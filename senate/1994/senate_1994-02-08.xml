<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts. I refer to allegations on last night's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> that Telecom has made almost 700 tapes of phone conversations involving Casualties of Telecom, that is, persons seeking compensation from Telecom over failure to provide an adequate phone service resulting in substantial damage to their businesses. Is this figure correct? If not, what is the correct figure and on what basis does Telecom justify its actions? Is the minister also aware of an April 1993 internal Telecom document indicating that the telephone of yet another COT case member was tapped without his knowledge? What actions does the government propose to take in respect of these matters?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Trade and relates to tariffs in Australia. I specifically ask the minister whether he is aware of recent media reports which suggest that the government is moving away from its support of a 5 per cent general tariff barrier after 1996? I also ask whether such reports are correct and does this mean that the government has reopened the tariff debate?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I did have the opportunity to address a forum of US pension fund managers whose investment funds collectively total something like $US4 trillion, so it was a group worth speaking to! In response to a question from some of them, I delivered a pretty simple and not at all subtle message about Australian tariff policy compared with the tariff policy of other countries, including the country from which they came. I am sure that all the professional fund managers in the audience fully understood the very clear message that I was giving them, but it does seem unfortunate that at least one journalist present did not understand it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it clear in perhaps shorter and simpler words in case he or she wishes to correct his or her perception, because the words that I used, I thought, were clear and had a clear and unequivocal message. Those words do not change in any way the position of the government on this issue, which has been articulated by my predecessors, nor do they change in any way government policy on this matter. The government's policy is that it remains committed to lowering Australia's general tariff rate to five per cent by 1996. The policy that we had already developed and implemented put us in a very strong position in the tariff negotiations around the Uruguay Round and was part of and a contributor to&mdash;I do not want to exaggerate the extent of the contribution&mdash;achieving tariff cuts of more than 50 per cent from our major trading partners. This provides enormous potential benefits for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there are very big benefits to our primary industry sector from the Uruguay Round&mdash;for example, in the area of coal&mdash;it is also true to say there are big benefits for the manufacturing sector as a result of the major cuts in tariffs that were achieved. Australia is one of the few countries which is not having to make further adjustments to accommodate the requirements of the Uruguay Round, as our trading partners are, and from which we will benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I was making fairly clearly and unequivocally to these guests to Australia was that the rest of the world is a long way behind Australia in this matter. It is not an issue about which we have any intention, or feel under the slightest pressure, to move any further in terms of the reasonable response to the requirements of the Uruguay Round or the activities of our trading partners; and unless and until we get to a situation where the international community catches up with the position we have achieved, there is no likelihood we will go further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way anything could possibly have been interpreted as a qualification of what I thought was a very straightforward position&mdash;and what I thought was very clear, and I think as reported is clear, but for some reason the interpretation in the newspaper is not&mdash;was that if in some unforeseeable future circumstance in the next round of multilateral negotiations the whole trade debate has moved on to new parameters, that is something Australia will need to look at then.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of the detail of that particular problem, although I am aware of it in general terms because Senator Panizza has raised the problem in the Senate on previous occasions. I have had the opportunity in the last two weeks of meeting with the Australian Wheat Board and discussing with it in some detail&mdash;in terms of my being a friend of the farmers, which indeed I am&mdash;the major item of interest to me at the moment, which is the prospect for the market for the entire yield. As Senator Panizza knows full well, the wheat industry, along with dairying, beef and a number of other primary industries, is looking far more positive at the moment in terms of both the harvest and markets than it has for some significant time. I am in the happy position of being able to tell Senator Panizza something which, as one of many primary producers who are active members of the coalition in parliament today, he already knows, and that is that prospects for the wheat industry generally are looking positive.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Science and Small Business as the Minister responsible for the Australian Customs Service. Earlier today the minister released the report of the independent review into the Australian Customs Service which was headed by Frank Conroy. Is the minister able to provide any information on the major recommendations of the report and its implications for the Customs Service? Secondly, what benefit does the minister expect from this important review?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="506" SPEAKER="Schacht Sen The Hon C.C." NAMEID="4J4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="SCIENCE AND SMALL BUSINESS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today, as honourable senators will be aware, I circulated to all members of parliament and to the press a copy of the Conroy review of Customs, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The turning point</EMPHASIS>, a copy of which I will table at the end of question time. I thank Mr Conroy, Mr Ian Macphee, Ms Susan Ryan and members of the secretariat for their contribution to preparing the report over the past seven months. It was a very wide-ranging report in accordance with the wide terms of reference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report deals with relations with industry, the public and government agencies. The broad themes of the report are: the need for Customs to establish closer links with industry in Australia; the value of good public administration; and the better use of technology. I have already announced that I have accepted the broad thrust of the report, which can be best summed up as trying to achieve a cultural change in the operation of Customs. That would be well recognised by members on both sides of the parliament who have been involved with such issues as the Midford report. All of those reports dealt with the need for a change in the culture of Customs, its style of operation and how it relates to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many recommendations, a number of which will quite clearly be controversial. I will ask the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development in consultation with Customs, the PSU and other interested parties to prepare a considered report on each of the recommendations, which I hope to take to cabinet within about six to eight weeks. I will then make further announcements about the outcome of those recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning, I had the opportunity to speak in Canberra to the senior management of Customs and to several hundred of its staff and to explain my view about the implementation process and preparation of the cabinet submission. I told them that I was sympathetic to the broad thrust of the report. Many people in Customs welcome this opportunity to be involved. I emphasised the need that, for the successful implementation of this report, it must be driven from the ground up within Customs as much from the top down to get the needed changes, which I think all sides of parliament would support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also announced today that the Comptroller-General of Customs, Mr Frank Kelly, has resigned from the position. I have recommended the appointment of the Deputy Comptroller-General, Mr Chris Doogan, to the position of Acting Comptroller-General. I made it clear to Mr Doogan and to others in the service that this is an acting position and that, as we develop the cabinet submission, we will look at the arrangements for the appointment of a new chief executive, a post for which he and other senior officers would be eligible to apply. But that will come after we make decisions in cabinet about what structure we want for Customs, not before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to place on record that Mr Kelly was a long-time member of the Customs Service and, despite the criticisms that some members of parliament have raised, he has done a number of things that have been good for the Customs Service.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TW4">Senator BOURNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is last Friday's decision by the United Nations Security Council to cut the size of the military operation in Somalia going to further exacerbate tension and civil disorder in that country? Indeed, has it already done so? Was the United Nations forced, in part, to reduce its involvement in Somalia because of continuing financial difficulties and the failure of member states to pay their dues to the UN? Which states in particular are not fulfilling their financial obligations to the United Nations, and how can the Australian government encourage those countries to meet those international obligations?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="507" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Friday, 4 February the Security Council, in resolution 897, did adopt a resolution authorising a reduction in UNOSOM force levels to no more than 22,000 personnel. That is a reduction from the some 28,000 that have been there during the course of the UNOSOM operation. It does represent a significant draw down. I add that it may well be in practice that the draw down will be to rather fewer numbers than that, perhaps in the order of 16,000 rather than the 22,000 that is here provided for. In keeping with this reduced capacity, the resolution limits UNOSOM's security mandate to protecting major ports, airports and essential infrastructure, and safeguarding lines of communication for relief and reconstruction activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution abandons further attempts by UNOSOM to forcibly disarm the Somali factions, although there is still a retention of a chapter VII enforcement mandate as well as a chapter VI mandate to cope with the reality that if the UN forces are put under military pressure, they may well need to respond in a way that goes beyond just a simple chapter VI self-defence. That lesson has been learned in the initial UNOSOM operation, and it has been retained here in that form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a fair judgment that the UN resolution is at least partly a response to some of the financial pressure that is being experienced by the UN at the moment. Probably more than that, however, it is a response by donor countries to the perception that there is simply no necessity&mdash;or strong case any longer to be made&mdash;for a very strong, active, aggressive military presence to be sustained in Somalia on the scale that was there in the earlier stages of the UNOSOM operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is a question that does arise, particularly if the draw down is of the order of 15,000 or 16,000 rather than 22,000, as to whether the UN will have a sufficiently substantial presence in enough parts of the country other than Mogadishu, Kismayu and Baidoa&mdash;and two or three other areas of that kind&mdash;to be able to effectively perform its function. That is something that we have a pretty close interest in with Australian personnel still in the country and, as a result, we will be watching it very closely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the useful things about the resolution last week is that it does emphasise the need for the Somalis themselves to assume the principal responsibility for their national reconciliation process. It underlines the importance to that political process of developing the fragile Somali police, judicial and penal systems, all of which are very important to the recreation of some kind of viable governmental infrastructure for the country. So I think the resolution is positive and forward looking in those ways. Moreover, it reaffirms quite explicitly the objective that the mission cease completely by March 1995. It is useful to set an end date in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the financial situation of the UN, 15 major contributors to the UN had amounts totalling $345 million owing to the regular budget at last count at the end of the year, including contributions outstanding from prior years. The United States, Japan, Germany, the Russian Federation, Italy, Spain, the Ukraine, Brazil and Belgium had amounts outstanding totalling $860 million for peacekeeping contributions. So there is a very substantial shortfall financially for the UN. Some of that will be fixed naturally in the course of the year. Other parts of it are a bit more long standing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States has been one of the main problem countries because it is such a large percentage donor for the UN system. I do not think that is the fault of the present administration which is committed to maintaining its role in this respect. There is certainly a lot of continuing hostility amongst members of the US Congress, and they are the ones who have to appropriate the resources.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not honestly think that financial considerations are the immediate cause of the reluctance of the international community to get itself more substantially involved in Bosnia. I think it is a recognition that the scale of the necessary intervention, if it really were to take place in a way that would involve a complete military occupancy of the country and the complete imposition of a military solution, would be so massive that it would not only be a matter of financial resources being hard to find, but the will, the commitment and the capacity simply would not be there from donor countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is often speculated that the order of magnitude of the resources needed in Bosnia to do a military job properly on the ground would be between 400,000 and 500,000 personnel. The notion of being able to get there simply by air strikes is not one that has commended itself hitherto, anyway, to those who have been responsible for making judgments about the military outcome in that country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was delighted to be present yesterday at the official signing between Australia's Civil Aviation Authority and the French radar giant, Thomson CSF, of a contract worth $A176 million for the implementation of Australia's first fully integrated air traffic management system. It will be a system that will ensure that air travellers in Australia fly safely well into the 21st century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly delighted to sign as part of a general signing ceremony the Australian industry involvement deed between the Commonwealth of Australia and Thomson CSF. The deed is critical to the further development of the Australian air systems industry, which has already proved itself as a world class industry by winning substantial export dollars for this country in markets overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deed commits Thomson to substantial research and development activity in Australia and to provide opportunities here as well. Specifically, Thomson is committed to facilitating exports of $550 million through to the year 2000. The agreement will as well support the creation of 800 new jobs in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia and, importantly&mdash;and given the nature of this debate, I think quite significantly&mdash;Thomson has undertaken to establish its regional headquarters for Asia and the Pacific in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian companies which will benefit from this&mdash;colloquially known as the TAAATS contract&mdash;include AWA, which has, I think, the best voice switching technology in the world and which supplies sophisticated communications products as well; Adacel, a supplier of air traffic simulation computer software; Lochard Environmental Systems, already a world leader in airport noise and flight traffic monitoring systems; and the John Holland construction company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contract will enable these companies and others to take advantage of integration in the marketing efforts of one of the world's leading air traffic control companies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a trivial question because it asks the government to re-affirm one of the quite important posts of independence in the whole constellation of government effort, and that is the office of the auditor. One does respect his independence and statutory responsibility to report openly and fairly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question then goes on to play a political game and say that all relevant documents should be made available to the auditor. It is my experience and understanding that that is the case of government departments. But the most celebrated case, which this question does not refer to, which is subject to some controversy, and which was the subject of a series of questions in this chamber yesterday, concerns sporting grants. The issue between the auditor and the minister at that time, where the minister sought legal advice, was where the auditor sought, as I understand it, documentations held privately by the minister which were not departmental documentations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McKiernan for this very timely question. Landcare is much appreciated by the farming community and, indeed, until today in question time I thought it enjoyed bipartisan support. The time has arrived for community groups, which are the driving force of the Landcare movement, to apply for funding for the next financial year in terms of the invaluable programs and cooperation with the primary industry sector that the Landcare movement is achieving in Australia. I would certainly urge all community groups that are involved in Landcare to apply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth of the Landcare movement in Australia is proof in itself of its success. In 1985 there were 75 Landcare groups around Australia. That has grown to 1,900 groups today. Indeed, I am sure that other senators would be familiar, as I am, with the valuable work that is being done by Landcare in their own states. In the  Northern Territory, for example, Landcare is directly involved in the elimination of mimosa pigra from coastal plains. It is involved in the difficult question of the supply of water to Aboriginal and remote communities in the Northern Territory, rangeland soil degradation and so on, and I am sure many similar projects are being conducted by Landcare elsewhere in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the most encouraging thing about the growth of the movement is that nearly 30 per cent of the nation's farmers are now members of Landcare groups and a growing number of companies are involved. There is increasing support from the corporate sector as the success of this movement in  getting the score on the board is shown more and more. The program, as I said before, has received bipartisan support and I hope it will continue to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community Landcare is designed to encourage and assist local groups and land-holders to identify problems and to take appropriate action to fix them. Together with Landcare Australia's Don Burke, I call on those community groups to get their funding proposals to the government as quickly as possible so that they can be considered. Last year the federal government provided $12.5 million to fund these groups across Australia. This year the program will again gain support for these projects to at least the same level.

What will be the effect on our balance of payments for 1993-94 of the recent reduction in export coal prices, coupled with the reduced tonnage to Japan and the increased value of the Australian dollar? Further, what is the government doing to avert the 24-hour rolling strikes which commenced today, which cannot have any impact on the monetary exchange rates, the world oversupply of coking coal or the Japanese steel production, and which can only further harm our major export industry?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that industrial action that is currently threatened will achieve anything. In fact, in my view, it will certainly undermine the very considerable benefits that have been assisted by the union movement in the mining sector in Australia in the efficiencies that have been gained in the Australian mining industry. I can&mdash;and I think any reasonable person can&mdash;understand the sense of frustration in the work force at the decline in prices. There has been a significant downturn in the Japanese steel industry. It is a situation where the international market has set the price. We are not in a position to do much about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen the perennial subject raised of establishing national coal boards and so on, but the principal reason behind the downturn in the price is the price that has been set by the Canadian suppliers of coking coal. The most important thing for the Australian negotiators, in my view&mdash;and they achieved it&mdash;was to be able to match that price in order to maintain Australia's market share in Japan. Disappointing as the outcome was in terms of price, I do understand the legitimate concern of the workers in the industry about the price of the product that they produce&mdash;</PARA>

I understand that; those opposite do not. The key point about these negotiations, and it is an important point, is that the Australian negotiators were able to maintain the share of the market that is so important for Australia in what, hopefully, will be a cyclical decrease in the price of coal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question falls into the category of a fishing expedition, and it is one that will be met with an outcome, but not today. This government, over the past 11 years of our administration, has presided over an industry policy which has seen manufacturing exports from this country boom and a resurgence at the same time as there has been a restructuring of the industry base in this country. We now have, according to the competitiveness index, a much more competitive economy able to cut its way in the international marketplace.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in that policy some things will remain consistent. This government embarked upon a major program of micro-economic reform and the removal of impediments to industry.

That is where their market and their measure of competitiveness is.

I was even more pleased, indeed slightly stunned, to read that the AMA endorsed the federal government's national women's health policy. Let me read to the Senate the endorsement because it really marks a new era with the AMA:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AMA supports the goals of the Australian Government National Women's Health Policy to improve the health and well being of all Australian women.</PARA>
<PARA>It was interesting to note that Brendan Nelson, who launched that paper, made the comment himself&mdash;very disparaging of the AMA&mdash;that it was very late for the AMA to have a view about women's health policy for the public arena. He said that 1994 was a very late year for this to happen. I was pleased to remind Brendan Nelson that 1994 is the centenary of the women's vote in South Australia, which I think means the AMA is about 100 years behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make it clear, too, that while the AMA may indeed be endorsing the government's policy, we do not endorse all of the AMA's policies. This government has had a far reaching commitment to women's health, and included in that was its promise at the last election to establish the first ever specific to women longitudinal study in women's health research. I am pleased to say that that policy and that election promise is a promise kept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I have announced the advisory committee that will advise me on the design of that longitudinal study. It is the first ever, and I think we have a great opportunity to put in place very significant new research for Australian women. It is very important to note that that committee will be chaired by Dr Heather Mitchell, the Medical Director of the Victorian Cervical Cytology Registry and the Victorian Breast Screening Program Registry. The committee, including representation from the nursing profession, from the Public Health Association, from the Consumer Health Forum and from the public health area, will be addressing questions such as deficiencies or gaps in current research and data, any gender bias in research allocation and the health implications in particular to women's social roles. We cannot possibly overlook the status of Aboriginal women's health as well as the health of women from non-English speaking backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not too long ago I received from a significant medical authority a little dial-your-own health data kit which enables people to check what their blood pressure, pulse rate and weight should be and so on.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the time has come for us to have health data and research data about women for women&mdash;not the adaptation of data about men. We know that we simply do not have a lot of basic data about women. We also do not have specific women's health data. Studies of men will provide no information about menopause or menstruation and, importantly, studies by men have actually ignored the evidence of women. So I am delighted that we now have established this advisory committee, and this is the first stage in establishing this longitudinal study. The importance of women's health research and women's health data cannot be overstated. Once that data is given to the government, we will be able to make sure our policies are targeted to most appropriately meet the continuing needs of women's health.</PARA>

I think that has explained the basis of the government's decision. I am not concerned about the international ramifications of this because the particular extension for two years beyond the phase-out period of 1995 that we are seeking to enable Pasminco to continue to dump industrial waste at sea&mdash;as it has been doing for the last 20 years&mdash;is one that is provided for within the terms of the London Dumping Convention, of which we are an enthusiastic member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The convention enables parties to it to, within a 100-day period expiring on 18 February, make any declaration they wish about limiting the scope of the convention to them. Once such a declaration is made, it is absolutely binding and it cannot be amended so as to upgrade it or extend it in the future. The declaration that we propose to make is one that is quite narrow and finite in scope and operation; namely to extend the period to 1997 rather than meet the objective date of 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why we sought that extension is that the industrial processes that are presently being developed to enable jarosite not to be produced at all as a waste residue from zinc production are not yet at a stage where we can be confident that the 1995 deadline would be met; in which case the only other alternative&mdash;apart from the company going out of business&mdash;would be for the company to adopt a landfill operation for some 200,000 tonnes of jarosite a year. This, of course, would raise its own environmental problems about which Tasmanians and others in the environmental movement have been equally upset. There are no easy options. It is either a matter of closing the plant and putting hundreds of people out of work in what is one of Tasmania's major industries, or creating another kind of environmental problem, or continuing for another two years what has been done for the last 20 years, and which has not caused any environmental damage at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that, although it is desirable to avoid dumping industrial waste at sea, and although it is desirable to avoid dumping this particular iron compound, jarosite, with its very small amounts of lead, arsenic and cadmium that are associated with it, there is no evidence whatsoever that the dumping that has occurred over the last 20 years has caused any environmental damage at all, given the dispersion of the waste in question that is involved with this kind of dumping process, and the way in which it reduces to levels and amounts and quantities which are not a cause for serious alarm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to other countries: we are only aware at this stage of one other country&mdash;Russia&mdash;that is likely to seek any kind of similar exemption, and that is not in relation to industrial waste, but radioactive waste. On any view, there is a very substantial difference in character between the kind of industrial waste we are talking about here and the radioactive waste which has generated so much concern from us and from other countries in the South Pacific and elsewhere around the world. It is a purely temporary extension of the dumping that is involved. It is squarely within the terms of the convention. Our position on this is well understood by the other parties to the convention. There is a heap of other problems facing us if we go down any other route but this one. For all these reasons, it is a decision that I think makes a great deal of sense, and I hope it will be understood as such.</PARA>

The Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation is one of 14 R&amp;D corporations within the primary industries portfolio.

Whilst acknowledging scope for fine-tuning, they believed that the model was a source of advantage against our international competitors. It was described to me as being unique in the world in R&amp;D and primary industry. They also identified substantial benefits flowing from the research they had commissioned, and one particular survey of projects revealed benefit cost ratios of over 10 to one. I indicated at the meeting my keen interest in promoting research as a means of ensuring Australia fully exploits the emerging opportunities in international food and fibre markets. The RDCs can facilitate this process by gathering the best possible market intelligence to anticipate changing customer demands and tailoring their research programs to ensure that Australian rural industry can meet those demands.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Vanstone asked me a question in several parts regarding the Australian Federal Police investigation into matters involving the Hon. Alan Griffiths MP. I undertook at that time to refer the matter to the appropriate minister and provide a report later this week. The Minister for Justice has provided the following responses:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question 1:Did the AFP have discussions with Mr Griffiths or his solicitors concerning the issue of civil proceedings against Mrs Harrison?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Answer:During AFP discussions with Mr Griffiths, his solicitors advised AFP officers of their intention to commence civil proceedings in the Supreme Court of Victoria against Mrs Lynette Harrison, her husband and her solicitor, Mr Roccisano. The AFP did not contribute to the making of the decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question 2:Did the AFP advise Mr Griffiths' solicitors that the issue of proceedings against Mrs Harrison would not impede its own investigation?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Answer:The AFP response to solicitors for Mr Griffiths at the time was, and remains, that the AFP would prefer that any such actions not commence while there were further police enquiries to be conducted, but that AFP could not prevent commencement of civil action if they so desired.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question 3:Did the AFP sanction or condone civil proceedings against Mrs Harrison?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Answer:The AFP position was made clear to solicitors acting for Mr Griffiths in the terms indicated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question 4:Were any facts ascertained during the investigation passed to Mr Griffiths but not Mrs Harrison?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Answer:There have been no facts obtained during the investigation which were passed to either Mr Griffiths or Mrs Harrison other than inferences which may have been drawn by either person as a result of questions asked of them by investigating officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question 5:Is it normal for AFP to discuss with one subject of an investigation or that subject's solicitors the propriety or otherwise of that subject issuing civil proceedings against another subject of the investigation?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Answer:The commencement of civil proceedings concurrent with criminal investigations frequently arises during AFP investigations, particularly where compensation or reparation may be in issue. Where such instances occur, it is not uncommon for the AFP to be advised of action contemplated by, or available to, the complainant.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I was asked a question by Senator Watson concerning the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. In essence there were two questions. One was about why it is being shifted from Sydney to Melbourne, and the other was about the chairperson of the tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the first question, the government had previously indicated that the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal was likely to be placed in Sydney because of its relative centrality compared with other capital cities. It was envisaged that a large part of the tribunal's business would be dealt with by correspondence in order to reduce to a minimum the cost involved in tribunal procedures. Although centrality is an important issue, it is not the only basis for determining the tribunal's location.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After subsequent evaluation, the government has decided that the complaints tribunal will be located in Melbourne.

In answer to the second part of his question, the chairperson of the tribunal will be full time, appointed by the Governor-General for a period of up to five years. From five to eight members of the tribunal will be part time, appointed by the Treasurer for a period of up to five years. The Treasurer is required to consult with the Minister for Consumer Affairs concerning the appointment of two of the part-time members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government recognises that the success of the tribunal will depend heavily upon the qualities of the person appointed as chairperson.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht) to a question without notice asked by Senator Jones this day, relating to the Australian Customs Service.</PARA>
<PARA>I am interested to read from page 29 of the report by the Conroy committee, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of the Australian Customs Service</EMPHASIS>, where the committee comments upon the Midford report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Customs' response to it. It stated that the committee considered the logic of the proposition that Customs had asserted that it had implemented the Midford recommendations. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that implementation of Midford recommendations has not been completed until cultural change in Customs is seen to be well under way. Evidence before the Committee does not indicate this has occurred. That evidence includes discussions with senior officers and others in Customs on the degree of resistance and hostility the Midford case has engendered in the organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Committee's view, Customs' implementation of Midford is far from complete, nor has Customs reported implementation in an accountable and meaningful process.</PARA>
<PARA>In the light of this report and the press release put out by Senator Schacht today announcing that Mr Kelly, the then Comptroller-General, has in fact resigned but is to be rewarded with a consultancy to DITARD on APEC issues, earlier in the day I wished to ask Senator Schacht why was he making an announcement about Mr Kelly's appointment to DITARD? How much is Mr Kelly to be paid? Why is this man, who presided over the demise of the Australian Customs Service and is found in this report to be wanting, to be rewarded at taxpayers' expense with an appointment to APEC, an area in which he has no demonstrable expertise? Anyone who has listened to the evidence given by him again and again through estimates will see that there is no such expertise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am disappointed that I did not get the call earlier in question time to ask that question of Senator Schacht. The fact that this appointment has been made and the fact that Senator Schacht was the one chosen to make the announcement certainly does require answering. If I might say, I think that the report that has been brought down is very much in line with the sentiment of the public accounts committee. Read together, both reports will be most useful documents. The work that has been carried out in both cases will mean that perhaps we will finally get a renamed Customs Service with a different structure of personnel&mdash;of course, all the existing positions were to be declared vacant. Yet Mr Kelly, who has stood down, in the minister's terms&mdash;and quite properly so&mdash;is to be rewarded in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say that that is going to make a lot of people very angry would be an understatement. The good people who were in the Customs Service and the many people who found the Customs Service wanting in so many ways are going to find the reward of Mr Kelly very hard to stomach. I think we do need to know why the minister is making the announcement of the appointment. How much is Mr Kelly being paid? Why is he being rewarded when he has presided over the demise of the Customs Service? Where is the apparent expertise that he has in this particular area?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a matter on which I had occasion to appear before the committee and give evidence. Page 163 of the report details the concerns that have been expressed to the committee not just by me but by a wide cross-section of witnesses from industry. These concerns include: the general quality of the performance by the Anti-Dumping Authority in administering the anti-dumping provisions; the time taken to see a complaint dealt with and brought to the stage where a countervailing duty may be imposed; the need for a more coherent relationship between Australian industry and the agencies administering these laws; and the difficulties experienced by customs, especially Australian customs representatives, when conducting anti-dumping inquiries overseas. There are a couple of other concerns, but I think these are the main ones.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that on page 165 of its report the committee says that by rationalising the existing structure the overall basic processing time could be abridged by up to 80 days.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations of the committee include some other worthwhile initiatives which we are looking forward to; a manual of policies and practices; the suggestion that material injury inquiries be conducted contemporaneously with a customs investigation of dumping; and the proposal that the legal provisions be reviewed, revised and amended to provide clear and effective laws in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have one problem with the way in which the report deals with anti-dumping, and that is with regard to industry concerns&mdash;expressed by a range of witnesses&mdash;that the anti-dumping provisions should be interpreted by the department and by the authority in such a way that they assist Australian industries to resist the deleterious effect of the dumping of cheap goods. On page 166 of the report, the committee says that the commercial behaviour in industry is very complex. It points out that many products that are being brought in may be used by industry as components, or for resale, and benefit industry if they are cheaper, and therefore the interests of Australian industries are not clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reject that totally. While I certainly agree that it is advisable for industry to buy components at the cheapest possible price&mdash;there are provisions to facilitate that&mdash;it is quite clear that where finished products are being imported into Australia at dumped prices they simply serve to destroy our industries and our employment. This section of the report does no service to the interests of Australian industry and Australian workers.

I am very pleased that amongst the first of the recommendations in this report is the abolition of the Australian Customs Service, because `Australian Customs' it might have been, but `service' it certainly has not been. Another recommendation was that the position of Comptroller-General and other senior executive positions be abolished.

If we accept the recommendation to abolish the position of Comptroller-General, that will require legislation. One way or the other we have to work out a process for appointing a permanent chief executive.

In July 1987 a gentleman by the name of Mr Malcolm Douglas expressed an interest in the lease for a crocodile farm in Broome. From 1987 through to 1992 the matter was the subject of a good deal of negotiation with local Aboriginal people, the Department of Land Administration and the Aboriginal sites department.

The Kimberley Land Council commissioned a report which resulted in the reconsideration of the matter from December 1992 until July 1993. It was not until July 1993 that the minister finally gave consent for lease for the crocodile farm provided that certain parts of it were excised so as to take into account certain initiation tracts which the local Aboriginal people used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that stage Mr Douglas had expended a great deal of money and time in bringing this development to fruition. Subsequently several applications were made in the Federal Court and the Supreme Court of Western Australia. As I understand it, four attempts were made to gain injunctions to stop this development. Those four attempts failed in the courts and, despite the fact that the courts had made a decision that the development should proceed, on 4 February the federal Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, used his powers under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act to temporarily halt that development. So we saw a blatant intervention in state affairs by a federal minister, halting something which even the courts said should proceed, which had undergone environmental clearance and which had undergone some six years of negotiations with the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relevance of my supplementary question was that Western Australia had another controversial development regarding the Aboriginal community, namely, the Swan Brewery site. My question to Senator Collins was aimed at knowing whether Carmen Lawrence, previously a state minister for Aboriginal affairs and a state Premier, had asked the then federal minister to exercise his powers to halt that development. I would put to the Senate that that was not the case because the person who was developing the Swan Brewery site was involved in the Multiplex building company and had been responsible for a donation of $692,000 to ALP coffers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we see a very big change in the action taken by the minister. When we have a friend of the ALP developing a site, we do not see the federal minister intervening. But when it comes to a small businessman in Broome attempting to develop a site, we see the full force of the federal government interfering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised by Mr Douglas that he employs eight locals. He intends to work with local Aborigines and train them in crocodile farming. But, due to this latest development, his whole undertaking has been called into question financially. He could face great financial loss and the town could lose a possible $500,000 in exports per annum. To me, that is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs. Although the courts have decided that this development can go ahead, this federal minister for Aboriginal affairs is going to ride roughshod over the rights of small businessmen and state interests. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) to a question without notice asked by Senator Alston this day, relating to telephone tapping.</PARA>
<PARA>In answer to a question from me, Senator McMullan effectively said that he did not know what I was talking about and that he would seek advice from minister Lee. My question related, firstly, to allegations on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> and, secondly, to the contents of an internal Telecom document which was described in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After question time, Senator McMullan came back and said that he had been advised by minister Lee's office that the answer he had given to my question last week still stood. That in fact had nothing to do with either the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> or this internal Telecom document, the contents of which became publicly known only this morning. Therefore, I have to say that it is a very inauspicious debut by the minister. I would have thought that, at the very least, he would want to contemplate the question that Senator McMullan knew nothing about and come back with a considered answer tomorrow. But, instead, he has rushed in to give an answer which effectively seems to suggest that he has not even paid attention to the subject matter of today's question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that he was trying to say that any matters that were raised today are to be treated as having been disclosed by Mr Blount, the managing director of Telecom, to the minister in mid-January, I take that as a matter of some significance. I hope that it is not simply an inference that one is able to draw because of the haste with which the answer was given. I would therefore invite the ministers to make clear in this chamber whether it is being said that the allegation on last night's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> that almost 700 tapes of phone conversations involving Casualties of Telecom was in fact the subject matter of the discussion between Mr Blount and Mr Lee some three or more weeks ago and, also, whether the internal Telecom document to which I referred was discussed by Mr Blount with Mr Lee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be amazed if the latter were the case because in fact that document was only provided by a source, as it would seem, outraged by the fact that Telecom had purported to comply with a FOI request but had not made this document available. Of course, inspection of this document makes it clear that Mr Dawson's telephone line was being tapped without his consent. That is a crucial document that clearly should have been provided pursuant to the FOI request. To the extent it was not, Telecom has a very serious case to answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the matter that I want answered. I would not have thought that was in any shape or form the subject matter of the discussion between Mr Blount and Mr Lee. If it was, and if we are therefore being told that the matter is being investigated by the Federal Police, maybe we will have to accept that, although I disagree profoundly that that precludes the minister from making any public statement about the propriety or otherwise of Telecom's admitted actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have any confidence, in view of the haste with which that answer was given, that I can assume that that mid-January discussion did have anything to do with the internal document. So I ask the ministers to reflect further upon my questions, to take them seriously, to give a considered answer and to face up to what I think is a very important proposition&mdash;that is, that it is simply not good enough to ask privately that matters be investigated when, if there are admissions of wrongdoing or if there are matters that the minister regards with concern, they ought to be brought to the attention of the public as quickly as possible. Those persons who are adversely affected ought to have those matters confirmed to them, instead of continuing to pretend that somehow nothing has gone wrong and then finding that, day by day, evidence is emerging to the contrary. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will appreciate that as part of the Government's efforts to make the public sector more efficient it has commercialised many areas of my Department.

To a limited degree some DAS businesses have moved into other markets including State and local governments, tertiary institutions, non-profit organisations that are substantially funded by governments and on occasions unions and the private sector. Unions are non-commercial entities and a legitimate part of the DAS market and there is a history of their using DAS services, particularly where their membership includes public sector employees.</PARA>

The work undertaken by DASFLEET for unions is within these guidelines. All work performed is charged at commercial rates and the rates cover provision for the payment of all relevant Commonwealth and State government taxes, charges and fees. Work undertaken by DASFLEET for unions in the first half of the 1993-94 financial year was less than 0.2% of its total revenue.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY CHEMICALS BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It gives me great pleasure to introduce in the Senate the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a historic occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Introduction of these seven bills brings to fruition efforts stretching back over twenty five years to develop a truly national approach to the registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was only in July 1991 that the Commonwealth, states and territories' governments agreed to establish a national registration scheme to replace the eight state and territory schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since then, there has been considerable progress in implementing the scheme. From 1 July 1992, the Commonwealth has taken over from the states and territories all the evaluation of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. In July 1993, honourable senators, we saw the establishment of the National Registration Authority for agricultural and veterinary chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From my perspective, we have come a long way in a short time. But there is further to go.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These seven bills will provide the NRA with its full range of functions and powers and they represent the final stage in the development of the national registration scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the government's commitment to a more open and transparent process for the assessment and registration of agricultural and veterinary chemical products, the government released this and the other registration bills as exposure drafts for public comment. Also, briefing sessions were held with the main stakeholders, viz: the states and territories;  the agricultural and veterinary chemical industry; the rural sector; and consumer, public interest and environmental groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to the invitation to comment on the exposure drafts, 33 submissions were received from a wide cross section of the community. A considerable number of the suggestions have been incorporated into these bills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The registration bills are fully supported by the AGVET chemical industry, the National Farmers' Federation, the Commonwealth agencies involved in the scheme and the state and territory agricultural agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consumer, public interest and environmental groups will welcome those provisions of the bills which will ensure improved public participation, greater availability of information for the public, the public's right to seek an injunction and empower the NRA to hold public and private hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should emphasise, however, that the AGVET code is being introduced without the formal agreement of the states or the Northern Territory. I propose to seek the necessary agreement  before the AGVET code is debated during the 1994 autumn sittings. In this regard, I wish to acknowledge the generous assistance provided by the states and territories in developing the scheme and the draft legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now wish to specifically address the provisions of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to make provision for the AGVET code to have effect in the Australian Capital Territory. The code contains provisions for the evaluation, registration and control of chemical products. Furthermore, the code is to be adopted by the legislatures of the states and the Northern Territory as a law of those jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also provides that the whole legislative package will commence on a date agreed to with the states and Northern Territory. In view of the need for the states and Northern Territory to enact complementary state law, provision has been made for the act to commence 12 months after royal assent or earlier by proclamation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill, through the "federalisation" mechanism applies the Commonwealth Acts Interpretation Act 1901 for the purpose of uniformly interpreting the AGVET codes as applied in each jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also, the Commonwealth administrative law package will apply to the AGVET code in each jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to reduce the complexity of the bill, offences will continue to be offences against the laws of the states or territories, although the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions will be empowered to prosecute for offences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill repeals the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988, which is replaced by this legislative package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY CHEMICALS CODE BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It gives me great pleasure to introduce in the Senate the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Bill 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is to be enacted in the Australian Capital Territory. It has been drafted in complementary adoptive form so that the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code (AGVET Code), scheduled to the bill, can be adopted by each state and the Northern Territory. Through this mechanism, evaluation, registration and control of agricultural and veterinary chemical products, and related matters, will be administered uniformly across Australia by the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (NRA).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The control measures apply up to the point of retail sale with the states and territories remaining responsible for control-of-use matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the provisions of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AGVET Code focuses on the registration of chemical products, approval of active constituents, and approval of labels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The over-riding criteria to be addressed by the NRA are public health, occupational health and safety, the environment, product performance, and trade and commerce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The public will be invited to comment in respect of each chemical product containing a new active constituent prior to determination of an application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NRA will also be able to reconsider an existing registered chemical product to ensure it continues to meet contemporary safety and performance standards. The public will be invited to nominate chemical products to be considered for inclusion in this formal and systemic review program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the NRA will be able to review a chemical product at its own initiative. If appropriate, the NRA may suspend or cancel the registration of a registered chemical product.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recognising the cost of additional scientific data when required to support continued chemical registration,  compensation provisions have been introduced which will apply in certain circumstances. The intention is to recognise research and development costs associated with updating data packages when such data may also support other manufacturer's products. The provisions will apply to data specifically requested by the NRA and where that data does not have patent protection. A considerable number of safeguards have been built into the AGVET Code to prevent the commercial abuse of data while ensuring that both the provider of the call-up data and a secondary applicant are treated equitably.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NRA will be able to control the possession of chemical products. It will be an offence to supply unregistered chemical products or to supply products in contravention of the conditions of their registration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a chemical product has been supplied in contravention of the AGVET Code, then the NRA may issue recall notices requiring persons to stop supplying the product and to take action to deal with unsold stock as directed by the NRA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A system has also been set up under which a person who wishes to do something in respect of a chemical product that would otherwise be an offence, may obtain a permit authorising the action to be done. For example, a person may want to conduct a trial or experiment in relation to an unregistered product in order to decide whether to make an application for approval or registration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure chemical products available to the public comply with the specifications determined by the NRA, this bill provides for the licensing of manufacturers of registered chemical products. The introduction of manufacturing principles is to be phased in over a period of time so as to allow the manufacturing industry time to adjust.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NRA will have adequate enforcement powers in respect of the AGVET code. Authorised inspectors will monitor compliance with the AGVET code and, if contraventions are suspected to have occurred, to obtain search warrants. In various circumstances inspectors will be empowered, or may be given powers, to enter and search commercial premises and seize things. An inspector may also require the giving of information or the production of documents. The code also provides that any person may seek an injunction to enforce compliance with the code.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To facilitate the NRA being able to seek a wide spectrum of professional advice in respect of its evaluation of chemical products and active constituents, the NRA will be able to release confidential commercial information. However, I emphasise that precautions will be taken to ensure that trade secrets and certain other information subject to possible commercial exploitation are safeguarded. Each person in receipt of confidential commercial information will be bound by the confidentiality provisions of the AGVET code.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to note that there are extensive provisions whereby an applicant can have a decision of the NRA reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), including for example, refusing to grant registration of a chemical product. Before applying to the AAT for a review of decision, an applicant may, if they wish, request the NRA to reconsider the decision at no significant cost to the applicant. If the matter is not resolved, it can be referred to the AAT. These two appeal mechanisms will, I believe, provide a balance between the powers of the NRA and the concerns of applicants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Transitional provisions have been provided which will ensure a smooth transition of existing arrangements to the new AGVET code.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill, I believe, provides for the efficient and timely registration of agricultural and veterinary chemical products. At the same time it will enhance safety standards and consumer confidence by involving the public in the evaluation process which will be accountable, open and transparent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY CHEMICALS (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It gives me great pleasure to introduce in the Senate the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 and the Copyright Act 1968. The amendments are a consequence of the introduction of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill 1993, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Bill 1993, and the repealing of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislative package extends the functions of the National Registration Authority for agricultural and veterinary chemicals (NRA) to include the registration and control of agricultural and veterinary chemical products. The new functions have been developed in consultation with the states and territories to ensure a consistent approach to the assessment and control of chemical products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, the NRA is to have regard to the government's policy in relation to the principles of ecologically  sustainable development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also the NRA will be required to comply with the policies of Commonwealth, state and territory governments that are determined under an agreement to be entered into between those governments for the purpose of this proposed Act and the AGVET codes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other major amendments to the Administration Act concern the importation, manufacture and exportation of chemical products. It will be an offence to import a chemical product that is unregistered, not exempted, or for which a permit has not been obtained from the NRA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's international obligations in respect of agricultural and veterinary chemicals are also addressed. This will ensure that Australia can enforce its international obligations under prior informed consent arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The enforcement provisions are very similar to those contained in the AGVET code of which details were provided in the second reading speech.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NRA will be able to hold public and private hearings to assist it in the exercise of its functions. The holding of hearings is a strong step towards the NRA's operations being open and transparent, and seen to be such.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes some consequential amendments to the Copyright Act 1968 so that the reproduction of the writing on  a label for a chemical product is not an infringement of any copyright.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY CHEMICAL PRODUCTS (COLLECTION OF LEVY) BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It gives me great pleasure to introduce in the Senate the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Levy) Bill 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable senators will be aware that in deciding to participate in the national registration scheme, the government decided that the full cost of the scheme would be recovered from industry, phased in over a four year period. The National Registration Authority for agricultural and veterinary chemicals will manage the cost recovery program associated with this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The levy will be a significant component of the scheme's cost recovery program. Other funds will be collected through application fees and annual registration renewal fees. In 1994-95, 83 per cent of the scheme's costs will be recovered from the AGVET chemical industry and in 1995/96 the scheme will be fully cost recovered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to emphasise that the AGVET chemical industry has been extensively consulted on these cost recovery arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the provisions of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will provide the NRA with the mechanism by which a levy on agricultural and veterinary chemical products can be collected. The bill identifies how liability for payment of a levy charge will be determined and the amount of levy that will be imposed. Generally speaking liability for the levy will be based on the sale or disposal of chemical products in Australia. In addition the bill allows for the authority to make an assessment as to whether a levy payment is required and the amount of the levy (if any) that is due. It also makes provision for a review process for persons dissatisfied with a levy assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SOCIAL SECURITY (HOME CHILD CARE AND PARTNER ALLOWANCES) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill gives effect to a significant initiative announced prior to the</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1993 Federal Election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new Home Child Care Allowance is to be introduced from September 1994. The Department of Social Security will pay it each fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Home Child Care Allowance reform consolidates the Government's provisions that assist families with children. It provides more direct recognition of the considerable time, energy and personal support devoted to children by parents, generally mothers, who decide to stay at home to raise their children. For the first time, this support will be provided direct to the parent caring for children, rather than to the other partner as a tax concession.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Allowance will replace the Dependent Spouse Rebate currently available to couples with dependent children and be paid at a higher maximum rate of $60 a fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">About 55,000 families whose tax liability was previously too low to get the full value of the Dependent Spouse Rebate available to couples with dependent children will receive greater assistance from the new Home Child Care Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Allowance will also be more responsive to families' needs than the Dependent Spouse Rebate. A parent leaving the workforce at any time during the year to, say, care for dependent children, will be able to claim the Allowance in that year, instead of waiting to re-establish their entitlement in the following year. This flexibility is expected to assist up to 120,000 families whose circumstances change within any year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Home Child Care Allowance will not be means tested on family income. Dependent partners with children and incomes below $10.85 a fortnight will receive the full $60 a fortnight. Those with income of up to $250 a fortnight will receive part payment. Some 840,000 families in total are expected to receive it at any one time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Home Child Care Allowance will be tax free and indexed annually. It will be paid until the end of the calendar year in which a dependent child, generally the youngest child, turns 18, or until the child ceases secondary schooling, whichever happens first. It will not be paid where the child is a prescribed student child except where the child is qualified to receive payments under the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme. A prescribed student child is a young person who has turned 16 and is qualified to receive payments under a prescribed educational scheme such as AUSTUDY or ABSTUDY. Families will have to meet Family Payment residency qualifications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Dependent Spouse Rebate for couples without dependent children and the Sole Parent Rebate will remain unchanged. Families that receive the new Allowance will not be eligible for these rebates. Legislation to prevent dual eligibility will be introduced later.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current taxation arrangements provide for a beneficiary rebate to protect full-year allowees from income tax, but the rebate assumes that for couple allowees, the family receives the full value of the Dependent Spouse Rebate. Abolishing the Dependent Spouse Rebate for couples with children would have left full-year allowee couples with dependent children with a large income tax bill. Currently these couples receive one combined payment. This payment will now be split so that each member of a couple will receive their own payment, with the dependent partner receiving a new Partner Allowance paid directly to them. Each partner will also get a tax rebate so that they don't have to pay tax on their basic allowance. As a result, dependent partners of maximum rate Job Search, Newstart and Sickness Allowances and Special Benefit will generally not be eligible for Home Child Care Allowance as they will receive the maximum rate new Partner Allowance in their own right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the Home Child Care Allowance and the Partner Allowance build on recent family assistance reforms that together will result in over $3 billion of assistance to families being directed to the primary care giver, usually the mother, each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has a strong commitment to assist families. The initiatives contained in this bill reinforce that commitment and are timely in view of the forthcoming  International Year of the Family.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CRIMES (SEARCH WARRANTS AND POWERS OF ARREST) AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Crimes Act 1914 to implement the recommendations of the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law to make much needed reforms to the law relating to search, arrest and related matters for the investigation of most Commonwealth offences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These areas of the law have been the subject of careful examination by the Law Reform Commission in its report `Criminal Investigation' and more recently by the Review of the Commonwealth Criminal Law established by Mr Bowen as Attorney-General and chaired by the Right Honourable Sir Harry Gibbs GCMG, AC, KBE. The Bill closely follows the recommendations made by the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law in its Fourth and Fifth Interim Reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Review Committee made recommendations to modernise Commonwealth law to ensure that both technological advances are taken into account by these laws and the increased awareness of the need for Parliament to state clearly the balance considered appropriate between the community interests in effective law enforcement and the maintenance of individual rights and freedoms. To date laws in this area have been contained in numerous Commonwealth statutes, State and Territory laws applied by the Judiciary Act, police instructions or general orders and case law. This has lead to a considerable degree of uncertainty and inaccessibility of the law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, recent public concerns about the Victorian Government's Crimes Amendment Bill highlight the need for this Parliament to make specific provision for laws relating to search, arrest and related matters in the investigation of Commonwealth offences. As the law currently stands, without this legislation, Commonwealth investigators are required to use State powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All these amendments will not initially supplant all other Commonwealth laws in this area as was envisaged by the Review Committee, those other laws are being carefully examined and brought into line with the provisions proposed in the Bill. It is intended to ensure that other officers, particularly those not subject to the training, discipline and accountability of members of a police force, have no greater powers than police. Until that review is completed, those laws which relate to the investigation of specific offences against Commonwealth law such as customs, quarantine and fisheries offences will continue to operate for police and inspectors appointed under those Acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for a comprehensive scheme for obtaining and executing search warrants, including telephone warrants, stopping and searching conveyances, arrest and related matters such as personal searches, taking and destroying fingerprints, holding identification parades and other identification procedures. It sets out the powers and obligations of police when carrying out any of these procedures and spells out the many safeguards to protect the rights of individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now mention some important features of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill precludes the issue by lay justices of warrants for search or arrest in relation to Commonwealth offences. Only magistrates and justices of the peace or other persons employed in a court who are authorised to issue search warrants and arrest warrants, as the case may be, will be able to issue such warrants. Further, the Bill recognises 3 different types of search to which a person can be subjected and lays down a clear criteria and procedures for their conduct. Practical difficulties which might otherwise flow from the removal of the power of lay justices to issue warrants are to be met by the introduction of telephone warrants. Easy access to magistrates or court employed justices of the peace is assured by the ability to use telephone, facsimile or other electronic means. The Bill creates a number of new offences in relation to applications for search warrants made by telephone and other electronic means. There is also a general offence, applicable to all warrants, of making a false statement in an application for a warrant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill prescribes in considerable detail the procedure which a police officer must follow to obtain a search warrant. The intended scope of the warrant must now be clear on its face. For example, if it is contemplated that a warrant obtained to search premises also authorises the search of persons at those premises, the warrant must clearly state this. Furthermore, to prevent the unnecessary execution of warrants on homes at night, the hours during which the warrant may be executed must be specified in the warrant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a police officer applying for a warrant suspects that, in executing the warrant, it will be necessary to use firearms the issuing officer must be told this and the reasons for this suspicion so that he or she can take this into account in deciding whether to issue the warrant. This is particularly directed to situations where, given the nature of the offence and the character of the suspects, it is more likely than not that violence will occur and it is anticipated that special weapons squads will be used. It is not, of course, intended to preclude the use of firearms where this is necessary in the circumstances as they develop when the warrant is being executed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill requires that a copy of the warrant be made available to the occupier of the premises or to the person to be searched.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The force used in the execution of the warrant cannot exceed that which is both necessary and reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Search warrants will authorise the seizing of evidence of the offence to which the warrant relates as well as evidence of any other indictable offence. A warrant to search premises may, at the discretion of the issuing officer, also authorise the search of people at, or near, the premises when the warrant is executed who are suspected of being in possession of evidence or dangerous items. Any person searched must be shown a copy of the warrant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill puts beyond doubt the right of police to be assisted by non-police experts. This will be particularly useful when the execution of the warrant involves operating computer equipment to locate evidence of an offence. The Bill permits the operation of equipment so that any incriminating evidence may be secured and retrieved but ensures that appropriate care is exercised to minimise damage to equipment. However, if damage is caused as a result of insufficient care in its operation, compensation may be payable to the owner of the equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill preserves the law relating to legal professional privilege. The current guidelines developed between the Australian Federal Police and the legal profession in relation to seizure of documents from solicitors' offices will continue to apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill classifies personal searches as "ordinary", "frisk" and "strip" searches. A search warrant issued in relation to a person may only authorise a "frisk" or "ordinary" search. Procedures for any form of personal search, either under warrant or conducted after arrest, are strictly circumscribed to ensure both the effectiveness of the search and maintenance of the privacy and dignity of the person searched. Strip searches may only be conducted after arrest if authorised by a police officer of the rank of superintendent or higher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, searches must be conducted by a person of the same sex as the person being searched. Strip searches cannot be conducted in the presence of any person of the opposite sex except where a medical practitioner of the same sex is not available or where the other person is a parent, guardian or personal representative and the person being searched does not object.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing power of police to stop and search vehicles in emergency situations contained in sections 10A and 10B of the Crimes Act, which were also based on the recommendations of the Review Committee, will be re-enacted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill introduces into Commonwealth criminal law a general offence of failure of a person to give his or her name or address to a police officer who has reason to believe that the person is able to provide information about a Commonwealth offence. Such an offence exists in many specific enactments but there has been no general provision such as exists in other jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill gives effect to the Review Committee in recommendations to repeal sections 8 and 8A and to replace them with more detailed and precise provisions about when arrest without warrant is permissible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The power of arrest without warrant by members of the public (citizens arrest) is limited by the Bill to suspected indictable offences in specified circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the power to apply for, and issue, warrants for the arrest of persons for Commonwealth offences continues to derive from State law under section 68 of the Judiciary Act, the Bill imposes a number of additional procedural requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for a scheme for the taking of identification material, including finger, hand and footprints, voice recordings and handwriting samples from a person in lawful custody for an offence. A police officer of the rank of sergeant or higher may take identification material if the person gives written consent or if that police officer believes on reasonable grounds that the taking of material is necessary to establish the identity of the person, identify the person as having committed the offence or to provide evidence of an offence. There are limits on the retention of the material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill expressly preserves other laws, including State and Territory laws applied to Commonwealth offences, by virtue of section 68 of the Judiciary Act, relating to the taking of forensic samples. Although this is a very necessary bridging provision to ensure that Commonwealth investigators have continuing access to law enforcement powers, the Commonwealth has reservations about some aspects of the Victorian Crimes Amendment Bill. Accordingly, I foreshadow that I will be bringing before the Parliament later this year a proposal relating to the taking of forensic samples as they relate to the investigation of Commonwealth offences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It regulates the holding of identification parades and the carrying out of other identification procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for the return of items seized (whether under warrant or not). It also provides that where a police officer needs to enter premises under a warrant or for the purpose of arresting a person he or she is required to announce his or her authority to enter the premises. This is designed to minimise damage to property or injury which can occur where the occupants are surprised. This safeguard was bolstered by Government Amendments in the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill is designed to make public the powers of police and the rights of individuals in the important areas of police investigation with which it deals. In the past many of the areas covered have been dealt with in police instructions or general orders which are not generally available to the public. This is incompatible with modern concepts of open administration and access to justice. I believe the Bill makes a significant advance in clarifying the powers of police and the rights of individuals in these important areas of police investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill reflects the Government's continuing concern for the welfare of veterans and their dependants. In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Building On Strength</EMPHASIS>, the Government announced as part of its advancement towards a fairer Australia that it would improve the position of low income retirees by easing the pensions assets test and by introducing a seniors health card.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government fulfilled the first part of this commitment by introducing legislation to ease the pensions assets test from 20 September 1993. This bill meets the second part of that commitment by introducing a seniors health card from 1 July 1994. This card will give certain low income non-service pensioners access to concessional pharmaceutical benefits and hearing aid concessions as well as entitling them to dental and optometry services. It is estimated that this proposal will assist a total of 10,000 veterans and dependants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill improves the assessment of child related payments for service pensioners. The main features include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the ability to redirect child related payments to the partner;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">adjusting the pension payment in shared care cases so that the child related payments are also shared;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">backdating child related payments to the first payday after the date of birth in those cases where notification is received within thirteen weeks of the birth; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ensuring, where pensioners have children and are receiving maintenance income, the maintenance income only affects the child related payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes result in a more equitable method for assessing child related payments and flow from the family payments structure under the Social Security Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also contains three measures concerning the assessment of managed investments. As all these changes are beneficial to service pensioners with managed investments, it is proposed that they commence from 1 April 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first clarifies the legislation by ensuring that all losses can be offset against profits from other managed investments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second ensures that where an investment has been held for less than twelve months and only an interim rate of return has been declared, that rate will be maintained as the annual rate of return. Applying the current provisions, the interim rate of return is extrapolated for twelve months. This can result in a higher rate of return being maintained in the service pension assessment than the actual rate of return over a twelve month period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third measure addresses certain friendly society investments. In the current economic climate a number of friendly societies have changed status. Under the Act, a change in the status of a friendly society would affect an investment made with that company. The investment would be considered as "realised" and any profit that has accrued would be maintained in a person's service pension assessment for twelve months. This measure would safeguard these investments by providing that where the conditions of the investment remain substantially the same, the current assessment rules will apply. Profits from the investment will not be assessed until it is "realised" by some other method.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides consistency in the arrangements for offsetting compensation payments against disability pension for the same incapacity or death for which compensation is paid. At present, these provisions apply only to disability pensions paid under Part IV of the Act in respect of defence or certain peacekeeping service. The amendment ensures that the offsetting arrangements will also apply to disability pension paid under Part II in respect of war or operational service. These provisions will apply only to payments of compensation made after the date of Royal Assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also clarifies the operation of the tax file number provisions where a person fails to comply with a request for a tax file number. In such instances, the Veterans' Entitlements Act currently directs that the person's pension or allowance is not to be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments set out the effect of failing to comply with a request for a tax file number and introduce a generous reconsideration period. It is proposed to give the person three months from the date the pension was last paid to comply with the request for a tax file number and still receive full restitution of the cancelled payment. This would allow the person time to consider the consequences of failing to provide the tax file number. If a person complies with the request after the expiration of the three month period, the pension or allowance will be restored from the payday after compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This three month period is in addition to the 28 days that the Secretary already allows the person to comply with the request before action is taken to stop the pension payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment puts beyond doubt the intention of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another initiative simplifies the current arrangements for withdrawing an application to determine qualifying service or a claim for service pension. It allows for a person to orally withdraw a claim and to reactivate the claim, within 28 days of its withdrawal, without penalty to the original claim. This initiative is consistent with the aim of assisting pensioners in their dealings with the Department by encouraging oral communications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, this bill will make a number of minor changes in the area of service pension assessment including a series of technical and consequential amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speeches read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">OFFSHORE MINERALS BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill, and the associated bills, replace the existing Minerals (Submerged Lands) Act 1981 and amend its associated acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, at this stage the Senate should note that whenever the word states is mentioned in the rest of this speech it also including the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing act, which is a consequence of the Offshore Constitutional Settlement, provides the legal framework for the exploration for, and the production of, minerals other than petroleum on Australia's continental shelf that is under Commonwealth jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Offshore Constitutional Settlement divided the jurisdiction over the mineral resources of Australia's continental shelf between the Commonwealth and the states. The states have jurisdiction within coastal waters adjacent to them, while the Commonwealth has jurisdiction from the outer limit of coastal waters to the edge of the continental shelf.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Offshore Constitutional Settlement it was agreed that there would be a common offshore mining code that would apply to the whole of Australia's continental shelf beyond the territorial sea baseline proclaimed by the Commonwealth in 1983. This common offshore mining code will be governed by a package of complementary Commonwealth and state offshore minerals legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The revision of the act is a result of the states' dissatisfaction with it and an unwillingness by some states to enact complementary offshore minerals legislation so long as it remained in its present form. They considered that the existing act was not suited to the needs of the offshore minerals industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth agreed to a comprehensive joint review of the act with the states. Following this review a large number of amendments was agreed to by the Australian and New Zealand Minerals Energy Council ministers in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government also took the opportunity to have the legislation re-written in the "plain English" style, recently adopted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, to improve its readability so that it could be understood more easily by those who will use it. The end result is that this bill contains many new features in relation to its overall organisation as well as in relation to individual provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the preparation of the bill the Commonwealth closely consulted the states and in doing so drew on their extensive experience in minerals administration which has been greatly appreciated. The states at the same time confirmed their commitment to a common offshore minerals code.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill, when enacted, will provide a model for state complementary offshore minerals legislation which will provide a common mining code to operate in areas under their respective jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the bill extensively modifies the mining code it preserves those principles in the present act which flow from the offshore constitutional settlement arrangements. Those principles are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">all offshore mineral activity in the Commonwealth area adjacent to a particular state is governed by a joint authority, consisting of the relevant Commonwealth minister and state minister;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the joint authorities are responsible for major decisions relating to titles, such as grants, refusals and the like, and in the event of a disagreement, the views of the Commonwealth minister prevail;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the day-to-day administration of the Commonwealth legislation is carried out by the relevant state and they are the primary point of contact between industry and governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As this bill deals with rights associated with minerals exploration and exploitation it ensures that this legislation is consistent with the government's policy in relation to native title. The provisions for the granting of licences are non-discriminatory and administrative procedures, which are already in place, will ensure that aboriginal interests are consulted when considering applications for any of the licences which may be issued under this act. Operators will be required to respect Aboriginal rights and interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also retains the provision that offshore mineral royalties will be shared 60/40 in favour of the states. This sharing arrangement will apply to all minerals recovered under the authority of the common offshore minerals code.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The states retain, and will continue to retain, all fees received from title holders and applicants for titles. This is a recompense to the states for the expenses incurred in administering the Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is divided into chapters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 1 covers the usual formalities, the constitutional and political background, the basic principles and concepts flowing from the Offshore Constitutional Settlement, including the establishment of the joint authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 2 is the actual mining code itself, which is written to reflect modern mining administration practice, and because of this, it differs substantially from the cumbersome mining code in the existing act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill clarifies how applications for exploration licences are to be received and treated. As a general rule the applications will be allocated on a "first come, first considered" basis. The exception to this rule will be where applications for substantially the same area are received at the same time. On such occasions ballots will be used to determine the priority as to which application is to be considered first.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill streamlines the existing provisions so that the manner in which an exploration licence is granted is simplified. It also alters the term of exploration licence renewals whereby the initial period will be for 4 years plus an option of 3 renewals of 2 years each. The maximum total term of a licence remains unchanged at 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only major change in the provisions concerning the  mining licence is the reduction in the maximum number of blocks from 50 to 20 for each licence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the introduction of a new title called a retention licence. This will be an intermediate form of tenure, between an exploration licence and a mining licence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its primary purpose will be to allow the holder of an exploration licence to retain for a strictly limited time, title to an area on which a significant deposit has been delineated and evaluated, but which is not a commercially viable proposition in the short term although there is a reasonable prospect for development in longer term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under this title the holder will not be able just to sit on the area but will be required to undertake further work according to the conditions laid down by the joint authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill introduces a provision which will require applicants for a title to lodge securities as a condition of title. These securities, which may be varied up or down during the life of a title, will be used to ensure compliance with the legislation, regulations and conditions of the title.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The securities may also be used to pay for rectification of any environmental damage as a result of operations, rehabilitation of the title area's environment and the settlement of any outstanding financial obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the creation of an instrument to be called a "special purpose consent" to undertake scientific investigations and reconnaissance surveys, and to collect small quantities of minerals. The consent will be a non-exclusive authority and it will not give any right or priority should an exploration licence or any other title be applied for later.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining chapters of the bill provide for the normal requirements associated with mining administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 3 of the bill provides for the keeping of a register and the details that are to be entered into it and so on. It also provides for dealings in licences and authorities and the details of the procedures that are to be followed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 4 provides the administrative details of the offshore minerals code such as information management, monitoring and enforcement, review of decisions, administrative procedures and finance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 5 provides for the application of state laws to the offshore area under Commonwealth jurisdiction and miscellaneous matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions in the five associated bills deal with money matters and are contained in separate bills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Offshore Minerals (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1993 amends the associated fees acts. The Offshore Minerals (Retention Licence Fees) Bill 1993 deals with fees payable for retention licences. The Minerals (Submerged Lands)(Royalty) Amendment Bill 1993 amends the royalty act. The Offshore Minerals (Exploration Licence User Charge) Bill 1993 and the Offshore Minerals (Retention Licence User Charge) Bill 1993 impose user charges on exploration and retention licences as announced in the 1993/94 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Discussions are still under way with the states for the establishment of a common offshore minerals royalty system and further amendments to the associated royalty act will be forthcoming at a later date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These bills provide a modern legal and administrative framework for the offshore mining industry which will help it grow as the years go by. They are a further demonstration of the government's micro-economic reform program to ensure, in co-operation with the states, that the barriers to the development of Australian offshore minerals industry are minimised so that it can compete in the tough world trading environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that once this legislation package is enacted, the states will introduce complementary offshore minerals legislation to apply within their jurisdiction. This will give effect to the agreement for a common offshore minerals code to apply right round Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">OFFSHORE MINERALS (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this bill is part of the package of offshore minerals bills. It repeals the Minerals (Submerged Lands) Act 1981 and amends the associated money acts, that is:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Minerals (Submerged Lands)(Exploration Permit Fees) Act 1981,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Minerals (Submerged Lands)(Production Licence Fees) Act 1981,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Minerals (Submerged Lands)(Registration Fees) Act 1981 and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Minerals (Submerged Lands)(Works Authority Fees) Act 1981.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the names of the acts and makes other changes to the terminology to fit in with the language of the Offshore Minerals Bill 1993. The new names of the acts will be:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Offshore Minerals (Exploration Licence Fees) Act 1981,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Offshore Minerals (Mining Licence Fees) Act 1981,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Offshore Minerals (Registration Fees) Act 1981 and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Offshore Minerals (Works Authority Fees) Act 1981.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main substantive amendment to the acts is the provision for the levels of fees to be set by regulations. This will enable more convenient amendment of the levels of fees when such an amendment is required to reflect the costs of administration of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The levels of fees have not been amended since 1981 and it is intended that new fees to be set by regulations would double the existing amounts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intended annual fees are $20 per block for exploration licences, $200 per block for mining licences and $20 per hectare for works licences. The registration fee for the  transfer or other dealing of an interest in a licence will not be raised and will remain at 1.5% of the value of the dealing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill sets a ceiling on the amounts that may be prescribed by regulations. The ceiling is not intended to reflect any intended rises in fees but merely provides an upper limit for fees well into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides that multiple holders of licences are jointly and severally liable for the payment of any fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that, in accordance with the Offshore Constitutional Settlement, administration of the offshore minerals legislation is carried out by the states on behalf of the Commonwealth. The fees collected are paid to the states in recompense for their administrative effort.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">OFFSHORE MINERALS (RETENTION LICENCE FEES) BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this bill is part of the package of offshore minerals bills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Offshore Minerals Bill 1993 introduces a new form of title called a retention licence which would allow a company to retain a proved mineral deposit without working it, if it could demonstrate a good reason for delaying production.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill imposes an annual fee to cover administrative costs. This is consistent with the other licences under the legislation where an annual fee is payable for each licence. The actual amount of the fee will be set by regulations but the bill imposes a ceiling on the amount that may be set.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that the fee will be set for the present at $200 per block. The maximum area of a licence being 20 blocks this could mean a maximum annual fee of $4,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA>This motion concerns the marketing of the disability reform package, an issue I have taken an interest in since the contracts were originally let in mid-1991 for a project with a total value of about $7 million, based on a two-year strategy and to be completed in June 1993. The aim was to inform the community, people with disabilities, doctors and people working with those with disabilities about changes to the disability reform package. The main contractor for the marketing of the disability reform package was a company called Corporate Impacts which was contracted by the Commonwealth to receive $4.95 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Corporate Impacts went into provisional liquidation prior to the completion of the contract. As at the end of last year 130 creditors including people with disabilities and service providers had not been paid. Some of the creditors contend that Corporate Impacts was working under the umbrella of the Commonwealth and that the Commonwealth was liable for these debts. That assumption was made because sometimes the employees of the company worked out of Commonwealth offices and used a logo that was also used by departmental officers. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Sixteen of the network facilitators employed by Corporate Impacts to market the disability reform package were also owed money. When we asked questions in estimates committees, Commonwealth officers contended that the Commonwealth may have been mischarged up to 13,000 head hours at an average of $45 per hour by Corporate Impacts as well as $220,000 by two designated officers to the contract and a significant number of other items, including an undisclosed number and value of deliverables, which at that time had not been obtained by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Upon asking questions at the estimates committee, I discovered that no checks of Corporate Impacts's financial capabilities had been undertaken prior to the letting of the contract. Within a year of the commencement of the contract, two of the three departments on the management committee contended that the contract should be terminated, but no effective action was taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three departments were involved, and also the Office of Government Information and Advertising, with an officer from that department chairing the committee with three people from the different departments. That committee seemed to change as different representatives came from the different departments. There seemed to be a lot of problems in the way in which this project was managed because it went across three different departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Corporate Impacts was supposedly paid on a monthly basis, but by February 1993 it had received all except $62,000 of the $4.95 million for the total contract and the contract was not supposed to be completed until June 1993. So some explanations are required as to why all but $62,000 was paid out well in advance of when the contract was to end. Despite the ongoing concerns about the contract, Corporate Impacts received a further Commonwealth contract in April 1993&mdash;weeks before it applied for voluntary liquidation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the estimates committee a Commonwealth officer expressed concern about the objectivity of the liquidator. One former member of the management committee is taking legal action against the director of Corporate Impacts on the grounds of defamation. It was also claimed in the estimates committee that one of the Commonwealth appointed valuators was threatened with legal action by Corporate Impacts. That has apparently been resolved. Two separate evaluations have cast doubt on the effectiveness of the marketing project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the progress of this contract raises serious concerns, the letting and supervision of it has wider ramifications in exposing major deficiencies in the administration of the Commonwealth's procurement policy. There are questions about the adequacy of current mechanisms used to manage contracts that cross three Commonwealth departments, plus OGIA, and about the adequacy of current procurement guidelines that apply to marketing and advertising contracts as distinct from contracts for materials and goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pursued this matter across estimates committees. One of the problems was that three departments were involved, so I had to ask questions of those three departments and of the Office of the Government Information and Advertising. That made it extremely difficult to ascertain all the relevant facts because sometimes I would find out one detail from one estimates committee by which time the other estimates committee had finished. It became obvious during the estimates process that that was not the most satisfactory means of obtaining all the information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also a number of non-government witnesses who may wish to provide evidence to a Senate inquiry about this contract. Again, that avenue is not available through an estimates committee. In addition, a large number of people who may have been mentioned in the estimates committee deserve a right of reply. For all these reasons, I commend this motion to the Senate. I look forward to the support of my colleagues on this side of the house. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The referral of issues to the various Senate standing committees is not an easy decision, especially as a larger and larger workload is put onto the shoulders of members of these committees. The Australian Democrats discussed this issue at length, and went through a process of first asking what the issue was: was it an issue of merit? I will not go back over this and argue the merit of the issue. Senator Patterson has done that very well. In this case it is not just a question of the impact on the community&mdash;which is very interested in the marketing of the disability reform package&mdash;but also a question of the use of government moneys, and exactly how taxpayers' moneys have been spent and where they have gone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beyond the issue we have to look at what other avenues have been tried. As Senator Patterson has just said, the estimates committees have been used extensively. The new system with the estimates committees takes out of this chamber a lot of the work, and possible questioning of ministers. As well as looking at three departments we have to look at what other avenues can be tried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue the Democrats had to look at is the actual pressure on these committees. The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs is perhaps under more pressure than almost any other committee. On balance, having gone through this process, our answer was, `Yes, this is an issue of merit. It has been pursued through other avenues. Despite the workload on the committee, it is an issue that we believe cannot be let lapse'. Therefore we will be supporting Senator Patterson's motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have been around this track a few times. I have to say it is hard to understand how people can justify the priority which they are proposing to give to this matter. I still fail to understand, after the several opportunities we have had to examine and discuss this matter, what in the main is intended to be the target of this inquiry. One part is obvious and, subject to the point Senator Lees makes about the priority which the committee wants to give to this as against other matters, it is a perfectly understandable matter to inquire into. The question is: has the outcome of this program justified the expenditure in it? I understand that. That is something we should look into with regard to a whole range of our activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the members of the committee&mdash;or a majority&mdash;think that is a matter they should look at, I will not quibble, even though I think other things are more important. It is a matter for the people who wish to conduct that inquiry rather than others. But there is a fascination with the process by which the people from Corporate Impacts were selected, and with the message that that might send about, firstly, whether the process itself is proper&mdash;and on this occasion whether it was properly conducted&mdash;and, secondly, the continually lingering innuendo that someone did something improper in making this choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with many other decisions when they are examined, it probably does show up&mdash;and it has shown up&mdash;ways in which some parts of the process of inclusion on the short list might be improved. But there has been nothing to suggest anybody involved has acted in a way that is in the slightest improper. That would seem to be the only thing that would justify the commitment to an inquiry, unless there was a reluctance to provide information. But a vast amount of information was provided to Senator Patterson last year. It covered virtually everything in this notice of motion. This led to lengthy questioning on a previous occasion, and nothing was disclosed that warranted further investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are not any further facts to be elicited. We have been providing everything that has been asked for. The full circumstances are already on the public record. They have been dealt with several times by the estimates committee. I keep hearing all sorts of rumours that somebody was supposed to have made this decision on behalf of a special friend of the government&mdash;or something. I do not have the slightest idea what the connection is supposed to be or with whom it is supposed to exist, other than that it may be that one of the people involved stood for preselection for the Labor Party 20 years ago. There is a longer sentence for standing for preselection than there is for murder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that one of the people apparently involved, one of the principals of the company, stood for Labor Party preselection only because I was told so in the Senate. I had never heard that before. In all the years I was in the Labor Party I did not know that the person had ever even been in the Labor Party. So if this is a great conspiracy, it is a pretty stale old affair; it is 20 years old. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alternatively, people may think there is cause for concern about whether the Commonwealth has been properly billed, or perhaps overcharged, for the work that was done; about the bankruptcy of the company concerned; and other such matters. The Australian Government Solicitor is currently investigating a number of the matters to ascertain whether there are grounds for legal action, not within the government, but in terms of our relationship with other parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore going to be extremely difficult to have a useful inquiry while those other inquiries are under way.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not that we are refusing to cooperate. We are quite relaxed about the matter. It is just that there is going to be a combination of tedious repetition and matters that are extremely difficult to pursue because of concurrent legal action that may be under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also proposed that the committee should look at an evaluation of the marketing of the DRP campaign. No-one can object to that. That is an expenditure of the taxpayers' money. The parliament is entitled to look at how effectively the money has been spent. But there has been a formal process of evaluation in the normal course, as all such campaigns of any magnitude are evaluated, and it is not finished. I am advised that the overall evaluation, taking into account several separate research evaluations of different aspects of the campaign, cannot be available for about two months. So the committee is going to charge in with half the information and try to make a decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such research as has been completed has already been made available to Senator Patterson. We have advised her that further research on the evaluations will be provided when we get it. So this is the world's least covering up cover-up. Every bit of information about this research that I am aware of has been provided. She wants more information&mdash;I am not aware of anything that has been asked for that has not been provided&mdash;but we do not need a major committee inquiry to try to provide it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the committee decides to go ahead with an inquiry, well and good. I suspect that at the end of the day it will say&mdash;on the basis of the bit of research that I have seen, and there is more to do and it may not come to this conclusion&mdash;that we need to tighten up the administration of how organisations get on the short list, but overall this was a cost-effective exercise for the Commonwealth and the taxpayers.

It may be appropriate to drop some other inquiry off the list&mdash;I do not know the committee's full brief&mdash;but if it chooses to give this inquiry priority it is the committee's decision.

There is a never ending repetition of inquiries. Those opposite are entitled to scour wherever they like to try to get up facts but they should not then seek to advocate that in some way they are about lean and efficient government because this is about diverting the government's resources from the primary tasks that the taxpayers provide their money for us to do. Taxpayers do not provide their money to pursue little exercises and fantasies that people have in their minds that somehow or other there might be a conspiracy in there somewhere if only we can keep looking. I do not suppose I can ever say that nobody in some far distant corner of the government has not conspired about something, but I know of nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that this is the world's most fruitless potential search.

I resent having to divert the resources of the public servants, who are seeking to do a job on behalf of the taxpayer, to pursue these fruitless fantasies that keep coming before the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we adjourned last night I was highlighting the hypocrisy of the Australian Democrats and the Greens&mdash;particularly the Democrats&mdash;in their approach to environmental and Aboriginal issues. They distributed what they call serious amendments, a series of papers, and they did so without warning to me. They had not given me any notice nor had they given the shadow environment minister, Mrs Gallus, any notice of these proposed amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they had any desire whatsoever to have these amendments treated seriously and passed, they would have notified the major party in this chamber, one which represents more than 50 per cent of the Australian public, about their proposals. Yet they chose not to, instead deciding to play cheap little political tricks in a vain attempt to out-Green each other&mdash;that is, the Greens and the Democrats&mdash;and to clamour for the support amongst that ever decreasing number of followers of the very left in the spectrum of Australian politics. </PARA>

Immediately I finished speaking I had a look at those amendments and I walked across to see the duty minister who, at that time, was Senator Ray. </PARA>

Had they done so, they may have saved themselves some embarrassment and they may have got some assistance from us in the amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not be supporting the second reading amendment. The wording is too vague to mean anything sensible and the general thrust of the amendment is already clearly stated in the bill. No commercial developments have been allowed which impact adversely in the eyes of those who have the power to stop any such commercial activities. Obviously, there is no development, past or current, under consideration that falls into the category of causing adverse impact which the amendment seeks to deal with. If there was adverse impact in the current proposal or in any past proposal there is plenty of authority and power for existing agencies to prevent that. They have not done that so obviously it has not occurred. It is unlikely to occur because the power is already there and it does not need to be spelt out in this particular second reading amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The skyrail project has been mentioned in the debate and it obviously has no adverse impact, as I mentioned, otherwise it would not have been approved by the Wet Tropics Management Authority, by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, by the local authorities or by the other agencies which have some interest in this matter. The skyrail project will be a great boost for tourism in Far North Queensland and will also allow ordinary Australians to experience at first hand the beauty and significance of the wet tropics in a manner which will not cause any damage to the rainforest or in any other way adversely impact on the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the benefit of honourable senators, I will explain what the skyrail project is all about because, from the fairly benighted references made by other speakers, they may well be excused for thinking that the skyrail project will involve clearing and felling huge tracts of forests. The skyrail will run from Smithfield to Kuranda with two stops, one in the national park and the other next to the Barron Falls. Both are in the World Heritage areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The skyrail will consist of six-passenger gondola cabins. It is made of 37 steel towers, 25 of which are in the World Heritage areas. These towers are being installed by helicopter, each into an area of 10 metres by 10 metres. They are up to 40 metres high and are higher than the trees so as to provide a canopy experience for those using the skyrail. The idea of the gondolas and the skyrail project is to allow people to travel over the rainforest rather than through it. The whole development involves a total clearing of less than half a hectare. The CSIRO has stated that the skyrail cableway will allow people to experience the rainforest with less impact than any other means, including walking through the forest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For five or six years the skyrail people went through the process of obtaining approvals and getting the right sort of environmental slant on these things. Eventually, in December of 1993, they lodged a $1 million cash security bond with the Queensland government to guarantee compliance with the development agreement and the environmental conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators and all parliamentarians would oppose any development which did damage to rainforests or any other environmentally sensitive areas. This second reading amendment is, accordingly, unnecessary. The purpose of the bill which we are passing is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to facilitate the implementation of Australia's international duty for the protection, conservation, presentation, rehabilitation and transmission to future generations of the Wet Tropics of Queensland . . .</PARA>
<PARA>that is, to protect and preserve those rainforests. We do not need this amendment to amend what the bill is all about. How can we do the sorts of things that the bill requires if we allow in commercial activities which adversely impact upon the World Heritage values? This second reading amendment is motherhood stuff which has nothing to do with the legislation. It is all about the Democrats and the Greens trying to carve out a niche in the minds of the radical greenies and those to the far left of the political spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that those in the Labor Party are agreeing with this amendment because, even though they know it is completely unnecessary, they have an eye to the second preferences. Of course, that is where Senator Richardson comes in, the past master at getting the second preferences from the greenies and winning votes on that. I think even Senator Richardson realises that all that sort of stuff is a thing of the past. Why they are bothering to support this amendment, which is what the bill is all about, is simply beyond me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stupidity of the Labor approach is that, by agreeing with the second reading amendment, they are conceding that the bill is not sufficient to do what it purports to do. It is really a vote of no confidence in the Wet Tropics Management Authority and, more importantly, it is a vote of no confidence in Mrs Kelly. I can well understand why they would have a vote of no confidence in Mrs Kelly, but it is a vote of no confidence in relation to this matter. Those in the Labor Party are saying, `We don't trust Mrs Kelly to keep out developments that impact adversely'. We know Mrs Kelly has the power to do that but for some reason members of the Labor Party, by agreeing with this amendment, are saying, `We know Mrs Kelly has the power to stop it, but we don't trust her to stop it and, therefore, we are going to agree to this amendment'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding the foreshadowed amendments, we can only agree with the government on the Democrats' proposed clause 6A and 5A(2) that it is not appropriate for this parliament to tell the Queensland parliament what it should do. In any case, if we look at the Democrats' proposed clause 6A, we see that it requires the minister to use her best endeavours to have the Queensland government `ensure that any advisory committee established by the Authority under the Queensland Act includes among its members Aboriginal representatives'. That is what the Democrats want us to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Democrats look at the agreement between the Queensland government and the Australian government that we are dealing with in this bill, they will see that there is provision for a community consultative committee and that the people included on it will come from various areas, including the Aboriginal community. We are confirming what is already there in the agreement, yet the Democrats want to move another amendment to say it again. It shows how stupid they are and the lack of attention they give to these details.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a scientific advisory committee with some requirements and, again, Aborigines could be appointed to that if they have a sufficient amount of scientific knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to foreshadowed amendment 5A(1), we support the concept that the Wet Tropics Management Authority should have on its board `one or more Aboriginal representatives who have appropriate knowledge of, and experience in, the protection of cultural or natural heritage'. The Liberal and National parties agree with that. We also think there should be an environmentalist on it and someone from local government and someone from the promotional areas around Cairns. We also believe that there should be women and men on it, but we are not going to change the act to make sure that local government is represented or that environmentalists are represented. All of those people can be put on the board if they have sufficient standing, and that is the same with Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely we should be getting the very best persons for the job regardless of their race if they have the standing and the ability. I know Aboriginal people have that. I know they are skilled. They can be appointed to that board today, and they should be appointed today. Why Mrs Kelly refuses to do so, I do not know. Maybe she will have to answer for that. It is up to the government to do that today if it wants to. It does not need this bill to appoint Aboriginal persons to that board. I cannot understand why this amendment is necessary. My time has run out. I want to say quite a bit more about the appointment of people to that board, but I will do that in the Committee of the Whole debate.</PARA>

Amanda asked what these amendments were, and for them to be faxed to her. At the time I started speaking in the Senate, Mrs Gallus had not received those faxes from Imogen, or whoever it was. After I finished my speech, I found the amendments on my table. We then sought to find out from Mrs Gallus what the whole thing was about.

We, and I understand the government, will be opposing this. Clause 6A seeks to get Aboriginal representation on advisory committees but this is already in the agreement which this bill is facilitating. This provision relating to Aboriginal people is in that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have, yet again, failed to give this legislation the correct sort of consideration. They are simply trying to re-legislate what is already in effect. It is simply another example of the Democrats trying to make these political points without any real consideration of the issues involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my speech in the second reading debate I was indicating that we supported the concept of an Aboriginal representative on the authority board, which the Democrats propose through the inclusion of proposed section 5A. We support the general thrust of the idea that there should be an Aboriginal person who has the appropriate knowledge of and experience in the protection of cultural and natural heritage to the Wet Tropics Management Authority board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also support&mdash;I repeat&mdash;the suggestion that there should be a local government representative on that authority board, because the local governments are inextricably involved in the management of these areas and the access to and from them. As well, of course, local authorities are locally elected, democratic organisations which are in the best position to adequately represent the views, concerns and aspirations of the people of the particular area. So it is essential that there be a local government representative on that authority board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, we believe it is essential that there be someone on that authority board who would mirror the interests of the tourist operators and developers, who have a very great interaction with the wet tropics management area. It is only by having those developers and operators that we can, sensitively and in a controlled and environmentally friendly way, get these areas to a stage where they can be accessible to ordinary Australians&mdash;not just those who can wander through them as long as they like and do not have to worry about the normal constraints that ordinary Australian families have. We want to make provision&mdash;and the tourist operators do this&mdash;for ordinary Australians to have the opportunity to get in and have a look at those rainforests. So we think there should be a representative of those sorts of people on the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also think that there should be a representative of the environmentalists on that authority board. That is essential. In fact, the government has agreed with that by appointing Dr Aila Keto, a well-known environmentalist, to that authority board. Nothing in the legislation says that she has to be appointed but the government has said that it is sensible, and we agree that it is sensible to have an environmentalist on the board, and so it has appointed her. The situation is similar with local government. There is nothing in the legislation now that says that a local  government person has to be appointed, but we have such an appointee in Councillor Tom Pyne, the Chairman of the Mulgrave Shire Council. He is there because he should be there, and because there should be a representative of local government. But that is not made mandatory in the legislation; it is up to the government to appoint these people, and it has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, it is important, as I mentioned, that there be a promotional person on the board, and the government has agreed with that and appointed someone. But that is not written into the legislation; it is not mandatory. It is for the government to decide and it has decided. And the situation is similar with regard to an Aboriginal person. We believe that such a person should be appointed to the board. It is up to the government to do it. The government now has all the power that it needs to appoint someone. Mrs Kelly can do it if she wants to; and, if she does not want to, perhaps Senator Richardson could tell us why that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is every power there now for Mrs Kelly to appoint an Aboriginal person if that person is the best person for that particular authority&mdash;and surely we should be getting the very best persons for the board of this very important authority, regardless of racial origin. People should not be appointed as Aborigines. They should be appointed as Aboriginal persons who have some real connection with the area. If, as I suspect, there are Aboriginal persons who have the appropriate knowledge of and experience in the protection of cultural and natural heritage and who can work in the broader thrust of preservation, maintenance and enhancement of the wet tropics rainforest, and if such a person would make a contribution at least equal to that of any other person who might be appointed, then that person should be appointed. As I have said, Mrs Kelly has the power to do that now. There is no need for special legislation; the power is already there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a person should be appointed for his or her suitability, not for his or her racial origin. I know that there are many Aboriginal persons who would do a marvellous job and who should be considered, but that could and should happen under existing legislation. As I mentioned, this is another example of the shallowness of the Democrats' legislation and the political games that they play&mdash;attempting to win votes but holding no real concern about or interest in the substantive issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed by the Democrats come from the leader of the party. It amazes me that the leader of the party could have got it so wrong. She has moved an amendment proposing something already provided for in the bill in order to try to score some cheap political points for a party desperately trying to maintain a constituency on the very left of the political spectrum, and it is doing that in the face of a concerted push for that left wing vote from the Western Australian Greens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the two proposed preambles&mdash;one proposed by the Greens and one proposed by the Democrats&mdash;I point out to the Senate that clause 3 of the bill, which we have all agreed should be passed, sets out the object of the bill. It clearly sets out the purpose of the legislation. Clause 3 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The object of this Act is to give effect to the agreement . . . and to facilitate the implementation of Australia's international duty for the protection, conservation, presentation, rehabilitation and transmission to future generations of the Wet Tropics . . . Area.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a clear setting out of the purpose of the bill. The Democrats' preamble talks solely about Aboriginals and their attachment&mdash;nothing about the objects of the bill as set out in clause 3. I would ask Senator Richardson and his advisers to consider this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot might like to get some legal advice on the nature and effect of preambles in legislation. She might find out that the preamble is a statement of intention as an aid to interpretation, but that it is secondary to the specific clauses of the bill. It is in clause 3 that the objects of the bill are given, and they tell us what the legislation is all about. The preamble proposed by the Democrats is contrary to the specific clauses of the bill in that it is contrary to the specific reference made in clause 3. It is, again, fairly typical of the grandstanding of the Democrats&mdash;making some political point no matter how irrelevant it is to the serious business before the parliament. Perhaps it is a preamble which the Democrats might want to move to any legislation that comes before this parliament, because it is as relevant to any other legislation as it is to this particular bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preamble proposed in the Greens' amendment is more relevant, particularly in its first eight paragraphs. They would very clearly assist the bill if that preamble were to be part of the legislation, because that preamble does set out what the bill is for; it is directly in line with the object of the bill set out in clause 3 and would be very relevant. But, unfortunately, the final three paragraphs also deal with Aboriginal issues and they are not at all relevant to the bill, particularly as the Greens' amendments do not in any way attempt to mention, involve or include Aborigines, leaving that part of the preamble standing completely alone and without relevance to the bill, particularly with respect to the specific provisions of clause 3. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, while not necessarily disagreeing with the sentiments of the preamble where they are raised in the appropriate place and in the appropriate legislation, we will not be supporting these preambles and these amendments to this particular piece of legislation because they are not relevant. They simply give a further example, if one is needed, of the action of the Democrats and the Greens in making political points without taking any account of the real issues before us in the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make some comments, particularly in relation to the preambles proposed by both the Greens and the Australian Democrats. I think there are a number of matters of serious concern to all senators. By adding these preambles there would be a dangerous tendency for the Greens and the Democrats to try to outbid each other for the constituency that these preambles are aimed at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Ian Macdonald said earlier, in large part the preambles are contrary to the aims and objectives of the act, and are almost ultra vires. The matter of serious concern is that they really achieve little except to make a political statement. I agree with Senator Ian MacDonald when he says they are a cheap political statement. There is a very strong rivalry between the Greens and the Democrats for very much the same constituency in many parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debates on the budget and the Native Title Bill, to name two, we saw an almost unedifying display of the two parties on the cross benches fighting each other for media attention. Even though that probably sounds a bit nasty, in saying that I do not detract from the genuine motives of all senators on the cross benches here. However, from my point of view it is almost unedifying to see these senators chasing each other for the media spotlight when they debate these things. It is therefore not surprising to see that we have two pious preambles competing for the support of the Senate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Ian Macdonald said, the coalition parties will not be supporting these amendments because we see them for what they are. They do not assist the process of managing the wet tropics area in the way the initial legislation set out to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter I covered when the Senate debated world heritage issues on previous occasions, but I want to spend a very short amount of time on the whole process of world heritage listing and on trying to take the politics out of it. Senator Coulter was present in this place when I made my earlier remarks on this subject. World heritage listing is a most controversial thing in Australia. As is well-known to senators, there is this continuing conflict involving the genuine hopes and aspirations of those who care for the environment and would like to see the environment protected and managed in a way that protects what are genuinely world heritage areas for the benefit of future generations, for the value of the amenity to those people who can enjoy it here and now, and for the value of the biodiversity, the flora and fauna and all the other aspects of heritage and environmental protection. These are very genuine hopes and aspirations, and they are good policy objectives when trying to maintain those values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The competing objective is economic development involving the hopes, aspirations and control of the local infrastructure and environment by local people. Every time we talk of world heritage&mdash;and this particularly applied during the 1980s which Senator Richardson knows more about than most people&mdash;we get this political conflict between the locals, the state government and the federal government. When world heritage listing is proposed we get this massive conflict with the right wing rednecks going around saying, `Watch out: Canberra will take control of your land', and, `Watch out for the nasty politicians and bureaucrats from Canberra'. The people from Canberra&mdash;generally the Australian Labor Party over the past 10 years&mdash;say, `Don't worry, we will look after you. We will give you money; we will give you resources on the ground and we really won't try to take over land management'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we are here debating one of the last pieces of legislative action to try to resolve those political difficulties in relation to the wet tropics. The danger here is that with people like the Democrats and the Greens competing for this common part of the constituency that they seek to attract by putting what I call these pious preambles into the legislation, one then further politicises the whole process of world heritage. It will then be made so much harder for Australia to list successfully world heritage properties in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This subject is political enough as it is. I will not repeat them all, but if we seek to have references to Aboriginal links to the land and the inclusion of Aboriginal delegates on committees and various other bodies set up under the act, then we will give people on the ground even more reason to kick political cans and be anti-world heritage in principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I genuinely believe that in principle world heritage can be a good thing, but it is all to do with how the process is achieved. We know what happens if these things are achieved working from the ground up rather than by working from the top down. This was the case with the wet tropics, with Shark Bay, as Senator Richardson knows, with the Nullarbor and with Lake Eyre as the result of a ministerial announcement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking about the process and about how the announcement is made. All of a sudden the pastoralists, tourist operators and everyone else in the area get scared about the prospect of world heritage listing, and immediately the people in Canberra and the politicians involved who are actually proposing the world heritage listing are on the back foot straight away. If one has to go to a hostile meeting on Lake Eyre, a hostile meeting on the Nullarbor or a hostile meeting on Shark Bay, one is fighting backwards because the government has decided, for whatever noble reasons, to draw a line around an area on the map of Australia and call it `world heritage'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am suggesting to the Senate that those over there on the cross benches&mdash;that is, the Greens and the Democrats who, of course, if there is a double dissolution, will be fighting for the No. 12 position in Senate elections in all states of Australia&mdash;are trying, at this late stage, to seek further political mileage from this fighting amongst green constituencies and amongst the natural supporters of the Greens and the Democrats to see who can make the most pious preamble to the world heritage legislation. In the long term they could do serious damage to the whole process of world heritage listing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald has referred to the more specific point about mandating that we must have an Aboriginal person on the board. I am sure it is genuinely meant by both the Greens and the Democrats. When it comes to appointing Aboriginal people and mandating that we must have an Aboriginal person appointed to the tribunal, we made the point during the native title debate that it is a form of tokenism and paternalism that will not help Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald made the point very well that a whole range of people should be involved in the process of managing this world heritage area and that we need to protect the interests of local people. There is no doubt that some Aboriginals within the wet tropics area have important links with that area going back a long time. I do not know about those links&mdash;I have not studied the Aboriginal heritage in that area, so excuse me for not seeking to be an expert on them&mdash;but I am sure that Aboriginals have links which possibly go back to before white settlement. I do not know whether that is the case; that is a definitive statement. But there is no doubt that many other groups of Australians, as Senator Macdonald has said, need to have a say in the management of this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this body is doing the right job, it will consult with all of those people. To mandate that we must have an Aboriginal person&mdash;in other words, make a racist mandate&mdash;would of course be making a big mistake in our eyes. It should be made quite clear that the coalition's view is that we should make sure that the board and the people involved in managing the wet tropics world heritage area are very cognisant of the hopes and aspirations of the Aboriginal people in this area. Senator Richardson has given us an assurance that the government has already had a number of consultations with the Aboriginal people in relation to the extraction of wood for their own purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the coalition fully supports that consultation. But, again, for what I consider to be cheap political reasons, the Democrats are proposing to put into legislation a form of racial discrimination which will not only hurt the world heritage process but, indeed, hurt the process of reconciliation which we all talk so much about in this place. We do not seem to get anywhere because all we seem to do is talk about it and make these crass political forms of tokenism and paternalism which do not actually end up helping the Aboriginals on the ground anywhere around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am afraid that these amendments are politically motivated. I think they are being moved as amendments for the wrong reasons. It is quite sad to see what I think is a hijacking of what is already a highly controversial area of public policy.

Therefore, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Page 1, after the Title, insert the following Preamble:  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">"Preamble</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"This preamble sets out considerations taken into account by the Parliament of Australia in enacting the law that follows.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"> "Aboriginal people have occupied, used, and enjoyed land in the Area since time immemorial.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Area is part of the cultural landscape of Rainforest Aboriginal peoples and is important spiritually, socially, historically and culturally to aboriginal people particularly concerned with the land.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It is, therefore, the intention of the Parliament to recognise a role for Aboriginal peoples particularly concerned with land and waters in the Area, and give Aboriginal peoples a role to play in its management.".</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me to be very rich indeed for the opposition&mdash;which, during the Mabo debate, obfuscated and filibustered day after day with its hidden agendas in relation to not properly recognising the legitimate land claims of Aboriginal people&mdash;to now come back over this piece of legislation and object to the writing into this legislation of several clauses which in fact recognise what Mabo is all about. I think the opposition's going back over that ground now seriously puts in question its motivation, and we must seriously question whether its motives are indeed not being racist or disguised as political pejorative against both the Democrats and the Greens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is that world heritage recognises, under the world heritage legislation, a number of characteristics in areas which mark those areas off as world heritage. One of those characteristics which mark them off as world heritage is cultural connections. This seems to have been ignored by both Senator Campbell and Senator Macdonald when they say that the recognition of Aboriginal occupation of this area has nothing whatsoever to do with the objects of the act and with the declaration of this particular area as world heritage. It has a great deal to do with this area. The cultural attitudes of Aboriginal people which recognise the need to protect areas, the idea of living with the land, of being part of the land and of being brother and sister to the animals and plants which one finds among many indigenous people lies very much at the core of what Mabo is about. It is about the change in Australian society and about what world heritage is about. So if the honourable senators fail to see that, that is their problem. They are failing to see something which clearly the government, the Greens and the Democrats have recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are proposing three amendments to this bill which are designed to ensure greater recognition of Aboriginal people's traditional association with the area that will be subject to the operation of the Wet Tropics Management Authority. Our amendments are designed to ensure that Aboriginal peoples who have an attachment to the land and waters under the protection of the authority can participate in the management of the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the essential point: they are designed to ensure that they will be there and will be participating. We have heard Senator Campbell and Senator Macdonald express their attitudes, when they said, `Yes, they may be. It is up to the minister. The minister can appoint them'. Heaven help us if the opposition were to form government and opposition ministers were in there if they have the sorts of attitudes that we have heard today in relation to Aboriginal people. I do not think any Aboriginal people or any of their attitudes will be represented whatsoever. I think the notion that one writes this into legislation, that one attempts as far as one can to ensure that these cultural attitudes are represented by having Aboriginal people with the necessary qualifications represented in there, is absolutely essential. So the first amendment we put forward proposes that there be this preamble acknowledging the connection of indigenous people to this area. As Senator Richardson has pointed out, some indigenous people have long-lasting connections with the area and their cultural tradition is an essential part of the world heritage qualities and should be recognised as such. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is to be regretted that the substantive legislation passed by the Queensland government covering the administration of the wet tropics area does not include a preamble. Our amendment goes some way to addressing this deficiency. Here, one needs to reflect on the history of the development of this legislation in relation to management: that, prior to Mabo, an agreement was entered into between the Commonwealth government and the state government; that, prior to Mabo, the Queensland government passed its legislation; but now, post-Mabo, the federal government is passing its legislation and clearly needs to recognise the deficiency&mdash;that is what these amendments attempt to do&mdash;which potentially lies in there and to fill that necessary gap. Things have moved on since 1990, thank God. Things have moved on since 1993&mdash;thank God&mdash;with respect to our recognition of the legitimate land claims of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second and third amendments that we have put forward expand on this and make it the responsibility of the federal minister to ensure, upon consultation with his or her state counterparts and the Aboriginal groups concerned, adequate indigenous representation on the board of the authority and its committees. These amendments are specifically designed to encourage indigenous participation&mdash;not to just leave it open so that it may occur at the largess of the minister but that that be clearly identified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept Senator Macdonald's point in relation to the legal strength of objects which are written as parts of legislation and preambles. But, as he said himself, the preamble is in fact a part to which law courts can look for further explanation and exposition of the purposes and the intent of the legislation. Therefore, it is quite appropriate that that be in there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that a review of Aboriginal involvement in the authority is under way, and it is to be hoped that a memorandum of understanding will be drafted which makes a clear acknowledgment of the heritage and traditional association of indigenous peoples with the area and provides for their active participation in management. This recognises the fact that there is a time line associated with this process which has now run over about 3 1/2 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge those involved in the review to include in the memorandum an acknowledgment of native title claims. Such claims should be taken into account when management plans are being drawn up. I acknowledged in my speech during the debate on second reading that there has been quite serious mismanagement in relation to world heritage areas and management plans. If we are to have proper understanding and acceptance of world heritage by people with regard to, say, the Nullarbor and Lake Eyre, the government needs to do a lot more to ensure that management plans are put in place early. I think Mrs Gallus is suggesting in a possible amendment that some sort of preliminary management plan would alert people to what governments had in mind. This would be an excellent idea. I have no problem with that at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that in the Law Reform Commission's amendments to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975, as proposed in the report on the recognition of Aboriginal customs and laws, it was suggested that there be indigenous representation on the board and, further, that management plans be subject to consultation and negotiation with Aboriginal peoples. Our amendments go a substantial way towards addressing this. It is desirable that more direct legislative imperatives be put in place to ensure that the interests of Aboriginal peoples are considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is disappointing that we could not wait until after the review of Aboriginal participation has taken place before dealing with this legislation; it may have been better to put the whole thing on ice for a bit longer. However, we considered that and rejected it as a possibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be some who will argue that it is not appropriate to move this type of amendment ahead of the review. However, it is our view that these amendments cover those exigencies, and the review may then come back with further suggestions for change. Our amendments ensure that simple legislative safeguards consistent with Commonwealth legislative and constitutional obligations to indigenous people&mdash;and these have changed since the Queensland legislation and since the Commonwealth-state agreements&mdash;are built into this bill. That is the basis of our strong support for these amendments. I formally urge on the Senate our first amendment which relates to the preamble. </PARA>

I draw attention to the fact that there is another Green amendment to be moved at the end.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) was talking about the amendment to the preamble that has just been lost, he said that it was redundant or worse. If it is correct that it is stating the obvious and it is unnecessary to put the context in which this bill is being presented, well and good&mdash;as long as it is clearly understood that it is for the protection and preservation of the world's cultural and natural heritage that is present in the wet tropics of Queensland. The Greens felt that it was appropriate to have that initial opening. We also felt that the provision referring to the role of Aboriginal people with regard to their participation in any management of the world heritage area was appropriate. Therefore, it would be very remiss of us not to support the Democrat's motion. Whilst leaving out what the minister has said about obvious and well-placed confidence in the legislation, we will be prepared to support the provision that refers to Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In responding to Senator Campbell's concern, the Greens do not feel that it is discriminatory to recognise the role of indigenous people in the care of significant environmental areas with which they have strong spiritual attachment. A lot of adjectives have been thrown around the chamber. It might be of interest to my colleagues to note that often I do not respond to any of these words. The reason why I do not react strongly against them is that, as a psychologist, I am very aware of the principle that whenever accusations are made they often reflect the accuser more accurately than the person who is being accused. I do not feel that there is any need to respond to the comments that were made earlier in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens and the Democrats have presented slightly different amendments. These have come from requests in the community from slightly different perspectives. In particular, Aboriginal groups have requested the inclusion of a special clause in the preamble. The Democrats are providing such a clause, and we are happy to support it. We believe that it gives recognition and encouragement to Aboriginal participation in the management process. There is agreement rather than competition between the Greens and the Democrats on this count. We will be supporting all of the amendments moved by the Democrats. We would urge the government to reconsider its reluctance to support all of them. I appreciate Senator Ian Macdonald's comments in which he supported in part the underlying meaning of the amendments, if not gaining the opposition's support for them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have come into the chamber in order to answer what I heard Senator Coulter say when I was listening to the broadcast in my office. He revisited the situation where anyone who says anything against any sort of Aboriginal motion or motive coming from the Greens, the Democrats, the government or whatever is a racist.

If he wants to put expertise onto such organisations, committees, boards or whatever it may be, it should be done by merit, as Senator Ian Macdonald has already pointed out. Senator Ian Macdonald has already said that it could be done positively by this legislation. We have to pick the people who are suited, the people who are willing, and the people who have the expertise. If we go away from that basis, then what other stupid sorts of situations will we get in other legislation?

The purpose of the bill is clearly mentioned in clause 3, which sets out the objects of the act. The objects relate to conservation but not to Aboriginal issues. I am at a loss to understand why the government, except for political reasons, would be supporting this amendment. They are the reasons why we oppose the amendment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also respond to what Senator Coulter said in reference to future coalition governments when it comes to appointing Aboriginal people. It is always easy for the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens to look at the coalition's views on things like the Native Title Bill and this bill and say, `Aboriginals will never get anything if a coalition government is elected.' That is a cheap statement which personalises and lowers the tone of the debate. I make my comments from a very genuine point of view&mdash;I made comments during the Native Title Bill debate after a series of Labor Party politicians criticised the coalition in relation to Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both sides of politics&mdash;including the Democrats&mdash;have a lot to be ashamed of for the way they have treated Aboriginals and Aboriginal issues for years, going back 30 or 40 years. It is fair to say that the coalition government under Malcolm Fraser and ministers like Ian Viner and Fred Chaney tried very hard to make progress on Aboriginal issues. It is probably fair to say that a number of ministers under the Hawke and Keating Labor governments have tried very hard as well. Many people are genuinely committed to the cause of trying to advance Aboriginals. But I do not think that just because one belongs to the Labor Party, the Greens or the Democrats one has a mortgage on empathy for the plight of Aboriginals. It is a sad reflection on anyone who says, `Coalition members are all anti-Aboriginal and the Labor Party loves Aboriginals because it keeps moving these bits of national land rights legislation and other things and supports pious preambles to bits of legislation.' We will fight this fight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will defend our record every time a Labor Party or Democrat politician gets up and has a go at the coalition and tries to attack the credentials of the coalition parties, particularly the Liberal Party, in relation to Aboriginal affairs. I will put on the record our genuine concern for all Australians; that Aboriginals do have some very endemic problems that need to be addressed by a nation that can stand up and be proud of itself. There are health, housing and education problems&mdash;problems that need special attention. But those problems are not assisted by politicians trying to score cheap political points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a genuine commitment during consideration of the Native Title Bill to our belief that the Mabo II High Court decision was not the best approach for a whole range of reasons, one being that that approach would actually be counterproductive in solving those other serious problems of Aboriginal people. We stand by that approach. We think the government has made a very serious mistake in the way that whole process was entered into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though the politics of the situation in this chamber towards the end of last year certainly did not come out in the coalition's favour for a load of reasons, which those who have been in politics understand, I am quite sure that in the long run Senator Richardson will be proven wrong. I am glad that he is proud of what his government has achieved, because in public life it is good to feel that one is achieving something. I think the government has made a serious mistake with the approach taken with the Native Title Bill, which in the long run will prove to be an economic disaster for Australia and, even worse, a disaster for the Aboriginal people whom the government sought to assist with its approach. </PARA>

I do not know what Senator Coulter was doing then but I made it quite clear that we would not be supporting this for the very reason that, whilst we support the concept of having an Aborigine on the board, we also support the concept of having on the board an environmentalist, a local government person, a representative of the tourism operators and developers and an independent chairman. That part is legislated for. We also support the concept of having men and women on the board, as appropriate in this day and age. But we support the concept of having the best people on it. All of those people can be on the board&mdash;it is up to the government to nominate them. We are quite happy for them to be nominated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has two nominations. Currently they are Mr Geoff Donaghy from the Cairns promotion bureau and Ms Aila Keto, the well-known environmentalist. The State government has two nominees: councillor Tom Pyne from local government and another gentleman, whom I do not really know. His name is McDonald, so he must be good, but I do not know what category he fits into. In addition, there is an independent chairman, Professor Ken Wiltshire, appointed jointly by the Commonwealth and state government. That is provided for in the agreement. Of course, the executive director also sits on the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the government is going to get together with the Greens and pass this amendment. Where does that leave us? The bill says that the government has to appoint one Aboriginal person and that the other person has to be only generally qualified. The agreement between the two governments adopted in the legislation indicates the type of person that should be on the board of the Wet Tropics Management Authority. The bill gives a broad definition that the chairman and members shall be persons having qualifications relevant to, or special experience or interest in, a field related to the functions of the management authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I challenged the Australian Labor Party earlier. An Aborigine with those qualifications could have been appointed three years ago. Senator Richardson does not need this amendment to appoint an Aborigine. But if he does include this amendment, there will be one Aborigine and one other person having qualifications relevant to or special experience or interest in a field related to the functions of the management authority. That other person could also be an Aborigine. So there may be two Aborigines on the board. Good luck if they both have the qualifications. But one Aborigine is there because he is an Aborigine. This amendment is contrary to the agreement. There is going to be a field day for the constitutional lawyers, but that is not for me to worry about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is going to have to get rid of either Dr Keto, the environmentalist, or Mr Geoff Donaghy. It will be interesting to see which one goes. I am going to be around Cairns when this happens. Someone with specific environmental learning and qualifications will be put off the board. I do not always agree with Dr Keto&mdash;I rarely do&mdash;but she is an acknowledged expert in the field. Mr Donaghy is the representative of the Cairns promotion bureau. He does a tremendous job in promoting Cairns, particularly in the ecotourism area. He is promoting an industry which in Cairns has meant millions and millions of dollars, and hundreds of thousands of jobs to far north Queensland and North Queensland generally. They have all been associated with ecotourism in the wet tropics. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes to transfer guardianship powers of certain non-citizen children from the federal Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to the state and territory governments. It does this by excluding children who enter Australia for adoption from the definition of non-citizen child defined in the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act 1946. Following the passage of this bill in the federal parliament, state and territory governments will be able to assume guardianship when they have been declared by gazettal by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs after he is satisfied with the state and territory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports this bill because it puts into legislative context what is current practice; that is, the federal Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs usually immediately delegates his powers of guardianship of adoptive non-citizen children to the relevant state or territory welfare administrator. There have, however, been exceptions to this practice. The most notable was the baby Kajal case several years ago when the federal minister intervened in the state adoption process by exercising his guardianship powers. The failure to follow usual delegatory procedures in that case raised concerns from state governments about the way the federal government had interfered in adoption procedures which essentially come under state jurisdiction. </PARA>

Although there will be a need for ongoing discussions between state and federal governments about the details of the complementary state and territory legislation, these are not part of the object of this bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes a definition of Olympic artistic work which includes a prescribed Olympic torch and flame design under proposed section 2A or an artistic work that incorporates either the Olympic symbol or a prescribed torch and flame design.

Such a regulation may be made only where the committee is the owner of the copyright or the relevant work.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly significant that this is to protect the Olympic insignias.

The AOC, which looked into this, is taken to be the owner of the design of the symbol and any design registered under the act before the commencement of this bill. Clause 6 provides that, in relation to an infringement of the monopoly in a protected design, a design may be a fraudulent or obvious imitation of a registered torch or flame design even if it does not incorporate a prescribed Olympic torch and flame.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 10, which requires the registrar, on application from the committee, to reduce the protection period of a registered torch and flame design, is also desirable.

Clause 15 proposes to preserve existing rights conferred by the Trade Marks Act 1955 and the Designs Act 1906. Clause 16 replaces all references to `the federation' with `the committee'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise also to support the Olympic Insignia Protection Amendment Bill 1993 and to make it very plain that the Australian Democrats welcome this piece of legislation. As has already been mentioned in this debate, the Olympic Insignia Protection Amendment Bill increases protection against the unauthorised use of either the commercial insignia or the symbols. The bill also seeks to stop what has been described as ambush marketing in the lead-up to the Olympic Games in Sydney in the year 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have already been reports of goods illegally using the Olympic insignia being sold within hours of Sydney being announced as the host city. The Australian Olympic Committee has suggested to the Democrats that it has been seeking this type of legislation for several years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AOC says that the world body, the International Olympic Committee, has requested the strongest possible protection for Olympic symbols, particularly the Olympic rings and the torch. The Olympic motto, `faster, higher, stronger',  will also be protected under this legislation. As the Australian Olympic Committee also states, official sponsors need to be protected. Those sponsors who have authority to use the Olympic symbols should not be undermined by organisations which use these symbols without the proper authority. An example of this occurred after the Barcelona Olympic Games in 1992 when a rival of one of the Australian team's major sponsors was able to cash in on the success at the games of the Australian athletes because this type of legislation did not exist. Unfortunately for the AOC, this particular sponsor has now ended its association with the Australian team over this incident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While welcoming the Olympic Insignia Protection Amendment Bill, the Australian Olympic Committee is concerned that it may not go far enough. The AOC has used the example of the United States to highlight its concerns. Olympic insignia protection rules are very strong in the United States and any individual or organisation wanting to use even the word  Olympic must have the expressed approval of the United States Olympic Committee. The Australian Olympic Committee and the Sydney Olympics Organising Committee have publicly called for measures similar to those in the United States. It appears that the government believes any attempt to restrict a word such as Olympic could be the subject of a legal challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a personal note, it is a little disappointing too that the legislation does not include any product labelling. This could have been a prime opportunity to ensure that any Olympic products carrying a `made in Australia' tag should truly represent goods that are fully Australian. However, the Olympic Committee assures me that a lot has been done in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the New South Wales government presented its legislation for the formation of the Sydney Olympics Organising Committee, it included a reference that the committee should ensure that Australian made goods were used wherever possible. The difficulty is that it will be very difficult in many instances to find goods that are truly fully Australian in both their content and manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To conclude, it is clear that, despite some of the reservations, the overwhelming feeling is that this legislation should be passed. As I mentioned earlier, the Australian Olympic Committee has been seeking protection such as this legislation for many years. It is on that basis that the Democrats will be supporting this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill 1993. Once again, this is a non-controversial piece of legislation and the opposition will be supporting its passage. The purpose of the bill is to make necessary amendments to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act to ensure that all competitors tested by ASDA under complementary state and territory legislation have access to the same appeals provision as those tested directly under the ASDA act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments will enable the states and territories to confer jurisdiction for review of decisions by ASDA on the Commonwealth Administration Appeals Tribunal or the Federal Court, even though athletes are being tested by ASDA under state or territory legislation. These amendments will also allow the name of a competitor tested under state legislation who has returned a positive test result or who has failed, without reasonable cause, to comply with a request by the agency to provide a sample and whose appeals have not been upheld, to be entered on the register of notifiable events established under the ASDA act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also include provision for the removal from the register of notifiable events the names of competitors who were tested under state legislation, which is consistent with those provisions applying to competitors tested directly under the ASDA act. While a number of state and territory governments have draft bills prepared, they cannot proceed until these amendments are completed. The opposition has one concern, I suppose, and that is that the states do not have comparable penalties. It is something that should probably be considered by the states. We will not be opposing the passage of this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats also welcome the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill. As we move towards the Olympic Games in Sydney in the year 2000, it is vital that Australia continues to play a leading role in the fight against drugs in sport. For this reason, the Democrats will be supporting this bill. To borrow a paragraph in the Australian Sports Drug Agency 1994 operational plan:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sport is about participation, performance, competition, and achievement. Above all, it's about building character and improving the health and well-being of the nation. Drugs to enhance physical performance undermine the essential values of all that sport is about.</PARA>
<PARA>With the eyes of the sporting world focusing on Australia over the next seven years, we must ensure that action is taken to try to stop the use of performance enhancing drugs. The Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill will assist the national approach to drug testing by providing athletes who have been tested under state or territory anti-drug legislation with access to the same channels of appeal as athletes tested under the Commonwealth act. In other words, all athletes will be treated equally in this respect. With state and territory legislation coming on stream soon that will mirror the Commonwealth legislation, this bill is certainly timely. It becomes necessary, following the agreement of states and territories, to introduce this complementary legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Sports Drug Agency has indicated to me that this coordinated approach will ensure that all athletes competing at international, national, or state levels will now be exposed to drug testing. It will also allow the agency to carry out more drug tests. It is hoped that this will provide an even greater deterrent against the use of performance enhancing drugs, as it will become increasingly difficult to avoid detection. Australia's strong anti-drugs policy should send a message to the sporting world that this country does not support the use of any drugs that enhance performance in sport. The Democrats support this legislation. </PARA>

I want to pick up a point that has been made. If we are trying to send a message to the community, and particularly to younger Australians, that we do not promote the use of performance enhancing drugs, that message has to be sent consistently and in a fair way, and the legislation ought to reflect the principle that no one competitor in a fair competition can be advantaged over the others.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I have much pleasure in speaking on the Australian Wheat Board annual report 1992-93. There will not be time to go fully into this report, so I will address just a few points. Firstly, I commend the Australian Wheat Board and the bulk handling authorities of Australia for the way they handled the near record Australian crop of 18 million tonnes in the season just finished. They did a phenomenal job considering the shorter time of the harvest. The section headed `Storage and handling' on page 11 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of its continuing commitment to cost reduction, the AWB continues to work closely with service providers to continue to disaggregate charges and link them more closely with the distribution services provided. Although some progress has been noted, further work is required.</PARA>
<PARA>I assure the Senate that there is a lot of further work required. As we do more and more segregation to take up the opportunity of getting a premium as low as $5, $10 or $15 per tonne for certain types of wheat that can be marked down, I believe that any premium paid to growers must reflect the costs, and included in that cost of segregation are the extra costs of handling and space. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might wonder why one sort of wheat should cost more to store than another. If I may briefly explain in the short time I have, it is because, if many types of wheat are segregated, one has a lot more space in one's silos; it is as simple as that. Making separate piles means a lot more airspace in the silos. To date, that has not been reflected in the premium returned to growers. So, if the premium for a certain type of wheat is only $5 per tonne, I can see most of that being taken up in extra handling and storage costs. The Wheat Board must address that matter fairly quickly because over the past season a record number of types have been segregated. This has been done for the valid reason that we have niche markets for these particular types of wheat, but the situation must be addressed because, after all, if it costs someone $10 extra to store something that attracts only a $5 premium, it is hardly worthwhile and, of course, it means that Australia's total storage capacity cannot be utilised to its fullest extent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a particular point with regard to Western Australia, bearing in mind that the costs of disaggregation are supposed to show up and be transparent. I was at a pastoralists and graziers conference in Perth when this matter came forward. People who know Western Australia will be aware that all the road deliveries of wheat to port go to the port of Fremantle, but it has been 10 or 15 years since loading for export was done at Fremantle; it is all loaded at Kwinana. After the road deliveries are made to Fremantle, the wheat is transported by rail to Kwinana, but that cost is not made known to growers. It is claimed to be commercial in confidence and the costs are spread over the growers of the whole state rather than being borne by those who deliver to Fremantle and get this advantage. CBH of Western Australia refused to answer my question on that matter; Westrail also refused to answer it; but sooner or later they will have to answer it&mdash;hopefully it will be pretty soon.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to follow Senator Panizza and take the opportunity of the tabling of the annual report of the Australian Wheat Board for 1992-93 to make a few comments about the future of wheat. Like Senator Panizza, I would like to congratulate the AWB on the way that it handled the record crop this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The linchpin to the future of this vital industry is the continuation of the established single desk selling policy for export. It is estimated that single desk selling, which is an advantage to the total Australian economy, is worth between $25 and $30 per tonne. The retention of single desk selling is paramount to Australian wheat growers. It allows the Australian Wheat Board to extract the top market premium for each stratum of the market and for each market. The successful outcome of the Uruguay Round of GATT after years of negotiations is positive news to the wheat industry and it represents an encouraging future in the long term. The main benefits will be the decrease in subsidised United States and European grain entering the world market. The export subsidies for these countries are to be reduced over time by more than 30 per cent&mdash;not a panacea but certainly a move in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ABARE has estimated that this will increase the value of wheat exports from Australia by about $250 million per year when the reductions are fully implemented over time. Even if these estimates are over-optimistic, we must be confident that the prospects of the industry have been improved. Australian farmers will still see rises and falls in the price of wheat, but now these fluctuations will be decided more by the laws of supply and demand than by the subsidy policies of the United States and the Europeans. The corruption of the market will be reduced, and that will be one less factor outside their control that Australian farmers will have to worry about. That problem will be eventually removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This change of direction is important for Australian wheat farmers as, over the past few years, while they have maintained their production of grain, their capital equipment has been running down. Good farmers need good equipment, and it will be a slow process to re-equip. But it has a greater chance of happening now. The Europeans, on the other hand, are much better capitalised with new equipment which will take a significant time to run down. Their potential to maintain production for an extended period of reduced returns is still very high. This could significantly delay the advantages to Australian grain growers. The EEC and the US have also been engaged in significant set-aside programs for their grain production. This has had the effect of taking a large acreage out of production and this land could quite easily enter production again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenge for wheat farmers now is how to react to the changing environment. Knowing Australian farmers as I do, I am sure they will equip themselves very well. The priorities of Australian governments, industry associations, unions and the community generally must be directed to trade access and international competitiveness if Australian employment needs and debt repayment targets are to be met. I commend the AWB on the job it has done this year. </PARA>

<PARA>I was particularly interested to read this report because I have made remarks in the past in relation to the new method of organisation within Australian defence to try to incorporate corporate structures within defence policy.

If it is a buyer's market in our region, I guess this kind of document tends to reflect that situation. For a start, it is, I guess, agreed that we currently are not making much money out of our efforts, but that tends to put more pressure on those who wish to make this kind of corporatisation work to use as their criteria of success how much we sell or are likely to sell. </PARA>

The fact that technology is being developed in Australia and sold both to the region and to other countries outside the region&mdash;possibly to countries which may be involved in conflicts in the future, and even in the present&mdash;is very worrying. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak very briefly on the current 24-hour rolling strike in the coal industry which commenced last night. The government has failed to address the underlying cause of the coal industry's problems, although Senator Collins acknowledged the stupidity of this industrial dispute in the Senate today. It is now time for the government, and especially the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Brereton, to outline a coal industry industrial relations reform package to provide a boost for this important industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coal is Australia's biggest single commodity export earner and represents one of the more advanced industries as far as technology is concerned. Ironically, however, the industrial relations system that rules the coal industry is outdated and inefficient. It is governed by its own industry specific industrial relations system which operates outside the current mainstream of industrial relations arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Coal Industry Tribunal is a one-man board which, in conjunction with the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission and other lesser tribunals in Queensland and Tasmania, acts with virtually the same powers as the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The tribunal came into existence in 1946 at a time when coal production was focused entirely on domestic consumption. It has no place, or very little place, in 1994. This industry has undergone dramatic changes, and the tribunal is still stuck somewhere back in the 1940s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of industrial disputes in the coal sector remains significantly above the national average. In 1988, which is a couple of years ago I know, the number of days lost to industrial disputes per 1,000 employees was 15,548. It is now 2,970 per 1,000 workers.

Before various companies used the section 45D remedies, and before injunctions requiring a return to work were issued, five days of production and $170 million worth of exports were lost, and a reputation of industrial instability was confirmed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As of last night the industry has again been thrown into a series of rolling stoppages, estimated to cost $1 million per hour, which is $24 million per day in lost production nationwide. This action particularly impacts on the Hunter Valley, an area that is economically crucial to this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make one thing clear. The current strike action cannot overturn the new contract arrangements which have been forced onto producers by shrinking demands from Japanese steel mills. This strike action only places jobs at risk and robs us of the opportunity to have mines maintain their labour forces at current levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalmining sector is further weakened by every strike such as this, and it makes it all the more difficult to keep up with cutthroat competition from countries such as Canada, which is setting the price on this occasion. Under the present coal sector industrial relations system, neither the industry nor the work force can fight these poor prices and foreign competitors, however upset they might be. Importantly, from an industry perspective, coal industry earnings have totally outstripped industry productivity growth. These sorts of trends kill coal producers, and this problem has stuck with the coal industry for a very long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only the coal companies that would benefit from the industry's antiquated industrial relations system being absorbed into the national industry; it would be all of us. The security of employment in the industry and future job growth would be enhanced. The Coal Industry Tribunal can do nothing to lock in labour productivity growth. The last three major studies of the coal industry&mdash;namely, the Hancock report of 1983, the Niland report of 1989 and the Industry Commission study of 1991&mdash;have all recommended that the Coal Industry Tribunal be abolished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This essential industry will be one that continues to drag us out of recession. It deserves an industrial relations system to match its national importance. In the meantime, the coal union should realise that its strike action is, regrettably, counterproductive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make a very brief comment in the light of Minister Ray's comments on the possible closing of the Nurrungar base in Australia. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> reported on 16 July 1993 that a defence department spokesperson said that Australia and the United States were committed to operating the Nurrungar satellite station for some time to come, that a new system&mdash;the follow-on early warning system&mdash;would replace its functions. Adding a word of caution, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> reported that the follow-on early warning system was unlikely to be operational this century and that funding was yet to be confirmed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But later, in October, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defense News</EMPHASIS> reported that, after 11 years of effort costing more than $US550 million, the laser link system is about to be trashed. Developed and built by McDonnell Douglas, the program was to replace the link-ups provided through ground stations by directly linking the satellites themselves. The link was initially requested by the US air force because it wanted freedom from relying on nations like Australia. Now it realises that this `freedom' will make the new defence support program missile warning satellites cost far too much for Pentagon budgets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Development and testing was supposedly completed in April 1984, and contracts worth $US380 million were given to build eight laser links. In September last year, a US air force spokesperson stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have since run into technical problems during production.</PARA>
<PARA>The laser devices are being delivered months after schedule,  are failing in testing and are being returned to McDonnell Douglas, which then has to announce to its shareholders that it lost $US11 million of its own funds spent on the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Well, can it ever happen? The US government has already wasted heaps of money on the failing program in a time when US voters are less warmed by huge military budgets. The technology does not exist yet. Probably the biggest crunch for the laser links is shareholder dissatisfaction, for without their capital and enthusiasm further development of a Nurrungar replacement will cease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are the minister's comments out of step with the realities of developing such an expensive and problem-ridden set of satellites? On what information does the minister base his comment, `I doubt it'&mdash;the Nurrungar base, that is&mdash;`will be there at the end of the century.'? Is it that the United States has decided that it no longer requires this kind of information gathering? We would like to think so. If that is the case, let us have further information about what decisions are made on our soil. If there is no basis to the comment, why was the comment made?</PARA>
