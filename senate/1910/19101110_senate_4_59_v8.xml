                        <para>- If such a motion is to be regarded as private business, and must take all the chances of private business in the ordinary way, our law with respect to the discussion of regulations he comes only so much waste paper. Since they can only be discussed by the good-will of Ministers, there should be some means under which any honorable senator, taking action within the law to raise the question whether regulations tabled under an Act of Parliament should have the force of law or not, might be able to have the question discussed as a matter of right. My_ contention is that this is really the business of the Senate, and not of a private member of the Senate, although it is business which a private member of the Senate must introduce. </para>

                    <para>This measure is introduced for the establishment of penny postage, and to bring about uniformity of postage on magazines and other printed matter throughout the Commonwealth. Honorable senators are aware that at present varying rates of postage are in force in the different States on letters, magazines, and mail matter generally. The continuance of these varying rates since the cessation of the bookkeeping system has become intolerable. It might be of interest to honorable senators to know to what extent postage rates vary in the different States. Dealing with ½-oz. letters, there is in New South Wales a penny rate on town letters, and a twopenny rate in the country. I find that in that State there are sixty penny postage areas, extending in most cases for a radius of  13  miles from the principal post-office. Included in these sixty postage areas there are  3, 131  post-offices. Letters passing between these post-offices bear only a penny rate. All letters posted or delivered outside of these areas must bear a rate of  2d.  In Victoria, as honorable senators are aware, there has been a penny rate throughout the State in operation for a considerable time. In Queensland there is a penny rate in the towns, and a twopenny country rate. In South Australia the rate is  2d.  for town and country. In Western Australia and Tasmania there is a town rate of1d., and a country rate of  2d.  The proposal now made by the Government is that throughout Australia there shall be a universal postage rate of1d. on½-oz. letters. </para>

Whilst the bookkeeping system was in operation, it was in a measure immaterial to the different States whether a profit or a loss resulted on the postage rates adopted. The revenue and expenditure were debited to each State, in accordance with the business done in each, the State making a profit on this business getting the benefit of it, and the State making a loss having to bear that loss. The bookkeeping system ceased to operate on the  30th  June last, and since that date the receipts from the different post-offices throughout the Commonwealth have been pooled. Honorable senators will recognise that it is a manifest injustice to States in which the higher rates of postage are imposed that their receipts from this source should be pooled with the receipts in Victoria, for instance, where the penny-postage rate has been in operation throughout the State for a considerable time, and where it has resulted in a loss even up to the present time. </para>

                            <para>- There are good and substantial reasons why it will not be possible to bring this proposal for universal penny postage into operation before the date named. It will be two or three weeks before this Bill can receive the Royal assent, and much work will be entailed in establishing this very much needed reform. It may be information to honorable senators to learn how, in the matter of postal business, the different States stood in the last financial year. I find that, in New South Wales, there was a profit of  £65,000;  in Victoria, a loss of  £27,600;  in Queensland, a loss of  , £49.500;  in South Australia, a profit of  £43,400;  in Western Australia, a loss of  £63,000  ; and in Tasmania, a profit of  £2,350. </para>

                            <para>- I shall endeavour to secure that information. There may be in the Senate, as there were in another place, some who are strongly opposed to the introduction of penny postage throughout the Commonwealth, and for the reasons which were advanced for the opposition to the proposal in another place. It was there contended that because the Post and Telegraph Department, as a public institution, is not in as satisfactory a condition as we could desire, and that in some of the States some employes of the Department are not receiving adequate remuneration for the services they perform, this proposal for universal penny postage is premature. I think that this measure should be considered altogether apart from the industrial conditions of the employes in the Commonwealth Public Service. When we let contracts for public works, and specify that certain industrial conditions shall be observed, we do not inquire whether the works will pay or will result in a loss, and when we decided that no man or woman in the Commonwealth service should receive less than <inline font-style="italic">£110</inline> a year, we did not take into consideration the receipts * and expenditure of the different Departments in which this regulation was to be made operative. There are some persons who will be found to be opposed to every proposal for the cheapening of postal facilities, and of opinion that it should not be proceeded with, because cheaper postage rates will be a concession to a small section of the community. But I am one of those who believe that, no matter what the postage charges may be, the expense has ultimately to be borne by the general community. </para>

In my opinion, postal charges are passed on. But if they are not, is it not manifestly unfair to allow the merchant or trader in Victoria to be advantaged by having penny postage within this State, and by being enabled to send printed matter through the post at a charge of Jd. for 2 ounces, whilst the merchant or trader in other States is obliged to pay a much higher rate, not only upon his letters, but also upon his printed matter? </para>

But the business man in Victoria enjoys a distinct advantage over the business man in any other part of Australia, whilst the business man in New South Wales possesses an advantage over the business man in any part of Australia other than Victoria. This condition of things ought not to be continued a moment longer than is unavoidable. The great bulk of the correspondence of business men consists of printed circulars. The introduction of penny postage will confer a very great benefit upon thousands of citizens who are not engaged in any business enterprise. There are thousands of men who are working in the country some distance from their residences and from their families. Assuming that they write only one letter a week each to their homes, and that a reply is forwarded to it, this reform will mean a saving to each family of 8s. 8d. per year. </para>

                            <para>- There are four courses open to us as alternatives to this proposal. We might have an Intra-State rate ot id., and an Inter-State rate of 2d. That is to say, we might have penny postage within a State ana a twopenny rate outside of it. Or we might have a uniform twopenny rate throughout the Commonwealth. But if we adopted that uniform rate, Victoria, which has enjoyed penny postage for a considerable period, would have to pay an increased charge. </para>

                            <para>- South Australia is the only State which has a twopenny rate. To adopt that rate uniformly throughout the Commonwealth we should have, not merely to lift Victoria up to her level, but also Queensland, Western Australia, and New South Wales, so far as their metropolitan areas are concerned. Another course open to us is to leave things as they are. </para>

                            <para>- No, it can be accomplished by regulation. It may be interesting to honorable senators to know how the approximate loss which I have stated has been arrived at. It is anticipated that upon Intra-State postage in New South Wales there will be a loss of  £157,000  during the first year, that upon her InterState correspondence the loss will be  £27,000,  and that upon her correspondence beyond the Commonwealth the loss will be  £23,000,  making a total loss of  £207,000.  In Victoria there will not be any loss so far as the Intra-State postage is concerned, but there will be a loss of  £22,000  upon her Inter-State correspondence, and a loss of  £19,000  upon her postage beyond the Commonwealth, or a total loss of  £41,000. </para>

                            <para>- Last year Victoria made a loss of  £27,000  in that connexion. In Queensland the loss within the State wilt be  , £48,000,  the Inter-State loss will be £11,000, and the loss in respect of cor- respondence beyond the Commonwealth will be  £2,000,  or a total loss of  £61,000.  The loss on Intra-State postage in South Australia will be  £37,000,  that upon InterState correspondence will be  £5,000,  and' that upon letters beyond the Commonwealth will be  £2,000,  or a total loss of.  £44.000.  The loss upon Intra- State postage in Western Australia will be  £23,000,  that upon Inter- State correspondence will be  £6,000,  and that upon correspondence beyond the Commonwealth will be  £2,000, or  a total loss of  £31,000.  In Tasmania  the loss upon Intra- State postage will be  £ 10,000,  that upon Inter-State correspondence will be £4,000, and that upon correspondence beyond the Commonwealth will be  £2,000,  or a total loss of  £16,000.  The additional loss which is anticipated when the system of penny postage is extended to other portions of the Empire is as follows :  - The United Kingdom, Egypt, and India, £38,500; New Zealand,  £10,000;  South Africa,  £1,000;  and Canada,  £500.  The history of penny postage in different parts of the world is extremely interesting. The United Kingdom has penny postage, and the returns available show that more letters per head of the population are posted there than in any other part of the world. </para>

                            <para>- I am given to understand that the Department makes a very extensive profit, that enables the Government to carry on works which are necessary in the interests of the people. New Zealand also has this system. There has been a considerable increase in the volume of postal business, and in the case of some firms the amount paid for stamps is higher than was the case when double the price was charged. In Victoria, it was anticipated that the proposed reduction in the postal rate would involve such a heavy loss that the Government would be forced, in the course of time, to revert to the old rate. But the introduction of penny postage brought a huge increase in the volume of business in the State. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. If I remember aright, within a very short time there was very little difference between the revenue at the higher rate and the revenue at the reduced rate. Although it meant a considerable increase in the volume of postal matter, the additional expenditure by the Department was infinitesimal, because I understand that only about twenty additional hands were employed in consequence of the reduction. I do not want to weary honorable senators, but to those who may be disposed to object to this reform, if there be any here, I wish to point out that from time to time we have made reductions in telegraph charges, and given concessions in different directions, so far as postal services are concerned. Since the inauguration of the Commonwealth we have made the following concessions in rates and charges - </para>

                            <para>- Within the Commonwealth to-day a person can send a telegram containing sixteen words 4,000 miles for a shilling. In what other part of the world are similar facilities given? Not-' withstanding these concessions, totalling £127,000, the revenue of the Postal Department shows an increase almost every  year since they were made. I do not propose to quote the revenue for each year, but merely the revenue for 1901 and 1910. In 1901 the receipts in the postal branch were £1,567,254, and in 1910 £2,548,403. In 1901 the receipts in the telegraph branch were £602,438, and in 1910 £671,959. In 1901 the receipts in the telephone branch were .£218,715, and in 1910 £509,532. In 1901 the total receipts from postal, telegraph, and telephone services amounted to £2,388,407. and in 1910 £3,729,894, showing a considerable increase in the volume of business in the different branches. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has asked me if I can state the number of letters per head of the population, and the increase in the volume of business since the- introduction of penny .postage in Victoria. In 1900 a twopenny rate was operative in the State, and according to the statement I have, the number of letters posted <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> in that year was 52.08, and in 1908 82.35. For the nine months of the first year in which the reduced rate was operative, the increase <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> was 6.61, or an increase of 12 per cent, over the number for the preceding year. In the second year the increase per head was 11.77, or 20.05 per cent, over the increase for the first year, dr an increase <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> of 18.38, or 35.2 per cent., over the number of letters posted in the last year when the twopenny rate was in force. In short, the volume of business had increased by one-third within that time. </para>

                            <para>- I have given the figures for 1908, and there are no later figures available. This Bill also alters the charges on books and magazines. An advantage is given to books, booklets, and magazines which are printed in Australia, as against similar publications printed outside. No good Protectionist can object to that proposal. It means that encouragement will be given to Australian writers, artists, printers, and bookbinders. For many years enterprising firms have made vigorous efforts, in different parts of the Commonwealth, to successfully establish magazines. They have been greatly handicapped. They are confronted with very heavy disabilities. I think that every encouragement should be given to the production of an Australian article, whether it be a magazine, a book, or a booklet. I am one of those who believe that in Australia we have writers and artists who will compare favorably with the writers and artists who are to be met with in any part of the civilized world. Australian writers, and artists who have left the land of their birth and gone abroad, have won name and fame for themselves. Moreover, as a printer, I may naturally be expected to maintain that as a matter of fact we are able to produce in Australia books, magazines, and other publications that will compare favorably with productions emanating from any part of the world. For these reasons, I strongly urge the Senate to give the advantage proposed by this Bill to Australian publications. It is not necessary for me to occupy the time of honorable senators at any greater length. If I have omitted to make clear any point, or have failed to give any information that is required or is necessary in connexion with the Bill, I shall be only too glad to furnish it in reply. By way of closing my remarks, I wish to say that I am satisfied that the Bill, if not carried unanimously in the Senate - as I hope it will be - will, at all events, be carried by a substantial majority ; and I am confident that when it becomes law it will mean, not as some honorable senators imagine, an advantage to a small coterie of individuals, but a distinct benefit, not only to the business community, but to every citizen of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- - There is one reflection that appeals at once to my mind in considering this Bill. As the Minister has pointed out, we have at present different postage rates for similar services in different States ; and it is obvious that, in carrying out what we intend to be the full effect of Federation, there must be uniformity in respect to those rates. The question is. therefore, whether we are to level down to the low rates which prevail in one State, or level up to the higher rates which prevail in the other States. </para>

                            <para>- We might, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> suggests, make the postage rate 1½d. But I dismiss that suggestion, even though I respect its origin, because the very denomination1½d., for which we have no single coin, prevents the suggestion from receiving serious consideration. The only question, then, is whether we are to adopt the rate which prevails in Victoria, or are to increase the Victorian rate to that which prevails in other States. To my mind, it would be to make a retrogressive step to raise the Victorian rate to uniformity with that prevailing in other States. That being so, there is but one thing to do. If we want a uniform rate at all, we must give the whole Commonwealth the benefit of the low rate which at present prevails in one State. But, having said that, I find myself in conflict with the Minister and with those responsible for this Bill. I asked the Minister why the Government propose to delay conferring the benefits of the measure until April next?  His  answer strikes me as being entirely insufficient and unsatisfactory. He frankly admitted that the present condition of affairs represents a manifest injustice; and he went on to say - I quite agree with him there - that while it is true that different rates were just enough, under the old bookkeeping system, according to which a State in which there were low rates carried its loss on its own shoulders, the people receiving the benefit while the Treasury lost revenue - just as the New South Wales Treasury received the benefit of their higher rate - nevertheless, it is manifestly unjust, when we are abolishing the bookkeeping system, and are having a common purse, that there should be different rates in different States. I do not use that as an argument against this Bill, but it is a fair argument to use against delay in bringing the Bill into operation. </para>

                            <para>- It is not a question of work for us to do. It is simply a question of when this Bill can be brought into operation. There will be no more work for the Senate to do if the Bill is brought into operation on 1st January instead of on 1st April. There may be more work for the Post and Telegraph Department to do; but I see nothing in that to justify the delay. </para>

                            <para>- But the same Public Service Act remains in force, whether the Post Office employs 500 men or fifty. There is, in my opinion, no justification for the delay, and the only reason for it that I can see is a Treasury reason. The Minister has intimated that there will probably be a loss of revenue as the result of adopting penny postage. The object of putting off the operation of this Bill until April, therefore, is to make that loss during the present financial year as small as possible. That reason may be a satisfactory one from the stand-point of the Treasury, but it is not treating fairly the larger number of States in the Union. There is another aspect of the case. It is possible that there will be a tendency in the Post and Telegraph Department to refuse facilities as the result of the diminished revenue. To my mind, it seems absolutely clear that that is what will happen. At present it is extremely difficult to obtain postal and telegraphic facilities for country districts. When an application is made for them we are frequently told that the Department "cannot afford it." If that be the case before the Department loses an additional£400,000 per annum, surely the argument will be brought forward with greater force when there is that additional loss of £400,000 upon the working of the Department. </para>

                            <para>- No; it seems to me to be unthinkable that we should take a backward step. In my opinion, what I have stated will be the immediate effect of this Bill. The Department, as we all know, when we ask for facilities for country districts, generally meets us with the stereotyped reply that "The service does not warrant it, and the Department cannot afford it. " Does any one think that when the Department is called upon to shoulder an additional loss of £400,000 it will weaken in its attitude towards country applications ? Is it not as clear as the noonday sun - not the noonday sun in Melbourne, but in those States where we see the sun - that honorable senators will get that reply more frequently and with greater emphasis than hitherto? That, however, is one of the drawbacks to the Bill which  1  willingly face for the reason that I do not believe that the loss will be permanent. I regret that the Minister has not given the Senate the information which I sought to obtain by way of interjection as to the loss entailed in Victoria when the penny letter rate was adopted. </para>

                            <para>- I was not aware of that. If, however, such be the fact, it would be very useful information for the Senate if we could, have presented to us a statement as to what the Victorian figures were, and as to what the reduction of revenue from the adoption of the penny rate amounted to. As far as I know, the position is this : The Victorian revenue was considerably diminished in the first year after the adoption of the penny rate, but as time went on the loss gradually decreased and the revenue recovered itself. I should like to be able to compare the Estimates presented to Parliament when the penny rate was proposed with the figures of the actual loss. I have no. great faith in these estimates ; not that I wish to cast any doubt upon the officials or upon the Department, but it seems to me to be quite beyond the compass of any one in the Department to know what effect is going to be produced upon the commercial and social life of this country by such a change. </para>

                            <para>- All that we can go upon is the common knowledge that when you reduce the cost of anything people are inclined to use it more freely. The reflection that that is so brings considerable comfort to my mind in connexion with this measure. Believing that we cannot increase the rate in Victoria, and must reduce it in other States, I am prepared to take the plunge in the belief that by-and-by - and before long - the expansion in post-office business will make up the loss with which we shall be confronted in the early days. There is another matter closely associated with that with which I have been dealing; and that is as to whether or not the Bill would be likely to have any effect upon the employes of the Department. I do not believe for a moment that it will. Parliament itself has always taken under its charge the regulations affecting persons employed in the Public Service. I do not think that whether the Postal Department makes a profit or a loss, that fact will affect the judgment of Parliament as to what constitutes fair wages and conditions for those employed in the Department. The figures which the Minister has supplied give us no guide as to the financial results of this proposal. The honorable senator has supplied an estimate of the probable loss of revenue, but he has said nothing of the increased expenditure which will be consequent upon the increased ' volume of business. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator said that twenty additional hands would be required, forgetting that that disposed of his argument that a great deal of preliminary work would need to be undertaken before the new system could be introduced. Though I have not the advantage possessed by the Minister of being able to confer with the officers of the Department, I can say that if our anticipations are realized, a considerable increase in the volume of business must result from the reduction of the rates of postage, and must involve a  considerable increase in the expenditure of the Department. I assume that the estimated loss of ,£400,000 has reference only to the loss of revenue to be anticipated, and takes no account of the increase of expenditure. To that extent it is a partial and misleading estimate. The Minister gave us some figures showing the profits and losses made at present in the various States from the operations of the Postal Department. I am sure the honorable senator did not put them forward with the intention of misleading the Senate, but there can be no doubt that they were absolutely misleading. So far as I could understand them the figures quoted represent a profit or loss, taking into account the total revenue and expenditure of the Department in the respective States. But it must be remembered that the expenditure account covers the cost of public works carried out by the Department. It would be easy for a State to show a profit this year when the expenditure upon new post-offices and other departmental buildings might be very small, and next year to show a very considerable loss, because there might be greater activity in the erection of new buildings. While the expenditure covers the building account, such figures as the Minister has presented represent nothing as a business statement. We were told, for instance, that New South Wales made a profit in this Department last year, of £65,000. But we know that the building account in that State last year was very low. It is quite possible that in other States in which a loss was shown last year, it did not represent a loss of revenue on postal matter, but was due to increased expenditure in those States on buildings and improvements in connexion "with the Postal Department. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable senator that it is a most unbusinesslike proceeding to mix up the capital account with the ordinary trading account. Until these accounts are separated it will be impossible for any one to say whether the postal business in any State pays or does not pay. A suggestion has been made in this Chamber as well as outside, that we should establish this reform by stages. It is proposed that we should first of all establish penny postage within each State, leaving the expansion of the system to the Commonwealth until a later date. I direct the attention of honorable senators to the figures with which we have been supplied, and ask them to say whether, if we intend to make this change at all, it is well to make two bites at the cherry. It is estimated that the loss upon the establishment of penny postage within the boundaries of each of the States would amount to £275,000, and that for an additional £75,000 we might establish the system throughout Australia. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> am satisfied that if we pass the measure to establish penny postage within the States only, the Governor-General's consent to the measure would hardly be obtained before there would be an .agitation for its repeal, and the introduction of a measure to secure the larger reform. The fact that a man would be able to send a letter from the Queensland border of New South Wales to the Gulf of Carpentaria for one penny, whilst another would have to pay twopence to send a letter from Wodonga to Albury, would at once indicate the absurdity of the proposal. Where we are dealing with a Federal Department we might as well at once recognise that all State boundaries must disappear. In the same way, if the loss upon the establishment of penny postage throughout the Commonwealth would be £350,000 per year, and for another £50,000 we might secure universal penny postage, I think we should decide to do so. It is clear that if we adopted the system partially to-day we should, before many months passed, be asked to pass a measure establishing the larger reform. Seeing that Great Britain sends us letters for a penny, it would not be long before a demand for reciprocity would be made, and we might as well face the whole reform at once. I congratulate the Government upon being the fortunate possessors of Ministerial responsibility at a time when the financial circumstances of the Commonwealth permit of the introduction of this measure. This is a proposal for which they cannot, and I think do not, claim any credit. It was mooted long before the present Government occupied the Treasury bench, but when previously suggested it was recognised that the financial straits in which the Commonwealth was then placed, absolutely prevented its adoption with any prospect of success. </para>

                            <para>- The Constitution has run its course, and the operation of the  bookkeeping system and the Braddon section have ceased. To-day the Commonwealth is placed in a position of greater financial freedom, and, as a result, the present Government find it possible to do what no previous Government could attempt. While I congratulate the Government upon having their name associated with the measure, I think it is only right to point out that they are making this proposal to-day because our financial circumstances permit of it, and that those who have preceded them were quite as alive to its advantages, but were restrained by reason of the fact that the Constitution placed such limitations upon the financial resources of the Commonwealth that it was not possible in their time to do what, under the greater measure of financial freedom enjoyed by the present Government, can be done, and may, I think, be done with advantage. </para>

                            <para>- There are very good reasons for that. Personally, I should prefer to see it held back to a much later date. Here we have a reform which in other countries it has taken generations to effect. We have a Labour Government in power, and although this Bill was foreshadowed within a few minutes after they assumed office, and is submitted within the first five months of their term of office, we have the Leader of the Opposition complaining. </para>

                            <para>- I have said there are very good reasons for the delay. We must consider the difference which it must make in the working of the Department. Honorable senators must recognise that wc cannot expect, with the same staff, to be able to handle a volume of business, perhaps, one-third greater than the volume of business at present being handled by the Postal Department. There must be alterations, also, in connexion with our contracts for the carriage of mails, and - to use a word which we frequently heard from an honorable gentleman who is no longer a member of the Senate - in connexion with the various " ramifications " of this service, involved in the proposed change. I am rather afraid that those who will be responsible for putting this system into operation will find the time between now and April next too limited to enable them to make the necessary arrangements. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator would not say that if he knew the conditions under which contractors for the carriage of our mails are at present working, and the great increase in the volume of work done by the Parcels Post Branch. I think that any complaint on the ground that this change should be brought into operation sooner than is proposed is altogether unreasonable. In my opinion, the officers of the Department are taking upon themselves a task which I have grave doubt that they will be able to carry out. I hope they will' be able to bring this scheme into operation in April, but I think they have, to some extent, overlooked the difficulty which must be faced' in coping with the increased volume of business which may be expected to follow from the introduction of this reform. I need only refer honorable senators to the statements appearing in the newspapers from day to day to re: mind them that there is, for lack of space to carry out the work, a state of confusion in all the metropolitan post-offices of Australia. Mail matter is coming in in such volume under existing conditions that the facilities afforded in the metropolitan post-offices are not sufficient to enable the staff to cope with the business. What are we going to do when the volume of business is increased? I have doubts that we shall be able to provide the increased facilities necessary. If penny postage is to be a success, the post-offices in the larger centres of population throughout Australia will require radical alterations. I can see that in future we shall have to adopt some means to divide our postal work, and we shall have, sooner or later, to direct our attention to an alteration in the system at present adopted of bringing heavy mail matter into the heart of the city, and at a distance from our principal railway stations, to be there handled. </para>

                            <para>- I have not to shoulder as much responsibility in this matter as have my honorable friends on my left. But my position, as Government Whip, will not prevent me from speaking my mind whenever I think that the Ministry are acting unwisely. In my opinion, they are taking a false step now. I have already referred to the difficulty that will be experienced by the Department in handling a larger volume of mail matter than it handles to-day. </para>

For many years the Postal Department has occupied a very unfortunate position, from a financial stand-point. It has occupied that position ever, since this Parliament reduced the telegraph and telephone rates to a point at which it was impossible for them to pay expenses. </para>

I recognise that it is extremely difficult for anybody to. put his finger on the precise spot where these deficits occur. But we can shrewdly guess the reason for those deficits. We know that no allowance has been made for quite a number of matters for which an allowance should be made. For instance, what has been allowed for the depreciation of buildings ? Nor has there been anything allowed for interest on the six millions invested. </para>

But we have good reason to believe that it is principally confined to the telegraph and telephone branches of the service. The only branch which is a success financially is the mail branch. Yet it is now proposed to deprive that branch of  50  per cent. of its income. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, the reduction which is proposed is too great to be justified at the present time. I quite recognise that something must be done to remedy the existing condition of affairs. But that does not warrant us in reducing the income of the Postal Department, and in starving it, in order that we may gain a little cheap popularity. In seeking to introduce the system of penny postage at this juncture, the Government are taking a false step. The Postal Department ought to be made to pay its way. It is not by any means a taxation Department. It renders a distinct service to the community. </para>

Similar results will follow the attempt to level down our postal rates to those which followed the levelling down of our telephone and telegraph rates several years ago. In these circumstances, ought we not to pause? It is all very well to say that penny postage is a Democratic system, but I confess that I have not met the individual who is so poor that he cannot afford to pay  2d.  postage upon a letter. </para>

                            <para>- Let us consider the effect of a reduced rate on the back- block services. Hitherto, whenever a new service for the back parts of the Commonwealth has been asked for, what has invariably been the answer? It has been, " How much will it cost, and will it pay?" It is positive cruelty to give a scant postal service to the men who live on the fringe of civilization - the best citizens in the Commonwealth who require better mail services. With regard to applications for new services, what has been our experience? Whenever we have approached the Department with a request, we have been told that the proposed service would not pay. If the postage rate is reduced, where will the Department get revenue from ? </para>

At any rate, they will get the lion's share of the benefit of this so-called Democratic reform.  1  did not intend to speak to-day. I should have liked a better opportunity to go through the evidence, and point out that the Government are about to take a step in the wrong direction. I recognise that the Bill is going to be carried; but I think that I should fail in my duty if I allowed a false step to be taken by the Department without entering a protest. I think it will be found that the difficulties which it has had in the past in extending postal services in the back parts will be accentuated. Persons in those localities will suffer in a much greater degree than will city people, and for that reason I protest against the proposed reduction. </para>

If there is one Department which ought to be conducted on commercial lines, it is the Postal Department. Whether it carries a letter or conveys a message, it performs a service for an individual, who ought to pay a reasonable fee. It is foolish to render that service at less than cost price. The Department has been run long enough on that idiotic principle, and the further it has gone, the deeper it has got into the bog. It is about to take a longer jump; but before very many years have passed over our heads, we shall regret the introduction of penny postage. </para>

                            <para>- Here is King Charles's head again. It is supposed that penny postage will involve a loss of £400,000 a year. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has pointed out that some things have not yet been charged against the Department. The Commonwealth has taken over State properties valued at £10,000,000. A good proportion of that sum is represented by post-offices. We have not yet debited the Postal Department with its proportion of the interest on the cost of transferred buildings. That would increase the nominal loss, if it is to be called nominal, by a considerable sum. What does an annual loss of £400.000 mean in regard to interest ? If we were to borrow money at per cent, that sum would pay the annual interest on £11,427,000. The Commonwealth is about to take over the Northern Territory and to construct a transcontinental railyway. These two projects alone will involve a cost not far short of £13,000,000. How are we to pay the interest on that sum ? It seems to me that this estimated annual loss of £400,000 on the Postal Department ought to be saved to enable the Commonwealth to pay interest on the large amount which will have to be expended in connexion with the Federal Capital, the Northern Territory, and railway construction. I do not wish to charge the present Government any more than the previous Government with extravagance, but now that we have gone in for these necessarily large outlays we have a. right to know where we are to find the money to pay the interest. It seems to me that this £400,000 could be employed much better in paying interest on the debt which will have to be incurred than in being simply given away, because, after all, every person who uses the Post Office gets very fair value for the payment he makes.  1  admit that there are a great many awkward cases. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> for instance, referred to the case of border towns. Surely that is a matter which can be arranged. If there is no difference in the postage for, say, 15 miles on each side of the border, could not that part be treated as if. it were in the interior of a State ? I am rather in favour of the principle of uniform postage, but I do not think that the time has come for its introduction. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so. The Department will, I hope, be able to pay its way. We have read a good deal about " frenzied finance" in America. I consider that we are going in for the same thing. But where is the income to come from? If we were to borrow money at 3 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> per cent., this £400,000 would pay the interest on £11,427,000; at 3^ per cent, it would pay the interest on £12,300,000, and at 3 per cent, it would pay the interest on £13,300,000. We must recognise that in time we shall have to go into debt to pay for these services. I repeat the question : Where is the income to come from ? I recognise, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, that we shall have to submit to the inevitable. But, as a man who has a little knowledge of business matters, I contend that it is unbusinesslike to throw away an income of approximately £400,000 without seeing where you are going to get an equivalent from. It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> to say, " Let the land provide the money." He is always talking on that subject; it is his forte. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that this is a popular proposal, but we are here to do what is right in the interests of the whole community. -We shall be paying the Postal Commission a very poor compliment, after all the trouble they have taken to investigate the affairs of the Department, if we do not take advantage of the information which they have furnished. The Post Office ought to be debited with its proportion of the interest on transferred properties. At some time or other £350,000 a year will have to be paid, and the question is whether we ought not to pay back interest, too, to the States. I am afraid that when the Department comes to pay its share of the interest on transferred buildings, the annual loss will be at least £500,000. </para>

                        <para>. - I am impelled to the conclusion that the genial personality of the Postmaster-General prevailed over the sounder judgment of the majority of his colleagues when this proposal was brought forward. We are faced with the undeniable fact that for two years a Royal Commission has been sitting at a cost of I do not know how many thousands of pounds. I am not for a moment saying that the cost was too great for the work done. The Commission travelled in every State, lt held 120 meetings, and has only recently ceased its long and arduous labours, the result of which is the report that has been presented to Parliament. But in the face of the recommendations contained in that report, the Government, overcome by the genial personality and the persuasive powers of the Postmaster-General, have brought down proposals which find no place in the recommendations of a Commission which has inquired most exhaustively into the working of the Post and Telegraph Department. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so; but, at all events, the Government should have taken the responsibility. As an alternative to levelling up or levelling down they could have adopted the recommendation of the Royal Commission, instituting penny postage within each State and making the rate 2d. on letters posted from one State to another. I noticed that certain information was absent from the figures quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> relative to the difference in cost between Inter-State penny postage and postage within a Stale. Figures on that subject were, however, quoted elsewhere by a member of the Postal Commission. </para>

                            <para>- If the reduction of postage within each State to id. would only mean a difference of £75,000, it does not seem worth while to take <inline font-style="italic">two bites</inline> at a cherry instead of one. But, even so, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, who was a member of the Postal Commission, has plainly stated that he believes that the loss will be far greater than the estimate, and that the difference between the two steps in the reform will be much greater than the Department has reckoned. The Minister has said that there is but one alternative before us, and that if we cannot put the Victorian rate up to 2d. we must bring down the rate in the other States to id. But if that argument is valid, the logical conclusion is that we should have free postage altogether. We should do one thing or the other. If we are going to make this service self-supporting the proposal of the Government is utterly absurd, because we know perfectly well - and the Postal Commission's report proves this statement - that the service to-day is by no means what it ought to be. If one goes to the postal officials to ask for facilities for country districts, they will say, " We cannot afford it." Ask them for a little better pay for the letter-carriers - men who are occupying most responsible positions, carrying letters containing valuable documents, who have to be honest and reliable, and who are working at salaries so low that even after half a lifetime they do not get more than £156 a year - and again the reply is, " We cannot afford it." There are recommendations in the Royal Commission's report to the effect that the letter-carriers should be given better pay, or, at any rate, should be able to rise to the salary of £156 at an earlier date than they can do under the present regulations. But the head of the Department and the Postmaster-General say, " It cannot be done." The answer is always the same when any reform is asked for. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly ; but. while  1  have not much sympathy with the cry of the higher-paid officers that they are not fairly dealt with, I believe that there ls a good deal of justice in the cry of the lower-paid officers in the postal service, that they should receive better salaries than they are being paid to-day. Whenever a question is raised of getting improved facilities for people living on the fringe of civilization, or better pay for the officers, we are met with the same reply from the Department, " We must make the service pay ; it is a business concern, and we ought to run it on business lines." But that reply is utterly and absurdly inconsistent with the attitude of the Postmaster-General in bringing down this proposal for penny postage. </para>

But to compare a closely-settled country with Australia, which has vast areas and distances over which postal matter has to be carried, is utterly absurd. </para>

The geographical differences are too great; and the cost cannot be for a moment compared. The chief argument used by the Minister in his appeal to honorable senators, however, and it was also the main argument of the Postmaster-General, was this : He said that this Bill is going to confer great benefits upon the people. Whom is it going to benefit? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> must be aware that 75 per cent, of the taxpayers of Australia will not be advantaged or benefited to the tune of, perhaps, more than 2d. or 3d. per week. </para>

                            <para>- I candidly admit that that is a reason why I am not justified in voting for this proposal. But I do not say so in the way in which the honorable senator takes the point. I do not say that that is the " sting " of the proposal. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger will admit that there is no class feeling in the argument when I say that, as the loss must fall upon the whole people of Australia, it is not fair to ask the man who is going to be benefited to a trifling extent to bear the same proportion of the burden as the man who is going to be benefited to a great degree. The Minister argued that the proposal is going to be of great benefit to all the people of Australia. I think that an ounce of experience is worth a ton of theory in this matter.  1  will, therefore, take my own experience. As a man who was not engaged in a business, but working for a fairly good salary, I found that I wrote on an average three letters a week, and my expense for postage was, therefore, 6d. per week. Immediately I left my former occupation and went into a small business the number of letters I found it necessary to write averaged ten a day, and if penny postage had been established my saving would have been 10d.  per day, or 5s. per week. One does not care to obtrude one's personal experience, but by doing so I have been able to present a concrete case and to state facts. I contend that my experience will be probably that of nearly every person in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing of the kind. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> could show me that the Post and Telegraph Department is in a position to do what it ought to do and still establish this reform, I should not complain.  1  should say, " This is a reform for which many people are asking, and we can afford to bring it about." But the fact remains that the Department is not paying, and we are being asked by the Government to consent to a proposal which" will add £500.000 a year to the present annual loss on the working of it, and they know that it will not be for the benefit of the bulk of the taxpayers of Australia. I ask honorable senators to consider the list of their acquaintances, and say how many, letters they are likely to send in a week. How many letters per week are sent through the post by an average householder in Australia? We know that the average wage-earner does not send through the post more than two or three letters a week. IT he sends three letters per week, on each of which he has now to pay 2d., he will save 3d. per week under this proposal. Every member of this Senate will, I am sure, admit that business men in the Commonwealth will, under this proposal, save anything from 5s. up to several pounds per week. I repeat that I should not object to that if the service were self-supporting. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator has become very innocent since he joined the Ministry. We can forgive him, perhaps, for that, but he knows a little more than he professes to know. After years of labour, the Postal Commission, at a cost of thousands of pounds, has supplied us with a report on the working of the Post and Telegraph Department. Apparently, the present Government propose to ignore that report. It would have been more fair to the Commission, the Parliament, and the country if they had decided to deal with this question when they proposed to deal with the various recommendations of the Commission. Of what use is it for Parliament to appoint a Commission to inquire, at enormous cost to the taxpayers, into the working of the Department if their report is not to be acted upon? I admit that there has not been time to act upon the report this session, as we have only just received it. I believe that, at the earliest possible moment, and perhaps this session, the Government will be prepared to take some action upon it ; but I complain that they should have picked out one subject, and have proposed a startling and radical reform, before they have had time to consider the whole of the Postal Commission's report. The Commission has recommended that there should be penny postage within each State, and that the Inter-State postage should be  2d. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, as a member of the Commission, has told us that the loss which would follow upon the adoption of that proposal would be nothing like the loss which must follow the adoption of the proposal brought forward by the Government. Ministers have told us that the difference between the loss upon the adoption of penny postage throughout the Commonwealth and the adoption of penny postage within each State would not amount to more than  £75,000,  and I suppose we must accept their figures. </para>

                            <para>- I am disposed to attach great weight to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, who was a member of the Postal Commission. At all events, we have the admission from the Government that the loss to be anticipated under this proposal is  £400,000  a year. That would be reduced by  £75,000  a year by the adoption of. the recommendation of the Postal Commission. We have been told that we cannot continue existing conditions, and I admit that there is a difficulty to be overcome. It is true that under the existing system the other States are called upon to bear a share of the loss on penny postage in Victoria. I admit that they have some ground of complaint in that, and are justified in asking for the adoption of a uniform system of postage. But I contend that it would have been" better if the Government had had die courage to raise the postage in Victoria to  2d.,  as in the other States, rather than submit a proposal which must involve a loss of  £400,000  a year. It has to be remembered that the estimated loss of  £400,000  does not take into account' the extra cost of working the penny-postage system. It will be remembered that when we reduced the cost of telegrams it led to an increase in the telegraphic business, and an increase in the cost of working the telegraphic service, and we know that the adoption of this proposal, by increasing the volume of postal business, must increase the cost of "working the Department. </para>

                            <para>- Either we should make the Department pay its way or else we should initiate the system of free postage. I know from actual experience -despite the interjections of Ministers - that if at any time within the next few months the Postal Department were approached with a request that increased facilities should be provided for the people, its reply would be that it would have to be shown that the work would prove remunerative. What was the reply given by the Postmaster-General, who is under the impression that he will immortalize himself as the author of penny postage in Australia- </para>

However, I recognise that the Ministry have not been sufficiently long in office to enable them to introduce urgently-required reforms there. But I have been asked by the Vice-President of the Executive Council why I say that the Commonwealth cannot afford to pay for penny postage at the present juncture. I would remind the honorable gentleman that when I requested the Postmaster-General to supplement the expenditure which the Tasmanian" Government was willing to incur, by .£1,500, in order that a telephone might be installed in a place where it is absolutely required, I was told that because no revenue would be derived from the work, the request could not be entertained. </para>

                            <para>- I am pretty good tempered, and I submit to many interruptions, but I think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council ought to restrain himself a little bit. Nobody who has approached the Postmaster-General with a request that this money should be provided has ever suggested that the work would return a revenue. But it has been shown that it is a work which should be undertaken by the Postal Department, at any rate in conjunction with the Tasmanian Government. But the only replY vouchsafed has been that ro revenue would be derived from it. </para>

                            <para>- That interjection is unworthy of the Honorary Minister. He really ought to endeavour to treat this matter with some degree of seriousness. In answering statements, he ought not to fall into the same habit as the Postmaster-General. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> _ must know that the Tasmanian Government proposed to erect a building at this particular place, and to station a man there to look after it. But simply because no telephone messages would be sent from this locality by the public, the work is not to be undertaken. That is absolute proof of the justice of my contention that the Department would reply to any similar request, " We cannot afford it; the Department must be made to pay." </para>

                            <para>- It is only since the advent of Federation that its necessity has become so apparent. The Postmaster-General appeared to be satisfied that something ought to be done, but thought that the Tasmanian Government ought to do it. When it was pointed out to him that the work must be undertaken either by the Postal Department itself or with its concurrence, he sheltered himself behind the plea that there was nobody there to send messages. As a matter of fact, the Tasmanian Government has agreed to place a caretaker there and to establish a depot of supplies. It merely desires the Commonwealth to open up telephonic communication with this place at an expenditure of  £1,500  a year. But the Postmaster-General will not accede to the request on the ground that the Department cannot afford to do so. </para>

                            <para>- But it is not a party matter. I shall vote against it because there is no sound reason why this reform should be initiated at this stage of our history. It is opposed to the commonsense argument that the Department ought to be made to pay its way, and it is also opposed to the report of the Postal Commission. If penny postage is to be m.stituted throughout the Commonwealth, it should not be instituted until the Government had afforded both Houses of this Parliament an opportunity pf considering that report. For these reasons I shall oppose the second reading of the Bill. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) [5.11].-  1  congratulate Senators O'Keefe and de Largie upon the Conservatism which they have exhibited this afternoon. I can readily imagine the criticism which would have been levelled at honorable senators upon this side of the Chamber if they had delivered the speeches which have been delivered by those honorable senators. Both of their deliverances were extremely conservative in character.

                        Keefe declared that the reform proposed in this Bill will involve the Postal Department in a great loss, and that only wealthy individuals and big institutions will be gainers under it. I would remind him that, irrespective of whether a loss or a gain results from the initiation of penny postage, the whole of the people will participate in that loss or gain. For many years it has been felt by honorable senators that the adoption of a system of penny postage would be of great advantage to the people generally. But the difficulty which has always confronted us has been, " Can we afford it?" We must recollect, however, that under Federation we occupy an entirely different position from that which we occupied when the Postal Department was conducted by the various States. Ever since Federation was initiated, Victoria has been enjoying the benefits conferred by penny postage. But now that the bookkeeping system has expired, the loss incurred in that State has to be made up by the Commonwealth.

                            <para>- There may be. But the point which we have to consider is whether it is advisable that we should put all the States upon the same footing by adopting penny postage, or whether we should increase the postal rates in the different States. Seeing that Victoria has enjoyed penny postage for ten years, during which period she has herself borne the loss which the adoption of that system has involved, it would be unreasonable to increase the postage rate in that State to 2d. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Under the Constitution it is our duty to put the States on an absolute equality. In my opinion, the only sufficient justification for increasing the postage rate in Victoria to 2d. per½ ounce would be the fact that we could not pay our way without making that addition. When we were first called upon to consider a Tariff, we had States which were Free Trade and States which were highly Protectionist. We had to consider the question of revenue, as well as the question of Protection. A majority of the members of this Parliament who had to deal with the Tariff were Protectionists. It was a case of give and take, of raising the duty in one place, and reducing it in another. But here we have to deal with one set of charges, and not with a multiplicity of articles. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> tells me that, in his opinion, our proper course would be to raise the postal rate in Victoria to 2d., because a majority of the States have that rate, I disagree with him. </para>

                            <para>- If, on the other hand, we decide to continue things as they are, unquestionably the loss in Victoria will have to be made up by the other States. That it not reasonable; and even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> recognises that. Are we to level up or to level down? Are we to go down to the rate which has been in existence in one of the largest States, or to double that rate? I do not think it would be reasonable to do the latter. If all the States were now on an equality, with a twopenny rate, I might feel inclined to say that we are not justified, at present, in facing the big loss which undoubtedly will be entailed by penny postage. But we have got rid of the bookkeeping system, and have a common pool. I do not see how we are to deal with this question on fair and equitable lines, unless we put the States on an equality with a penny rate. It has been stated by the Honorary Minister that, in certain States, there is a radius of 20 or 30 miles within which the rate is1d., and beyond that 2d. It would not be possible to introduce that system throughout the Commonwealth without causing a great deal of difficulty and trouble; and even then you could not measure out a fair meed of justice to Victoria. A loss of£275,000 a year is estimated if we enact that all letters shall be carried in each State at 1d. per½ ounce. But for an additional expenditure of £75,000, we can have one system throughout Australia. In the first place, I am induced to support penny postage by reason of the position in Victoria to-day. If we make a change, we must adopt a rate which will not be to the prejudice of one-third of the population in the Commonwealth. Then arises the question, " Is it well to stop at£275,000 in order to save£75,000, or to incur an annual loss of £350,000?" I did hope that the Honorary Minister would be able to furnish estimates as to what would be the result of penny postage in future years. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator might have ascertained the probable increase in the number of letters <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> He might have gone a step further and ascertained what would be the cost under the penny rate, and on that he could have made an estimate based largely on Victorian experience, which shows that the increase in communication has been very considerable. He told us that in 1900, that is before penny postage was established in Victoria, the number of letters per head sent through the post was 52.8, whereas in 1908 the number had increased to 82.35, showing an increase of thirty letters per person. When a comparison is made, it will be found, I think, that the increase has been very much greater under a penny rate than under a twopenny rate.

                            <para>- That has had a certain effect. The quotation continues -  and though there was a slight increase in the revenue, and, doubtless, in the number of letters, between 1835 and the establishment of penny postage early in 1840 - an increase chiefly due, in my opinion, to the adoption of part of my plan, viz., the establishment of day mails to and from London - yet, during the whole period of twenty-four years immediately preceding the adoption of penny postage, the revenue, whether gross or net, and the number of letters, were,, in effect, stationary. </para>

                    <para>Contrast with this, the rate of increase under the new system which has been in operation, during a period of about equal length. In the first year of penny postage the letters more' than doubled, and though since then the increase has, of course, been less rapid, yet it has been so steady that, notwithstanding the vicissitudes of trade, every year, without exception, has shown a considerable advance on the preceding year, and the first year's number is now nearly quadrupled. As regards revenue, there was, of course, at first a large falling off - about a million in gross and still more in net revenue. Since then, however, the revenue, whether gross or net, has rapidly advanced, till now it even exceeds its former amount, the rate of increase, both of letters and revenue, still remaining undiminished. </para>
                    <para>In short, a comparison of the year 1863 with 1838 (the last complete year under the old system) shows that the number of chargeable letters has risen from 76,000,000 to 642,000,000; and that the revenue, at first so much impaired, has not only recovered its original amount, but risen, the gross from ^2,346,000 to about ^3,870,000, and the net from ,£1,660,000 to about <inline font-style="italic">£1,</inline> 790,000. </para>

                        Hill then alludes te* many matters which, he contends, have improved in consequence of the introduction of jenny postage. In 1836 education had not made great strides in Great Britain, but since then it has made very great advances, with necessarily an increase in letter-writing. People in a class which could not write years ago can both write and read to-day. The movement which has taken place from village to city and
                        <inline font-style="italic">vice versa</inline>
                        has induced persons to write. Previously, letters were not written by persons who remained in their own villages. All these things have to be taken into consideration, because they have undoubtedly affected the increased number of letters sent through the post since the penny rate was introduced. Under the present proposal for the reduction of our postage rates it is estimated that the loss will be £350,000 a year. According to the Royal Commission's report, the estimate some years ago was a much smaller sum. It has been increased. But I am prepared to take the Minister's figures as approximately correct. I also recognise that it will cost more to run the Post Office in consequence of the increased number of letters that will have to be distributed. Today there are complaints that many of ow postal officials are underpaid and overworked. The Royal Commission has inquired into these matters and made recommendations which I have no doubt will be favorably considered by the Government. To contend that the increased business will not increase the cost of managing the Post Office is to argue against common sense and the teachings of history. But I anticipate rapid developments in this country. It is true that I should like to see it developing much more rapidly than it is doing, but, nevertheless, population is increasing, the volume of business in all our great cities is unquestionably immensely greater than it was ten years ago, and the signs of greater prosperity are on every hand. Most of us believe that there will soon be considerable additions to our population. All these signs point to increasing revenue. The Post Office will be a greater service and will have a much larger revenue at its command. This increased volume of business will enable it to a large extent to recover the loss that will ensue at the commencement of these changes. If I thought that, as the result of what is proposed, the employes would not be paid adequate wages, or that proper facilities would not be provided for persons resident in country districts, I should deprecate any change in the system. But I look at the matter from the stand-point of a man who believes in Australia, and who is confident that we are about to have a material increase in our population and in our volume of business. Therefore, I am prepared to accept what is now proposed as a step in the right direction, and one which the circumstances of the Commonwealth will permit us to take. It is certain that we have to make a change of some sort, and as any change which we can make will amount to a loss of £275,000, I agree with the Government that we might as well make the larger reform and incur the loss of £350,000 at once. Some honorable senators contend that the proposal will benefit only a few individuals. But I believe that every individual in the community benefits by an advance of this character, even though the benefit derived by some persons may apparently be small. We wish to encourage trade and intercourse. We wish to do all we can to improve business relations. I do not look upon the Post, Telegraph, and Telephone services purely from a revenue-raising point of view. They are services which are conducted for the benefit of the people of Australia. They require these conveniences, and any little deficit upon them should be made up out of the general revenue.

                            <para>- No; I have admitted that the increased cost of the service will be considerable, though I believe that it will be greatly diminished in the course of years. In Great Britain you can send a letter 4 ounces in weight from one end of the country to the other for1d. Here it is proposed that the rate shall be half an ounce for1d. I look forward to another reform which will increase the amount of mail matter that will be carried for1d. I believe that it will be possible later to carry letters up to, say, one ounce in weight for that sum. There is also another advance that I should like to see, and that is in the direction of more frequent deliveries of letters in our principal cities. It is almost inconceivable that in days like these there should be only three deliveries per day in Melbourne and Sydney. </para>

                            <para>- I have no intention of doing so; I shall declare my attitude very emphatically. I have always been an admirer of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henniker</inline> Heaton, who has been the persistent apostle of penny postage throughout the Empire. I say at once that I am personally in favour of penny postage throughout Australia, other things being equal. But as far as I can see the time is not ripe for the Commonwealth to indulge in what may be termed the luxury of penny postage. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has said that those who oppose this reform are conservatives. On this occasion I may be included in that category. But let me also say that on various occasions our opponents have hurled at us the charge that we were not actuated by business motives. In opposing the second reading of this Bill I am actuated by the opinion that we cannot at present afford the loss which the proposal will involve. We have the authority of the Postmaster-General himself for the statement that, in the first year, penny postage will cost the Commonwealth£400,000. I think that that sum could be spent to better purpose than by conferring a benefit upon a few people in this Commonwealth. There is no denying the fact that penny postage will benefit, not the greater number of our people, but only the few. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> gave a very apt illustration from his own experience as a business man and as a private individual. He told us that by the advent of penny postage he would have benefited to the extent of 5s. a week while he was a business man, but that the benefit to him would have been something like three halfpence per week while he was a private individual. I do not think that the average worker in Australia will write any more letters because the postage rate is brought down from twopence to one penny. Supposing that he continues to write as many letters as he is now doing, the saving to him will, to use the Minister's own words, be infinitesimal. Are we going to burden the taxpayers of Australia to the extent of £400,000 per annum to achieve a saving for an infinitesimal portion of the population. If during the ten years of Federation the Postal Department had paid its way - and that is what I want to see - I should have supported the second reading of this measure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> cannot say that it has paid its way, nor can he fix approximately the date when it will. I have no desire that State institutions should be run only for profit, but I believe they should pay their way, and if there is a balance of profit on their operations, the community should get the benefit of it. If it could be shown that there was a profit on the operations of the Post and Telegraph Department, this is a reform which I should be prepared to welcome. It is well known that many of the servants of the Post and Telegraph Department have not been receiving the remuneration for their services which they ought to receive, and we know that the present Government have determined to give them better wages in the future. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister, with his usual impetuosity, is getting ahead of himself again. He is not the man today that he was when I listened to him from the other side of the House two or three months ago. If we can afford to lose £400,000 in the first year of the operation of this proposal, I say that we can better afford to apply that money to providing postal facilities for remote districts of Australia. I have said that I should welcome  this measure if the Post and Telegraph Department had been paying its way. Recognising that it has not been paying its way, and cannot be expected to do so for some time to come, I cannot support this proposal at the present juncture. I do not know what the inquiry held by the Postal Commission has cost the country ; but I know that a number of members of this Parliament devoted themselves laboriously to the consideration of the affairs of this Department. I know that their investigation has cost a considerable sum. It would have been only fair to this Parliament, and to the members of the Commission who devoted themselves conscientiously to their important inquiry, to have waited until Parliament had an opportunity to discuss their report before the introduction of this Bill. I say that the Bill is premature ; and. because it is, I intend to oppose it. It is not that I am not in favour of penny postage - I should like to see penny postage established throughout the Empire - but I say that, at the present time, Australia cannot afford to lose £400,000 in one year. If we lose £400,000 under this proposal in the first year of its operation, it must be remembered that we shall continue to lose heavily under it for some years to come. Senators de Largie and O'Keefe have pointed out that the increase in the volume of business which is likely to follow from the adoption of penny postage will necessarily involve an increase of the cost of working the Department. I regret the necessity of having to oppose the second reading of this Bill, but I must do so, because I think we are not in a position to spend £400,000 this year to give effect to his reform. </para>

If the Government think that we can afford to spend so much money, I contend that it might be spent in some other way with much greater benefit to Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire, at the outset, to announce that I intend to oppose the second reading of this Bill. I shall do so for several reasons. The first reason for my opposition to this proposal is that no one can deny that it is brought forward in the interests of the residents of the cities of the Commonwealth. There is no other end in view in submitting it than to relieve business firms in all the cities of Australia of a contribution which they should make towards the cost of government in the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> may think so, but on similar proposals I have heard the honorable senator express opinions very different from those which he has expressed to-day. I say that this legislation will be in the interests of the cities and against the interests of the country districts of Australia. I have had some experience in postal matters since I have been a representative of Western Australia in the Senate. Whenever it has been necessary for me to appeal to the Postal Department for facilities which were absolutely necessary if the development of outside portions of the State I represent were to continue, I have always been met with the reply that, because the revenue to be derived from the granting of those facilities would not equal the expenditure involved, it was impossible to grant them. It must be admitted that, in this respect, the residents of our cities are under no disability whatever. They have postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities at their hands, but when we look to the outside districts we find settlers so placed that they can only get a mail once in a month or once in six weeks. We must recognise that people so situated labour under disabilities which are never experienced by the city man, who receives his mail every morning before he receives his breakfast. </para>

                            <para>- Of course the cost is borne by the whole community, but the man outside, who receives the mail once every month, contributes equally to the Government expenditure with the city man, who receives his mail every morning at breakfast time. The city man is being considered, and the outside man is being made a scapegoat, by this legislation. There is another factor which impels me to oppose the second reading of this Bill. I take precisely the same ground as has been taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe.</inline> We all know that a very exhaustive inquiry has recently been conducted into the administration of the Postal Department by a Royal Commission ; and I hold that to select as a subject for legislative action one item from amongst the many which have been investigated by. that body is a wrong course to pursue. I shall oppose the Bill, because the Government have evidently taken into consideration only the granting of increased postal facilities to the residents of our cities. I happen to be the representative of a State in which the Department incurs a deficit year after year. </para>

                            <para>- Four of them will be. The Government admit that the introduction of penny postage throughout the Commonwealth will involve us in a loss of practically  £500,000  during the first year. But, after all, that is merely an estimate ; and experience may prove that it is a very inaccurate estimate. If the Ministry are right in urging that the establishment of penny postage will result in an increased volume of business, I say that it will also involve an increased cost which will practically be borne by the settlers in our outlying districts. In other words, they will be still further penalized. In my opinion, our first aim should be to provide rational postal facilities in every one of those districts. The number of persons who receive only a weekly, fortnightly, or monthly mail service, is very considerable. Those persons contribute equally with city residents to the Commonwealth revenue; and, therefore, have an equal right to our consideration. </para>

                            <para>- The actual loss may work out at  £750,000.  It would have been much better if the Government had_ recognised the wisdom of calling upon Victoria to pay the same postal rates as are charged in the other States. I have no desire to continue the differentiation in postal rates which exists between the States at the present time; but we ought to consider the urgent necessity of extending postal facilities to those who are righteously entitled to, and who are daily demanding, them. I do not, for a moment, suggest that we should establish a post-office for the convenience of half-a-dozen people. But, of my own knowledge, there are communities in the back country which number many hundreds, and which receive a mail service only once a week. The reason why these communities are not granted a more frequent service is that the Department has not the money with which to pay for it. Yet the Government submit for our consideration a measure in which they practically say, " Let us cheapen the cost of postal facilities to the city man, to the business man." I hold that if the Bill be carried settlers in the back-blocks of this country will, in the matter of these facilities, be still further penalized. The same remark is applicable to telephonic and telegraphic communication. I know of a place in Western Australia which for years has vainly attempted to obtain telegraphic or telephonic facilities. The reason advanced by the Department for its refusal to grant those facilities is that the service would not pay. Yet the Government are now attempting, in the interests merely of city residents, to reduce the postal rates which are already operative. Seeing that in this Bill they have dealt with only one item of the report of the Postal Commission, I shall be obliged to oppose the motion for its second reading. Until that report is dealt with in a comprehensive fashion, I shall have no option but to oppose every similar measure which may be brought forward. </para>

                        <para>. - We are now engaged in bringing to a termination what I believe is regarded by all sections of the community as a truly Federal session. The Braddon section of the Constitution has practically expired, and the bookkeeping system, which required every tradesman to keep an account of all the articles which he happened to forward to an adjacent State, has also disappeared. I think that the Government are entitled to some credit for their effort to give legislative effect to a further complement of Federal reform by abolishing the differential postal rates which exist in the various States. The two principal objections which have been urged to the Bill are that the employés of the Postal Department are not being fairly treated, and that, if we incur the great loss which the establishment of penny postage will temporarily involve, those employes must continue to submit to conditions which do not reflect credit on the Commonwealth. But it must be remembered that, since its transfer to the Federation, a marked improvement has taken place in the Postal Department. No person can deny that. Even the Postal Commission, which went into the subject very exhaustively, was compelled to acknowledge that the payment of officers, especially postmasters in New South Wales, had been increased by almost  50  per cent. </para>

                            <para>- In the first place, of course, the New South Wales Treasury was held responsible for the payment of the increase, but certainly its people had to foot the bill. Even the increase of the minimum to  £110  per year under Federal rule was a distinct improvement on anything previously known to postal employe's. In view of the undeniably great improvement which has taken place throughout the service, from the standpoint of both the employés and the general public, we can afford to ignore much of what we hear about sweating in the service to-day. </para>

                            <para>-  What about the other branches of the Postal Department?  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator LYNCH.-</inline> This huge organization was created to minister to the needs of the public. When we find that there has been a material increase from the stand -point of the employés, it is only fair that we should give effect to the desire of the public to make this service a greater instrument of public good. It has been urged that if we take this departure, and incur an annual loss of  £400,000, which I hold would diminish rapidly, there would be no possible hope of extending postal facilities to deserving people in isolated parts of the Commonwealth. I yield to no one in sympathy with those who are engaged in the arduous work of developing the interior. I consider that it ought to be the first duty of the Government to see that the utmost consideration is extended to them in the matter of adequate post and telegraph facilities. I feel that if I were to oppose this proposal, I should be adopting a foolish attitude if I wish to achieve that result. Rather do I believe that, by supporting the proposal, I shall bring necessary postal facilities within the reach of the people in isolated parts of the Commonwealth much sooner than otherwise would be the case. I come from a State which is suffering more from the inability of the Commonwealth to extend these facilities than are the States in which closer settlement has proceeded more rapidly. The smaller States are not suffering to the extent to which the newer and larger States, such as Queensland and Western Australia, now suffer, and apparently will continue to suffer. I believe that with penny postage we should be able to extend necessary facilities to persons in distant parts much sooner than otherwise could be done. I, of course, may be asked for proof of that statement. We know that, according to the law of diminishing returns - a phrase which is used by economists - you can keep the rates of a service at a certain point, which will not only cause a drain on the capital account, hut also make the trading account not balance at the end of a period. You can take, for instance, the Melbourne tramway system, and raise the rates of the service to a point which will make it absolutely impossible for the management to make ends meet. At the same time, you can reduce the rates to a point which will enable the management not only to reimburse the outlay from capital account, but to show the highest maximum profit on the trading account. It is to the question of arriving at that scientific point which means the difference between loss, on the one hand, and gain on the other, that those who are charged with running this huge Department have to closely apply themselves. It is that scientific point at which we want to arrive. There are two proposals before us. One is to adhere to the present rate, and the other is to reduce it. If we find that by reducing the rate we shall be in a much more advantageous position, I hold that it is our duty to do so. Canada furnishes an example of what has happened in a kindred case. For many years the Dominion had an internal letter rate of 1½d. per½ ounce. When it was reduced to1d., a marked increase in the receipts was at once noticeable. So much so that the Dominion Treasurer stated in the House of Commons three years ago, that while the1½d. rate prevailed the Postal Department had to be assisted to the amount of from £123,000 to £143,000 a year, from other sources, in order to make ends meet; but that immediately after a penny rate was adopted, a change took place in its finances. What was it ? It was not a change of the kind which is predicted by the opponents of this Bill, but rather the contrary. The Dominion Treasurer said that the change was very satisfactory to Canadian finance; that the adoption of a penny rate throughout the Dominion and to the United Kingdom was the immediate cause of the wiping out of the annual deficit in the accounts of the Postal Department, and assisting the Consolidated Revenue by no less than £184,000 a year. It is quite plain that the1½d. rate was the means of keeping a great Department in a state of bankruptcy year by year, and that immediately after it was replaced with a penny rate, it was enabled to contribute£184,000 a year to the finances of the Dominion. We are quite entitled to expect satisfactory results to accrue in Australia, where conditions very much similar to those in Canada obtain. </para>

                            <para>- We hope to see our population increase. I do not know what stronger inducement than a Labour Government there can be for increasing the population. I know that a number of men abstained from marrying until a Labour Government came into power because, previously, they could see no possibility of making ends meet. No matter how unconsciously we may be biased in our opinions, we cannot afford to ignore the very satisfactory results which penny postage has brought about in Canada. Taking the number of letters posted, the increase per  cent. as compared with 1899 rose from 18.56 in 1900 to 89.88 in 1905. The result in New Zealand, too, is very encouraging. Although its population was less than a fourth of that of Australia, still five or six years ago it reduced its letter rate from 2d. per½ ounce to1d., and in four years the total increase in the number of letters posted was 72.78. </para>

                            <para>- That makes the illustration still more applicable to our case. The results of penny postage in the United Kingdom have been equally encouraging in the direction of cheapening facilities and also increasing the profits. . Since Federation the loss on the working of our Postal Department, even with a twopenny rate in all States except Victoria, has been no less than £948,000, so that it has had to lean on another Department - the Treasury, I suppose - for the huge sum of £100,000 a year in order to make ends meet. What hope have we of effecting any improvement so long as we continue the existing conditions? </para>

                            <para>- Even looking at the matter from that point of view let us make it worse, and then we shall have a very much better chance of effecting an improvement. It is a very old maxim that things have to be made worse in order to effect an improvement. While things are proceeding in a slipshod fashion it is very hard to arouse the people from their lethargy, but when things become intolerable then will come the time for the people to say that an adequate amount shall be provided in order to put the Postal Department in a sound position. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to draw attention to the state of the Post and Telegraph Department viewed as a whole since the Federal Government assumed the control of it. I find that between 1901 and 1909-10 the finances of the Department have undergone little change. In 1901-2 the percentage of revenue to expenditure was 96. The percentage has oscillated up and down, reaching 94 in 1908-9. Last year, 1909-10, the percentage of revenue to expenditure was again 98. These figures show that during the period of Federal control the position has not been improved in the direction of furnishing extra capital in order that the Post Office might push forward and extend facilities to the country districts. The improvement, indeed, has been so trifling that it is hardly worth while to take it into consideration. It is clear that something must be done. What should be done is clearly indicated by the Royal Commission. The Commission has reported to the effect that in order to put this service in anything approaching an up-to-date position it is necessary to expend about £2,000,000. Looking over the accounts for the same period of nine years, I find that the expenditure has exceeded the "revenue by £948,000; or, roughly speaking, an averageof£100,000 a year. That amount of money has had to be made up out of the general revenue of the country for the erection of buildings, the construction of telephone and telegraph lines, and the general purposes of the Department. So that at the rate of progress that has been made during the last nine years, it would take us twenty years more, continuing in the same hum-drum fashion, to bring the service into an up-to-date position. It is, therefore, impossible to regard the present situation as satisfactory even from the stand-point of those who are opposing this Bill. We must either go forward or backward ; and my contention is that if we pass this Bill it will be the means of putting the Department on a more solvent basis.  We shall experience in Australia similar results to those which have been effected in Canada, where the Postal Department has been changed from being a business run at a loss of about  £130,000  a year, to one which contributes about  £180,000  a year to the revenue of the country. </para>

                            <para>- But in Victoria the two branches of the service - postal and telegraphic - were combined, whereas in Canada the one service with which we are now concerned, the postal branch, is a separate organization, controlled by the Government. The telegraphic service is largely in the hands of private enterprise. Seeing that the present position does not give us any hope of obtaining improved facilities for the country, and that we have a chance of improving that position by means of this Bill, we should learn from the example of Canada, where a reduction In postage rates has not only wiped out a deficit, but converted the Post Office into a revenue-producing agency. I quite recognise that we have in our service at the present time a number of underpaid attendants. But I believe that there is a greater proportion of underpaid attendants outside the clerical staff than inside it. I have a clear recollection of one case in Western Australia, where a woman was in charge of a post-office at a railway station, performing the duties of postmistress for the munificent sum of  £1  per annum. There are quite a number of big landed proprietors in the district, and this woman was expected to be in attendance at the office twice a day to receive and hand out letters. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that the case was altered when I made representations about it; but, even then, the remuneration nf the postmistress was only slightly improved. Radical improvements are also called for in respect to the non-official post-offices throughout Australia. Those in charge are, I believe, generally underpaid; but I am of -the opinion that there is not, within the salaried branch of the Department, that amount of sweating that we have been led to believe. There is far more sweating outside the Department proper. In order to secure more reasonable terms for those people who are in charge of various post-offices throughout the country, I. should be very chary of taking any step that might be the means of securing to them better terms than they have received in the past. I support this Bill, believing that it will be the means of putting the Post Office on a much better footing than it occupies to-day. If the experience of Canada and New Zealand is repeated in Australia, it will go a long way indeed towards wiping out the temporary deficit that will be occasioned by making this change. I believe that the Government should be a model employer, especially in this huge postal organization that spreads throughout the country. Just as I think it is necessary that the Government should set an example in dealing with its employe's, so, also, I am of opinion that it is necessary that a change should be made in respect to ministering to the wants of the public. The Post and Telegraph Department was created for the special purpose of serving the public, increasing the means of communication, making it easier for one person to communicate with another throughout the length and breadth of the continent. Seeing that our postal facilities have remained stationary for about nine years, whilst we have taken steps in the direction of improvement in other respects, I think it is high time to make a move in_ the direction indicated by this Bill, which has for its object to increase  and improve the means of communication throughout Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - I . intend to support the second reading of this Bill. I think it is decidedly a step in the right direction. I have no sympathy whatever with those honorable senators who desire to put this Government Department, as they call it, upon a strictly business basis. I look upon the Post and Telegraph Department as an absolute necessity in the development of the country. Wherever the seller goes, the Government should follow him with postal, telegraphic, and, if possible, telephonic communication. The post, the telegraph, the telephone, and the railway systems, may be compared to the arterial system of the body. It is like the circulation of the blood. The more freely the blood flows, the better for the individual, and the better for the nation. Some honorable senators have claimed that the Department should be placed upon a business footing, and made to pay its own expenses. That seems to me to be one of the most antiquated ideas that I have ever heard uttered in the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- I do not trouble about what Great Britain does. We are here to adopt new ideas, not to pursue the antiquated notions prevalent in Great Britain, and which ought to be buried seven feet underground. Let us look, as sane men, upon our present system. Here we are in Australia, situated differently from any other country that I know of. There is no country under the sun to-day which occupies the same position as Australia does. Australia owns the whole of this continent. The people of Australia own the land of the continent. The- Government of the country, acting for the people, carries on enterprises which are never looked at by the people of the great majority of countries. In Australia, the people do for themselves a great many things that are left to private enterprise in almost every other country I know of. They have spent large sums of money in developing the resources of the country, in building railways, roads, and bridges, in erecting telegraph lines and building post-offices, and in providing almost every convenience of civilization, even in the most remote parts of the continent. Each one of these conveniences has added to the value of the lands of the Commonwealth, and who are at present getting the benefit of that added value? 1 have said here, dozens of times, that, at the present moment, there is a river of community-created value amounting to no less than £20,000,000 passing into the pockets of the private land-owners of Australia. So long as there remains this huge reservoir of community-created cash, I shall not cavil at proposals for cheap postage, or any other cheap service, which this or any other Government may seek to establish. </para>

Under a proper system each individual in the community could go to a post-office, and put in his letter, his newspaper or his parcel, and it would be sent on to the person to whom it was addressed without any charge to the individual sending it, because the piper would be paid by the community as a whole. That is the ideal I have for our Post Office, and I think it may very well be realized within the next twenty years. I am sure that if a Labour Government continues in power, it will be realized within half that period. </para>

                            <para>- Just so. I do not suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has ever attempted to reach such a rarified political atmosphere as that. He endeavours to accommodate himself to every environment He has fought under a number of flags already, and probably before he finishes his political course he will hoist a few more. I supported this proposal when very few members of the Labour party were prepared to do so. Many of them opposed it when it was previously (introduced by the Deakin Government, and for exactly the same reasons - fallacious reasons, as I think they are - as those which have been brought forward by some Labour senators here to-night. What are the reasons given by members of the Labour party opposing the Government on this Bill? They say that this is merely playing into the hands of the large business people in the city. They contend that if we give them the benefit of cheap postage we shall be only adding to their dividends. </para>

                            <para>- He is, and he is right, for he will be drowned. I mean to say that the system under which he and others have lived hitherto will be swamped in the new finance. One of the objections urged against this measure by honorable senators who ordinarily support the Government is that it will not benefit the great mass of the people, but will mean the paying of  ,£400,000  a year into the coffers of the large business houses. I do not think that any idea could be more fallacious. We know that the keenest competition exists between the large business houses, and a concession of this kind ultimately finds its way to the mass of the people. That has been my experience since ever I began to take notice of things around me. Every one of these concessions ultimately finds its way into the pockets of the poorest people in the country. What may be termed the force of political or economic gravity makes that inevitable. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that there are any such cases in Australia. We know that business charges are passed on, as far as possible, to the public. A merchant must include in the expenses of his business postage, telegraphic, and telephonic charges, railway fares and freights, and so on. But if a man engaged in some business reduces his charges, another man engaged in the same business must, in self-defence, do the same. Where we have to deal with a trust or combine, which, because of the elimination of competition, would not pass the benefit of such a concession as this on to the public, we propose to take to ourselves power to deal with it in another way. We propose to nationalize a business which has reached that stage. Several honorable senators have asked us to consider how this proposal is going to benefit the back-blocker. They have no doubt that it will benefit the man who lives in a city or a town, but they fear that the poor back-blocker will have to carry the burden. I say that no man in the community will be more benefited by cheap postage than the man who lives far back in the bush. What has been our experience of the reduction of postage rates and the establishment of the parcels post? We find that the catalogues of our largest business firms are now to be seen in the home of every selector. The people in the bush are enabled in this way to find out where they can get the best of goods in the large cities. They send their orders down, the firms send back the goods by the parcels post, and the Post Office collects the money. So business is done now between selectors in the back-blocks and large merchant houses at a discount, I believe, in many cases, of  100  per cent, on the price which they would have to pay to the local storekeeper. </para>

                            <para>- The reduction in price ranges from 25 to 100 per cent. People living in the back-blocks are now able to transact business with city firms without leaving their homes, and with substantial advantage to themselves. I have been spoken to many times by bush storekeepers, who have asked me to do my best t-&gt; abolish the parcels-post system. I have always refused to do so. I have told these people that  1  am not sent into Parliament to look after their interests, but those of the great mass of the community. If the people generally are benefited by the adoption of such a system, instead of abolishing it, we ought to extend it. I welcome this proposal. I believe it will benefit every citizen of Australia. It will make the wheels of business go faster, and will make it easier for people living in the bush to communicate with those who live in towns. It ought to be the object of every Government to make communication between residents in every part of Australia as easy as possible. The experience of other countries has proved that within a very few years penny postage pays for itself. If we take New Zealand, Canada, Great Britain, France, and almost any country of which we have knowledge, we shall find that the same thing has happened. For a year or two, no doubt, there has been a loss from a purely business point of view ; but in a few years that loss has been more than made up. I do not bold the idea that the Post Office should be looked upon as a revenue-producing Department. It ought to be a correspondence and information distributing Department, and the cost of carrying it on should be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue. There is a plentiful reserve of taxation which can be drawn upon if the necessity arises, and I have no doubt that if the present Government remain in power that reserve will have to yield up some further portion of its riches. I do not intend to say very much more upon this Bill. The proposal itself is the strongest argument which can possibly be advanced on its behalf. The penny wise and pound foolish ideas which have been expounded so very liberally by honorable senators to-day excite no sympathy in me. We ought to carry on the government of the country by modern and enlightened methods. Let us make communication and travel as cheap as possible. Let us enable those who are living on the eastern side of Australia to travel to the western side of the continent, so that they may know exactly the class of country we occupy. That is the ideal which we ought to strive to attain. The financial side of this question does not occasion me the slightest anxiety. At present we have £20,000,000 which is absolutely going to waste. Whilst that reservoir stands, we shall never be at a loss to carry on the government of the country. </para>

                                has put the position in excellent terms.  1  agree that many of the employes of the Postal Department are not being treated as they ought to be. I have in my possession information which points absolutely to sweating lt is the duty of the Department to attack that evil wherever it finds it. The people of the Commonwealth' cannot afford to sweat their employes. They will not permit anything of the kind to continue when once they discover its existence. There is sweating in connexion with the permanent officials of the Department, but there is even worse sweating in the semi-official, allowance, and contract post-offices. Large numbers of the persons in charge of semi-official post-offices - I do not know why they are called semi-official, seeing that those who manage them are not permitted to engage in any other occupation - receive only 30s. per week, out of which they actually have to pay rent to the Commonwealth for the building in which it carries on its business. That is a system which ought to be abolished. To many people in country districts, it is a great convenience to have the postmaster or postmistress residing on the premises. The persons who occupy these positions ought not to-be charged rent. Recently we have decided to advance every employé in the Telephone Branch who is over twenty-one years of age, to a minimum wage of two guineas per week. I think that that ought to be the minimum wage in connexion with semi-official post-offices. I was recently looking at the statistics connected with a number of these offices, and T find that many of those who are in charge of them handle cash ranging from £200 to £400 a year. They occupy positions of responsibility. They must be telegraph operators. They have charge of the correspondence of the people of the districts in which they are located ; they transact money order and savings bank work - in fact, they do all the work connected with a post-office for the paltry cash payment of 30s. a week. That system ought to be changed by the Government at the earliest opportunity.

                            <para>- Exactly. But  1  hope that the Government will remedy the glaring anomaly which exists in connexion with our semi-official offices, under which persons who occupy positions of great responsibility are paid very much less than are the officials of the Telephone Branch in Melbourne, Sydney, or Brisbane. I do not suggest that the latter officials are overpaid, but I do say that they have not one tithe of the responsibility which attaches to the former. The Government ought to pay its officials decently. The first duty which the people of Australia require of any Ministry is that they shall pay their servants a living wage. Nothing that the Commonwealth ever did has been received with so much enthusiasm by the electors as has the establishment of a living wage, and the enactment of the provision under which women are paid the same rate as men. Every elector whom I have addressed upon the subject- and I have addressed a good many - has enthusiastically cheered that provision. I am sure that not one of those electors would desire the persons who are in charge of our semi-official post-offices to be paid less than a decent living wage. </para>

                        (Queensland) [8.40J.- In discussing this question, we have either to reconcile ourselves to taking a retrograde step or to adopt penny postage throughout the Commonwealth. At the present time the postal rate upon letters in Victoria is a penny, and under the Constitution we cannot discriminate as between State and State. Consequently, if we do not pass this Bill we shall have to increase the postage rate in Victoria to the level of that which is charged in other States. When we have taken a step in advance I do not think 1 hat we should turn back until we have thoroughly tested it. I regard the proposal which is embodied in this Bill as a step in the right direction. The people of the Commonwealth will regard penny postage as a boon.  1  do not think that in a young country like Australia anybody expects the Postal Department to pay its way.  We must recollect that we are opening up the country, and that we have to send mails hundreds of miles into the bush. We must either do that or leave our settlers without any means of communication. As we wish to develop the country it is obvious that we must offer every inducement to settlement. I can recollect the time when there were scarcely any telegraphs in Queensland. When telegraphic communication was established there, the loss at first was very great. But as the years passed that loss became less and less.

                            <para>- I am quite aware of that. But I hope that before very long the Commonwealth will allow the States interest upon those properties. Indeed, that arrangement is part and parcel of the Federal agreement with them. If necessary, we can pay for the transferred properties by taking over a proportionate amount of the States' indebtedness. We might even pay for those properties with Commonwealth notes. I heard the honorable senator dispute the facts which the Minister laid before the Senate. He was not in a position to take that course, except through the aid of his own knowledge, and what he had been told as a member of the Postal Commission. He had no data to go upon. He was not able to give any figures in refutation of the official figures submitted by the Minister. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps I misunderstood the honorable senator. I am not prepared to say whether the statement read by the Minister is right or not. We have to face the position in which we find ourselves. If we do not pass this Bill, we shall have to bring the postal rate in Victoria to a level with that which obtains in the other States; but I do not think that honorable senators would care to take that step. Whenever a proposal has been made in the Old Country to cheapen the postage, it has met with the conservative cry that it would ruin the Post Office, and do harm generally. When Rowland Hill first proposed to adopt penny postage, and when other reformers in the Department made a progressive proposal, the Conservative party raised the cry that the Department was going to ruin the country. If we are to be guided by experience, it has proved that, although temporarily there is a deficiency in the postal revenue, within a few years it is equal to the revenue under the old system. Australia, of course, cannot be compared with Great Britain, whose Postal Department earns a ' profit of £4,000,000. That was not the case when the .postage rate was 6d. or is., because people resorted to devices of all sorts to cheat the Department. When a letter was tendered at a post-office to be marked " is. to pay," it also bore a mark indicating that everything was well with the family of the sender, and that there was no cause for the addressee to accept delivery. Immediately that mark was noticed by the addressee, he handed back the letter ; and it had to be carried back to the despatching office. The Postal Department had to carry the letter both ways for nothing. Under an enlightened system of cheap postage, the country progressed; and, instead of cheating the revenue by resorting to tricks, everybody paid his postage. I hope that the measure will be carried, and that penny postage will be equally successful in Australia, as I feel sure it will be in the course of a few years. If a small loss is incurred at the beginning, let it be borne by the whole Commonwealth. Why was penny postage established within a radius of 15 miles of a town? It was to encourage persons to send letters instead of despatching messengers. Why should not that benefit be extended to the whole of the people who, when all is said and done, have to pay the piper? I do not think that any liberal, fair-minded man will object to the introduction of penny postage throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to reply to what has been said by some opponents of this very Democratic measure. One honorable senator has stated that it ought not to have been brought down by the Government before they had become acquainted with the results of the inquiries by the Postal Commission. I think that they were under an obligation to the people to bring the measure down this session, because, in the Governor-General's Speech, they announced their intention to bring in a system providing for uniform postage rates throughout the Commonwealth. In order to accomplish that object, they must either take from the people of Victoria the valuable privilege which they have enjoyed for many years, and make them pay more dearly for their postal services, dr establish penny postage throughout' the Commonwealth. It would be a step in the wrong direction to compel the people of Victoria to pay the old rate, so that the only course open is to bring in a uniform penny rate. There is no doubt that a loss will result during the first few years of its operation, but I think that the volume of business will increase so much that in about four years the shortage in the revenue will be made good. Take, for example, the history of penny postage in Victoria. In 1900, before penny postage was introduced, her postal revenue was £425,837. On the 1st April, 1901, she introduced penny postage, and for that year - nine months under penny postage - her postal revenue was £401,475, showing a loss. In 1901-2 - which was a very bad season - it fell to £366, 299. In 1902-3, the increase of business resulted in a revenue of ,£391,397. In 1903-4, it was £420,424; in 1904-5, £431,015; in 1906-7, £502,357; in i9°7-8» £522&gt;994J in 1908-9. ;£536&gt;3°°; and in 1909-10, £574,311. The experience of Victoria shows that in the course of a few years penny postage is likely to' increase the postal revenue to such an extent that it will be a great benefit to the Commonwealth. The Postal Commission asked the Parliament to indorse their recommendation that penny postage should be established throughout the State when it can be placed on a paying basis. Would it not be rather ridiculous to charge a penny rate on a letter between Melbourne and Albury, and a twopenny rate on a letter from Albury to Wodonga, a distance of a few miles? I think that the time has passed for distinguishing between States. We want to enact measures for the benefit of the whole of Australia. I, for one, am against a compliance with the recommendation of the Postal Commission <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> penny postage. Much has been said about the wages and conditions of workers in the Postal Department. It has been pointed out that a decrease in the revenue will mean lower wages in 'the service. According to that argument, when the boon of free postage is established the employes will have to work for nothing. I see no reason to prevent them from enjoying fair conditions and better wages, even though we have universal penny postage. During my travels through New South Wales I have seen how postal facilities have benefited people in the backblocks. I have seen a vast tract of beautiful country which is in need of a railway, but the only means of communication at present is by means of a mail coach. Some of the mail coaches are run at a very low rate. At one place which I visited recently a man contracted for £12 a month to run a bi-weekly service, and the business increased so much that he was compelled to alter his turnout from a two-horse to a four-horse. He applied to the Department for assistance, and he was granted £1 per week to get four extra horses. I am not one of those who believe in mail contractors being sweated, and I think that the introduction of penny postage will not interfere with them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> is very much afraid that it will involve a loss of revenue. I have no fear on that score, because any loss can be made up in other directions. I believe that with penny postage there will be sufficient revenue to expand the mail services throughout the country. I intend to vote for the Bill, because under the Constitution we are required to put the services of the States on as equal a basis as possible, and this is one way in which we can extend to the whole people a privilege which is enjoyed in only one State to-day. </para>

                        <para>.- I am disposed to regard this proposal as one which is governed more by sentiment than by sound business sense. I realize the necessity for establishing a uniform postal system, but the question is whether we should bring one State to the level of five or five States to the level of one. I do not think that the time has yet arrived in the history of this country when we can afford penny postage. </para>

                            <para>- There are varying rates within the boundaries of different States, but that is an entirely different matter. The States are not to be considered in the regulation of postal affairs in the future. It is entirely a Commonwealth matter. Hence the necessity for absolute uniformity. I think it is a matter for regret that we have not had some pronouncement from the Government regarding the recommendations of the Postal Commission. I do not blame the Government for that, because I know that they have been too busy, devoting attention to matters that have occupied the time of Parliament during the last few months, to give that measure of attention to the report that its importance and merits demand. But, nevertheless, we ought to consider the recommendations contained in the report side by side with the proposal now before the Senate ; and I venture to prophesy that if honorable senators were at all conversant with the findings of the Commission they would hesitate before voting for this Bill. If our postal, telegraphic, and telephonic system is to be placed upon anything like a satisfactory footing, the Government of the Commonwealth will, in the very near future, be plunged into very heavy expenditure. The Commission have had the advantage of obtaining the advice of the very best experts in Australia regarding the efficiency or non-efficiency of the service, and their recommendations are based upon the knowledge so obtained. If there is anything in the advice tendered to the Commission, it is certain that in the near future the Government will have to give serious consideration to some proposals which are outlined therein. If that be done, and if the Government surrender £400,000 of revenue, they will have to tap some other channels of taxation in order to raise the necessary money to meet the heavy expenditure which they will be bound to incur. On page 39 of the report, the Royal Commission sets out the amount required for new works, instruments, batteries, maintenance, and staff. For new works alone, there will be required an amount of £1,828,052; for batteries and instruments, £105,473; for maintenance,£453,176; for staff, £132,378,making a grand total of £2,519,079. Add £500,000 for the annual loss that will be incurred if we adopt this Bill, and we shall have to face new expenditure equivalent to £3,000,000. I say that the Government cannot afford at the present juncture to throw away this large amount of revenue. In the course of the debate it has been emphasized over and over again that the service of the outlying districts is anything but satisfactory. The cry for penny postage, notwithstanding what has been said to the contrary, is purely a metropolitan one. </para>

I do not think that the Government can quote an instance where a country district has ever shown any enthusiasm for penny postage. I have some experience of my own State, and, no doubt, honorable senators representing States larger in area have a wider experience, regarding the drawbacks and disadvantages from which settlers suffer. Some of them would not dream of asking for telegraphic and telephonic services. They would be quite satisfied to get a postal service once a week. But I know from experience of dozens of districts in Tasmania that such a service has been refused. The matter has been referred to the  Deputy  Postmaster-General ; the  Deputy  Postmaster-General has instructed an officer to investigate the locality in question, and to report upon the probable revenue results ; the finding of the officer has generally been adverse; the  Deputy  Postmaster-General has advised accordingly ; and one has been duly informed that the people making the application must be left absolutely without any postal communication. </para>

                            <para>- That is the reason invariably given. I draw the deduction that if the Government cannot afford to pay for these services with the revenue now obtained they will be still less able to do so when £400,000 is surrendered. Again, application has been made for improved communication with the Port Davey district, which is on the south-west coast of Tasmania. The coast is a very dangerous one, indeed, and many wrecks have occurred there. We have pleaded for some communication, either telegraphic or telephonic. But we have been met with the same red-tape answer, " It will not pay ; the revenue likely to accrue is not sufficient." Some communication, preferably radio-telegraphic, has been asked for on behalf of the people who are isolated on King Island. But, again, we are told that there is no money - that the finances of the Department will not permit of the communication being  given.  The settlement on King Island  is  growing rapidly, and is a thriving one. It  is  incumbent upon the Government at the earliest moment to give consideration to the requests  of  these people, made so frequently, to give them some kind of communication either with the mainland or with the State of Tasmania. There is a radio-telegraphic station, thoroughly equipped, at Queenscliff, which can waft messages across to Tasmania. Another station on King Island would be sufficient to establish communication between that island and Queenscliff, and the expenditure would not be very heavy. </para>

                            <para>- They tell us that they  Cannot  afford it. I regret very much that the Government have adopted that view,  in  connexion with the cases to which I have referred. I should now like to know what the Government intend to do during the recess. Are they going to maintain the ;idea of not connecting King Island either with Queenscliff or with Devonport? I regret very much that the Postmaster-General has been in very indifferent health for some time past. Consequently, it is but reasonable to expect that there has been some dislocation in the affairs of his Department as far as he is concerned. We -all hope to see him back in his office completely restored to health in the near future. "But, all the same, I desire before this session ends to have some pronouncement from the Minister representing the Postmaster-General in the Senate as to what are the intentions of the Government in respect to establishing wireless communication with King Island during the recess. I understand that the Government are being advised by Admiral Henderson, and a gentleman highly skilled in the science of radio-telegraphy, as to the best points at which  to  establish stations in order more thoroughly  to  link up various points of importance by wireless telegraphy. No doubt the Government will act upon the advice of these experts. I hope that they will act promptly. But I look forward to obtaining some statement from the Government before the session terminates as to what their intentions really are regarding this very important matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> in announcing his support to this Bill, observed, amongst other things, that he thought it must be realized that the postal employes in the country districts are not getting the remuneration which they ought to receive from a Government that professes to have such a regard for their welfare. Of course, the present Government have not yet had time to regulate the conditions. I shall add that their task will be much harder in bringing conditions up to something like fairness and justice when they are face to face with such a huge deficiency in their postal revenue as will be occasioned by the passage of this Bill. The honorable senator went on to say that, notwithstanding that the prospect of these employes receiving any better treatment in future was not improved, he was still going to vote in the direction of allowing the Government to surrender something like  ,£400,000  of revenue. </para>

If there is one thing which, more than another, is calculated to make a Government unpopular, it is that it should introduce new taxation. I am sure that it would be eminently satisfactory to my honorable friends opposite if the present Government took that course, and made themselves unpopular as soon  as  possible. </para>

There is another phase of the work of the Postal Department to which, I think, some attention should be directed. I refer to the tendency to increase the boy labour in the Department. In Tasmania we have boys engaged in carrying about huge bags of mail matter from behind which it is almost impossible to see them. The Postal Commission, at page 112 of their report, refer to this very objectionable practice. They say, in paragraph 620 - </para>

                        <para>Representatives of associations in many of the States alleged that boys are employed on men's work, and they complain that the Department thus secured cheap labour. Several witnesses stated that boys fourteen to eighteen years of age were employed as night telephone attendants, and to deliver telegrams to suburbs inside certain metropolitan districts. The Commonwealth Public Service Inspector of New South Wales stated that the employment of boys on men's work is discouraged by the Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner. </para>

                    <para>The word " discouraged " sounds very nicely ; but still the number of boys in the service of the Department is being increased, notwithstanding the view which the Public Service Commissioner takes of toy labour. I hope that the time is not tar distant when the Government will take this question in hand, and see that boys are employed by the Government only at work for which they are physically fitted. It is altogether objectionable to find little boys of thirteen or fourteen years of age, who ought to be at home in bed, travelling the streets at night delivering telegrams. </para>

Boys are now engaged in delivering telegrams at a time of night when they should be at home in their bed, growing, as nature intended they should. I do not claim that the Government should have established all these reforms in the few months they have been in office; but I am directing their attention to these paragraphs of the Postal Commission's report in the hope and belief that they will consider them when the proper time arrives. I wish to refer again to the back-blocks post-offices. The country districts in the different States are not so much interested in penny postage as in twopenny postage. </para>

                    <para class="block">Their concern just now is to be supplied with a postal service at least once a week. I have had representations made to me, which, in turn, I have made to the Department, for a weekly postal service here and there, and for the establishment of money-order offices in other places. The lack of money-order offices is a sore point with many people living in the country districts of Tasmania. Under existing conditions, people have to walk 5 or 6 miles in many places, if they wish to send a post-office order or a postal note. My concern just now is to see better postal facilities provided for the country districts, and nothing will induce me to vote for this proposal, unless I have a declaration from the Government that, notwithstanding the anticipated loss of revenue under this Bill, they will still be prepared to increase the facilities afforded the residents of country districts, not only in Tasmania, but in all the States of the Commonwealth. Some honorable senators have stated that the time has arrived when we should have a uniform postage in the Commonwealth. They claim that, as Victoria has enjoyed penny postage for so many years, the other States ought to be brought into line with that State. On that subject, I may say that I do not think the majority of the Victorian people will have the slightest objection to their State being brought into line with the other. States, and a uniform twopenny rate established. </para>

                            <para>- What I suggest would not involve an increase in the postage rates in Tasmania. I do not propose that we should interfere with the existing arrangements in any of the States, providing for penny postage within certain limited city areas. Instead of losing revenue, as we must do under this Bill, I should prefer to see Victoria brought into line with the other States, in order that the revenue we are at present deriving from the Postal Department may be increased. At the present time, the Government are faced with the necessity for a huge expenditure on the Post and Telegraph Department alone, to say nothing of the expenditure to which they are committed in other directions ; and, in the circumstances, they cannot afford to surrender the revenue which must be lost under this Bill. Until I hear that the Government intend to do a fair thing by the country districts which have not had a fair deal in the past, I shall continue my opposition to the proposal for the establishment of penny postage. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to be very brief in addressing myself to this question. I congratulate the Government upon introducing this Bill this session. I hope it will become law, and that we shall have universal penny postage in the Commonwealth as soon as conveniently may be. I do not view the establishment of penny postage throughout the Commonwealth in the same way as does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long.</inline> I recognise with him that, in the past, the Postal Department has perhaps not been as mindful of its obligations to the country districts throughout the Commonwealth as we could have desired j but I do not think for a moment that the establishment of penny postage will make it less mindful of its obligations in that regard. In my opinion the two matters are not in the slightest degree associated. Those who take up that position, it seems to me, are assuming that the estimated immediate loss in revenue resulting from the establishment of penny postage will continue. I think that it will not. Some honorable senators who have already spoken, have pointed out what has been pointed out in another place, and on various platforms throughout the country during the last general election,  that the experience of all countries that have lowered their general rate of postage from "Sd. to id., is emphatically to the contrary. As a matter of fact, in the first year or two, there has been a drop in the revenue, but it has been very speedily converted into a rise ; and, in the course of a very few years, the revenue has assumed normal proportions. </para>

We may take the United Kingdom or Victoria, where, during the period covered by the comparison, the population did not increase beyond the ordinary average normal increase of the Commonwealth. I have heard that the Minister, in introducing this measure, stated that it will be for the benefit of all the people in Australia. That statement has been challenged by those opposed to the Bill. I venture to say that it cannot be successfully challenged, because the benefit of this proposal will be for all the people in Australia. I may say - and in this regard it is necessary for me to introduce a personal note - that, in addressing the electors on the last occasion on which I appeared before them, from every platform in my own State, I strongly advocated penny postage throughout the Commonwealth ; and, wherever I did so, it was strongly supported, and nowhere more strongly than in the country districts. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly the time is opportune. Now that we have entered into a new arrangement in regard to our financial relations with the States, it is particularly opportune. The adoption of penny postage will benefit people in the country in a way in which they have not hitherto been benefited. At the present time, commercial institutions, such as banking and insurance companies, legal offices, and other large city houses, do not enjoy penny postage. They enjoy, on an average, farthing postage, for the simple reason that the great bulk of their mail matter is forwarded for considerably less than id., not merely in our cities, but throughout the whole State in which they carry on their operations, and even beyond the limits of that State. I would invite the attention of honorable senators to the rates which are set out in the schedule to this Bill. There, we find that the rate upon letters is to be id. per J oz., that upon letter cards it is to be so much, and that the rate upon printed papers is to be <inline font-style="italic">\a\.</inline> per  2  ozs., or part thereof. What proportion does that bear to the rate of id. upon letters? I think it represents about one-eighth. Upon books which are published and printed in Australia |d. is to be charged per 8 ozs., or part thereof. I now wish to show what the commercial, the financial, the legal, and other establishments in our cities have been enjoying in the matter of postal rates for years past. Take, say, in my own State, the packet rate of <inline font-style="italic">\d.</inline> for  2  ozs. </para>

                            <para>- I should like to know when. Under this Bill, it is proposed to give to residents of country towns an opportunity of communicating with one another at the rate of1d. per½-oz. Is that too much to grant them, seeing that for years the commercial houses, the legal firms, the banking, insurance, and other financial institutions of our cities have enjoyed privileges of the character which I have just outlined? I repeat that they have been enjoying, on an average, farthing postage. In our country districts, if one resident desires to communicate by letter with another resident in a town which has a population possible of 3,000, he has to pay 2d. in order to get his letters forwarded. </para>

In Sydney, I believe that the radius within which penny postage is operative is one of 16 miles from the General Post Office. In Melbourne, similar conditions did obtain to those which now obtain in Adelaide. Penny postage did not once exist within the city itself. </para>

                            <para>- The residents of our capitals have enjoyed the benefits of penny postage for a considerable time so far as ordinary letters are concerned. But if a resident in one of our country towns wishes to communicate with the metropolis, or with a neighbouring town, he is required to put a 2d. stamp upon his letter. On the other hand, if a city resident wishes to forward by post any document of the character outlined in the extract which I have quoted, he is at liberty to do so by paying a rate of1d. per 2 ounces. But the individual in the country who desired to reply to such a communication by letter has to pay a 2d. rate. That is where the hardship comes in. If we only give him the right to reply by letter to a financial institution, a legal firm, or a commercial house at the same rate as is charged to those institutions, we shall lessen the present inequality. We need not apprehend from penny postage the dreadful results which some honorable senators have predicted. Though the revenue of the Commonwealth may suffer a temporary set back as the result of its adoption, I believe that it will speedily recover. What has taken place in New Zealand, Canada, and elsewhere, will, I feel sure, not merely be paralleled here, but will be surpassed. </para>

                            <para>- If we are not to take action until our population is equal to that of Canada, we shall continue to lag behind. I hope that the Bill will receive the cordial support of honorable senators, because I believe that penny postage will lead to closer communication between the States. With the introduction in the near future of a uniform stamp and the adoption of penny postage, I believe that we shall take a forward step in Australian Nationalism. These reforms will also tend to cement the ties which have hitherto bound the different States together. I feel that the Government have not been unmindful of the financial aspect of this question. I am very pleased to reflect that I was associated with a Ministry which some time ago indicated its intention to bring forward a Bill of this character. But in order to permit of that being done, it was necessary that an arrangement should be made with some of the States, and the opportunity for entering into that arrangement did not present itself. I congratulate the Government upon having introduced this measure at the earliest opportunity, and I feel sure that it is one which will redound to their credit. </para>

                        <para>The  great importance of the subject which is now under consideration impels me to say a few words upon it. I have listened very attentively to the utterances of my Tasmanian friends and colleagues upon it. To-day we have had one of the most interesting debates of the session - a debate which will go far towards dissipating the objection urged by the Leader of the Opposition a few days ago that the Senate can no longer be regarded as a deliberative assembly. The discussion which has taken place to-day conclusively proves that this Chamber is a deliberative body. It will also serve to place before the people of Australia the advantages which will flow from the adoption of penny postage. I appreciate especially the splendid speeches made by Senators O'Keefe and Long, who evidently have a grasp of the subject, and spoke from experience. </para>

                    <para>One of the most comprehensive reports which have ever been issued has been made by the Postal Commission on one of the most important services' in the Commonwealth. The more it is studied, the more it will be realized that our Postal Department requires a great deal of re-organization. I could, if I wished to do so, cite innumerable instances in Tasmania. I could also cite instances which have come under my notice in other States. But I only propose to mention some of the many Tasmanian complaints which are referred to by the Postal Commission. Some of the reforms they deal with are of so important a character that I take it that any one interested in the subject must be impressed. For instance, they say - </para>

                        <para>The winter mail service with the mainland is not sufficiently frequent, and should be the same as the summer service. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>That is admitted by every Tasmanian. </para>
                    <para>The King Island mail service is insufficient. </para>
                    <para>We have heard from honorable senators to-day remarks, which I can substantiate, as to the inadequacy of the mail service to King Island. Its people have no means of communicating with the mainland; and, although the want of telegraphic communication has been brought under the notice of various Governments, no action has yet been taken to redress the grievance. </para>
                    <para>In the northern parts of Tasmania it has come to be regarded as almost a scandal that no step has yet been taken. Not only has King Island a bright future, but it is recognised as being, for its size, one of the most up-to-date and populous places. Its people have shown a very progressive spirit on all public questions, and, to my mind, to deny them the right of a decent mail service is a disgrace to any Government. I hope that the present Government will take some action, even though it be late in the day - </para>

                    <para class="block">These statements, which apply to all Tasmania, are substantiated by sworn evidence, and are not contradicted. In fact, there is no one who will defend the existing state of affairs. There are crying evils <inline font-style="italic">calling</inline> tor reform. The present Government is one which stands for clean administration, and whose main principle is to show the public that, by administration, they can put a Socialistic system, such as the Post Office undoubtedly is, on a better footing. Their first duty is to attend to these matters as speedily as possible. I, as a supporter, have every confidence that, before this session is ended, a pronouncement will be made by the Government as to their intention to remedy many of the existing evils. </para>
                    <para>It is when the existence of great evils is urged as an argument against the establishment of penny postage that I beg to disagree with the opponents of this measure. I hold that penny postage, and the reforms I have alluded to, are distinct matters.  While we, as believers in an efficient, well-governed and paid system, are anxious for certain evils to be redressed, the very fact of their existence is not a good argument against our instituting a great reform. If any matters in connexion with the postal administration are in a backward state, is that an argument that we should not proceed with such an important reform as the introduction of penny postage? I fail to see the trend of that argument. Every year the introduction of penny postage is delayed will increase the cost of its institution. If we now put expediency before principle, and do not introduce penny postage for five or six years, it will result in a greater initial loss of revenue than would be the case now. It has been stated that, if penny postage be introduced now, the loss of the postal revenue will be so great that there will be no money available for instituting certain postal reforms. </para>
                    <para>But I take it that the more efficient and up-to-date our postal service is, and the cheaper the rates are, the more .it will be used by the people, with the result that, not only shall we get more revenue, but we shall have a people more satisfied with the system as a whole. We have a duty to perform to the Public Service. It would ill-become a Government, with such a platform as the Labour Government have, to ill-pay their employes, or to give them bad conditions. At the same time, it would ill-become them to lag when the great reform of penny postage calls for public attention. I am glad to see that the Government have had the pluck to take the question in hand, as they promised to do in the Governor-General's speech, and I hope that the measure will soon be placed on the statute-book. </para>
                    <para>A few years ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fielding,</inline> Treasurer of Canada, pointed out that, when it had postage rates of 1½d. and  2jd.,  its Postal Department was worked at a loss. He stated that with improved administration and an increased volume of business, due mainly to the introduction of penny postage, the Postal Department was able to contribute £^184,000 a year to the Consolidated' Revenue. I believe that,- within a few years of the introduction of penny postage in Australia, the deficit in the postal revenue will be so small that it will not seriously embarrass our finances, and that the people generally will gain a benefit. </para>
                    <para>I quite understand how my honorable friends from Tasmania feel, in reference to this measure. They are hurt because nothing has been done this session to benefit the postal employes and the service as a whole.. Considering the business which we have put through, and' remembering that we have been engaged on some of the most important measures ever put before this Parliament, and that the Labour Government have only been in office for a few months, I think that they are entitled to be allowed a reasonable time in which to organize their Departments and start great reforms. I trust that, before we rise this session, we shall have a pronouncement from the Ministry that such improvements in our Public Service as we can reasonably expect will be carried out, and that, in consequence, those who are engaged in postal work will be put on a better footing. </para>
                    <para>One of the great contentions of the Postal Commission is that the persons in charge of allowance offices are not receiving an adequate remuneration. If we facilitate .the business and increase the number of letters, will not these officers benefit? Did we not receive from the Postmaster-General a sliding scale showing that the persons in charge of these offices were paid according to the number of letters which went through them? Naturally, if more letters are posted, these persons will be paid an increased amount, so that one of our complaints will be remedied by the introduction of penny postage. There will be more letters to deliver, and consequently more pay tor the postmistresses to receive. </para>

Surely they would' not tell us that they were prepared to lose £400,000 in the first year if the finances were not in a good position ! </para>

                        <para>. - For various reasons which I will explain I intend to support the second reading of the Bill. We have been taking from a certain class a large amount of taxation, and we have been taking a great deal from the bulk of the people for some time through Customs and Excise. I think that the time has come when we should remit something to them. T welcome this form of remission. I think that the community have a right to expect it in the circumstances. I believe that the Government can finance this proposal without having their revenue unduly contracted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator after</inline> senator on the other side has got up and drawn attention to the alleged sweating in this. great Department. They state that sweating exists, and insist that it ought to be remedied. What relevance has that to the question before the Senate? I cannot see that it is relevant; but, assuming that it is, is this the way or the time to deal with the matter ? Do not honorable senators perceive what their assertion amounts to? It is, first, a reflection on the Public Service Act, which received from this Parliament so much attention. If the defects are not to be attributed to the Public Service Act it is a reflection upon the Administration, and the officials who are responsible for the general conduct of the Department must take it as a reflection upon them to a certain extent. I admit that the Government are also being assailed in the matter. If what honorable senators Opposite say in justification for their charges be correct, let us investigate their statements by themselves. If their charges are justified let us deal with them. But they should be dealt with as a separate issue, and should not be mixed up with this question of postage rates. I may here remark that Parliament and the people of this country are at present witnessing something that is not very satisfactory in the pressure that is being exercised by a portion of our Public Service, and in turn in a certain quarter in both Houses of the Legislature. A certain section of the service - while I have to compliment them on the whole on being thoroughly sound, loyal, and efficient officers - are giving indications of a spirit with which other Ministers who have occupied office have been familiar, with which the present Government are familiar, and with which their successors also will have some acquaintance. There will come a time when this Parliament will have to assert in clear fashion that the Public Service exists for the public, and not <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> At the same time it is only fair to say that if there are deep-seated evils in the administration of any Department the Ministry ought to give those concerned an opportunity of having their grievances investigated and remedied. I take this opportunity of saying that there seems to me to be now a tendency foi a " bread and circus " policy being pressed forward both on the public and on Parliament. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I shall conclude by giving a few figures which I have taken from the Budget papers relating particularly to the Post and Telegraph Department. They go to show that the doleful prospects and warnings indulged in by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> and others are not justified. In 1902-3 the revenue of the Department was £2,404,000; in I903-4, £2,510,000; in 1904-5, £2,632,000; in 1905-6, £2,824,000; in 1906-7, £3,128,000; in 1907-8, £3.300,000; in 1908-9, £3,409.000; and in 1909-10, £3,727,000. The estimate for 1910-11 is £3,856,000. But I may here remark that I do not agree with the Treasurer's estimate. I think that he has under-estimated the revenue of the Department, which I believe will be in the neighbourhood of £4,000,000. Those figures show that between 1903 and - taking the estimate - 1910-11, a period of eight or nine years, the increase of revenue is 60 per cent. The Department is expanding, and that fact should encourage us to give something back to the people. I have also taken from the Budget papers certain returns under the heading of " Receipts over and under expenditure " for the same years. In 1903 there was a deficit in the Postal Department of £27,343. But in 1904, and ever since there has been uniformly a surplus. In 1904 the receipts over expenditure were £2,106; in 1905, £65,726; in 1906, £186,824; in 1907, £439,171; in 1908, £381,754; in 1909. £366,234; in 1910, £524,840; and the estimate for 1910-11 is £364,248. The last figures show a slight falling-off as compared with the previous year, but it will be remembered that I have already said that I think the Treasurer has under- estimated the departmental revenue. These figures all go to show that the Department is in a healthy condition as far as revenue is concerned. They justify us in making an experiment of this kind. It is only fair to say, however, that in giving the excess of receipts over expenditure I have omitted the amount voted by Parliament for buildings and public works on account of the Department. That amount for the years mentioned totals £3&gt;3I2&gt;551- But I have always contended that a vicious and unfair system of accountancy has been adopted by the Department. I have repeatedly urged that expenditure on works and buildings should be placed to a capital account, and that that account should Be .gradually extinguished by a system of annuities such as prevails in connexion with the British Post Office and in connexion with certain telephone works carried on by private enterprise in America. If we were to capitalize the £3,312,000 and provide for its gradual extinguishment by means of a system that could be easily determined upon by actuarial investigation, we should be able to debit a steady amount to current expenditure on account of new works. </para>

                            <para>- Not necessarily. I have said publicly that it it were advisable to raise money for construction purposes I should not hesitate to do so, but what I am now urging is that we should capitalize the expenditure on works and provide for its gradual extinction. It is unfair to charge the total amount spent on works in any one year to current revenue. I feel fairly confident that if Australia continues to expand in the future in anything like the same degree as she has expanded in the past, and if we provide for capitalizing the expenditure on telephones, telegraphs, buildings, and other works, we shall be able to see that we can fairly afford to grant the concession which is proposed by this Bill. It has been said by the opponents of the measure that complaints have been made over and over again by constituents in reference to the establishment of offices, the erection of telephones, and the provision of services. I have received applications of that kind myself time after time, and .have duly forwarded them to the Department to be noted. But, I ask, will there ever be a time, even if we made the postal rate 2d. or even 3d., when demands for new works will cease to be made ? It does not matter what condition the finances of the country are in, whether we are short of funds or revelling in money, the Post and Telegraph Department will always be deluged with applications for the erection of post-offices and the provision of postal conveniences in all parts of the country. It is the duty of the Department, through its responsible officers, to advise Parliament, as to whether we can safely afford to grant  the concessions that are asked for. A rule should be laid down by which it could be determined which of these requests should be granted and which should be refused. The Minister has officials behind him, whose duty it is to consider the applications. If he cannot trust his advisers it is time for him either to- get rid of them or to appeal to Parliament to deal with the subject. On the other hand, the Minister is responsible to Parliament for seeing that reasonable demands are complied with. There is 1:0 reason to anticipate that his hands will be unduly tied if the reform I have so often advocated be adopted. In a very few years there should be little or no restriction upon the operations of this important Department, and a very much needed boon will be granted to the people. Next to railway communication, the granting of postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities is the most powerful means that could be adopted for the development of the country. I differ from the Postmaster-General in his administration of the telephone system; but I believe that, in common with the other members of the Government, he is desirous of extending these facilities. In this matter, the Government are taking a step which, I believe, will be found to be financially sound; and it is one which, I believe, the country expects them to take. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to express the pleasure which the Government feel at the reception given this measure. Without desiring to make any invidious distinctions, I should like to say that no speech to which I have listened on the Bill impressed me more than that delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> It was one of the most solid contributions to the debate, and every sentence of it was an argument in support of the measure. I think he must have convinced every unbiased member of the Senate who has given any consideration to the laws of competition and social economics, that the charges exacted in respect of correspondence and other forms of communication from those engaged in carrying on a business are, as surely as the night follows the day, passed on to the general community. . </para>

I give the members of the Postal Commission every credit. They entered upon, and carried out, their inquiries in a most painstaking and conscientious way. They took exhaustive evidence, and familiarized themselves with the postal, telegraphic, and telephonic services throughout the Commonwealth. But I must say that when I read their recommendation, in respect to penny postage, I was amazed. After all, these are Socialistic or semi-Socialistic institutions.

The postal service in country districts is non-paying, and in many districts it never will be on a payable basis if all the requirements of the people are to be met. It is not the desire of this Government, and I hope it will not be the desire of any Government of the Commonwealth, that only those postal services which can be shown to be self-supporting shall be granted. </para>

                            <para>- Let me ask Senators de Largie, Henderson, and Needham, who claim that this reform should be delayed until the postal service is established on a payable basis, a very pertinent question. I hope that next session the Government will have the pleasure of introducing a Bill- and it may fall to my lot to do it -for the construction of a railway line from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. Will these honorable senators, who are opposing this reform, get up in their places in this chamber when that Bill is submitted to the Senate and ask, " Will it pay to construct this railway ?

But when honorable senators opposite asked him to disprove the statement I have made, he said that as one of the Postal Commission, he was unable to obtain any information in respect to the matter. That did not disprove my figures. </para>

                            <para>- I am not dealing with that aspect of the question. The opposition to this measure has been vigorous, but it is not sufficient to defeat it. After all, on what grounds has the opposition to it been based? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie considers that the time is not opportune for its introduction. Other honorable senators have opposed it on the ground that it will cost  £500,000  a year, and others again because the post and telegraph service is not in as satisfactory a condition as we should like to see it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> says that this proposal will cost  £500,000,  and he opposes it on the ground that we cannot afford it, and because, with other representatives of Tasmania, he has, from time to time, deputationized the Postmaster-General to secure telegraphic communication with Port Davey at a cost of  £1,500.  Because the honorable senator cannot get that, he opposes this measure. </para>

He said that the proposal meant lifting one State up to the level of five, or five down to the level of one. That is not so, - because there are varying rates of postage throughout the different States. It means either universal penny postage, or penny postage Intrastate and twopenny postage Inter-State, or a twopenny rate throughout Australia. Is any one desirous of a higher rate of postage throughout Australia? </para>

                            <para>- Yes. But when applications are made for postal facilities, the Department is always prepared to make a grant of 50 per cent. upon the revenue which it is estimated will be derived from the service. That is to say, if any locality will guarantee that a service will return £20 per annum the Government will grant an additional£10 per annum. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) [10.50].- There seems to be no reason why the rate for the carriage of commercial papers, patterns, samples, and merchandise, should be higher than the rate for the carriage of printed papers, as prescribed. The charge for the former is1d. per 2 ounces or part of2 ounces, or double the charge for the latter. I suggest, unless there is any strong reason to the contrary, that the charge for the former should be reduced to ½d. per 2 ounces or part of 2 ounces.

                        <para>. - There is one argument which may, perhaps, appeal to the Minister. Irrespective of whether one rate is high and the other low, it seems desirable, as far as we can, to have uniformity. To-day, when a man goes round to the Post Office, he is in some doubt as to which rate his parcel or package comes under. The more uniform the rates are made the more will every one know what he has to pay. With a variety of charges, one is at a loss to know what to do ; and he has to go to the bother of asking an official the category under which it comes. In view of the advantage of having uniformity the Minister might see his way to accept an amendment' in the rate attached to the last line. </para>

                        <para>.- So far as I can see, the rate of1d. per 2 ounces or part of 2 ounces is adopted in all the States. Honorable senators will understand why the rate should be maintained when I state that commercial papers include acceptances, accounts, invoices and receipts, ballot-papers, bank-books, bankers' pass-books, bills of exchange, bills of lading, drafts, drawings, files of official papers, insurance documents, policies, invoices, legal documents, affidavits, briefs, deeds, manuscripts, and many other things. These are the reasons which move the Department to fix a different charge for this kind of correspondence from that for documents which are wholly printed. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) [10.56].- A question arose just now with regard to the carriage of samples. I believe that under the postal regulations one can send so many pounds of matter for a few pence. Suppose that you go to a store and buy a lot of goods weighing about 10 lbs. They can be sent through the post at a very low rate.

                        <para>. - The existence of a number of rates with regard to those articles on which a reduction is made from the ordinary letter rate is 'a constant source of annoyance and irritation. People receive through the post articles posted in one place in the full belief, and very often on the assurance of an official, that the rate is1d. for  4  ozs. But when the recipient is entitled to receive them, he is told that the articles were posted under a wrong designation, and that he has to pay1d. for 2 ozs. This is of daily occurrence in the experience of many persons. The fewer the rates in the list the less likelihood is there of friction between citizens and officers. It is quite impossible to think that the officer at the despatching office, and the officer at the receiving office, will always agree as to what is the particular designation under which articles of this character come. I hope that whether the rate in the previous instance is raised, or this rate is lowered, there will be at least uniformity. </para>
