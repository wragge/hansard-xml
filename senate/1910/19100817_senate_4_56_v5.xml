                        <para>- I wish to ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council a question without notice. I understand that the first business to be considered to-day is the second reading of the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill. I notice on one of the walls of the chamber a large map, which, I presume, has been placed there for the information of honorable senators. If that be so, it ought to be an accurate map. As a matter of fact, it is not an accurate map. It shows the railway line from Townsville to Cloncurry as going through Winton, when, as a matter of fact, the line does not go through Winton, or pass near that town at all. I notice, also, that the map is not drawn to scale. I should like to know by whose authority so inaccurate a map has been placed here for the information of honorable members? </para>

                        <para>- As I moved the adjournment of the debate after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> had moved the second reading of this Bill, it devolves upon me to say a few words upon it. I think there is no difference of opinion as to the desirability of the Commonwealth taking over the Northern Territory. It comprises an area of nearly 600,000 square miles, and is a very large and practically uninhabited portion of Australia. It has many valuable rivers, and there are places on the coast at which a foreign Power might obtain ingress and secure a foothold in positions from which it would probably involve a vast deal of trouble and expense to dislodge an enemy. The subject-matter of the Bill is covered by the terms of the agreement under which we are invited to take possession of this Territory. Honorable senators will bear in mind that, although South Australia has had control of the Northern Territory for a great number of years, she has never been able to make a success of the task she undertook in the government of it, although she has spent a great deal of money in the effort to develop it.</para>

                            <para>- The Northern Territory forms a not inconsiderable portion of Australia, and South Australia has incurred an annual loss by the ordinary expenditure in its development. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, in introducing the Bill, cited the cost of the construction of the railway from Port Darwin to Pine Creek. The public debt on the Territory amounts to something like , &#163;2,725,000, and the deficit on the advance account is &#163;603,222. These figures represent the state of affairs about twelve months ago, but they are the latest I could get. This brings the present debt on the Territory to about &#163;3,300,000. I wish honorable senators to notice particularly that the deficit represents the annual loss involved in the control of the Territory by South Australia. The interest payable upon loans amounts to &#163;110,990 per annum, and if the Commonwealth takes over the Territory, it must become responsible for the deficit and the annual expenditure by way of interest. There is a further interest charge on the advance account of &#163;602,222 amounting annually to &#163;17,142. Under the agreement included in this Bill, it is stipulated that there shall be a sinking fund provided by the Commonwealth. I believe that South Australia makes provision for a sinking fund in respect of the debt of &#163;2,725,000 to which I have referred, and it is estimated that this involves an annual charge of &#163;6,963. These figures of interest payable and provision for sinking fund amount together to &#163;135,000. Then it is proposed that there shall be a sinking fund in connexion with the smaller sum due, and this will make an addition of a further amount to the annual expenditure. Then there is an excess of interest and sinking fund in the accounts for 1907-8 of &#163;16,398. There is a total annual expenditure upon the Territory, not including interest on the Oodnadatta railway, of &#163;151,493. As to the Oodnadatta railway, of which we are asked to take charge, we find that it has cost South Australia &#163;2,242,600, and that the annual interest amounts to &#163;84,000. There is a surplus of earnings over working expenses of &#163;12,000. </para>

The Commonwealth is asked to indemnify South Australia for the expenditure to which she has been put on that account. Furthermore, under the proposed agreement, the Commonwealth is to be bound to connect the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta with the line from Port Darwin to Pine Creek. The cost of that work has been estimated at nearly &#163;5,000,000 sterling; so that, as the Vice-President of the Executive Council put it the other day, we are called upon to face an expenditure of between &#163;10,000,000 and &#163;11,000,000 sterling in connexion with this agreement. </para>

                            <para>- It is not being given, nor is it being bought by us. Originally South Australia was, by charter, intrusted with the control and management of the Territory, the right of the Crown being reserved to revoke the grant at any time. The Territory was not given to South Australia to form a part of her own property in the ordinary sense of the term. It was merely placed under her control and administration. In the Commonwealth Constitution it is, however, recognised as being a portion of South Australia. But now South Australia comes to the Commonwealth with a proposal in which she says that she is quite willing to hand over to us the control of the Territory on certain conditions. One condition is that she shall be indemnified for the expenditure to which she has been put, and the loss she has sustained, in connexion with the administration. </para>

                            <para>- I quite agree with the honorable senator. I do not suppose that there is a single member in either House of the Legislature who would demur for one moment to that proposition. It is generally recognised that South Australia has acted as a trustee, and has administered the Territory to the best of her ability at considerable outlay. We are prepared, as we ought to be, to recognise that as a fair and reasonable proposal. But when we come to consider the other provisions of the agreement, we find ourselves hampered with conditions which we should find it hard to justify in the interests of the Commonwealth. We ought not to permit ourselves to be leg-roped - to use an expression employed in this Chamber on a previous occasion - in the matter of connecting the Northern Territory with other portions of Australia. We ought not to be compelled of necessity to construct the railway that South Australia considers to be the proper one. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps New South Wales would support Queensland in that contention. If the route proposed by South Australia will stand the test of examination and determination by the governing power, why should she be afraid to trust this Parliament ? . But, on the other hand, if it is shown that the proper way to develop the Territory by building a railway through it is to take the line over to the east, and attach it to the States of Queensland and New South Wales, the Commonwealth ought not to hesitate to adopt that course. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that Queensland desires the Commonwealth to help in the development of her territory. She has always shown an independent attitude, and has been well able to develop her own lands, and is doing so at a rapid rate at present. But my argument is not that we ought to develop Queensland, South Australia, or any other State by means of the projected railway, but that the railway ought to be for the purpose of developing the Northern Territory, and making it, what we believe it may ultimately be, a very fine area for the settlement of a large number of people, whom we hope to see  placed there. If it were shown that the best route for the railway would be towards the east instead of north and south as South Australia desires, we should carry the line in that direction so that we might develop the Territory to the highest advantage. The descriptions of the Territory that have been furnished to us seem to me to show that there are large areas of valuable land lying to the east of the proposed line of railway, and not to the west, nor along a direct north and south route. If the line be carried north and south, it will traverse a large tract of barren, useless country, but if it were carried to the east there might be a possibility of developing valuable land. South Australia, however, has devoted time, energy, and money to the development of the Northern Territory, and she may think that she ought to be recouped for her expenditure by the construction of a railway which would connect Port Darwin with South Australia proper. But our main object must be to develop the Northern Territory itself. The only question for us is whether the railway which South Australia desires would have the effect of developing the richest portion of the land. </para>

                            <para>- I have not the reports by me just now, and do not know that I could put my finger immediately on the passages to which I refer; but I have read them, and the impression strongly formed in my mind is that the most valuable country lies to the east. I do not say that there is no valuable land along the due north and south route; but I am satisfied that there is a greater possibility of development in an easterly direction than is probable by taking the other route. Again, it may be remembered that Lord Kitchener, on his re cent visit to Australia, called attention to the necessity of connecting the Northern Territory with the other portions of Australia by railway. Let us, therefore, look at the matter from a military point of view for a few minutes. If it be necessary that a line of railway should be built to the Northern Territory in order to protect it from any attempted raid in time of war, where would the bulk of the troops for the defence of the Territory be drawn from ? Would they not be drawn from the eastern coasts of Australia? Do we not find, when we consider the facts, that the largest number of troops could most expeditiously be despatched from Queensland and New South Wales, rather than from the south ? Evidently, the bulk of the troops must come from the portions of Australia where the bulk of the population resides. The bulk of the population is on the eastern seaboard. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but when we are talking about railway construction we must remember that the resources of the Commonwealth are not unlimited. Do honorable senators think for a moment that the Commonwealth would be justified in building any but the line of railway that it would be most advantageous to construct, both from the point of view of military strategy and territorial development ? We also have to bear in mind that the railways which South Australia has at present built in and to the Territory do not pay, and, as far as I can judge, will not pay. South Australia is asking us to incur a heavy liability in taking over these lines. If, therefore, she insists on our building a line which is not the most advantageous to construct, and we do so, the Commonwealth will be saddled with a still greater probable loss, whilst, at the same time, we may not have the line which will best conduce to development in the future. Does South Australia believe that the Commonwealth can develop the Territory properly and fairly, or does she consider that the Commonwealth requires her Government at its back to advise in what way it is to develop its own land? </para>

                            <para>.- New South Wales never attempted to develop the Territory. I give South Australia all credit for the pluck and energy which&#39; she has displayed; but, unfortunately, she has failed to achieve the success which she  desired.  An interjection was made just now with regard to the valuable country in the Macdonnell Ranges. It was suggested not long ago that, instead of South Australia handing over to the Commonwealth the Northern Territory down to her present northern boundary, she might hand over only the portion of the Territory north of the Macdonnell Ranges, leaving the ranges in her hands if she believes that they are capable of being developed and made a profitable proposition. I feel quite sure that a Bill for that purpose would receive acceptance at the hands of honorable senators. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> agrees with the view expressed that there is nothing in the agreement to bind the Commonwealth to carry the railway entirely within the Territory or to prevent the Commonwealth from diverting it into the neighbouring States, so long as it touches on the northern boundary of South Australia. That view has been put forward, I believe, by a member of the present Government. But, on the other hand, we have had placed upon the table the opinion of the Crown Solicitor for South Australia, in which he advised his Government that the railway must be constructed within the Territory, and that&#39; it would be a breach of the agreement to deflect it into either of the adjoining States. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. I am not going to charge anybody with an attempt of that kind, because one opinion is supplied by the Commonwealth law officers, and another opinion is provided, for public consumption, by the law authorities of South Australia. While the matter remains in doubt, the Senate should take the course necessary to protect the interests of all parties, and that is not to bind the Commonwealth to construct the railway in any particular direction. It is not right, I repeat, to attempt to shackle the Commonwealth in any way with regard to the administration of the affairs of the Territory. It should be left with a free Hand, and should the present Government be in power when it  became necessary to build&#39; the railway, no doubt they would select the route which they conceived to be best in the interests of the Territory and of the Commonwealth as a whole, regardless of whether it might be to the advantage or to the detriment of a particular city or State. The agreement, of course, contains a large number of conditions. I am prepared to accept the broad condition that the Commonwealth shall recoup South Australia for any loss which she may have sustained in connexion with the railway, but neither my voice nor my vote will be given in favour of placing any restrictive conditions upon the Commonwealth in regard to the way in which it is to develop the Territory. If South Australia thinks that the Commonwealth is capable of developing the Territory, she should say, &#34; Go and do the best you can with it.&#34; We have only one object to serve, and that is to promote the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole, and not of any particular portion of it. </para>

                            <para> - South Australia has a constitutional right to make her voice heard in this Chamber. She has always had the great advantage of being represented by many singularly able men, who have been enabled to clearly state her position whenever it became necessary, in contradistinction to the position of other portions of the Commonwealth, and so far as one can judge she will probably continue to return that class of legislators. I have no desire to say more at this stage. I have no doubt that the second reading of the Bill will be carried on the voices, but I would urge honorable senators either to eliminate from the agreement the portions which tie up the Commonwealth, or to add a proviso which would make it absolutely clear and plain that the Parliament of the Commonwealth is to be the sole and final arbiter as to the way in which the Territory shall be developed.

                        <para>- I do not think that any of us, and certainly not those who are more intimately connected with South Australia, have any reason to complain of the initial attitude which my honorable friend,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline>
                        took in the view which he with so much force placed before the Senate; nor do I think that there is any dispute that from the broad, national standpoint, it is desirable, in the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole, that this great tract of country, which is almost one-fifth of the area of Australia, should be directly under the control of the Commonwealth. I do not, and never did consider, that it is any objection to the attitude of South Australia - although there has been a good deal of carping criticism to that effect - that she has not succeeded in making the Northern Territory populous, or, so to speak, blossom as a rose, rich with the produce of the undoubted mineral wealth which it possesses. I am not at all sure that the other States have quite overtaken all the development which is possible within their boundaries. I am one of those who are inclined to think that some of the larger States might very well be divided, that those portions which they are unable to effectively control might very well be declared Territories of the Commonwealth, and that when they reach that stage of population and wealth which would entitle them to be regarded as States, they should be admitted as States of the Commonwealth. Therefore, I do not attach the slightest importance to criticism such as. that which my honorable friend has just used in respect to South Australia not having made a success of the Territory. Success is a vague term, and success within the meaning of what I have indicated has not been possible for a population of  300,000  or  400,000,  who, to use a common expression, have perhaps &#34; bitten off more than they can chew.&#34;</para>

                            <para>- I think, so. That is the position. It is of no use to make a statement like that of my honorable friend, that South Australia has not made a success of the Territory for forty years, although it has been in her possession. But for the fact that she was exercising the functions of government, and controlling the Territory, it is just possible that it might not have been in the possession of Australia at the present moment. No reproaches ought to be cast on any State. I am not sure that reproaches could not be cast on New South Wales or Queensland for having, I will not say neglected, but ineffectively developed the immense areas which they respectively possess, and that they might not have been made much more productive of wealth than they have been; but that is no reproach. </para>

                            <para>- That does not show that it is not a valuable asset. Western Australia was called the Cinderella of the Continent a few years ago, and nobody knew of the existence of those untold golden riches which were under her soil some 300 or 400 miles from the coast, until they were discovered. I dare say that if anybody had suggested, when she had a population of some 40,000 or 50,000 persons, that that enormous territory - about a fifth of the whole continent - should be taken over as part of a bargain, it would have been stated that all the country at Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie was a mere barren desert, and would not provide water for a goat within hundreds of miles. But look at it now. So in the Northern Territory it is the same at this day, but it is the same with this difference, that it has been established that it is immensely rich in mineral wealth. </para>

                        SYMON.Because we want to generously share it with the other States. The honorable senator is like others who desire to have the Northern Territory annexed to Queensland, to have all its riches in the possession of that State, and its produce brought down to Brisbane, always subject, of course, to the claims of some of my honorable friends from Sydney, who think that that is the port to which the produce of the Territory should come. I do not intend :to occupy the attention of the Senate on the question of the desirability and importance of the Territory being an integral part of the Commonwealth as a Territory, and not as part of the State of South Australia.

                        was quite right in saying that there is no difference of opinion on the broad national question of the desirability of taking over the Territory.  1  do not believe there is a member of the Senate who holds a different opinion. Nor is there any difference of opinion that the Territory, if it is taken over by the Commonwealth, should be transferred subject to the charge upon it.

                            <para>- Just so. But it was, I think, in question not long ago. People used to say, &#34; We ought not to pay South Australia this money,&#34; and I could not understand the contention. Because, as between man and man, if a property is handed over from one to another for a consideration, or without it, in addition to the charges due upon it, it is taken over subject to the mortgage, if any, upon it ; and the debt on the Territory may be described as a mortgage. I could never understand the suggestion made, and I am glad that no such suggestion is now made, that the Territory should not be taken over subject to the charges upon it, incurred by the owner in doing his duty by it. That is now conceded. But one reason why, from another point of view, that is fair and proper, is that South Australia has expended these moneys in building railways with a view to the development of the Territory. . She built the Port Darwin to Pine Creek railway, and has run it all these years, if not at a loss, at any rate without much profit. Honorable senators, perhaps, forget that she has also run a railway from Port Augusta up to Oodnadatta, which is within 100 miles of the 26th parallel, the southern boundary of the Territory. So that South Australia has done a very great deal in the direction of carrying out what, adopting a phrase used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> is best adapted in the interests of the Commonwealth to promote the development of the Territory in the future, namely, the construction of a direct line from Port Augusta to Pine Creek and Port Darwin. The debt on the Territory has been incurred in this way, and in the necessary efforts of South Australia to work the southern railway until she could connect Oodnadatta with Pine Creek. When it is remarked that South Australia has not been successful in developing the Territory,  it might be said that she was not successful because of the policy of keeping Australia white. </para>

                            <para>- She had an opportunity a good many years ago, and passed an Act to avail herself of that opportunity, for the introduction of Indian coolies into the Northern Territory. But the sentiment of South Australia, and of Australia generally, was so strong as to the desirability of keeping Australia white that that Act remained a dead letter, and not a single coolie from India was imported under it into the Northern Territory. It is all very well for honorable senators to say that the Chinese are there; but I may say that, but for them, there would be no revenue at all from the Territory, and that is not the only part of Australia in which there are Chinese. South Australia abstained from introducing coolies to develop the Territory. Another thing from which she abstained was the opportunity to continue the line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek by securing its construction on the land-grant system, as she might have done more than once during the last forty years. I say that that is something to be proud of also. It is another of the circumstances which account for the accumulation of the debt. </para>

                            <para>- South Australia is not asking the Commonwealth to do this, and, instead of getting a reward, it appears to me that she is likely to get more kicks than ha&#39;pence. This is part of a bargain. My honorable friends keep on saying that South Australia is asking the Commonwealth to pass this Bill and to do this, that, and the other. She is doing nothing of the kind. This is a mutual bargain between two contracting parties, the Commonwealth on the one hand, and the State of South Australia, the present owner of the Territory, on the other. </para>

It is conceded on all hands that South Australia, in transferring this Territory to the Commonwealth, is entitled to be paid the money expended and resting as a charge upon it. If that is conceded as a right, what consideration is she getting for parting with the Territory? </para>

I do not suppose that anything I could say, or anything that an angel from Heaven could say, would satisfy honorable senators from Queensland, or, perhaps, some of our honorable friends from New South Wales, that the straightest line from north to south is not to be found by going 1,000 miles to the east, and zigzagging the line to the south. They say that the longest way round is the shortest way home. </para>

                        SYMON.Perhaps; but it is not so with regard to this particular railway. Putting all that on one side, I say that, so far as regards the taking over of the Territory on the one hand, and accepting the liability on the other, there is not one ha&#39;porth of reward proposed for South Australia. She would not make one farthing of profit out of the bargain. We are all agreed upon that. Rut do honorable senators not think that she is entitled to make some little profit out of it?

                            <para>- It is as near as is necessary; but I shall not quarrel with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> if he changes his opinion. I merely wish to say that South Australia will not make a single farthing out of this transaction, unless by the stipulation agreed to by both the contracting parties with respect to the railway. That is really the question on which we differ. I wish to remind my honorable friend, when he talks about distances, that South Australia has bridged over the distance between Port Augusta and the southern boundary of the Territory to within100 miles. She also, years ago - and I think this stands to her credit in connexion with the development of the Territory, as well as in connexion with national Australian interests - built the telegraph line across the continent. Honorable senators need not imagine for a moment that, in making these references, I am boasting of what South Australia has done. What I mean to infer is that, if this Bill is not passed - and I am not saying this as a threat in any shape or form - I have faith that South Australia, in some way, will accomplish her destiny in connexion with the Northern Territory, and will, whether by the land grant or some other system, construct the railway, and bridge over the distance between Oodnadatta and Pine Creek before many years are past. Personally, I do not care two pins whether the Senate adopts the agreement or does not ; but I say that South Australia, which has done so much in the construction of national works of benefit to Australia, is capable of doing more. I ask honorable senators to recollect that she has already constructed, at her own expense, the railway which it is a part of this agreement that the Commonwealth should take over. The coot of that railway is a present charge on the Territory which should be paid back to South Australia if it is transferred to the Commonwealth. It should not be forgotten that the railways already constructed bridge over the worst part of the intervening territory between the good country on the south and the good country to the  north. I should like to see any report which condemns the MacDonnell Range country, or the country from the Katherine River northwards. It is magnificent country. </para>

                            <para>- If my honorable friend lives in the statistics of the rainfall, I give him joy of it. I may be allowed to say that the arguments with respect to distance, in connexion with military operations, appear to me to be ludicrous. The populous State of Victoria is practically within from twelve to fifteen hours of Port Augusta. If they were wanted, troops could be sent from Melbourne to Port Augusta, and from there on to Port Darwin in much shorter time than by any other route. That, as every one knows, is the shortest route to Port Darwin from Melbourne, and is shorter by perhaps 200 or 300 miles than the shortest of the zig-zag routes which have been suggested. </para>

                            <para>- We are making a bargain with South Australia now ; and the railway already constructed&#39; must be regarded, from an ordinary business point of view, as a part of the main trunk line. It would seem to be merely a sensible thing that we should utilize the two portions of the main trunk line already constructed, and content ourselves with closing up the gap between them. Why should we abandon a railway which goes to within 100 miles of the border of the Territory to be taken over, in order to get away to the east to make a slight deviation, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> says, into Queensland or New South Wales? </para>

                    <para class="block">Commonwealth was the initiator of this project. She approached South Australia, and asked that State on what terms she would be prepared to hand over the Territory. South Australia replies, &#39; &#39; All that we desire is that you will complete the grand trunk railway, which&#39; we have already begun, through to Port Darwin.&#34; That is all ; and that, as far as I am concerned, I hold to. I shall decline to be a party to handing over the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth unless it be part of the bargain that the Commonwealth shall construct that trunk line between the north and south. I am quite willing, as far as the route is concerned, that it shall be anywhere within 500 or 600 miles east or west of the twenty-sixth parallel. I am quite willing that the best route shall be ascertained within the area. But, speaking for myself, I will not depart from the condition that the railway must be wholly within the Northern Territory. There is one point as to which I agree with my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> and that is that there seems to be a little ambiguity as to whether the language of this Bill would permit the line to deviate into Queensland or New South Wales, or out of the Northern Territory. I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has called attention to the point. I consider that it should be made perfectly clear. If honorable senators desire to vote for this Bill on the assumption that the stipulation in question shall be satisfied by taking the railway eastward into Queensland or New South Wales, the Bill ought clearly to say so. On the&#39; other hand, if they desire that the railway should be wholly within the Northern Territory, the Bill should say so. </para>

We have also the opinion of the Crown Solicitor of South Australia, which was adopted by the Ministry of last year, and which I myself share. There is, therefore, as pretty an opening for litigation as one could well desire. </para>

                            <para>- Good for the lawyers, perhaps, but we are not here as lawyers. We are here as representatives of the different States and of the people of the Commonwealth; and I myself am not going to be a party, now that attention has been called to the doubts that exist, to enacting a measure that may be the cause of a law-suit. We are here to confirm or to disaffirm an agreement, and if we see a possibility of doubt, we ought to do our best to remove it. Consequently, when this Bill gets into Committee, if no one else moves an amendment, I shall do so, in order to make it clear that the railway is to run wholly within the limits of the Northern Territory. I wish to say at once that, unless that be made clear, I shall not support this Bill on its third reading. By allowing these conflicting opinions to remain unsettled, we should simply stultify ourselves as legislators, and put upon the statute-book the initial stage, so to speak, of litigation that will not only produce great difficulty and trouble, but may cause heavy expenditure and unending bitterness between the two contracting parties. We certainly do not desire to do that. All those who vote for the second reading of the measure will, I feel sure, consider that they must vote for my amendment. </para>

                            <para>- The late Government introduced their Bill on the assumption that the railway was to be wholly within the Territory, and my honorable friend voted for the measure on that understanding. He should, therefore, vote on this occasion to make clear what I agree with my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> is at present a little doubtful because of the conflicting opinions to which reference has been made. It is not, I may add, doubtful in my own opinion. I have no hesitation concerning the point, so far as the terms of the agreement itself are concerned. But, unfortunately, the words of the agreement, which make the  matter abundantly clear, are not introduced in the Bill. I do not suppose that they were left out by a trick. No one would suggest that for a moment. But this Bill was framed and introduced last year on the assumption that under the strict terms of it the railway was to be wholly within the Northern Territory. Therefore I propose to give honorable senators an opportunity of making that quite clear on the present occasion. </para>

Consequently, the words are contained in the Act which has been passed by the South Australian Parliament. This Bill is to ratify and confirm the whole . agreement, and it authorizes the construction of the railway contemplated by paragraph  1  of the agreement. Clause 5 of the Bill says - </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;4.26&#93;.-I did not anticipate that this debate would have been resumed this afternoon, and, consequently, I am taken at a disadvantage. It was introduced as a Bill which dealt principally with machinery, but in the form in which it has reached the Senate it contains some very far-reaching provisions which should receive very full and fair consideration at our hands. We all realize, of course, that it is the duty of the Parliament to make our industrial legislation as workable as it can be made, so long as we keep clearly within our constitutional powers. Matters which were discussed and settled on certain lines in 1904 are being entirely altered in this Bill. There is no necessity to debate the position of unions, or the way in which industrial powers should be brought into existence, because we have recognised that it is necessary to enable industrial associations to place their views before the public in the way which they consider desirable in the interests of the community at large. But we are getting more and more into this position : that the. only persons to be considered are those who belong to unions. When an investigation is made, it will be found that the preponderance in number is greatly in favour of the men who do not belong to unions. In introducing the Bill,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline>
                    pointed out that it is the men of the most ability, the most energy, and of the most far-seeing views who are in the unions, and who have been the means of bringing unionism into its present position. Our people have long since regarded the existence of unions as a very legitimate state of affairs.

                        <para>- Yes, unions pure and simple, but not unions which had become to a very large extent political and partisan bodies. It was found that the Sydney Wharf Labourers Union - of which the Attorney-General was secretary - had a rule to the effect that every unionist must contribute a certain sum annually towards a political fund, and, whether he liked it or not, vote for any parliamentary candidate who might be chosen by the Labour party. That, to my mind, was a complete prostitution of the whole intention of unionism as established originally, and as recognised generally by people throughout English-speaking communities. We all recognise that men have the right to combine for the advancement of their&#39; mutual interests, but we do not admit that a few men have the right to procure a strong position with regard to their own particular calling, and to say to men outside their union, &#34; You shall not be admitted unless you are prepared to sacrifice any political principles or views which are not in accordance with those of the governing body.&#34; &#39; The purpose of a trade union, in the first instance, was the protection of the mutual interests of workmen in their own calling. It was recognised that they should have the opportunity of combining to obtain the best practicable conditions from their employers. But the unions had nothing to do with, and never should have been mixed up with,&#39; the political opinions of its members. I can very readily imagine a number of men being in a union, whose object is to get decent working conditions and wages, and at the same time holding different views on political questions. If it were claimed that the men who were selected by the Labour party had only one object in view, and that was to protect the interests of a particular class, there might have been, not a sufficient justification, but some sort of excuse for taking up the position which they did, because they practically said, &#34; We are only concerned with getting Labour interests attended to. Your interests and ours are the same so far as Labour conditions are concerned, therefore we expect you to vote for the man whom the majority of us consider best fitted to represent us in Parliament.&#34; But when a man enters Parliament, he has no business to regard himself as the representative of a class. He should look upon himself as a representative of the people, and study the interests of those who do not belong to his class just as he would study the interests of those who do. </para>

                        <para>- I recognise, of course, that they are actuated by the same honorable motive, but I contend that men ought to keep themselves free from the suspicion that they only come into Parliament to represent one particular class. It will be remembered that in Sydney a large body of men had preference granted to them by the Arbitration Court. It was found that they had a rule to the effect that no man, unless he would consent to sacrifice his political convictions to those of the dominant majority, should be allowed to enter the union or to earn his livelihood in the occupation which&#39; he was accustomed to follow. Then it became necessary for the Court to make an&#39; order that the rule should be altered if that union was to retain the preference previously granted to it, and the rule was altered accordingly. When the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill of 1904 was under consideration, a provision was inserted to protect citizens from being tyrannized over by rules made in this other direction. </para>

                <para>It will be seen that the section deals with employers as well as with employ&#233;s, and does not extend to organizations having political purposes as a portion of their aims and objects. What the phrase &#34; political purposes &#34; does not include is defined -  &#34; Political purposes &#34; in this section does not include obtaining or maintaining provisions applying to all persons in any particular industry, without discrimination as between those who are and those who are not members of an organization, with respect to the regulation of the following matters :  - (i.) Preservation of life and limb. (ii.) Compensation for injuries or death. (iii.) Sanitation. (iv.) The sex and age of employees. (v.) The hours of labour. (vi.) The remuneration of labour. (vii.) Protection of <inline font-style="italic">salaries</inline> and wages. (viii.) Other conditions similarly affecting employment. </para>
                <para class="block">It is provided that these organizations shall not be used for political purposes, but the Act specifies certain matters which are of moment in connexion with the employment of workers, and allows to the unions the freest possible hand in those respects. If there are any similar matters which it is necessary to add, then there will be no objection to include them in the section. But why should any organization which is established for the purpose of securing employment, obtaining decent wages and working conditions, and settling industrial disputes, have the right to say, &#34; No man shall come into this union unless he has a particular brand upon him&#34;? </para>

Many are outside the unions, but the argument which is now urged is that the men who are inside a union may make a close preserve of it for themselves, and say to the other fellows, &#34; You shall not be allowed to work at your trade or occupation, because we have got preference, and before you can come into our body you must give up all your political principles if they differ in any way from those which we advocate at present.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator has given me a reply which I have often heard. It is said by some persons that if preference is not given to unionists, the chances are that they will be boycotted by employers if they go before the Court. I can see the force of that argument, but I contend that we have no right to go a step further and say that a man who does hot. choose to join a union shall not be allowed to earn his living. If a hundred men in a union go before the Court, and the conditions are such that it is just to give preference to them, well and good ; but you have no business to turn round and say that no other man shall be allowed to engage in that occupation unless he becomes a member of a union if it requires him to support the parliamentary candidate whom it may select. </para>

This preference would have been taken away had not the union seen fit to modify the rule so as to give every decent, respectable man an opportunity of becoming a member of it, quite apart from his political views. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but now honorable senators on the other side want a law which will free them from all such difficulties. In the first instance what did they propose in regard to this very Bill ? They brought in a provision that preference should be granted to unionists, thereby taking all discretionary power from the Court. They advocated that if a union applied to the Court to settle certain disputes and troubles which they might have with their employers, preference should be granted to them irrespective of all other considerations. Fortunately the Bill has not come up to the Senate in exactly that form, because it does leave a certain amount of discretion to the Court, although it appears to be limited in a very marked degree. This clause, as originally introduced, provided that the proposed new section  40  should read -  &#34;40. The Court, by its award, or by order made on the application of any organization or person bound by the award, may prescribe a minimum rate of wages or remuneration, and in that case shall, on the application of any party to the industrial dispute, or of any organization or person bound by the award - </para>

                    <para class="block">That is another provision which we are here asked to repeal. Under this Bill the Judge of the Arbitration Court is called upon to deal with an industrial dispute from the point of view of the particular organization appearing before him. It may represent 200 or 300 men engaged in an industry which gives employment to 20,000 or 30,000 men. No man who is not a member of the organization appearing before the Court, or employer who is not cited to appear in connexion with the dispute, will have any opportunity of knowing what the organization seeks to obtain, or, if they know, of coming forward to state their views. They would have no <inline font-style="italic">locus standi</inline> in the Court. I ask honorable senators to say whether it is right or reasonable that men engaged in the great industries of the country should be bound by conditions which will materially affect them when they are given no opportunity to make known their views or submit arguments against the proposal made. I put it to the people of the country whether it is fair that a man should have to be bound by the decision of a Court, come to behind his back, and without his having the slightest knowledge of the conditions proposed to be applied to the industry in which he is engaged. </para>

                            <para>- An organization appears before the Court, which can only deal with the claims submitted to it. The  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court will not be omnipotent, but he would need to be to do justice under this Bill. It has been strongly urged that the  President  will represent the community generally, but, unfortunately, the general community is about the last body considered by the organization in dealing with these matters. An organization claiming that the cost of living has been increased, appeals to the Court for an increase of wages from10sto 12s. per day. The Court hears the views of the members of the organization, and of a few employers in the industry. It may consider the weight of evidence to be on the side of the organization, and give an award of preference at the rate of pay asked for. But if the whole body of employ&#233;s and employers engaged in the industry were given an opportunity to make their views known to the Court, and submit the evidence which they could adduce with respect to the conditions of the industry, its expenses, returns and difficulties, the Court might considerably modify the decision come to in their absence. In section 40 of the existing Act there is this further proviso - </para>

                    <para>This safeguard is to be taken away, and it may be that a dozen men, or a. score, will secure an award of preference against the interests of hundreds engaged in the same industry.

                            <para>- Then why repeal this provision of the existing law, if, as the honorable senator says, the organizations have no burdensome or oppressive rules, do not enforce unreasonable conditions of admission to, or continuance in membership, and do not act unfairly to &#39;any of their members? The honorable senator must have had his ears closed to the statements which have been made on this subject from time to time. The Government are proposing to repeal a law which has hitherto worked fairly and reasonably, and which must commend itself to every unbiased mind. An honorable senator interjected that the object was to put an end to strikes, but, in doing so, all should be treated justly and alike. We could put an end to strikes if we had gaols large enough in which to confine every man who strikes. No honorable senator would contend that that would be a proper way in which to deal with a strike. </para>

                    <para>Bill, proposing to do away with reasonable and proper safeguards. Honorable senators are aware that a work entitled <inline font-style="italic">Australia&#39;s Awakening</inline> has been written and. published by a gentleman who occupies a very prominent position in unionism in this country. The writer gives an extraordinary recipe for the making of good unionists. Honorable senators will, no doubt, recollect the story he relates of a non-unionist desiring to go to work. The first thing the unionists did to him was to duck him. The object was to see whether they could not bring him to understand the value of unionism. When one ducking did not serve, a second was tried; and, after a third ducking, as the writer of the book humorously says, they discovered that the method adopted was an excellent one to impress people with the correctness of the principles of unionism. </para>

I know that one Judge, in reporting upon certain cases that occurred in New South Wales, described the condition of&#34; affairs existing at one time in that State as being practically civil war. The Government are proposing an alteration of the law in connexion with the granting of preference to unionists, and are doing away with the safeguards provided in the existing Act for the protection of men who do not desire to become unionists, and they are further proposing that people may have judgments given behind their backs in matters in which they are directly interested. </para>

                            <para>- I have every possible confidence in the Court ; but I would ask the honorable senator whether it is because he has no confidence in the Court that he proposes to assist the Government in doing away with certain guiding principles contained in the existing Act ? Are honorable senators opposite prepared to leave any dispute between employe and employer to be dealt with by a Judge in any way he thinks fit? Some of these provisions will require a good deal of consideration before we know what they mean. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> of clause 2, contains a definition of &#34; Industrial dispute.&#34; It provides that an industrial dispute means a dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State, and includes a dispute in relation to employment in an industry carried on by the Commonwealth or by a State, or by any public authority constituted under the1 Commonwealth or a State. This definition, therefore, purports to bind a State. Railways are managed by the States of Australia. Some time ago an application was made to the Arbitration Court by the railway employes. We know&#62; the fate of that application. Ultimately, the case found its way to the High Court, which held that the attempt to control a State was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> Yet we find a definition, having the same object, included in this Bill. Whether honorable senators consider it desirable or not that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court should have such controlling powers, how unwise it must be to attempt to assume such powers when we have before us the judgment of the High Court, -showing that we do not possess them. The provision to .which I have referred appears to be beyond our powers under the Constitution. A State is entitled to carry on its own functions, and to pay its employes as it chooses. It is not, nor should it be, within the power of the Commonwealth to dictate to a State as to the amount of money it should provide for its services. We cannot reasonably do what we are purporting to do by this Bill. We have always to bear in mind that our position is,  in many respects, very different from that of other Federations. Take the Dominion of Canada. The powers of the Federal Government there are absolutely different from burs, and are based upon different principles. Under the Canadian Constitution, the provincial Governments are really under the control, and subject to, the authority of the Dominion Government. But in Australia the States are sovereign States. They have absolutely the same powers as the Commonwealth in its- sphere with reference to all matters which are not specifically handed over to the Commonwealth under the Constitution. Why should we make a farce of our legislation by attempting to pass an enactment which the- </para>

This is a serious blemish from the stand-point of any person, no matter what his views may be with regard to the broad principles enunciated in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act of 1904. Again, it is provided in this Bill that the certificate of the Registrar is to be conclusive with regard to certain specified persons being members of specified organizations. I do not take so much exception to that provision as has been taken by other honorable senators, because I realize that we want to free the Arbitration Court, as far as possible, from technicalities, such as may arise from time to time. And I should like to direct particular attention to clause 8, which provides for a power of amendment in connexion with industrial disputes. Under this clause, the Court may, at any time before the determination of an industrial dispute, allow the amendment, on such terms as it thinks fit, of a plaint. And there is also power for the Court to grant relief, although such relief has not been formally applied for. I recognise that those are valuable provisions from the point of view of those who desire to get rid of technicalities in the Arbitration Court. I* quite agree with that desire. Possibly, it may please honorable members opposite to see a lawyer assuming that attitude. But that brings me to the provision in regard to the representation of parties by counsel. Section 27 of the principal Act is to be amended by eliminating from it the power at present held by the  President  of the Court, to permit the parties to be represented by counsel. </para>

                            <para>- No. The original Act provides that an organization may _ be represented by one of its members or officers, and that any party not being an organization may be represented by an employe of that party; but that no party shall, except by consent of all the parties, or by leave of the  President,  be represented by counsel or solicitor. It is now proposed to eliminate that provision as to the leave of the  President,  and to provide that it shall be within the power only of the parties themselves to consent to the representation of each side by counsel, solicitor, or paid agent. The value of leaving in the words &#34; by leave of the  President  &#39; &#39; is this : Many complicated matters, involving law as well as fact, have to be dealt with by the  President  of the Arbitration Court. There is no Judge who ever sat on a Bench who would not gladly welcome the assistance of counsel when intricate facts were involved. It is impossible for any Judge to be absolutely possessed of full knowledge on every point that may be raised in connexion with a dispute. The Judge may be a good case lawyer, thoroughly acquainted with all the decisions that have been given by the various Courts; but, even so, he may not have in mind all the cases which counsel might be able to bring before him to assist him in arriving at a judgment. Again, arguments may be adduced by counsel from various decisions, or matters may be put from a different stand-point from that which the Judge would be inclined to take. It, therefore, becomes extremely desirable that, the Judge should have the assistance of skilled men whenever he thinks it desirable. I have been asked whether I have confidence in the  President  of the Court. I have the highest possible opinion of the gentlemen upon our Bench. I believe that their training has been such that they have but one object in view, and that is to act fairly and impartially with regard to all matters that come before them. There are great traditions attaching to the Bench which have been handed down to the present generation of Judges. They desire to live up to those traditions. Of course, the Bench has occasionally been disgraced by men who have not so-lived. But such cases are very exceptional. Our Judges, I am satisfied, desire to be guided by the best traditions. And for that very reason they will- welcome the assistance of counsel in order that cases may be laid before them in the clearest possible manner. The principal Act did not permit employes to be harried by employers through the engagement of counsel or attorneys. Employers had no power to introduce professional men of their own volition. Counsel could only appear when both parties were desirous of having skilled assistance, or when the Judge  thought it desirable that they should be represented.  If  the  President  of the Court gave such a direction in a particular case, we mav depend upon it that he did it for good reasons - probably because he considered the matter involved to be of such importance that it was necessary  to have counsel to assist him in coming to a conclusion. It  will be a great mistake to omit the provision in question from the principal Act. Of course, if counsel may not appear, paid agents ought not to be allowed to appear. </para>

                            <para>- But here we are taking from the Judge the power to get assistance to enable him to arrive at an accurate conclusion as to what was in the mind of Parliament when the legislation in question was passed. He will have to construe the law as best he can. He is not to be bound by the law of evidence, but is to decide everything according to equity and good conscience. Do honorable senators think that there is any one man who is able, in a vast country like this, to decide satisfactorily in all cases that are brought before him, and without legal assistance to ascertain what the mind of Parliament was? I have pointed out that in regard to one question this Bill proposes to express the mind of Parliament emphatically. I allude to the question of preference. The Commonwealth High Court may interpret the provision of this Bill in that regard as being unconstitutional, but, at all events, it is evidently the desire of Parliament that preference shall be granted. I hope that the &#34;Government will find die law, as amended, more satisfactory to work than it appears to be at present. One great complaint against this legislation is that there has been only one class recognised as being entitled to relief or consideration, and that is the wage-earning class. Naturally everybody desires to make his conditions as favorable as possible, but these trade organizations represent only a limited number of the wage-earning class. I do not suppose that a fourth, perhaps not a fifth, of the wage-earning class belong to the trade unions. By establishing an aristocracy in Labour, the trade unions seek to interfere with the &#39;rights of the non-unionists. No man will put his money into an industry which is dependent upon labour unless he can see his way to get a fair return on his capital and skill, so that we have to consider the employer as well as the employed But there is also the vast mass of the people to be considered - the consumers. As we raise the cost of the production of goods, so we raise the cost of living to every one, and, of course, rents, also, must rise. Indeed, the prices of everything must go up. The larger the wage which an employer is called upon to pay, the larger the return which he must get on his investment. My honorable friends on the other side can only go so far and no farther. They should never forget that there is such a thing as killing the  goose  that lays the golden egg. If they are going to raise the cost of carrying on industries beyond a reasonable figure, then the man who erects a house must ask a larger rent in order to get a reasonable return on the increased cost of construction. </para>

If the honorable senator is referring to a certain remark which was made some time ago, that a Judge has not to take into consideration anything more than the individual, I do not agree with it. A man ought to have an  Adequate  wage on which to maintain a wife and family, and give them a decent education. We must always act within reason. Honorable senators on the other side may depend on it that a great many of the criticisms which they hear hurled against Bills which they are in accord with are made with the very best intention, and that is to make them perfect, just, and equitable to every man,  woman,  and child in the community. We cannot legislate for one class without taking into consideration how our legislation is likely to react on other classes. </para>

I think I am entitled to say that on a measure which is of equal importance to wage-earners and to capitalists, large or small, who are engaged in industries, the other side should have paid, if not to us, to the important question itself, the courtesy of assisting us to understand the probable application and effect of this proposed legislation. Perhaps, knowing that they have the numbers, they think that that is a sufficient reason why the Bill should be forced through the Senate without any assistance being rendered by them to us. </para>

I beg to protest, for what it may be worth, against the attitude taken up by honorable senators on the other side. So long as this is a deliberative body, surely measures are entitled to be considered from the various points of view from which they may present themselves to honorable senators. </para>

                            <para>- I shall not obtrude that delicate and sore subject into this discussion. I may have to deal with it in another way. I take it that both sides of the Chamber are anxious to bring to the solution of this very great, question the highest intelligence, combined with the knowledge obtained by observation of industrial operations, and of the effect of this class legislation. I have publicly placed before a larger audience than even this Parliament a desire for further information on a most important social experiment which will try to achieve two objects. One is to improve the conditions of the worker, and, while doing that consistently with equity to the capital on which industry must largely depend, to see if we cannot find, if not a new paradise, at least some vistas through which we can make the conditions of life of the worker and of society somewhat higher and better than they have been. I deprecate strongly every insinuation that there is any party in any Parliament which has a monopoly of that social sympathy which begets a desire to lift the masses on to a higher level, and whatever criticism may be offered in our own Parliament from any side and from any point of view, it would be well to assume that the critics are not animated by class hostility and do not speak from a purely class stand-point. Further, I object to it being insinuated that because we subject measures of this kind to criticism or controversy, which is more or less intended to sift them to the very bottom, we are necessarily hostile either to the principles of the measure or to the advancement of those whom its provisions are intended to benefit. </para>

                            <para>- I object to these interjections, and to the raking up of class prejudices on an occasion&#39; when we are rightly subjecting an important measure tr&#62; criticism. When you&#39; find persons repeatedly proclaiming to the world at large that unless you see eye to eye and line to line with them, without the alteration of even a comma or the dotting of an &#34; i,&#34; in your heart you are an enemy of the great body of workers* you are reminded of the Pharisee who assumed to himself that, because he always stood to the letter of the law, he was better than others who were teaching higher principles of life. Any such conduct shows a bad spirit on the part of those who advocate this Bill. I ask honorable senators to assume for a moment that while we are criticising its provisions we are just as honest in our sympathy with regard to its main object, and just as sincerely desirous to do for al! classes of workers what they wish to do for a particular class, consistently with the welfare of society and of the country at large, as they are. </para>

                            <para>- It is frequently urged, with the intention of gibing at those who criticise these measures, that this legislation is reform. The principal Act was introduced as reform legislation. The intention of _ the reformers, as expressed in that Act, is being made more clear now, and all the time those who are in favour of this kind of legislation are assumed to be in favour of reform and advanced legislation, and, by an almost necessary inference, those who criticise and oppose this Bill are assumed to be Conservatives, and opposed to reform. I wish to inform the Vice-President of the Executive Council that, with respect to preference to unionists, the original Act and the amendments proposed upon it represent, if not letter for letter, certainly in spirit, a resurrection of a whole mausoleum <inline font-style="italic">of.</inline> slabs of legislation from a dead, despotic and barbaric past. What do we know historically about, this class of legislation, giving a single individual power to fix wages, and immense powers generally over labour and industry? Where do we find the origin of it all, and almost word for word the rules and regulations which control and regulate the conduct of various kinds of workmen ? We must trace the records of the industrial history, not of five hundred or one thousand years ago, but of three thousand or four thousand years ago, to find the origin of these tilings.  Therefore  all the critics, newspapers, and others, who brand those who venture to criticise these measures as being Conservative and opposed to reform legislation, use terms which are so misrepresentative of the actual facts that one wonders that in using them they do not turn pale or green. I wish it to be understood that, in opposing this Bill, I am opposing provisions for the origin of which we must look to the past, and the principles of which were rejected in the last half of the nineteenth century. As has been admitted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and as a most cursory glance through the Bill will show, it is proposed to enlarge the powers conferred upon the Arbitration Court under the present Act. And this leads me to an objection I have to the Bill on principle. </para>

                            <para>- There are two methods of dealing with industrial disputes which have been considered very exhaustively in Australia. One is that of compulsory conciliation and arbitration under the Federal jurisdiction, limited by the terms of the Constitution. Another is to be found in the establishment of Wages Boards. Both seek to attain the same end ; but the object of one is to bring, as far as possible, industrial operations under one Federal tribunal, while the other is based upon the idea that the State Parliaments, having almost supreme and sovereign powers within the boundaries of the States, nave the right to set up their own machinery for dealing with industrial disputes in the full light of their knowledge of local circumstances. The two principles are being made in this Bill tq conflict one with the other. </para>

                            <para>- Those who know the history of this Bill are aware that the Government have recognised that, in introducing it, they have transgressed one of the principles of the Constitution. We who subject this measure to criticism, and some objection, recognise that if there are two conflicting jurisdictions dealing with the same matter, sooner or later one must be supreme, and must oust the other. I believe that I do not misunderstand the Bill, or misrepresent the intentions of the Government, when I say that it is their object to give the Commonwealth, so far as they can under the Constitution, supreme power to deal with industrial matters as against the States. Further than that, I believe that it is the intention of the Government to so test the powers of this Parliament under the Constitution in order that, if it is found we have not supreme control over all industrial operations in Australia, they may ask for such an amendment of the Constitution as will give us that power. While some of us have watched patiently, and in the different States have, to some extent, encouraged the idea that Wages Boards established by the State authorities should have supreme jurisdiction over industrial matters within the States, we now see a movement by legislation which can have no other effect, and which, I believe, is intended only to have the effect of&#39; destroying, or weakening as much as possible, the work of the Wages Boards. Prior to Federation, the State Parliaments endeavoured to regulate and control industrial operations. They adopted the principle of Wages Boards as against the principle of compulsory arbitration and conciliation; and I have no doubt that the measure with which we are now asked to deal will, sooner or later, bring about a conflict between the States and the Commonwealth. If there is to be one tribunal established to deal with industrial questions, let me ask what tribunal is better able to determine the conditions that should prevail in any industry than the tribunal set up by the State in which the industry is carried on ? </para>

                            <para>- Let me remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell that it is honorable senators opposite who are Conservative in this matter. It is they who are digging up the past, and we, who are asking that they should carefully consider what they are doing, are really on the side of reform. The State Parliaments have supreme power over all industrial operations, except those which may involve a dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State. Under the Constitution, the Commonwealth has really but a very limited power in the industrial sphere, whilst the State Parliaments, acting strictly within the* limits of their jurisdiction, possess immense power in controlling industrial operations in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- May I be permitted to say that, in connexion with certain of the amendments proposed, some question of Commonwealth and State jurisdiction may arise. For instance, the proposed power to deal with industries established by a State is one which, as I have already said, might involve the jurisdiction of the two authorities. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger were to confine himself to the discussion of such matters,  I  think he would be in order. </para>

                            <para>- I shall accept the suggestion which has been made, and confine my remarks more closely within the scope of the Bill. Let me say that, inasmuch as it is proposed in this Bill to give greater powers to the Court, in making an award of preference to unionists, it must be admitted that that involves the constitutional question. Therefore I beg to give the warning that honorable senators opposite will find themselves upon this matter in conflict with the Constitution. Where, I ask, is it distinctly laid down in the Constitution that preference shall be given to unionists? Our legislation on this question is based on a paragraph in section 51. That provision is confined strictly to the settlement of disputes. I can find in it no allusion to preference. Where do  the Government find it enacted that preference can be declared? The Vice-President of the Executive Council, instead of meeting this difficulty, skimmed over it in such a way as to suggest that he felt unable to cope with it. Those of us who are familiar with the records relative to the framing of the Constitution know that the paragraph relating to conciliation and arbitration occupied the Convention for a long time. It was considered because of the fact that an industrial dispute of great magnitude had threatened disaster to Australia. The Convention knew the injury inflicted on Australia by reason of industrial conflicts&#39;. They therefore desired to give power to the Federal Parliament. But they went no further than to declare that the Commonwealth Court should have power to deal with a dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State. The framers of the Constitution were quite well aware that a section of trade unionists commonly called Socialists desired to have preference to unionists declared. That demand has been made for a long time. On the other hand, some trade unionists were not in favour of the principle of preference. At all events, the framers of the Constitution knew what the principle of preference was. They knew the conflicting views entertained regarding it. But they refrained from mentioning preference in the Constitution for obvious reasons - because if preference to unionists were to be given the State Legislatures had power to grant it completely. </para>

                        <para>. - The matter that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has brought forward has come before me in the shape of a telegram from the Commandant of the Military Forces in Western Australia.

I have been compelled to take up that position, not because of this particular request, but because a practice is growing up, not only in Western Australia; but throughout the Commonwealth, of various organizations - boy scouts, Sunday schools, quadrille parties, bazaar committees, and so forth-which are concerned in organizing tours, picnics, and the like, applying to the Defence Department for the loan of equipment. The Department has been asked to lend such things as tents, mattresses, knives, forks, and spoons, and a&#39; variety of other things. </para>

                            <para>- This practice has grown until it has become really a serious abuse. While I was Minister of Defence in the previous Fisher Administration, while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook was Minister, and again during the second period of my administration, complaints have come from the military authorities regarding the growth of the practice. They have complained that they never could tell in what state they would find their equipment owing to its having been lent. They never knew how much equipment they had available for military purposes. Of course, the various bodies that have borrowed equipment in this manner undertook to -make good any damage, but honorable senators must be well aware that if you lend a tent or . a mattress very often, although no specific damage may be done, at the same time the continual lending leads to deterioration. In this way the property of the taxpayers, which has been purchased for defence purposes, has been seriously impaired. The particular organization alluded to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> is not, as he seemed to me to indicate, connected with the Australian Natives&#39; Association, although the gentleman whose name has been quoted is connected with that body. It is an organization of boys and their parents, which has taken up the very laudable idea of organizing tours to various parts of Australia. The organization is at present engaged in arranging a tour of the gold-fields. The Defence Department has been asked to lend such articles as knives, forks, spoons, and one or two other things which  1  forget for the time being. Of course, the Department has these articles in store. But they are there for the purposes of the annual camps and for any week-end camps that may be held. Honorable senators may know that week-end camps are frequently held in connexion with corps in various parts of the country. It has sometimes been found, after a weekend camp has been arranged, that the equipment was deficient because it had been lent to some private body. I have come to the conclusion, therefore, that the time has arrived when an end should be put to this practice. To show that there is no prejudice, I thought it best to commence putting an end to it in connexion with an affair in my own State. I have therefore directed that, unless otherwise, ordered, the military authorities are not to give leave for the use of military equipment for private institutions. </para>
