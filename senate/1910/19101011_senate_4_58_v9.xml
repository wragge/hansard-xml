                    <para>. - I only rise to draw attention to a fact which I mentioned in my speech on the second reading. I congratulated the Government that they are to pay interest on this advance from the Australian Notes Account. That is only fair to the fund, and I only want the public to know that the Government, as they are to pay  3  or  3½  per cent, to the Trust Fund, might as well have done what the last Government proposed to do in connexion with naval defence and other purposes, and that is to go to the banks here and elsewhere for the  money. They are to pay interest on the advance, and the cost to the country will be the same. </para>

                        <para>- Probably the honorable senator sees with only one eye, whereas I endeavour to see with both. The honorable senator has asked whether the passengers are not able to look after themselves. As a matter of fact, they are not.. They simply book their passages, and very often do not know what berth they are to occupy until they board the vessel. They then have to accept whatever accommodation may be offered them. I wish every person to be dealt with fairly. I do not favour class legislation. What is good for the seamen ought to be equally good for the passengers. In this connexion we must recollect that whilst only half the crew of a vessel simultaneously occupy quarters in the forecastle, the passengers are sometimes accommodated in quarters where there are no port holes, and it is a greater hardship upon them to be so " cribb'd, cabin' d and confined " for days together, especially when others around them are afflicted with seasickness, than it would be upon the crew. </para>

                        <para>- The welfare of the thousands of passengers who travel round our coast should be safeguarded to the best of our ability. I have seen people on board ship so ill that they had to be put off at a port, being unable to proceed on their voyage. I am asking for nothing more than the Bill provides for in the case of seamen, firemen, and apprentices. Surely it is our duty to look after the interests of the travelling public. It has been said that passengers need not travel by ship if they do not like the accommodation provided. But generally people who go aboard a ship have to travel whether they like it or not, and when they engage their berths they do not know what kind of accommodation they will be provided with. </para>

                        <para>- Surely the honorable senator can look at this matter from more than one point of view. I have not contended that -too much consideration has been paid to the comfort of the crew in the past. I simply say that it is our duty to look after the passengers as well. I am well aware that the vessels that have been built in recent years have been fitted with much better accommodation than was formerly the case. But, at the same time, we are not legislating solely for one class of people. We ought to do what is fair and just to all classes who may be affected by this measure. It will be said that the passenger accommodation can be provided for by regulation. But we know very well that regulations are made merely to be broken. There are regulations providing tor both fire and boat drill, but, nevertheless, on some ships the boats are not lowered into the water once in twelve months. </para>

                    <para>. - Clause 268 enables regulation's to be made in regard to " number of passengers to be carried and their accommodation." I know of no more convenient way of dealing with this matter than by regulation. The passenger accommodation naturally varies with each ship, with the length of the voyage, the nature of the seas in which the voyage takes place, and a number of other considerations. The honorable senator will, I am sure, find that the regulations will provide for better accommodation than his amendment would secure. It is a well-known fact that as the law stands the accommodation for passengers is superior to that provided for the crew. Under this Bill we are providing for better accommodation for the crew, and it naturally follows that better accommodation will be provided for the passengers. Already on some of the boats trading on our coasts splendid accommodation is provided for passengers. I am personally acquainted with the accommodation on the vessels trading between Melbourne and Western Australia, and can speak of the improvements that have been effected in recent years. It is by no means likely that the regulations will provide for inferior accommodation to that which is already provided. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister says that this matter can be provided for by regulation, but I remind him that the accommodation for seamen, firemen, and apprentices might be provided for in just the same way. This is a matter for which we should provide definitely in the Bill. If the Government thought it necessary in certain circumstances that increased accommodation, beyond that which I suggest should be provided for in the Bill, should be secured to passengers, there would be nothing to prevent that being done by regulation. We know that it is often the case that honorable senators know nothing of regulations until some difficulty in connexion with them crops up, and then, if any objection is urged, they are told that the regulations were laid on the table some time before, and that objection to them should have been urged then. The Minister has offered no argument against the amendment. He has merely contended that it would be more convenient to have the matter dealt with by regulation. The reply to that is that we have made provision for the accommodation for seamen, firemen, and apprentices in the Bill, and we should provide for passengers in the same way. I am asking nothing unreasonable. I ask that passengers should not be asked to put up with less than 140 cubic feet of space each. I am quite at a loss to understand why the Minister should offer any objection to my amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers.</inline> I think it is important that the minimum of accommodation for passengers should be laid down in the Bill. It would, in my opinion, be a mistake to leave entirely to regulation the comfort and welfare of passengers on ships. They ought to be as much objects of the care of the Legislature as the comfort and welfare of the seamen. One class should be no more to us than the other. I have suffered a great deal of inconvenience in passenger steamers on our coast, and I am sure that people travelling in the steerage of those vessels have had a very much worse time of it than I have had. I have inspected the steerage accommodation in several vessels, and in many cases I found it very inadequate. That is the reason why I think the minimum of space to be allowed to each passenger should be definitely laid down in the Bill. I do not think the minimum proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> is sufficient. It would be for those who frame the regulations under this Bill to prescribe such an increase in the accommodation the honorable senator proposes as might be considered necessary, but there should be something to guide them in the measure itself. I think that the Minister might very well accept the amendment. </para>

But this is not the part of the Bill in which the matter should be dealt with. We are dealing here with the accommodation required for the crew. As I have already stated, this matter of accommodation for passengers is dealt with in Part III. of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894, which is in force not only in England, but in all British dominions. </para>

                        <para>- That is the theory of the Imperial law on the subject; but all necessary provision is made for the proper  accommodation of steerage passengers. All that we can do is to make provision in this Bill that the Governor-General may, by proclamation, lay down certain rules. The Imperial authorities have in the most careful way laid down rules governing this matter of the accommodation for passengers. If any honorable senator takes the trouble to look at schedule 10 of the Imperial Act of 1894 he will see that provision is made for the thickness of the bulkheads, the size of the bunks, the distance they must be from the deck, the number of tiers of bunks permitted, and a hundred and one other things. All those provisions are law here, and I believe we have no power to alter a single section of the Imperial Act. Under clause 268 of this Bill, full provision is made for the issue of regulations which may cover all the provisions included in the Imperial Act for the accommodation of passengers. I have here a copy of the " Memorandum of Part III. of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894." It is dated " Marine Department, Board of Trade, May, 1895." It is issued by the Board of Trade, and, so far as I know, there is nothing later dealing with the subject. I quote the following - </para>

He is under the impression that the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act dealing with passengers will be applicable. But I am of opinion that, so far as the coasting trade is concerned, the Minister will have the right to make regulations, the effect of which will be to supersede those provisions. I do not think that the Minister's power will be in any way hampered if he makes any regulations, but that question can be more appropriately discussed when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> submits his amendment on clause 268. Notice was given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> of his intention to move that the air space for a seaman or apprentice be reduced from 140 to 120 cubic feet. Unfortunately, he is not present to-day, and in his absence I move - </para>

                <para class="block">This proposal was argued in the general discussion which took place on clause 136 of the Bill. It is identical in terms with section 64 of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1906. It also follows, verbatim I believe, the provision in the New Zealand </para>
                <para class="block">Shipping Act of 1909. A provision somewhat similar to this clause was contained in the New Zealand Act of 1906, but in 1909, for reasons which, I suppose, were sufficiently good, it was repealed and replaced with the provision of which my amendment is a copy. I would point out to the Minister that it is a slight concession to make. Although in some respects it may not be necessary to make this deduction with regard to the large ships which are engaged in the coasting trade, yet in the case of the limited coast-trade ships, as was pointed out in the discussion on clause 136, and also to some extent in the case of river and bay ships, the space for the accommodation of the seamen has to be carefully looked into, not merely from the point of view of convenience, but also from the point of view of the vessels' carrying capacity. If the Minister can see his way to grant this concession to the limited coast-trade ships, if not to the Australian coast-trade ships, I think that it will be welcomed by the shipping trade. </para>

                        <para>- I was going on to say that, in my opinion, the amendment if made will not be disagreeable to the seamen of Australia, provided that the matter is left to the discretion of the Minister, at any rate with regard to a limited number of the coast-trade ships. In a matter of this kind we have to consider two things, namely, the  undesirableness  of hampering trade by unduly limiting the carrying capacity of vessels, and the necessity for insuring that our seamen shall be properly treated. I do not share <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> fears that it would be disadvantageous to the seamen if a reduction were made in the accommodation proposed to be allocated to them. </para>

                    (Western AustraliaMinister of Defence) [3-56l-- 1 would direct the attention of the Committee to the fact that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline>
                    intended to follow up this amendment with a proposal to leave out clause 138, under which relief will be provided to ship-owners. Under that provision, the Minister is empowered by order in writing to exempt a ship built before the commencement of this Act from the conditions laid down in paragraphs
                    <inline font-style="italic">a</inline>
                    and

                    of the clause now under consideration, if he be satisfied that the accommodation provided for officers and men is not insanitary, or that all such alterations have been made as are in his opinion necessary to make that accommodation sanitary.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline>
                    desires to make an arbitrary exemption in the case of ships registered in Australia before the commencement of the Act. It is not the intention of the Government to use this clause for the purpose of crippling our maritime industry, or of injuring it in any way. But there are a number of ships on the Australian coast upon which by means of structural alterations the desired accommodation can be provided. The amendment, if carried, would not render it obligatory on the part Qf the owners of those vessels to make such alterations. Consequently, I do not think that we should adopt it. All that we provide is that where a ship can conveniently be altered so as to provide the necessary accommodation, the alteration shall be made. If structural alterations cannot conveniently be made they will not be insisted upon. In that case the only condition which will be enforced will be that the accommodation shall be sanitary.

                        <para>- Under the Board of Trade provisions a seaman, even in the tropics, is allowed only 4 quarts per day for the purpose of cooking his food, washing, and drinking. Take the case of seamen who have left Newcastle, Sydney, Melbourne, or Adelaide, where they have been engaged in coaling operations. They are just as black as are the men who are engaged in the engine-room. To imagine that they are able to remove the dirt from their faces with the aid of salt water is ridiculous. </para>

                        <para>- They had to remain dirty. I have had to go without a wash for weeks at a time. Further, a seaman who is required to wash in salt water gets his eyes full of salt, so that he is unable to keep an efficient lookout. I would remind the Committee that the clause is not intended to apply to sailing ships, but only to steamers. Most of the latter vessels are fitted with ballast tanks, in which they carry fresh water, and in the great majority of them the adoption of my amendment would not involve an additional expenditure of <inline font-style="italic">j£i</inline> per annum. This leaves out the men connected with the boilers, those who come from the combustion chambers at the back of the boilers, covered in soot, and those who come out of the bilges covered with grease. They are expected to clean themselves with salt water. My amendment was placed upon the paper last week, and I thought that it dealt with so trifling a matter that there would be no difficulty in securing the consent of the Minister. </para>

                    <para>. - What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> asks for seems to be a small concession, and to refuse it is somewhat disagreeable. But, until we know the full effect of what is proposed, we can hardly agree to the amendment. The honorable senator treats matters of this kind rather lightly. The clause has been carefully considered by the Government, who had before them the recommendations of the Navigation Commission. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> can show that the concession can be made without inconvenience to the working of ships, I am sure that the Minister of Defence would be willing to accept it, and no single member of the Senate would refuse his assent. </para>

                <para class="block">I have travelled in ships in which I was not able to obtain hot fresh water. One can usually get plenty of hot salt water. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> mean to tell us that he would be satisfied with a gallon of hot fresh water per man? lt would be absolutely ridiculous to give a man coming out of the stokehold so small a. quantity. What is intended by the clause is that ships shall supply their men with baths. I understand that the representative of the Seamen's Union who gave evidence before the Navigation Commission did not recommend that hot fresh water should be supplied, and only one witness advocated such a thing. The Bill goes further than the recommendations of the Commission, and I trust that the clause will be agreed to as it stands. </para>

                        <para>- It is true that hot salt water is supplied to passengers in their baths; but it has to be remembered that a first-class passenger merely wants a bath to refresh himself, and not to cleanse him after doing very dirty work. In vessels trading on the north-west coast men have to handle cattle. In clearing up after work of that kind, is it not necessary that they should be supplied with hot fresh water for a bath? Such a provision is essential in the interests of sanitation. If the Minister of Defence had ever had to clear up decks after coaling, he would have demanded hot fresh water. This concession would mean nothing to the steam-ship companies. My amendment would not mean an extra expense of  ^1  a year to a ship. </para>

                    <para>. - The amendment may seem to refer to a small matter, but it involves a great amount of convenience to seamen. One can easily imagine that on a long voyage it may become necessary to shift coal from one part of a vessel to another, as the coal near the furnaces becomes exhausted. That work is done by the sailors. When the day's work is over, the engine-room staff and the trimmers would be supplied with hot fresh water for cleansing purposes, and it would create ill feeling if such conveniences were not also supplied to the seamen. It is true that the Navigation Commission did not make such a recommendation, but we have not adhered strictly to the recommendations of the Commission in all respects. This is a matter as to which we might very well make a concession. Seamen, after doing some work, become as black and begrimed, and are as much in need of fresh water, as firemen or trimmers. The proposal would involve little or no expense. The facilities available for providing hot water for the engine-room staff would be sufficient to provide hot water for the members of the crew. I emphasize the anomaly which would be created if we provided that hot water should be supplied for a particular section of the crew of a vessel, and should not be provided for another section when engaged in precisely the same work. Hitherto it has been regarded as a privilege for the members of a crew to be supplied with hot 'water. On our coasting vessels, if a man is chummy with the cook and provides his own bucket, it is placed on the gratings of the ship near the funnel, and water warmed for him ; but no seaman has heretofore been entitled, "as a right, to a comfortable bath. We are, in this Bill, considering the wisdom of making such a provision for the comfort of a section of the crew of a vessel, but the Bill draws the line at the seamen. </para>

                        <para>- I recognise that, while a vessel was in port, there might be some difficulty in complying with the proposed provision. The practice adopted at present is to have a tank placed at the foot of the funnel. Water is pumped into this tank from the ballast tanks, and piping is provided to carry the water, when it is heated, to any part of the ship in which it is required. So far as cost is concerned, the amendment would involve no more than the actual cost of the water required to give it effect, and water can be obtained at all the principal seaports for something like is. per 1,000 gallons, and that quantity of water would go a long way if used for this purpose. The heat required is at present going to waste. </para>

                        <para>- I have admitted that difficulty ; but neither sailors nor firemen, as a rule, handle coal while the vessel is in port. Sailors are often employed in handling coal on long voyages on steamers running down to the Islands, or to the far north of Queensland, when sufficient coal for the voyage cannot be "stored in the neighbourhood of the furnaces. When they are engaged in this work, they should not be treated differently from other members of the crew engaged in the same work. </para>

                    <para>.- My objection to the amendment is that it would be very difficult to supply the seamen with hot water when a vessel was in port. We know that some men are unreasonable, and a seaman might ask for hot water when he knew it was next to impossible to provide it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has admitted that it would be difficult to supply hot water to the seamen if the ship were in port for two or three days, and her fires were out. This might lead to a lot of trouble if we made a special provision that members of the crew asking for hot water should be entitled to get it. We might provide that seamen should be entitled to hot water when they are employed in handling coal. </para>

                        <para>- I have done some painting, and I can take paint off without hot water. I am prepared to do what is reasonable in these matters, but if we were to make the proposed provision compulsory in the case of seamen, it might lead to a lot of trouble. If, under the amendment, seamen who asked for hot water were not supplied with it, the master would be liable to a penalty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> in dealing w'ith another clause, was strong on the necessity for regulations, and surely this is a matter which might be easily provided for by regulation. </para>

It has been admitted by the Government that while they hope that the Bill will pass through the Senate this year, there is reasonable ground for assuming that it will not pass through the other House. In other words, there must be an interval of twelve months before it can be passed. I take it that the construction of a good many ships will be begun during the ensuing year, and that I submit, is a very good reason why the Minister ought to accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I trust that the Minister will not accept the amendment, because due notice of the intended enactment of this provision has already been given. This clause, with very slight alterations, has appeared in every Navigation Bill which has Been brought before the Senate, and every ship-owner who contemplated building a ship has known exactly the intention of the Government regarding the accommodation to be provided. If does not take very long nowadays to build a ships and undoubtedly all ship-owners have had full notice of our intended requifemerits. I know that some men who Went Home to supervise the building of some steam-ships which are running to-day were instructed to comply with the provisions contained in the Navigation Bill of  1904.  I think that the Committee will be well advised in adhering to the clause. </para>

                    <para>. - We cannot accept the amendment. In any case, it would not be right to exempt a ship in course of construction before the commencement Of the Act, because the introduction of the measu're was in itself a notification of our intention in that regard. Otherwise we might find some steam-ship owners rushing in the get vessels built in the interim. If honorable senators will refer to the Bill of  1904  they Will find that the alterations in the clause as to accommodation are not very drastic. They will see that, instead of an air space of  120  cubic feet, we propose one of  140  cubic feet, that instead of  18  super. feet measured on the deck we propose  20  super. feet, and that instead of  4  feet between the bunks we propose not less than  5  feet. I think it will be found on examination that the necessary alterations to comply with the clause, if enacted, will not involve structural alterations of the ship. It will be just a question of the number of men accommodated in any particular portion of the ship and the arrangement of the bunks. The number of bunks put into a certain space can determine the air space. Suppose that a ship has been built in compliance with the provisions of the Bill of  1904.  The alterations we have made in this Bill will not involve a structural alteration. They will simply involve the provision of further accommodation in some other part of her. That being so, I do not think that the Committee ought to make an amendment which would be a distinct encouragement to ship-owners to build according to the old lines, hoping for am exemption. And as, after all, it will rest with the Minister to grant an exemption. I trust that the honorable senator will not press his amendment. </para>

                    LEDGER (Queensland) [4:441.-suppose that this Bill had been brought in for the first time, the justice of the amendment would at once commend itself to the Government. In fact, I can hardly imagine ally Government supporting a Navigation. Bill without such a clause, providing that their intention to pass it into law was

                    But, unfortunately, this measure has been used for the last four years as. a means by which the Senate might' amuse itself. This is the first time that we have had a chance of getting to downright business.- It is quite possible that ship-owners never took seriously the Bill of 1004 or the Bill of 1906. But they have to take this measure seriously, because, so far as the Senate is concerned, it is going to be carried through this session with the generous assistance of the Opposition. I think it is only an accident, to which the Committee ought not to attach too much weight, that ship-owners have had previous notice. After all, that notice was more or less a sham. The point of view from which the amendment ought to be considered is that the measure is brought in seriously for the first time. It was introduced here on the 24th August, and if the Minister will accept a modification of my amendment to the effect that it should not apply to ships under construction after that date that concession would be appreciated. I think that the Government and their supporters are not entitled to say that because two Bills have been brought in for our consideration when we, as well as the public, knew that they were only brought in for the Senate to play with, that fact ought to be used as against the just demand of ship-owners and ship-builders in the case of a measure which is brought in for the first time.

                    <para>. - In answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> remarks, I may say that there is a necessity for this provision in the case of seamen who are constantly travelling. Ordinary citizens reside in certain districts, so that they experience no difficulty in getting their wills duly witnessed. But seamen are in the habit of moving from place to place, so that if their services were requisitioned as witnesses to a will, some difficulty might subsequently arise in finding them. The clause therefore provides that the wills of seamen. shall be witnessed by persons whose whereabouts are well known. The provision affords protection against crimping, and is in the interests of the seamen. </para>

It implies that if an Australian sailor chooses to say that he is above the law. he can maintain that contention. It is hard to understand why such a proviso has been inserted.

                    <para>. - It seems to me that the proviso to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> has called attention practically offers a premium for Australian sailors to desert. Surely we must provide for fair play all round. If an Australian voluntarily enters into an engagement to serve on a foreign ship, we should not offer an inducement to him to desert. I am in favour of deleting the proviso. </para>

                    <para>. - I am afraid that some honorable senators do not fully appreciate the disadvantages of service on board some foreign ships. A man may join a foreign ship knowing very little of the law of the country from which it comes. Later on, he may realize where he has landed himself. The evidence obtained by the Navigation Commission revealed the brutality practised on board some foreign vessels visiting Australian waters, and even the brutal nature of the laws of some foreign countries. If an Australian sailor, after signing articles to serve on a foreign ship, realizes that he has made a mistake, we should not by our law force him to remain in that predicament. Our policy should be to retain every man Ave have in the country. If an Australian sailor is foolish enough to sign articles for service on a foreign ship, we should not force him to stay on board if he realizes that he has made a mistake. By so doing, we should do a much greater injustice than could occur under the proviso. </para>

                        <para>- It ought to be our policy to prevent such occurrences. The Minister cannot for a moment defend such a proviso. Suppose that an American master in the port of Melbourne having completed his crew, is just ready to sail, and that all the Australian sailors who have signed on with him suddenly determine to leave. Under this clause, they can defy the master, and the law will say to him, " You have no remedy, and cannot obtain an order against the deserters without their own consent." No such provision is to be found in the laws of any other country. When a man is signing on in any country, he is not asked whether he is an Australian, an Englishman, an Irishman, or a Scotchman. </para>

                    <para>- I am afraid that my colleagues on this side do not fully appreciate the reason why the Government have introduced this proviso. They have a very good reason for it. It is part of their new immigration policy. The object of the proviso is to encourage desertion from vessels  when  they arrive in Australia. That is, possibly, the only reason which can be given for it. If agreed to, it would be a standing invitation to other nations to retaliate against Australian seamen on the same lines, or to seek for some other means of retaliation. As no benefit could arise from the proviso other than the imaginary one I have satirically suggested, and as it -might involve us in international complications, the Minister would do well to agree to its omission. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable senators opposite have failed to understand what is behind this proviso. Punishment for desertion from a British ship in a British port has been abolished. We have in this Bill provided that an Australian seaman deserting from an Australian ship shall not be liable to punishment, except as the result of a civil action. I am satisfied that every honorable senator opposite believes in a fair trial for every man charged with the commission of an offence. </para>

                        <para>- Without this proviso, an Australian citizen signing foreign articles in a foreign country might leave the vessel when it reaches Australia, and, without any trial, and merely on the oath of the master that he had deserted, might be forced to return to the ship against his consent. We should be making a distinction between an Australian citizen who signs on in an Australian ship and one who signs on in a foreign ship. A master would only have to go before a justice of the peace and make oath that the seaman had deserted his ship. The justice would issue a warrant, and the Consul for the nation to whom the ship belonged would be at liberty, if we do not adopt this provision, to have an Australian citizen arrested and put on board the ship without a trial ; although, if the man deserted from an Australian ship, he could only be proceeded against by civil action. The object of the proviso is to place an Australian citizen shipping on board a foreign ship in as good a position as an Australian shipping on board an Australian ship, or as an Englishman shipping on board a British ship in Great Britain. Suppose an Australian seaman signed on for a Portuguese ship, and,  after  leaving Australia, it was proposed to take the vessel to Portugal, which is just now in a very unsettled condition. The man might say, " I am not going to a country in which there is a civil war being carried on. I shall remain in Australia, and I am prepared to abide by any civil action you care to bring against me. I decline to be delivered on board the ship." Without this provision, the Consul representing Portugal could have that man put in irons and delivered on board the vessel. That is what would happen. </para>

                    <para>- - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has told us a marvellous story about a man signing on in Australia on a foreign ship to go to Portugal, where there is a bit of a " scrap " going on just now. But we should deal with an average case. We can assume that, before a seaman signs on, he knows where the ship is going. If, for instance, an Australian citizen, while in the United States, signs on for a round voyage, including Australia,  are we going to provide that, as soon as the ship reaches Australia, the man may desert, on the ground that he is an Australian citizen ; whilst, in similar circumstances, if he were an American, he might be dealt with? I say that, in agreeing to this proviso, we shall be degrading ourselves, and inviting foreign nations to place our seamen travelling in foreign countries in a worse position than they occupy now. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister has admitted that this is a novel provision, and is not to be found in any other Navigation Act. It proposes what is absolutely unfair, and would disgrace us in the eyes of the world. It proposes that we should say to the nations of the world, " We are going to regulate the shipping of Australia as we think fit. We intend to regulate your shipping in Australian waters as we think fit, and to permit Australian citizens to desert from your ships in any Australian port, if they claim to be Australian." There is no provision requiring the men to prove that they are Australian citizens. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie said just now that the moment a Britisher arrived here on a ship, he would be practically considered an Australian. I do not consider that a man is an Australian, even though he belongs to the British Empire, until he has been here long enough to qualify for a vote. We are putting ourselves in a false position in the eyes of the world when we provide that, if a foreign ship comes out here with a crew of fifty or sixty men, one of them can step ashore and claim immunity from the penalties which apply to a deserter, because he happens to be an Australian citizen. If a deserter is an Australian citizen, the first thing he should be made to do is to prove that he is. A citizen is a man who has civic rights. An Englishman who steps off a ship on to our soil is not an Australian until he acquires civic rights. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> moved an amendment which, to my mind, would make the proviso even worse than it is. We are framing a Navigation Act for Australia j and, while I do not agree with the proviso, I can understand it applying to Australian citizens, but not to any one who is not an Australian citizen, whether he be a Scotchman or an Irishman, or whether he comes from Jamaica. I shall be under the painful necessity of voting against the amendment, and afterwards, unless I can find a <inline font-style="italic">modus vivendi</inline> with the Government, of pressing to a division an amendment to delete the proviso. </para>

Suppose that a " British citizen," whatever that term may mean, was engaged on a foreign ship, and deserted her in an Australian port, he could, under this clause, be put on board. But suppose that an Australian came to Australia on a foreign vessel for a round trip, he might desert her, and nothing could be done, except with his consent. </para>

                        <para>- Yes : he could be tried and fined. Apparently, the clause forbids the Courts being used to put an Australian on to a foreign ship whose articles he has signed : but when a British citizen comes to Australia on a foreign ships and deserts her, the Minister will be bound to see that our Courts are used to put that man on board here. How is he going to justify the distinction which is made between an " Australian citizen " and a "British citizen"? What is the meaning of the former phrase as compared with the latter? It may be that every Australian citizen is a British citizen ; but  it is clear, from the proviso, that every British citizen is not an Australian citizen. The phrase "Australian citizen" must be taken to be used in this provision in contradistinction to every other citizen or citizenship in the world. If the intention is that no distinction shall be made between "Australian citizenship" and- " British citizenship," what is the objection to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers'</inline> amendment? What distinction is there in the mind of the Government between Australian citizenship and British citizenship? If there is no difference, on what grounds have their legal advisers come to that conclusion? But if there is a distinction between the two things, it means that, whilst the Minister will not enforce the law as against the Australian citizen who deserts a ship, he will enforce it against the British citizen who becomes a deserter. If there is an indignity or an injustice in enforcing the provision against an Australian citizen by reason of his birth, surely equal indignity and injustice will attach to its enforcement in the case of a person born in any part of the United Kingdom. The more the proviso is examined the more stupid and farcical and unjust does it appear to be. Why should <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> for example, simply because he is an Australian, be entitled to desert from a foreign ship in an Australian port, and to say, " I shall not go back to the ship ; you can fine me ^5 or is.," whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline> simply because he happened to be born in the United Kingdom, could be put on board a foreign ship if he deserted from it in an Australian port? </para>

He has his ' Australian citizenship within the jurisdiction of Australia, but <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> also has his British privileges as a native of Great Britain. A person born in Australia has the protection of Great Britain, and a citizenship of that country. If every Australian citizen is also a British citizen, why is the word " Australian " used exclusively here? If the term "Australian citizen " must of necessity imply a British citizen, then the shipping law will be in conflict with foreign law, because, under this measure you give to the Britisher a privilege which you do not give to the foreigner. If " Australian " includes a Britisher you encourage the desertion of </para>

                    <para>-- I would not use the term " international indiscretion," but the term " Australian partiality." I think that one of the glories of Britishers is that their laws treat all persons alike. An attempt is being made to bolster up the proviso to this clause by depicting the condition of affairs on a foreign ship, and the tyranny that is practised there, and so on. An Australian seaman ought to know the conditions on foreign ships before he signs on. If they are of the character which has been described, he ought not to venture upon them. We ought to insist upon Australians keeping their bargains, in the same way as any one else ; otherwise we ought not to insist upon others doing so. We are told that there will be a civil remedy, but the clause which provides a civil remedy against a deserter has been quite altered in the case of this Bill. Before a deserter can be proceeded against thereunder, proceedings must have been taken against him previous to the ship leaving port. If no action has been taken prior to a ship's departure from Australia, then proceedings against a deserter cannot be carried on. </para>

If we wish to free Australia from the condition of affairs that has been pictured by honorable senators opposite in the case of foreign vessels, we ought to be equally anxious to  free Britishers who have deserted, from liability to be returned to those vessels. </para>

                        <para>- Only in cases where the proceedings have been instituted for desertion against a seaman, and a warrant has been issued for his arrest before the departure of his ship. The clause is a very unfair one as between individuals, and is a grossly impolitic one as between nations. It will certainly invite reprisals from other Powers. At a later stage I shall move that the following words be added to the clause, " provided that in  the  case of any seaman who objects no such order shall be made without his consent." We have no more right to return to his ship a foreign seaman who is afraid that he will be treated with injustice or brutality than we have to return an Australian seaman. Let us treat all with justice. </para>

                    <para>A considerable amount of evidence was received in connexion with the supply and discharge of seamen of foreign-going ships. Some of this was so sensational that, had it not been amply corroborated, its accuracy might well have been doubted. The witnesses, it may be remarked, were not recruited from any one class, but represented, indifferently, all sections of the community. From board inghousc-keepers, shipmasters, seamen, lawyers, merchants, doctors, and police the same testimony was received. As it would be impossible to suppose that witnesses of so representative a character would mislead your Commissioners, they were forced to the conclusion that fresh legislation in this matter is most urgently needed. </para>

                    <para>. - I point out that this clause does not deal with " shanghaied " seamen. It deals with seamen who absent themselves from duty. We have all read with a good deal of disgust in the Commission's report of sailors who have been ' ' hocussed ' ' in lodging-houses and, while drugged, put on board ship, knowing nothing about it until they found themselves at sea. But this clause would not touch such cases. There are ships coming to Australia having on board sailors of many nationalities. If one of them happened to be an Australian citizen, he could desert and escape punishment. </para>

We are asking Governments in other parts of the world to recognise that, if an Australian engages, say, at San Francisco, to serve on board an American ship and to come to Melbourne, he can, when the vessel reaches Newcastle, where, perhaps, she loads up with coal to go to Valparaiso, walk off the ship with impunity. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has argued as though the men would be engaged in Australia ; but the clause will apply to men who have engaged elsewhere, and who come to this country. We shall be putting ourselves in an absurdly -bad position in the eyes of the world. </para>

                        <para>- Whether the Imperial authorities will consent to the Bill I do not know ; but I am sure that we are making a mistake in providing that a man who is an Australian citizen can claim special exemption in Australia, in spite of an agreement made in some other country. I ask the Government seriously to reflect on what they are doing. The Minister admits that this is quite a novel provision, and he has not attempted to justify it. I think we are making a very great mistake. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator must know that many sailors who were born nowhere near London give that city as the place of their birth. I had two or three sailors' discharges before me the other day, and on them the men were described as British subjects. Men might be employed on a foreign ship under conditions so bad that no Court would say they were not justified in leaving it, and in such a case it would be most invidious to provide that while an Australian citizen could not be compelled to return to the ship after deserting it, an Englishman, an Irishman, or a Scotchman might be taken on board without his consent. I do not wish to waste time in discussing the amendment, and perhaps the Minister will say whether he is willing to accept it, as I was led to believe he would. </para>

The question at issue was whether Minahan was or was not an immigrant within the meaning of the Immigration Restriction Act. If he was an Australian-born citizen, obviously he could not be an immigrant. The High Court held that he was not an immigrant, because he was born in Australia. Although he had left Australia for twenty-five years, he was held to be an Australian citizen. The judgment of the High Court is summed up in these words - </para>

                    <para>But anterior, both in older of thought and in order of time, to the concepts of nationality and domicil, is another, upon which both are founded, and which is, I think, an elementary part of the concept of human society, namely, the division of human beings into communities. From this it follows that every person becomes at birth a member of the community into which he is born, and is entitled to remain in it until excluded by some competent authority. It follows also that every human being (unless outlawed) is a member of some community, and is entitled to regard the part of the earth occupied by that community as a place to which he may resort when he thinks fit. In the case of <inline font-style="italic">Musgrave</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Chun</inline><inline font-style="italic">Teeong</inline><inline font-style="italic">Toy</inline> (1) it _ was held that an alien (though an alien friend) has no legal right to enter a country of which he is not a native. Yet, unless he is outlawed from human society, he must be entitled to enter some community. So, by process of exclusion, we are certain that there is at least one part of the world to which every human being, not an outlaw, can claim the right of entry when he thinks fit. </para>

                <para class="block">On that argument, an Australian citizen by birth continues to be an Australian citizen unless he loses the right, as the result of the action of some competent authority. That, I take it, would be a law of the Commonwealth dealing with citizenship, and citizenship I take to be the right to take part in the government of the country. That is conferred by the Franchise and Electoral Acts and by the Naturalization Act. We, therefore, may conclude that those who are eligible to exercise the rights of citizenship, whether born in the country, or arriving in it later, are Australian citizens. A British seaman would not be eligible to exercise the rights of citizenship in the Commonwealth until he had been here for three months. I do not think we should accept the amendment, because the British Imperial Parliament legislates for British seamen, and their legislation follows him into any of the British Dominions. It is not for us to legislate for the British seaman. It is sufficient that we should legislate for those for whom we are authorized to legislate. </para>

                        <para>- We have already in this Bill assumed the power to legislate for British seamen. Complications are bound to arise under this proviso. There are thousands of men who are not domiciled in Australia who have the right to vote. If British seamen or persons who have become naturalized British subjects have been six months in Australia, they are entitled to vote in this country. I take the case of a British seaman who has resided for six months in Australia, and so become entitled to a vote, and who has afterwards gone abroad. I assume that he signs on in the United States for a vessel making a round voyage. The owner or master of the vessel might know nothing of the fact that he had resided in Australia and become an Australian citizen. He comes out here, and immediately says, "I am an Australian citizen." Where is the thing to end, and who is to decide?" <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has given us a definition of what he calls an " Australian citizen," but I think that the term includes a great deal more than he has stated. We have to recognise that if a foreigner comes here, and becomes naturalized, he is an Australian citizen. But do other countries recognise our act ? I know that Germans who have come to Australia without having served their term in the German army, and remained here for twenty years, have been arrested immediately on putting their feet on German soil, although they were Australian citizens. </para>

                        <para>- It has. It shows that we cannot prevent that from taking place. Suppose that such a man joins in Hamburg a ship bound to Australia, and on her arrival here, says, " I am an Australian citizen," although Germany claims him as its subject, what will be the position ? There is not the slightest doubt that if this proviso is enacted in its present form we shall get embroiled with foreign Powers. It is all very well for the Minister to smile at that remark, but he knows that the proviso, if enacted, is likely to bring about trouble. </para>

                        <para>- It is all very well' for us to get a little swelled head, and to imagine that we are the universe, but we cannot enact a provision which is in conflict with international law, and say that we do not care what may happen. I know that, in introducing the clause, the Minister said that he knew of no similar provision, and that he did not feel very sure about its validity. I do not know whether he feels any surer now on that point than he did then. I am aware that he has a following at his back strong enough to pass the proviso, but he must not forget that if it is enacted, it may endanger the whole measure, because, so long as Australia is part of the British Empire, it is not likely that we shall be allowed to make any law which may embroil Great Britain with other countries. </para>

                        <para>- I am entitled in Australia to everything which an Australian is entitled to, but I am still a British subject, and so is the honorable senator. If an Australian seaman went to the Old Country, he would receive exactly the same justice and fair play as if he had been born in the United Kingdom.  But this clause makes the clear distinction that because a man has been born in Australia, or has lived here long enough to get the franchise, he is an Australian citizen. Suppose that this clause is enacted, and that a seaman from the Old Country comes out here in a foreign ship. Another member of the crew can desert and say, " I am an Australian citizen, and I decline to go back to the ship," and the law of the country will permit him to walk away. Why should the other man, because he was born in England or Ireland or Scotland, be liable under our law to be taken on board in irons? Is it not invidious to draw that very wide distinction between the two men? We are not here for the purpose of enacting a provision of that character. I do not know how it ever came to pass the draftsman. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, he may. But he practically has no citizenship rights. It would be a mistake to allow a French or German Consul, in substitution of our law Courts, to order the return of an Australian seaman to a foreign vessel. </para>

                    <para>- - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Guthrie</inline> has thrown an entirely new light on this proviso. When I first objected to an Australian seaman who had signed articles on a foreign vessel, being placed in a better position than the other members of the crew, I did so from a sense of justice. But I now find that this clause is intended to be a portion of an anti-emigration Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has told us that it is intended to prevent Australians from escaping from-  Australia. </para>

                        <para>- That is what the honorable senator said. He declared that we were going to allow Australian seamen an opportunity to escape from this country if they desired to do so. He then quoted French maritime law quite forgetful of the fact that that country is under  a system of conscription. No man is at liberty to leave France unless he pan prove that he has served his time in the army or unless he can be brought back at a moment's notice to complete it. If an Australian seaman at Cape Town, Durban, or any other port outside the Commonwealth deliberately signs an agreement for a round voyage, I do say that to allow him to step ashore on reaching a Commonwealth port,, and thus to flout his agreement, whilst compelling other members of the crew to return to their vessel, is manifestly unjust. To say that only some civil penalty shall . be inflicted upon him- </para>

                <para class="block">I believe they understand the law just as well as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> himself does. I do not believe that an Australian seaman who happens to have gone to the Old Country on a ship, and who joins a foreign vessel at Havre, where he signs, for a voyage to Australia, would be such a nincompoop as to sign articles without understanding what they meant. Yet, that is the assumption underlying the argument of honorable senators opposite. I am not taking exception to the clause as far as it relates to Australians who, in Australia, sign articles to serve on board a foreign ship, and then, for some extraordinary reason, decline to proceed with her. Why such a case should occur, I do not know, except where a sailor may. have indulged too much. But that really has nothing to do with the clause, which is intended to deal with an Australian sailor who joins a ship in a foreign port, comes out with her to Australia, and then breaks his articles. I contend that there is no reason why an Australian, under such circumstances, should be placed on a different footing from an American, a Frenchman, or a German. I cannot vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers'</inline> amendment, because he seeks to make the clause apply still more widely. I do not care whether the sailors affected are Australian or British; when they come to Australian waters, they should all be treated on the same basis. As to the term " Australian citizen," I ventured, by interjection, to say that I did not believe that a man could claim to be an Australian citizen unless he had remained in this country sufficiently long to enable him to exercise the franchise. The Minister of Defence read portions of a judgment of the High Court in a certain case. But what he read did not deal with the question of what 'is an Australian citizen. The passages he quoted related to what is an immigrant or a prohibited immigrant. I have consulted two or three law dictionaries in which the expression " citizen " is defined in a somewhat unsatisfactory manner. A citizen is said to be a man who lives in a city and has the franchise of that city. But, turning to <inline font-style="italic">Webster's Dictionary,</inline> T  find that a citizen is defined as -  one who enjoys the freedom and privileges of a city;, a freeman as distinguished from a foreigner, or one not entitled to its franchise ; : . . . a person, native or naturalized, of either sex, who owes allegiance to a Government, and is entitled to reciprocal protection from it. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that the phrase is used there. At any rate, it is not defined here; and it certainly is not covered by the judgment that has been quoted. I presume that an Aus-' tralian citizen is either a natural-born Australian or a person who has been naturalized in Australia, or, at all events, one who has; gained the franchise here. I am still impressed by the idea that we are making a great mistake in saying to foreign countries, " When your ships arrive in Australia, any man on board who can claim that he is an Australian, may break his articles." No provision is made to the effect that a man making this claim must prove that he is an, Australian citizen. I remind honorable' senators of what occurred a few years ago.' A great outcry was raised in South Africa' about a large number of " Australian citizens ' ' who were left stranded after the' war. The Commonwealth Government,, and I think some State Governments also, contributed money to enable those people to be brought to Australia. A number came over. We know the very unpleasant subsequent history of a considerable percentage of them. Those who read the Police Court reports, and other reports, which appeared soon after they arrived in this country, know what sort of people they were. It was to the interests of the Governments concerned to find out who were Australian citizens then. Yet, it is doubtful whether all the persons brought over were Australian citizens in fact. In this: case, we are going to lay ourselves open,' not only to the danger of being deceived5 by the use of this phrase, but, under ' <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers'</inline> amendment, either British' or Australian citizens would be able to claim exemption. I should be glad to see the proviso struck out; but, as that cannot be done, I enter my strongest protest against it. I have every reason to hope that when the Bill reaches another place, the proviso will be relegated to the dark-' ness from which it ought never to have' emerged. </para>

                    <para>. - As to the difference between an Australian citizen and any other person who has signed articles on board a ship, the position is clear. An Australian who has signed articles to serve on board a foreign ship may, on arriving at a port in this country, break those articles and go scot-free. But a Britisher, not being an Australian citizen, who has signed articles, is liable to be brought before a Court of law in Australia at the instance of the master or owner of a ship, and may be forced to go on board and complete his articles. Thus, an Australian and a Britisher, who does not happen to be an Australian, will be treated differently in a British Court of law. It must be remembered that every one of our law Courts is British. It derives its power to administer die law, not from the Commonwealth, but from the Imperial power, which has conferred upon us the right to exercise justice under British law. Our Constitution itself, from top to bottom, derives its jurisdiction legally and politically from the Sovereign. Our power to set up tribunals for the administration of justice is British, root, branch, and stem, and especially at the roots. Yet, here we shall have the spectacle of an Australian appealing to an Australian Court, which is still a British Court, receiving one course of treatment, whilst a Britisher appealing to the same Court will have another course of treatment meted out to him, because he does not happen to be an Australian. He appeals to the very same law, at the very fountain of justice, and different treatment is accorded to him. In practice, that is what this clause will amount to. We shall have as grave a scandal as was caused when we stuck up the six hatters here. </para>

                        <para>- Say what we like, this proviso will be a reproach upon the Australian Legislature. The Minister tacitly acknowledges this, because he can produce no precedent in international relations, so far as maritime law is concerned, for a clause of the kind. There is another point that I should like to raise, and which no previous speaker has touched upon. It is an important point, and closely relevant to the clause. I ask the Minister - on whom will the onus of proof lie in the case of an assertion of Australian citizenship? Suppose a Britisher does not want to go on board a foreign ship, though he has signed articles to do so. Suppose he is brought up in a Court of law, and chooses to raise the point, "I am an Australian citizen." </para>

When the ship arrives at Sydney, he wishes to take advantage of this proviso, deserts the vessel, and pleads that he is an Australian citizen. How is he to prove it? He could only obtain positive proof at Perth, thousands of miles away from Sydney. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> stated that I wished to force Australian citizens out of Australia. He read to the Committee a section from the French maritime law dealing with this matter, which was altogether wide of the mark. If we were passing a measure to prohibit any Australian citizen from serving on a foreign ship, the honorable senator's argument might apply. The French have prevented Frenchmen joining any ship leaving France unless under a guarantee that they will be returned to their own country. We are here dealing with a very different matter - a provision to enable a seaman claiming Australian citizenship to break an agreement he has entered into. It is a bad thing for the law to encourage lawbreakers, and the Minister must be aware that this proviso can only operate to encourage seamen to break what may be called the maritime law of the world - that when a man signs articles he is bound to complete his agreement. There was, no doubt, a good deal of " shanghaiing " going on all over the world forty or fifty years ago, but the practice has been put down in these days to a very great extent. The Government are here proposing that a man who has deliberately signed articles for a particular voyage may break' his articles and repudiate what he has done with impunity. In view of the conscription legislation we now consider it well to pass, I could understand the introduction of a clause providing that no Australian citizen should be allowed to serve upon a foreign ship, but I cannot understand why we should legislate to enable an Australian citizen who has taken service on a foreign ship to break his agreement. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> talks of inducing people to leave this country, let me remind him that there is nothing in this Bill to prevent an Australian citizen joining a ship to go to any part of the world with the intention never to return to Australia. I object to the distinction which this proviso draws between our own people. Why should we provide that a man who is an Australian citizen shall be at liberty, with impunity, to desert a foreign ship on which he has signed articles, when his brother, because he happens to have been born in Great Britain, may, in similar circumstances, be taken before a foreign Consul and forcibly returned to the ship? If we have the power to deal with Australian citizens in the way proposed, we have the power to deal with all British subjects in the same way. We are not a Sovereign power, and cannot dictate to foreign nations. We are bringing two torpedo-boat destroyers out to Australia just now, and I remind honorable senators that, if they did not fly the British as well as the Australian flag, they might be captured by the vessels of any foreign nation, and treated as pirates on the high seas. This should teach us that we ought not to get " swelled head," but should agree to conform to the international law in this matter. I do not think that this is a proper stand for Australia to take, and before passing such a provision we ought to consult the views of other countries. It is quite possible that the Minister of Defence or the Minister of External Affairs may later have to consider protests against the passing of this provision. </para>

                    <para>. - My difficulty in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers'</inline> amendment is that, if, in principle, it is wrong to apply this provision to an Australian citizen, it is equally wrong to apply it to any British subject. The amendment would extend, and not limit, the evil of which I complain. If a man has entered into an agreement, he ought to keep it, but we are here offering seamen a premium to break their agreements and desert from ships on which they have agreed to serve. I am sure that the Minister does not personally approve of this proviso, and I wish he could see his way to agree to its deletion. I am satisfied that if we pass it, it will cause trouble in more ways than one. There is a good deal in the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, that a seaman who has to prove his Australian citizenship will, in many cases, have a very big contract in front of him. He may have been born in Australia, and have left this country at an early age. He enters into an agreement on a foreign ship abroad, and arrives here in the vessel. He is not an Australian citizen in the sense that he has the franchise and is entitled to a vote, and he cannot, therefore, turn to an electoral roll and say, " There is my name, and that shows that I am entitled to be regarded as a citizen of the Commonwealth." And, unless he carries his certificate of birth about with him, he may have the greatest difficulty in proving that he is entitled to take advantage of this proviso. </para>

In the report of the Royal Commission, I can find nothing recommending a survey, as it was provided for originally in the Bill. Its recommendations on that point, as far as I read them, are only three. On page 64 of the small edition of the report, I find this passage - </para>

                <para>The report goes on to deal with the qualifications of the surveyors and the classes of surveyors recommended for appointment to carry out surveys.

                <para>The Commission seems to have made no specific recommendation on what is an important innovation in the Merchant Shipping Act. The clause will apply as it is intended to apply to the coast-trade vessels,  and, of course, to vessels trading to the Pacific. It must be within the knowledge of the Minister that some of the voyages along the Australian' coast take several weeks. From the time a steam-ship leaves Melbourne for Cairns until she returns to port three weeks elapse, and to connect with Western Australia, I dare say that it takes another four or five weeks. Under this clause every six months a vessel engaged in the coasting trade  and working upon a time-table may be laid up by the Minister. What is the reason for this innovation? It Is an entirely new departure from the lines laid down in the New Zealand Navigation </para>
                <para class="block">Act and the Merchant Shipping Act. Apparently some of the expense which will be cast upon ship-owners by this clause is to be modified, inasmuch as the provision is not to apply to vessels more than five years old. But the Minister must recognise that some vessels after five years' service are in a more defective condition than many which have seen twenty or thirty years' service. There is such a thing as a jerry-built ship. Under my amendment the Minister would have power to exercise his discretion irrespective or whether or not a vessel had been more than five years in service. He would thus be able to take action whenever he chose in the case of a jerry-built ship. Those vessels which satisfied his surveyors. after they had been five years in service,would be liable to survey only once in every twelve months. But if the surveyors found defects in a ship so great as to endanger her seaworthiness, the Minister would have power to detain her upon that ground. No other Navigation Act, so far as I am aware, provides for a survey of vessels every six months. </para>

Allusion has been previously made to the fact that a power, similar to that the inclusion of which in the Commonwealth Bill was objected to, has existed for years in the New South Wales and Victorian Acts, and it is now admitted that the exercise of such power, has, so far, " not caused serious ground of complaint." As there is no reason for assuming that Federal administration will not be as considerate as that of the States mentioned, it is difficult to understand the reason for the suggestion to take a test case to the Court. Had cases of hardship occurred, or had there been any doubt as to the legal position of the matter, it might reasonably have been expected that ship-owners would not have waited till now to appeal to the Courts. </para>

The ships referred to are " exempted " because they are not included in the scope of the Imperial Act, which places them in a somewhat different position from that which they would occupy if they were specially exempted from actual reference. If such reference existed, the Bill would be in direct opposition to the Imperial Act, but, as it is, it merely attaches a liability to a British ship whilst in Australian jurisdiction only, and does not directly contravene any Imperial legislation. </para>

As, however, the matter of survey is one on which there is strong feeling among the ship-owners in this country,  His  Majesty's Government asked in my telegram of 27th of November, for the assurance which your Ministers have now readily given, that if any ship-owner is advised that the provisions as to survey in the Commonwealth Navigation Bill when passed into law, are, in effect, repugnant to the provisions of the Imperial Merchant Shipping legislation, no technical difficulties will be placed in the way of the matter being taken before the High Court of the Commonwealth. </para>

The owner of every steam-ship constructed or intended to carry passengers-, shall, during the actual employment of such ship in that capacity, cause it to be surveyed twice at least in every year, at such convenient times as the superintendent directs, by a shipwright surveyor and by an engineer surveyor, appointed under this Act. </para>

                <para class="block">These clauses are not identical with the clause in the Bill, but they establish the fact that in the legislation which is referred to in the Board of Trade's circular to the  Commonwealth Government a similar provision was embodied as regards the period of survey. I would further remind the Committee that the proposed survey is to apply only to steamers more than five years old, and that it will be subject to the power of the Minister to extend the term. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger appears to think that the survey of ships is a very costly matter. But I find that in New Zealand the fees charged for the survey of vessels are as follow. - For ships not exceeding 20 tons register in respect of a certificate issued for six months, £110s., and in respect of a certificate issued for over six months and not exceeding twelve months, £3. They vary from these amounts up to a maximum fee in respect of a certificate issued for six months of £10, and in respect of a certificate issued for more than six months but not exceeding twelve months, of £20. </para>

In reply, the Commonwealth Government has intimated that it will throw no obstacle in the way of any British ship-owner stating a test case before the High Court. </para>

                    <para>. -I can scarcely anticipate that the Government will attempt to hold up a vessel which possesses a certificate of survey from the Board of Trade for twelve months, if, during that period, she is trading in Australian waters. There would certainly be a conflict if a vessel having a survey certificate from the Board of Trade were, against the wishes of the master or owner, compulsorily docked in Australia, on the ground that she needed to be surveyed. That action would be an imputation on the seaworthiness of the vessel. If survey is made compulsorily, I can scarcely conceive a British ship-owner or master quietly acknowledging that Commonwealth law is paramount over the Merchant Shipping Act when a vessel is sailing with a Board of Trade certificate. </para>

One is the offence of the master who takes his ship out, and the other is the offence of the owner who, knowingly or unknowingly, permits her to go to sea. But there is only one penalty. In the event of an offence being committed, is the owner or the master to pay the penalty? I can see that complications may arise. The owner may be abroad at the time of the sailing, and may allege that the whole blame rests on the master. Consequently, the master may have to pay the £100 for taking the ship to sea.

                    <para>. - This clause gives very strong powers to the Minister, which should not be exercised at his own sweet will. It would be well that he should not exercise them except on the recommendation of the superintendent or seamen's inspector. There will be a superintendent or inspector at every port of any size in the Commonwealth. If a ship is unseaworthy, the superintendent will be able to telegraph to the Minister, making a recommendation, and the Minister will then have justification for taking action under the clause. An amendment in the direction indicated would not interfere materially with the working of the clause. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger will not move an amendment. The officers whom he has mentioned, the superintendent and the seamen's inspector, would be the wrong officers to deal with the question affected by the clause. Under clause  195,  it is provided that a surveyor shall furnish a report to the Minister, and the Minister may, if the surveyor's report justifies him in doing so, issue to the owner a certificate of survey. Then clause  200  enables the Minister, for the purpose of survey, to require certain things to be done. The person to report to the Minister is the surveyor. I know what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has in his mind. There are certain things that come under the notice of the superintendent and the seamen's inspector, and on which it might be desirable that they should report to the Minister. But if the honorable senator turns to clause  211,  he will see that it enumerates matters that come under the notice of the superintendent and seamen's inspector. The question of unseaworthiness may be reported to these officers by the crew. The honorable senator's amendment, if needed at all - which I do not admit - would be in order upon clause  211,  but not, I think, upon clause  200,  where we deal with matters that do not come under the official notice of the superintendent and seamen's inspector. </para>

I take it that he will act on a report from the surveyor.

                    <para>- 1 think that there should be some authority over and above the surveyor in reference to the matters mentioned in this clause. I have known vessels to be surveyed and certificated, although they were not fit to go to sea. I have known ships to go to sea properly certificated, although the surveyor has never been down below. Only recently a vessel was pulled off from the wharf in Sydney and was0 nearly upset, although the surveyor had given his certificate that she was properly loaded. She had to be brought back to the wharf, in order that her deck cargo might bo removed. If the men working on board a vessel had some authority to whom they could report what they knew, many lives would be saved. I have had a good deal of personal experience of ships. I have known a vessel to be taken to sea with her boilers in such a condition that the men working below were scalded within two hours after sailing. I gave evidence before the Royal Commission, in which I showed that scandalous things have occurred, and men's lives have been sacrificed through acts of carelessness. If, when I was working on a vessel of that kind, I had known that I could report to a certain authority who would take notice of what I reported, I should often have done so. As it was, ships that had not been properly surveyed were allowed to be taken to sea, and men's lives were sacrificed. We ought always to consider the safety of the lives of the men working on board ship before anything else. </para>

                <para class="block">I hope the Minister will accept my apology for not having this amendment in print. I did not anticipate that we should have made such progress as we have made tonight. I expected to have it in print tomorrow. My object is to prevent any extension of time being granted for the currency of a certificate to enable a vessel to go to a distant port for docking and repairs, if facilities for the purpose are available at any of the ports to which she is a regular trader. There are a number of small vessels trading in the north of Queensland, and it is possible that they might be worked for the full term of their certificates in the local trade, and then apply for an extension of the currency of their certificates in order that the officers and crew might get a trip to Brisbane, Sydney, or somewhere else for the purpose of docking and repairs, to have a resurvey, and to obtain' the new certificates. Honorable senators will agree that if that kind of thing were allowed, it would be very unfair to a number of people in the different smaller ports of the Commonwealth, who have been at the trouble and expense of establishing patent slips, and supplying facilities for repairs to vessels. It will be agreed also that it would be an advantage to Australia if docking and repairing facilities were available in every port in the Commonwealth. If the practice to which I have referred is to be allowed to continue, no encouragement will be offered to people to establish docking and repairing plants in the various ports. The amendment would inflict no hardship upon the owner of any vessel. Why should the owners of vessels trading exclusively between Queensland ports be given an extension of the currency of their certificates in order that the vessels may be taken to Sydney or somewhere else for docking and repairs, when facilities for the purpose are available at Brisbane? </para>
