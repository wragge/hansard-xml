                    <para class="block">I mentioned this matter to the Minister of Defence before the Senate met to-day, and assured him that I did not intend to occupy more than a few minutes. In the course of procedure upon the Supply Bill on Wednesday last honorable senators had an opportunity of discussing the census questions, which, it will be admitted, have been attracting a. great deal of attention all over the country, and have been the subject of a considerable amount of unfavorable criticism. The questions might reasonably enough have been discussed at some length then. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> therefore asked the Vice-President of the Executive Council a question, intimating that we were anxious to know when the Senate would have an opportunity of discussing the questions. Thereupon the Vice-President of the Executive Council made the definite promise that an opportunity would be given on the following day - that is, on Thursday last. What happened on the Thursday morning? Notice of motion was given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> which held out the hope that the Senate would be afforded an opportunity of discussing the matter on the following Tuesday - that is to say, yesterday. When the motion was called on yesterday, however, in spite of the fact that an honorable senator on this side of the Chamber called " Not formal," it was ruled - perfectly correctly, I understand - that the Minister was at liberty to take no action whatever. Accordingly the motion lapsed. Where do we stand now ? We have granted Supply for two months, and have not been afforded the opportunity for which we were anxious. We were promised by the Vice-President of the Executive Council that we should have an opportunity within twenty-four hours after the matter was mentioned to him. In reply to a question which I put to-day the Minister of Defence stated that the census questions were to be dealt with by the Executive Council this week. If I understood him rightly, he said that the questions would thereafter take the form of regulations, which would be laid upon the table of the Senate. That procedure is not at all in accordance with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> definitely promised. He promised to give us an opportunity of discussing the questions before they were embodied in regulations. Now we have an entirely new proposition laid before us. The census questions themselves must be drafted and ready for submission to the Executive Council. Otherwise the Minister of Defence could not have spoken as he did concerning them. The moment they have been dealt with by the Executive Council t'hey will take the form of regulations. The Government have not treated the Opposition, and their own supporters who wish to discuss the matter, fairly. They induced us to allow an excellent opportunity to slip. I may, perhaps, be using an unreasonably strong term, but when I compare the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> and the notice of motion given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> with the procedure since adopted, I am inclined to say that the Government have been guilty of trickery. If Ministers can show some really good reason for the position which they have taken up in departing from the promise definitely made, I shall certainly withdraw that last statement, but meanwhile I say that on the face of matters the Government have not treated those who wished to discuss the census questions, fairly. I do not intend to discuss the subject at length at the present stage. I purposely drafted my letter to the  President  in such a form that - as I knew perfectly - I should have no power to discuss the questions themselves. What I am now discussing is what appears to me to be an absolutely unfair course of action on the part of the Government, namely, that we were assured that we should have a fair opportunity of discussing the questions, and that that opportunity has not been afforded to us. Of course, any honorable senator could raise the matter on the adjournment of the Senate any evening ; but at a late hour honorable senators are tired and not prepared to take an interest in a subject of the kind. </para>

                            <para>- I said nothing of the kind. 1 am afraid the honorable senator is becoming nervy over this matter. I say that if the Minister of Defence, on behalf of the Government, gives the Senate an assurance that an opportunity will be afforded to discuss the regulations, and, if necessary, to alter them, I shall accept it unreservedly ; but in the circumstances surrounding the matter up to the present the honorable senator can scarcely blame me for saying that we require something more than his definite assurance. What is there discourteous to the Minister personally in that statement? It may be that the Vice-President of the Executive Council found that he was unable to follow the course which he assured the Senate would be taken in the matter. If that can be shown to be so, every honorable senator on this side will be perfectly satisfied. But I point out that when the regulations are tabled we may not be given a proper opportunity to discuss them. When the Minister says that the Government will give us an opportunity to do so, I accept his assurance unreservedly. </para>

                        <para>. - I am at a loss to understand why certain members of the Opposition should impart so much heat to the discussion of this matter. When later in this week or next week the regulations are laid on the table of the Senate, honorable senators will be given an opportunity to express their opinions in respect to every question that appears on the census papers. When questions concerning the matter were asked me, as the representative of the Minister of Home Affairs in the Senate, I told honorable senators that there was no desire on the part of the Government to prevent a discussion of the matter. A few days ago I laid on the table copies of the forms proposed to be used in connexion with the collection of the census. Some honorable senators contend that the attitude of the Government in this matter is somewhat extraordinary. But really it is their own attitude that is extraordinary, because, if the subject had been discussed in connexion with the papers laid on the table, no matter how much honorable senators might have been opposed to the questions proposed, no action could have been taken to alter them, and the discussion must have keen fruitless. The Government are proposing now to give the Senate the opportunity which some honorable senators say they desire, to take action which may have some result. </para>

Under the course we now intend to follow, the Senate will be given an opportunity to amend any of the questions proposed, if a majority of honorable senators believe that to be desirable. In the circumstances, I think that the motion for the adjournment of the Senate is altogether unnecessary, and to discuss it is only taking up time unnecessarily. </para>

                        <para>. - I think it is as well that we should deal at once with the last remark made by the Honorary Minister. The whole crux of the matter is that we desire to discuss the census questions before they are confirmed in a regulation by the Executive. The Government do not desire that we should discuss them until they are embodied in the regulations. An honorable senator may disapprove of some of the questions, but if he is a follower of the Government, he will not be disposed to vote against the regulations as a whole, because, if the Senate declined to pass the regulations as a whole, the Government might regard that as a motion of censure. </para>

                            <para>- I wish that every member of the Senate should be able to consider the questions to be asked in connexion with the collection of the census, before they are decided upon by the Executive. That is what we were promised on last Wednesday. I brought the matter up on the Supply Bill, and we were given an assurance by the Vice-President of the Executive Council that an ample opportunity would be afforded honorable senators to discuss the questions before the Executive Council took any hand in the matter. I do not know why that promise was broken. To my surprise, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> tabled a motion in connexion with the matter, but when it was called upon yesterday, he withdrew it.  1  objected on a point of order, but the  President  ruled, correctly, I suppose, that the Minister had power to withdraw the motion. The honorable senator did so without offering any explanation whatever, and to-day we are told that later in this week, or during next week, after the Executive Council has dealt with the matter, regulations under the Census and Statistics Act will be tabled, and we may discuss them. 'The difficulty is that we shall not then be able to deal with the questions separately. </para>

                            <para>- We believe that this matter has not been dealt with in a straightforward manner. On Wednesday last the Vice-President of the Executive Council promised that honorable senators would be enabled to discuss it upon the following day. No mention was then made of the circumstance that it was necessary that the regulations should first go before the Executive Council. On Thursday last the Honorary Minister gave notice of a motion, which was duly placed upon the business-paper, but which was yesterday withdrawn. Thus the promise of the Leader of the Senate has not been redeemed. Instead, it is proposed to lay certain regulations on the table, which - if they are not vetoed - will become law. It would be far better for the Government to say to honorable senators, " Here are the questions which we intend to adopt in connexion with the census papers. We propose to give you an opportunity of discussing them separately." </para>

Of course, any honorable senator will be at liberty to move that they be disagreed with, but any such action would place him in a very awkward position, inasmuch as he may approve of some of the regulations and disapprove of others. I hold that before the Government adopt these regulations the Senate should be afforded an opportunity of saying whether or not, in its opinion, the questions which are to be placed upon the census papers are suitable or otherwise. But it is the same old practice of government by regulation, to which Senators Givens, Lynch, and myself have so strenuously objected. </para>

I objected to that proposal, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> was quite prepared to accept it.

If my recollection be right, it was the Leader of the Opposition who first asked the Vice-President of the Executive Council whether he would lay. on the table of the Senate a copy of the questions which it was intended to include in the census papers, and whether he would afford us an opportunity of discussing them. The Vice-President of the Executive Council stated that he would grant us that opportunity, and in fulfilment of his promise the Honorary Minister gave notice of his intention to move -

                    <para class="block">Had that motion been submitted, honorable senators would have been afforded an opportunity of approving the questions which it is intended to place in the census papers before they were embodied in regulations. From the promise which was given, it appears that the Government were then willing to consider any representations which might be made regarding those questions, and, if necessary, to modify them before they were embodied in regulations. Why was the motion of which notice was given by the Honorary Minister withdrawn from the business-paper? At a later stage the Vice-President of the Executive Council declared that, because the Senate did not pass a two months' Supply Bill without debate, he would reconsider the matter, and withdraw the motion from the notice-paper. So far as we know, that is the only reason why it was withdrawn, and why we are refused an opportunity of approving or disapproving of the questions which it is intended to place upon the census papers. That refusal is the punishment to which we are to be subjected be-1 cause we did not approve of a two months' Supply Bill without discussion. I repeat that the Senate has not been properly treated by the Government. When a promise is made it should be fulfilled to the letter. I protest against this sort of treatment of the Senate by any Ministry. The Government may have the numbers behind them, but that does not make their action right. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, having made a definite promise, has no right to withdraw it on such a shabby pretext. I strongly dissent from a number of the questions which it is proposed to place upon the census papers, but I will not attempt to discuss them now. </para>

                        <para>. - Most of the noise made this afternoon by honorable senators opposite is intended to make it clear that, because the Government have a following in this Chamber, they are in a position to bring down' regulations which that following must support, irrespective of whether the regulations are right or wrong. That is entirely opposed to my notions of the duties of  a  Government. This is the first time I have been given to understand that a Government can bring down a set of regulations which must be regarded as sacred, which' must not be touched, and which they themselves regard as vital. Take the case of the Navigation Bill, which is before the Senate. Presumably its provisions have undergone a great deal of Executive criticism. Its clauses represent a list of Cabinet decisions. But when each clause comes under our review every honorable senator is free to vote yea or nay upon it. </para>

                            <para>- We all recognise that the clauses of the Navigation Bill, which had met with Cabinet approval before being submitted to us, have since undergone a very great change. It would be extraordinary if we were told by the Government that these regulations would be treated by them as vital to their existence. I am sure that the Ministry do not expect their supporters to follow them blindly upon a mere matter of regulations. At any rate, I shall exercise my independence in respect to every one of those regulations. </para>

                                GOULD (New South Wales) [3.13].- From the tone of the debate it seems rather a pity that the Government did not see their way to allow the Senate to debate the motion of which notice was given by the Honorary Minister last week. Had that course been followed we should have been afforded an opportunity to express our opinions upon questions to which we are strongly antagonistic, and it would also have enabled the Government to ascertain the feeling of the Senate. Instead, it is now proposed that the whole of the questions to be placed on the census papers shall be embodied in regulations, and we are told that it will be competent for any honorable senator to discuss those regulations on a specific motion. That statement is quite true, so far as it goes. But as has already been pointed out by
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline>
                                Government business already monopolizes the whole of our time, so that we may really have no chance of dissenting from any particular regulation. I think that the Ministry ought to afford us such an opportunity.

                            <para>- In this case, for instance, the Senate can disallow a regulation because it contains certain questions which are objectionable, and then I assume that the course for the Ministry to take would be to submit another regulation embodying the questions which have been approved. It is rather a pity, I think, that the Senate has not had an opportunity of debating the census questions as was promised. On Wednesday last a promise to that effect was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> and subsequently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> gave notice of a specific motion which was supposed to take the place of the promise that the questions should be discussed at an early date. That variation has, no doubt, created the feeling that the Senate had not been treated fairly. I trust that Ministers, now that they have ascertained its feeling, will lose no time in submitting regulations in order that they may be dealt with as promptly and effectively as possible, and not hold them over until such a late period that there will not be ample time to discuss any objectionable features of them. </para>

                            <para>- One-half of the questions were deemed to be of a most ridiculous character, and as tending to bring discredit upon the authority which was responsible for issuing them. Somehow or other the feeling got abroad that the Government was prepared to give the Senate an opportunity of discussing the questions with the object of discovering which of them were objectionable to honorable senators, and that the result was to be some sort of a guide to them in framing regulations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> promised that the Senate would have an opportunity of discussing the questions. For some reason or other that promise has not been carried out, and now the Government falls back on its present decision which is to issue the regulations in due course, and then we are told the Senate will have an opportunity of discussing them. I wish to point out that the regulations, so far as we know, are not yet framed, and that after they are ready the Government will be under no obligation to lay them on the table at once. They can do so at any time within thirty days after they are so prepared. I do not say that the Government will delay the tabling of them for that period, but it may do so. If that course is adopted the Parliament will have no opportunity of discussing the questions. Thirty days from a week or a fortnight hence will be well into the month of November, when, I suppose, everybody will be anxious to get away, and there will be the usual crush of business which occurs at the end of every session. In those circumstances, the probability of the census questions receiving anything like a fair discussion is very doubtful. I did not hear what the Minister said in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> but the Government need not give the Senate any opportunity of discussing the questions. </para>

                                has said that what honorable senators wanted was a discussion with the object of discovering which of the census questions were objectionable. What would that mean ? Every one of the thirty-six senators would have to give his opinion on each of the fifteen questions. Who would interpret them ? Speaking from the Government bench, I might interpret the discussion as being wholly favorable to the fifteen questions, whereas
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway,</inline>
                                or some other senator on the Opposition side, might interpret it as being wholly unfavorable. What possible register of opinion would there be in such a discussion? If
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline>
                                really means what he says the course proposed by the Government is the best to meet his view, as he knows, because, on a previous occasion, he moved to amend a regulation and succeeded in accomplishing his object. '

                            <para>- The honorable senator knows that that is the best way to accomplish anything. If, however, he merely wants an aimless discussion, arriving at no end and accomplishing no purpose, the course adopted by the members of the Opposition is the one which he should support. It would mean an aimless discussion, rambling over the whole of the questions and not altering one of them, nor giving the Government an opportunity of ascertaining what is the opinion of the majority. But I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> wants to assist the Government in getting on with the business of the country, and it is solely with that end in view that the Government have taken the course which they have adopted. We have also given an assurance, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> refuses to accept, in common with one or two honorable senators - that if, within fifteen sitting days of the tabling of the regulations, any honorable senator gives notice of a motion disagreeing with any one of them, we shall afford to the Senate an opportunity of discussing' the motion, and, of course, they will also have the opportunity of taking a vote. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; and if the Senate carries the motion the regulation will be nullified. That will be a direction to the Government to bring in a new regulation in the direction indicated by the Senate. There must, however, be Executive action in regard to the framing of regulations. They cannot be framed in the Senate. They must be framed by the Government and submitted to the Senate for approval. If the Senate disallows a particular regulation, the Government, as the Executive body, will carry out the will of Parliament. Any Government would be stupid in the extreme if it reintroduced a regulation contrary to the expressed will of a branch of the Legislature. </para>

                            <para>- I made the promise in reply to a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> I gave the Senate a distinct undertaking that the Government would give a full opportunity ; and in the face of that undertaking the submission of a motion for the adjournment of the Senate could have but one meaning, and that is that those who rose in their places to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> refused to take the assurance of the Government. Either that, or they simply wished for an opportunity to belabour the Government because of the action that they took on a previous occasion - an action which was explained on Friday last by my colleague. </para>

                        (Queensland) moving the adjournment to-day, it has been furnished by the wild and whirling words that have been uttered by the two Ministers. They have become absolutely angry about the matter. One would imagine that, instead of having asked the Government to explain why they broke a promise made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, we had suddenly laid some dark and dangerous trap for them.

                            <para>- The Vice-President of the Executive Council did not use that word. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is going to edit <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> he should retire from Parliament and become a salaried officer of the Crown. Meanwhile, he may accept my assurance that I am quoting from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> On the strength of the definite promise that was made, the Supply Bill went through. On the following day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> gave notice of motion. Discussion of that motion would have carried out the promise made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. The only explanation offered by Ministers to-day for the withdrawal of that opportunity is that when the regulations are tabled we shall be able to deal with them. Of course, we can take what action we please on regulations submitted to' us. That is not a case of the Government affording the Senate an opportunity. It is an opportunity which we take for ourselves. </para>

They led us to believe that on a certain occasion we should have an opportunity of discussing the census questions. What has happened is that, between the time that promise was made and the time for it to be carried out, the Government have thought fit to censor the questions, and to bring forward a fresh set. If one effect of this debate will be to cause the Government to table the regulations and give us an opportunity of discussing them, my motion for the adjournment will not have been submitted in vain. </para>

                            <para>- I asked a certain question about the regulations, and the Minister then told me that the whole matter was coming before the Executive Council this week. He made no definite promise as to a debate in the Senate. It is only reasonable that the members of this Chamber, seeing how short the session is likely to be, and how little time is left to us, should be afforded the very earliest opportunity of discussing the regulations. I trust that they will be debated as soon as possible. With the consent of the Senate, I now beg leave to withdraw my motion. </para>

                    <para>-- I have moved the amendment for two or three reasons. It will be admitted that it is highly desirable that, at as great a number of ports in Australia as possible, we should have facilities provided for the repairing of vessels. I am sure that every honorable senator desires that the policy of decentralization should be the policy adopted in this connexion. So far, in almost every State, a policy of absolute centralization has been adopted. The policy in New South Wales has been to drag everything to Sydney ; in Victoria, to bring everything to Melbourne; in South Australia, that everything should be done at Adelaide. I believe it is as bad in Western Australia, and if things are not as bad in Queensland in this regard it is because the coast line of that State has not lent itself to the adoption of such a policy. It has been represented to me by men who have gone to a great deal of trouble and expense in establishing patent slips and other appliances for the repairing and docking of vessels that vessels trading to the ports in which these facilities have been afforded, having exhausted the currency of their certificates, have applied for an extension, in order to enable them to proceed to some other port for docking and repairing. I say that this practice is grossly unjust to those who have displayed sufficient enterprise and energy to establish patent slips and repairing facilities in the smaller ports of the Commonwealth. No extension should be granted to a vessel in order that she may proceed to some other port for docking and repairs if facilities for the purpose are provided at one of the ports to which she usually trades. I remind the Committee that the amendment can do no injustice to, nor inflict any hardship upon, any shipowner, because, if he considers it essential that his vessel should be taken to some port to which she does not usually trade for the purpose of docking and repairs, he can see that she is taken there during the currency of her certificate. The clause provides that the Minister may grant an extension of the currency of the certificate if he is satisfied that it would involve no danger to the vessel or to human life ; but I say that the only way in which the Minister can properly satisfy himself on those points is by a resurvey of the ship, and that takes place before a new certificate is issued. It is therefore essential, in my opinion, that no extension of time should be granted upon any flimsy pretext, if facilities for docking and repairs are available in any port to which the vessel usually trades. Under existing conditions, vessels are frequently run for the full term of their certificates; then application is made for a month's extension of the currency of the certificates, and the vessels are taken to Sydney, or somewhere else, from the northern ports of Queensland, to have the work of docking and repairing done there, when facilities for the purpose are provided in the ports to which the vessels usually trade. I have no doubt that the same thing applies in each of the other States. It will be admitted that it is a most undesirable practice, and discourages the establishment of facilities for the docking and repairing of vessels in the smaller ports. I know that there are a number of small vessels trading between ports in the north of Queensland, where patent slips and facilities for repairs are provided, and when they have run the full term of their certificates they proceed to Brisbane or Sydney, on an extension of time, for necessary repairs. This is in keeping with the bad policy of centralization, which this Parliament should discourage in every possible way. I repeat that the proviso would not deprive any ship-owner of any right he should possess. I hope the Government will accept the amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- That is so. We must rely upon the good sense and fairness of the Minister. We have no provision to say when the power given under this clause may be exercised. Without wishing to impute any improper conduct to the Minister, I cannot fail to recognise that Ministers, like private members of Parliament, are fallible. I direct attention to the fact that a regular survey of steam-ships is provided for in clause  194.  In certain circumstances they are to be surveyed once in six months, or once in every twelve months as the case may be. </para>

                        <para>- If the amendment be carried, it will deprive the Minister of power to grant an extension of one month to enable a vessel to return to her home port for the purpose of being surveyed, simply because docking facilities may exist at another port. Thus, we shall practically be saying to a ship-owner, ' ' Although you may be in the habit of having your vessel docked in Brisbane, because she happens to be in Townsville at the time the resurvey should be made, and because docking accommodation exists there, she must be resurveyed there, notwithstanding that the work may cost from  15  to  25  per cent, more than it would cost at her home port." The proviso would, therefore, deprive the owner of a vessel of freedom to determine where his ship shall be docked and repaired. Under clause  200  of the Bill the Minister is empowered at any time to require a steamship, at the expense of her owner, to be  taken into dock for the purpose of survey. The widest possible power is given to him in this connexion. The amendment would not safeguard the clause one iota, but it might compel a ship-owner to have his vessel docked in a port in the docking capacity of which he had no confidence. It would thus hamper the ship-owner for the benefit of any enterprising individual who may have established a dock at a seaport in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is a strong advocate of protection to our manufactories, but whoever heard of persons being called upon to purchase their goods in any place in which they happened to be at a certain time ? If we adopt the amendment we shall be acting unfairly towards the shipping industry. </para>

I do not wish him to talk nonsense here when a matter of serious moment is under consideration. Honorable senators must recognise that every additional burden that we impose upon the shipping industry will, inflict another hardship upon our primary producers. I do not wish to prevent any class of the community from embarking upon the shipping industry, but I do say that, to prevent a ship-owner from getting his vessel to her home port for the purposes of resurvey, simply because a little peddling industry has been established at some other port, would be ridiculous. The amendment, I repeat, would inflict hardship on the ship-owners, and would further shackle an industry which we ought to make as free as possible. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the Minister has acted wisely in accepting the amendment, and I am rather astonished at the attitude which has been taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould.</inline> So far as the provisions of this Bill are concerned, great liberality in the matter of the survey of ships has been extended to the ship-owners. In most of the States the law provides that all ships shall be surveyed every six months. But this measure provides that ships under five years old shall undergo only an annual survey. The amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is an eminently reasonable one. The Bill declares that a certificate of survey shall be issued in respect of all vessels every six or twelve months. Consequently, the shipowner is in a position to arrange that his vessel shall be in a certain port when the period for her resurvey comes round. But in order to prevent him from suffering unnecessary expense or inconvenience, he has the right to apply to the Minister for an extension of one month. That provision has hitherto been operative in our State laws, and has been largely availed of. With' what result? By repeatedly securing an extension of one month, the ship-owner has obviated the necessity for one survey every six years. If a vessel be trading to some port where docking facilities do not exist, her owner can always represent to the Minister that it is inconvenient to bring her away for the purposes of survey at the prescribed time. When he has secured a month's extension, he may approach the Minister and say, " I want another month's extension to enable me to take my ship to a port where she can be surveyed." The amendment will prevent that being done. Hitherto owing to the want of uniformity in our legislation shipowners preferred to send their ships to certain ports where the legislation was not quite so strong as in other States. But hereafter no matter at what port it may take place, the survey will be absolutely uniform, and so far as the Government are concerned, the cost will be uniform. Are we to permit an owner to hold back his ship until after her certificate has expired, to call for tenders for. the cheapest docking place, and then for the purpose of getting to that place to grant him an extension of time for the survey? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has not looked at this proposal as fully as he might have done, otherwise he would have recognised that it will only serve to do a considerable amount of justice. If, however, the Minister can show that it is likely to do an injustice to the shipping industry, I am prepared to reconsider my position. In the meantime I shall support the amendment. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales)  [4.16].-  1 think that there must be some misunderstanding in this matter. We are all agreed in regard to the provision for extending the time for making a survey, but
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline>
                    has submitted an amendment that no extension of the currency of the certificate shall be granted to enable a vessel to proceed to another port for the purpose of docking or being repaired, if proper facilities for that work are available at any of the ports to which she usually trades. That means that a vessel cannot leave any such port until the survey takes place. Suppose that the master of a steam-ship wishes to proceed to another port to get docked or undergo repairs, the Minister will not be empowered to grant an extension of time if the port where she is lying possesses docking facilities. It is not a second extension, but only one extension that is contemplated.

                    GOULD (New South Wales)  [4.31].-  I think that, as the law stands, the penalty for the overcrowding of a steam-ship is
                    <inline font-style="italic">£20,</inline>
                    and, if I mistake not, that penalty ' is also prescribed in the Merchant Shipping Act. It would be only reasonable to reduce the penalty in this clause from
                    <inline font-style="italic">£100</inline>
                    to
                    <inline font-style="italic">£20.</inline>
                    It might frequently happen that, although the master would be legally responsible for the fact, it would be an overcrowding over which he had no practical control. Surely a penalty of
                    <inline font-style="italic">£20,</inline>
                    and an additional penalty of 5s. for every passenger in excess of the prescribed number, ought to meet adequately the offence which it is proposed to guard against. I, therefore, move -

                    <para>. - This clause deals with a most serious offence, and also one of the most difficult offences to detect. On some steamers it has been the practice  - I have seen it done - to rush on passengers after the Customs officer has gone ashore. It is necessary to impose very stiff penalties, in order to deter owners and masters from acting in that way. Not only does overcrowding lead to discomfort, but it leads to positive danger, especially in the case of river and bay ships. The penalty prescribed in the clause is none too large. The only trouble I feel about the provision is that it is a most difficult one to enforce. I trust that the Committee will not accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>That sub-clause  3  be left out.  lt is entirely novel to allow a person to become an informer with regard to the overcrowding of a steam-ship. It may be that, without the cognisance of the master of a ship, there may be an excess number of passengers on board, and moneys may be received from the passengers by some individual who may subsequently become an informer, and thereby obtain the benefit of the penalty inflicted, whether it be large or small. Unless this amendment is made, many a man may be induced to have recourse to a method which would be anything but an honest one for the purpose of getting a large sum out of his employer or the captain of a ship. In no other State is a similar provision to be found. It is undesirable to enact a provision which must tend to breed a race of informers. One of the worst things we could do would be to legislate in that direction. Unless this sub-clause is omitted,  many persons may commit the offence of overcrowding in conjunction with somebody else, and then may go and lay an information against the owner or master. So far. does the law disregard such evidence that, in ordinary criminal procedure, the evidence of an approver has to be corroborated in some important particulars before it is considered worthy of credence. Suppose that a man is employed in selling tickets, or admitting persons on board a steam-ship, and he finds that there are three or six persons in excess of the prescribed number. Under this clause he can become an informer against his employer. It must have a tendency to create disloyalty amongst employes. However desirable it may be to avoid overcrowding on ships - and we all admit that that is very desirable - I do not think it is advisable to enable an employe to give information for the purpose of procuring a very heavy penalty out of the pocket of his employer. I believe that a spirit of fair play and justice as between man and man will commend the amendment to honorable senators as a reasonable one. There are officers appointed by the Government whose duty it is to guard against overcrowding on ships. I would not say a word against a Customs officer or a police constable performing the duty for which he is paid by the State ; but I do not believe in encouraging employes to become informers as against their employers. It has been shown in many cases in Sydney that there has been a larger number of passengers on board a ferry boat than the master was aware of. I trust that the Minister will see that my proposal is a reasonable one, particularly as there is no precedent to encourage him to adhere to the clause. Whether it was contained in the Bill of 1908 or not, I am not aware; but certainly it appears in no Act in any portion of the British Dominions, and  1  hope that it will not be insisted upon. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not think that the provision is unnecessary. On the other hand, for the reasons I gave in a previous speech, I think it is necessary. It is a most difficult thing for a single officer to check the number of passengers going on board a ship. Honorable senators who have done much travelling by sea know what an amount of bustle and hurry accompanies the sending of a ship to sea, and how difficult it must be for an officer of the Government to find out whether the number of passengers allowed to be carried has been exceeded. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; because if a ship-owner chooses to break the law the passengers have to suffer. If the ship is lost a passenger may lose his life or his luggage. Even if the ship be not lost he will suffer discomfort from overcrowding. The principle of this clause is already in operation in the Game Acts of some States. Owing to the impossibility of the police force exercising proper supervision, sportsmen are brought in to assist, and are rewarded if a conviction is secured against a person who has broken the law. The law cannot be broken without the connivance of the owner or his agent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> says that there may be collusion between the agent and the passenger who seeks to get the award. </para>

                        <para>- If the Court could be shown that the owner had taken all proper precautions, and had issued instructions to prevent overcrowding, those facts would be taken into consideration. In the case of collusion, does the honorable senator think that any Court would enforce the penalty? It must be remembered that the penalty of <inline font-style="italic">£100</inline> is not arbitrary. The Acts Interpretation Act provides that a penalty prescribed in a Commonwealth Act means that the amount stated is a maximum. I venture to say that any magistrate to whom reasonable proof of collusion was given would, inflict a merely nominal penalty. The overcrowding of ships is a very serious offence indeed, and I am informed that it is impossible for the Department to employ sufficient officers to protect passengers. We, therefore, propose to bring in the passengers to police the measure, and to encourage them by giving them the penalty which may be recovered. </para>

                    <para>- - I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> will press his amendment to a division. Whilst admitting the difficulties that the Minister has pointed out with regard to the administration of this clause, and acknowledging the danger which it is desired to combat, I point out that administration by the evidence of informers involves the adoption of a most abominable system. There is in me a dash of the blood of a people who have been cursed by informers. Their name is odious, and any administration which depends for its effectiveness upon their evidence is more or less abominable. The model shipping Acts which we have had before us - those of Great Britain, Canada, and New Zealand - contain no such provision. No Government but our own has made this proposal. Has any sufficient reason been given for the introduction of such a discreditable system of administration? As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has pointed out, any person under this clause may actually plot to bring about the offence which it is profitable to him to take means to punish. In the administration of Licensing Acts the Departments responsible employ individuals to obtain evidence when the law is believed to be broken. These officers may disguise themselves in the pursuit of their work ; but no Government in this country has encouraged informers to obtain evidence by granting them part of the penalty imposed. In every city in Australia there are regulations providing against the overcrowding of tramcars. Those regulations are frequently broken, but the law does not encourage informers to give evidence. In all probability the injury done through the overcrowding of trains and tramcars is large as compared with the injury done from the overcrowding of steamers. It is quite true, as the Minister says, that the object is to protect passengers. But surely a passenger who goes on board a river and bay ship which is overcrowded can draw the attention of the proper authorities to that fact. It is rather a strain on our credulity to say that the Department could not make proper provision against the overcrowding of our large steamers. There are many ways by which the Minister could provide for the administration of the clause. </para>

                        <para>- I would rather have that than descend to the abominable system of administration by paid informers. I believe that the ship-owners of Australia will loyally assist the Government in carrying out this provision. The Government can very well afford a little extra money for the employment of officers to exercise vigilance in the administration of the provision. Any course is preferable to this system, which offers a direct incentive to  ill-conditioned persons to conceal themselves on board a ship, with a view to securing evidence against the ship-owner and hauling him before the Court, which in itself is a revolting thing to do. In the summer time in Brisbane there are week-end and holiday excursions down the river, which are enjoyed by thousands of persons. Over and over again I have seen officers standing on the wharf and stopping people from going on board, because there was no more accommodation. As far as I could gather, the administration was quite effective. It might have been made thoroughly effective by the appointment of additional officers. The Minister may be thinking of the large seam-ships which leave Sydney and Melbourne carrying hundreds of passengers. Hundreds of persons go on board these ships to bid farewell to their friends, and, even though the ship may be in charge of the most vigilant master, and he may be acting under the instructions of the strictest of owners, it would be possible for an ill-conditioned officer to make use of this provision in- order to harass the owner. We have nothing but the assertion of the Minister that this is the only way in which, in the administration of the law, we can protect the lives of passengers. He tells us that it is necessary to resort to this abominable system of administration by informers. It is extraordinary that, in connexion with this our first Navigation Act, the Government should propose to adopt a form of administration which is condemned in almost every civilized country. It exists in France, and also in Russia. It involves the employment, for purposes of administration, of what is known as <inline font-style="italic">I' agent provocateur.</inline> Over and over again the French and Russian systems of administering laws by means of persons whose interest it is. to provoke a breach of the law has been condemned. The most vigilant of ship-owners could have no guarantee that he would not be struck at under this provision, if a single passenger beyond the regulation- number was carried on one of his ships. The ship's officers might be under instructions tq search every nook and corner 'of the ship to see that the regulation with respect to the number of passengers to be carried was strictly observed, and, notwithstanding the fact that their duty was carefully performed, the owner would have no guarantee that he would not be charged with an offence. I have travelled a good deal on the eastern coast of Australia, and I know that great vigilance is shown by ships' officers in this matter. Persons who have no tickets to present have been isolated, and as soon as the vessel has arrived in port have been handed over to the .authorities. I have known that to be done on more than one occasion. When the owners of vessels are trying to observe the law, they should be encouraged, and should not be left open to an attack of the kind which would be possible under this provision. </para>

                        <para>- They should be punished, by all means. But we should not endeavour to secure the administration of the law by the employment of informers. Such a system would not be tolerated, I think, in any British community. The large cities of Australia are infested with the worst kind of criminals, as bad, I suppose, as any to be found in any part of the world ; but public opinion would never tolerate a proposal that the administration of the law for the protection of the lives and property of people on land should be through informers, on the French model.; That the Government should think it necessary to resort to such a method of administration for our first merchant shipping law is a mystery which has not yet been explained. I feel so strongly upon the matter that if some amendment of the proviso is not proposed I hope it will be pressed to a division, so that we may be able, at least, to record our dissent.* </para>

                    <para>.- I wish it to be clearly understood that in objecting to this proviso, our objection is not to the penalty proposed to be imposed on ship-owners for overcrowding. We recognise the serious danger of the overcrowding of ships, though I do not think there would be much danger of foreign-going ships being overcrowded with passengers. The crew and passengers of such vessels are mustered from time to time, and, if the number of passengers on board exceeded the number allowed by law, the fact would soon be discovered. Danger might arise in the case of vessels acting as ferry-boats, and making short passages. If we take the case, for instance, of the vessels plying in Sydney Harbor, it is next to impossible to check the number of passengers that crowd into one of these boats on a holiday. The real difficulty is that this clause would enable any person giving information of overcrowding to recover the penalty for the offence for himself. </para>

The popular conception of an informer is a parson who, securing the confidence of another, inveigles him into the perpetration of an unlawful act, and then turns round and swears his life away. But to obtain evidence under this clause a man will have to go about his work in the most open-handed way. It would be of no use for him to expect to induce the ship-owner to commit an unlawful act. If this offence is committed it will be committed deliberately by the ship-owner or his agent. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator forgets that a passenger is not a person who steals unawares on board a ship. According to the definition clause, a " passenger " means any person other "than the master and crew, or the owner, his family or servants, carried on board a ship with the knowledge or consent of the owner, agent, or master thereof. The experience we have had in the past of the greed of ship-owners in carrying more passengers on their vessels than could be carried with safety, shows the necessity for an effective provision to deal with this evil. Honorable senators who remember the rush that took place to Western Australia, will know that in many cases ship-owners appeared to be quite indifferent to the safety of their passengers;, and many were carried in excess of the number for which provision was made in the matter of life-saving appliances. It must be remembered that every passenger taken on board a vessel in excess of the number for which life-saving appliances are supplied, endangers not only his own life, but the lives of all other persons on board the ship. </para>

Such an offence should be met with a heavy penalty, and the means to be employed for the discovery of offences of the kind should be such as to make evasion of the law extremely difficult. I have said that a person informing under this provision would not be an informer in the ordinary sense of the word at all. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not blame the Government for introducing a drastic provision of this kind, because those who have charge of the lives of people at sea should be obliged to take every precaution for their safety. I do not object that heavy penalties should be imposed under this clause. But I certainly object to sub-clause 3, which provides that any person may lay an information against the master of a vessel for overcrowding, and may pocket any fine which may be inflicted on the offender. In no other industry is such a thing permitted. I have seen tramcars crowded to their utmost limit, and I have known of a man being seriously injured as the result of a fall from a tramcar, consequent upon overcrowding. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) [5.5].- It has been suggested to me that instead of eliminating the entire penalty, it would be wise to omit the words "and retained by him for his own use." In speaking of this matter the Minister of Defence endeavoured to evade the objection which has been urged against the creation of a breed of informers. He said that passengers by sea might be sufferers as the result of the overcrowding of vessels, and that, therefore, they ought to be encouraged to lay informations where such offences are committed. But if overcrowding occurs on any vessel, a passenger has merely to protest to the master, and if he cannot secure redress to communicate: with the police.

The clause practically affirms that we do not think any passenger will lay au information against the master of a vessel which has been overcrowded in the interests of the public safety, and in the absence of a pecuniary reward. I hold that it is not proper to offer an inducement of this sort, of which advantage may be taken by dishonest passengers. Quite a number of persons who travel by our ferry boats will be prepared to lay informations against the masters of those vessels if there be a prospect that by so doing they will obtain a substantial reward.

                        <para>.- - I am not. But I am not so foolish as to allow the honorable senator to side-track me in that way. The Min,ister of Defence has not attempted to reply to the statement that, in many cases, this clause would act as an incentive to the members of the crews of vessels to lay informations against the masters of those vessels - informations which were not absolutely correct. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> "has affirmed that where a master knowingly permits overcrowding he deserves the penalty which would be inflicted upon him under this clause, and that the Ministry were justified in using any means by which to secure his conviction. When I suggested that the word " knowingly " should be inserted in the clause, the Minister exclaimed, " How can we consent to that," seeing that the master of a vessel would be on the bridge, and, therefore, could not know the number of passengers who were on board? But, if any overcrowding takes place, he is the man who is responsible, and who has to pay the penalty. In its present form the clause is most un-British and unjust. I am very sorry that the Minister is not prepared to consider it from that stand-point. He has pointed out that, as the result of overcrowding, a passenger may suffer inconvenience and loss. But in such circumstances the passenger is entitled to recover damages without the necessity of becoming an informer. Every honorable senator must realize at once that the law contains ample provision to enable him to protect his interests. I cannot allow a clause of this character to pass without entering a protest both by voice and vote. Whilst I recognise that the overcrowding of a vessel is a serious thing which ought to be put a stop to, I contend that the proper plan is to allow the marine authorities to deal with the matter, or if a person feels impelled by a sense of justice to intimate to those authorities that a breach of the law has been committed, let him have the right to do so, without having to run the risk of being told he did this because he thought he would receive ^5 or <inline font-style="italic">j£io</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">£20</inline> out of it. If a man sees a person ill-using a horse in the street he can give information to the police, but he does not take the penalty which is inflicted on the wrongdoer. No matter how strong a case may be made out, an honorable senator on this side has apparently very little opportunity of impressing any arguments upon honorable senators opposite. The Minister in charge of the Bill is the arbiter. When he says " yea " or "nay " there are twenty - two honorable senators who are prepared to follow him in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> - has realized occasionally, when he has tried to exercise- an independent judgment, that he was kicking against the pricks, and could not get his arguments considered or given proper weight to. It is not a question of one party wanting 'one thing and another party wanting another. Both parties here, I take it, desire to make as suitable and equitable a law as possible for the country. It is very hard when an honorable senator on this side tries to improve a provision in the Bill to find that he does not receive the slightest sympathy from honorable senators sitting opposite. What one says from this side of the Chamber is just like so much water thrown on a duck's back. </para>

                    <para>. - Virtually what we are considering is whether a person shall have the right to recover a penalty against an owner for the overcrowding of his ship. I do not think that there is anything new in the provision. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has admitted that this principle has found a place in the statute-book on several occasions. I know for a certainty that it appears in the Companies Act of the United Kingdom, and of nearly, all the States. For the very simple offence of not advertising their place of business, any individual in South Australia can sue a company and recover a penalty. </para>

                        <para>- It may be possible for the administration to stop persons from rushing excursion steamers, and also to find out if there are too many passengers on board. But I do not anticipate that that is a case where an action is likely to be initiated. On the contrary, it is only likely to be taken in the case of a ship which is going some distance, and has on board more passengers than her certificate allows her to carry. In a case of that kind, the passengers will have to put up with inconvenience. There will be no berths for the excess number, and probably no food After her departure from the wharf everything is found out. Perhaps this may occur on a vessel leaving a port outside Australia. </para>

                        <para>- We have control over a vessel which arrives here with more passengers than her certificate entitles her to carry. Suppose that a ship leaves Cape Colony with twelve passengers in excess of the prescribed number. Do honorable senators think that the master is likely to put the names of those passengers on his passenger-list, and thus give evidence against himself? No. As soon as the ship arrives at Melbourne, the passengers begin to scatter throughout Australia, or, perhaps, Australasia, and it is practically impossible for the Department to obtain corroborative evidence. If, however, a passenger who has been inconvenienced by overcrowding is allowed to initiate an action before the passengers have dispersed, there will be a chance of sheeting home the offence to the master. Whatever legislation we pass, let it be effective, but do not let us pass legislation through which the proverbial coach-and-four can be driven all the time. In mi opinion, the Government have acted wisely in making this_provision. We cannot police every ship that sails the water. </para>

                        <para>- The master has other duties to attend to, and cannot trouble about little matters. He does not expect to be subject to the annoyance of common informers or law-breakers in connexion with his ship. It is better for Parliament to encourage a high rather than a low tone of morality in the community. I sent my boys to a high-toned school, where lads were on their honour, and where a boy who told a lie, or did a despicable thing, was looked upon with contempt and treated accordingly. But here the Senate is asked to proceed in the opposite direction. It is invited to encourage a class of low-down informers. Set the public a fine example always, and the moral tone of the community will be raised. </para>

                        <para>- I hope so. I do not want to see this kind of legislation enacted. The people of Australia desire us to maintain a high moral tone. Let the penalties be as severe as the Government like, and let us protect the public in any way we think desirable, but I appeal to Ministers not to make use of the services of common informers. </para>

                    <para>. - I am somewhat surprised at the fusillade of objections which have emanated from the Opposition. The opponents of this provision have concentrated their fire on sub-clause 3. The word " informer " has been objected to, although it does not appear in the clause. The only excuse that can be found for those who have fulminated against that word is on the ground of their nativity or their descent. One honorable senator who has spoken is a native of a country whose people abhor and detest an " informer." I wish to assure the honorable senator who is so vigorous at the age of seventy-nine, that I did not refer to his present attitude when I alluded to him as slumbering. I was referring to the time when he was a member of the Victorian Legislative Council. If he had been as wideawake then as he is now we might have heard a different statement from him. No honorable senator more thoroughly detests the word " informer " than I do, but I cannot see anything wrong in a passenger who suffers from the overcrowding of a steam-ship laying an information against the owner.I have travelled in many steam-ships around Australia, and can cite instances in which there has been so much overcrowding that first-class passengers had to sleep in the music-room and the dining-room. Would a passenger, who made a complaint against that treatment, deserve to be called an informer? Certainly not. There is no policeman on board a ship to report a breach of the law. Therefore it is reasonable to provide that every ship shall be policed in this respect by the passengers. </para>

                            has sufficient knowledge of human nature to recognise that once the pain arising from such inconvenience has gone, persons are inclined to forget all about it. Honorable senators opposite have tried to make out that by this legislation we are endeavouring to manufacture dishonorable men. I resent that charge as an imputation upon the Senate. I am convinced that if the sub-clause becomes part of the law steam-ship companies will take precautions not to overcrowd their steamers. I have heard of no suggestion from the Opposition as to how the provision against overcrowding could be administered effectively by any other means. Even

                            has not suggested a constructive amendment. It appears to me that his object is to destroy the whole effect of the clause.

                        <para>- Honorable senators opposite have been indulging in mock heroics. They have concentrated their criticism upon the word " informer," but their real desire seems to be to protect the steam-ship owner against the citizen, irrespective of the fact that the steam-ship owner may cause his vessels to be seriously overcrowded. The attitude of the Opposition is that they would allow the dishonest ship-owner to be immune, whilst the innocent passenger is made to suffer. </para>

                    <para>. - I have some doubt regarding the effect of this clause. A reference is made to certificates " recognised by the Board of Trade." I have no objection to take cognisance of a certificate issued by the Board of Trade. I remind the Committee that under the Board of Trade no certificate of survey is required for British ships that do not carry passengers. Such ships may trade upon our coasts and handicap our own ship-owners. At the Imperial Conference, at which we were represented, the following resolution affecting this matter was adopted- </para>

                </quote>
                <para>That would be all right, but, unfortunately, up to the present, the Board of Trade has not provided for the issue of survey certificates for non-passenger vessels. The use of the expression " or recognised by the Board of Trade " leads me to believe that these vessels, which are not required to have survey certificates, may be allowed to enter into competition with our own ships, which, under this Bill, must be surveyed every six months or twelve months, as the case may be. The decision of the Navigation Conference was that we should recognise the British standard, but, as I have said, up to the present time no action has been taken by the Board of Trade to require survey certificates for non passenger vessels. I should like to know from the Minister whether it is intended under this clause that we should recognise non-passenger British ships without survey certificates ? </para>

                <para class="block">The marginal note to this clause is very misleading, unless the intention is to suggest navigation laws which do not contain such a provision. I have no objection to the first portion of the clause requiring that transverse water-tight partitions shall be provided. That appears to me to be a very wise provision. But I do take great exception to the provision for water-tight false bottoms. I point out that there is no provision requiring these water-tight false bottoms in either the New South Wales Act of 1 90 1, or the New Zealand Act of 1903. There is a strong objection to insisting that water-tight false bottoms shall be provided in ships registered in Australia and engaged in the limited coast-trade. The provision would very materially interfere with coast-trade ships trading to ports in which there is only a light draught of water to be obtained. In the case of such vessels every ounce of unnecessary weight, and every cubic foot of unnecessary space demanded, must add to the inconvenience and loss of the ship-owners. When I referred to the matter on the second reading of the Bill, I gathered from interjections made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that he believed this provision would not materially interfere with the construction of vessels. I think the honorable senator was not correctly advised, because a water-tight false bottom must add to the weight of the ship, and so must reduce her carrying capacity. </para>

                        <para>- I am prepared to admit that at once. I say that the extra weight of the water-tight false bottom would materially reduce the carrying capacity of the ship. I take it that the false bottom would cover the whole of the bottom of the ship, and would have to be raised above the true bottom of the ship. It must therefore restrict the space which would otherwise be available for the stowage of cargo.

                        <para>- I remind the honorable senator that the writer of the letter I have quoted is a superintending engineer of one of. the oldest shipping companies in New South Wales owning vessels trading between Sydney and Newcastle. He says that these false bottoms will be detrimental in adding weight to the hull, and, consequently, increased draught of water when light, and less carrying capacity when loaded. I do not think the honorable senator will be prepared to pit his knowledge of this matter against that of a man whose profession it is to thoroughly understand it. I place great reliance upon the opinion of such a man. Realizing these difficulties, we should surely eliminate this provision from the clause. Hitherto no such provision has been embodied in the law relating to ships trading to Australia. It is not contained in the Merchant Shipping Act or in the New Zealand Shipping Act. For many years a large number of light draught steamers have been trading along the coast of New South Wales, none of which has been fitted with a watertight false bottom. It is true that one of these vessels is occasionally lost, perhaps as the result of bumping upon a bar ; but, in every respect they are admirably fitted for the trade in which they are employed. Many of the companies have been engaged in that trade for scores of years, and in no instance have they considered it necessary to adopt watertight false bottoms for the safety of their ships. Although they have increased and improved the equipment of those vessels, nothing has been done in that connexion. Of course, in the case of a steamer worth only a few thousand pounds, the fitting of a watertight false bottom may not be of much consequence. But I would point out that it has not been found necessary to hamper vessels costing  £60,000  or  ,£70,000  by restricting their cargo-carrying capacity or by adding to their draught. I ask the Minister why this provision has been introduced. He may reply that its object is to protect our passengers, our ships, and their cargo.  But ought we unnecessarily to lessen the power of vessels to negotiate bar harbors and to carry a reasonable amount of cargo unless a strong case can be made out in favour of that being done? </para>

                        <para>- Is is our duty to do that as far as we possibly can. But in dealing with this matter, we have to consider what are reasonable and proper provisions to make. We know that a ship is not permitted to proceed to sea unless she is in a seaworthy condition. In dealing with a provision of this character we ought to be very careful how we interfere with our shipping trade. We ought not to impose too great restrictions upon an industry to which we expect to owe so much in connexion with the future development of this country. We must not make it impossible for ship-owners to carry on an efficient service at remunerative rates. We must also recollect that people have settled in the various States in the belief that their produce will be carried to market, at reasonable freights. I ask the Minister to consent to the elimination of this provision. </para>

                            seems to be chiefly concerned about the cargo-carrying space which will be sacrificed if this provision remains in the Bill. But I take it that our main object should be to see how far we can insure the safety of travellers by sea. The Government can-  not accept the amendment.

                        <para>- The argument against fitting a large ship like the <inline font-style="italic">Papanui</inline> with two bottoms will not apply in the same way as it will apply in the case of small steamers. That vessel may carry water ballast between her true and false bottoms, and there may be sufficient space between them to permit of the interior being thoroughly cleaned from time to time. If a similar space has to be provided between the two bottoms of a small steamer, such as is required to negotiate a bar with only 5 or 7 feet of water upon it, it must materially diminish her cargo-carrying capacity. Thus, what may be a reasonable provision in the case of a large ship may be a most unreasonable one in the case of a small vessel. </para>

The Honorary Minister must know 'that, within the past few years, we have obtained a very superior class of coastal ship, especially from the stand-point of the accommodation provided for passengers. That has necessarily led to a decrease in their cargo-carrying capacity.

                        <para>- I cannot realize the force of the speech, I shall not say the reasons given, by the Minister in opposition to the amendment. It seems to me that he has an invariable reply to give to every proposal from this side, and that is, " The" Government cannot consent to the amendment." That is a very easy way to carry a Bill through the Senate, so long as honorable senators are satisfied. But I would point out to the Minister that it is advisable to give as reasonable consideration as possible to the Bill, and not to leave the other House to correct our mistakes. I feel quite satisfied that many of the amendments which have been submitted from this side will commend themselves to the members of that House, and will, of course, be ultimately accepted by the Senate. I do wish that honorable senators, especially Ministers, would give a little more consideration ;to the Reasons which are advanced from this side from time to time in favour of amendments. </para>

                    <para>. - The speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> might lead some persons to think that this is a new provision in a measure of this kind. As a matter of fact, it has appeared in every Navigation Bill which has been originated here. So far as I can remember, not one witness before the Navigation Commission raised the slightest objection to the provision for watertight partitions in the Bill of 1904. In the face of the fact that all the witnesses accepted the principle, it is rather unfair for the honorable senator to state that the Government have no case further than that they will accept no amendment from the other side. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose that if there is one State in Australia in which such a provision is necessary, it is New South Wales. I do not think it is necessary in many of the other States. It is certainly not required for safe navigation in Western Australia. According to the marginal note, this clause was taken from the New South Wales Act of  190 1.  It is a very wise precaution to take to insure the safety of navigation in the case of bad bar harbors. In the absence of such a provision, captains would take the liberty of going out when there was not sufficient water on the bar, and incur a very great risk both to the ship and to the persons on board. It is unreasonable to expect the Government to go back on such a well-established principle as is embodied in the provision. </para>

                    <para>.- I . admit that in the case of small craft this provision, if enforced, will increase her draught, but that will not interfere with her going over a bar. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has not to take into consideration any additional weight which may be given to a light ship. It is only, a question of the difference between putting down thin steel plates and wooden planks from  2  to 3 inches thick. There is a bottom now in the case of every ship, and the whole question is whether it shall be watertight or not. Under Lloyd's rules a ship may run five or six surveys before the cement in the watertight bottoms is repaired or renewed. The cement keeps in good condition for a considerable number of years. The clause provides for the making of regulations where required, and we may reasonably assume that this power will be exercised with discretion. The Government must follow very largely on the lines of Lloyd's, because unless its requirements are complied with' there can be no insurance on a ship or cargo. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales)  [6.26].-  I would point out that at present, in order to obtain a Lloyd's certificate these steamers, certainly the smaller vessels, do not require to be provided with watertight, false bottoms. If we make this amendment there will, at any rate, be an assurance that, so far as any ships are concerned, these requirements will not be necessary unless, of course, Lloyd's sees fit to .impose them. All these ships are registered at Lloyd's; they all have to get its certificate. That, I have no doubt, is looked upon, and very . properly looked upon, as a very great help to the Department in dealing with vessels of this kind. But if we know that Lloyd's gives a certificate in certain cases without requiring a watertight bottom, why should we enable the Minister to prescribe such a requirement, and impliedly tell him that in- our opinion it :.s a reasonable thing to do? If this provision is passed it will be an intimation to the Minister that Parliament contemplates that it is desirable that a vessel should have not only transverse watertight partitions, but also watertight false bottoms. Nobody can object to the provision for transverse watertight partitions, as ships are divided into watertight compartments. I think it would be wise for the Committee to eliminate the words in view of the class of ships which are engaged in the coasting trade, and also in view of the fact that all such ships have a Lloyd's certificate of the first class when they come to Australia.

                    <para>. - I think we ought to leave the clause as it stands. It contains the words, " if required by the regulations," and I prefer to leave the matter to be dealt with by regulation. I do not think that it is wise to exclude from the operation of the clause all ships built before the passing of this measure. I am not even prepared to say that we should exclude ships under 500 tons gross register. A great deal depends upon the trade in which they are engaged. For instance, there are trading round the north-west coast of Western Australia vessels which, owing to the limited population, are necessarily small. But they go right out to sea, and work upon a rocky coast that is insufficiently charted. It might be necessary to require that a vessel trading on such a coast should have a watertight false bottom. </para>

                <para class="block">It seems only fair that notice should be given to ship-owners that the requirements specified in the clause will apply to vessels built hereafter. But there are some vessels already trading on our coast which have not transverse watertight partitions; and there are a fair number that have not watertight false bottoms. Especially is that so in the limited coast-trade. The owners of those ships are entitled to some notice. Unless the regulations carry out the intention of my amendment, a large number of ships will be driven out of the trade. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) [8.8].- A large number of ships engaged in the coasting trade have not watertight false bottoms. Indeed, I doubt whether any of them are so fitted. I see no objection to the provision as to transverse watertight partitions. I think that most of our ships are so constructed. But a number of ships have been built during the last few years, and contracts have been entered into for the construction of other vessels for the coasting trade. Some of them' are larger than any ships that we have at present engaged in the trade. It would only be reasonable that

                        <para>.- Ships ordered within the last few years have naturally been built in accordance with the requirements of the law that has hitherto applied, and in accordance with British law as it exists to-day. It is a very serious thing, after giving an order for a ship that is to cost  £60,000  or  £70,000,  to have to go to the builder, and require him to make important alterations. It is only reasonable that this clause should not apply to ships that have been built under the existing law, or which have Lloyd's certificates. </para>

It is asserted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that the requirement means practically nothing. On the other side, it is asserted by ship-owners that a good deal of the coasting trade, at any rate on the eastern side of Australia, is done with ships which have not been constructed in accordance with these requirements. Unless the Minister, with the assistance of his experts, or of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> can tell us that the loss of life at sea in the coasting trade of Australia is abnormal, surely we ought to provide that as long as vessels remain seaworthy they shall be allowed to be employed. </para>

                        <para>- I do not believe that there is any reasonably strong evidence to show that the coasting trade of Australia is conducted in vessels so built as to jeopardize human life. The proviso submitted by me is intended to give statutory protection in the case of vessels, the owners of which desire to continue to trade as they have hitherto done. The vessels will still have to come up for survey occasionally, and if they are not fit to carry on the trade they have been doing in the past, other provisions of this Bill will enable the Minister to insist upon such structural alterations as are required. But as long as the vessels are maintained in a condition of efficiency, and are fit to carry on the work they are doing, why impose upon them this additional precaution? Why should not the owners of these vessels be considered? I remind the Committee that we have already, in another part of the Bill, given the Minister power to do what I ask by way of regulation, if he is satisfied that it may be done with safety. In the circumstances, I cannot see why there should be any objection to exempting from this provision vessels already engaged in our coasting trade and carrying it on satisfactorily. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. We have agreed to many clauses giving the Minister large discretionary powers to secure the seaworthiness of vessels engaged in our shipping trade, and to require them, from time to time, to undergo a survey. We must assume that vessels at present engaged in the coastal trade have complied with the provisions of the State Acts, and 1 do not see why we should not permit them to carry on the trade in the future as they have done in the past. </para>

                    <para>. - I have given this matter serious consideration, and I think that honorable senators had better leave it to be dealt with by regulation. Although these ships are limited to a radius of  400  miles, they go to sea very often, and they are ordinarily engaged in a trade which takes them into tidal rivers, in nearly every one of which there is a more or less dangerous bar. Vessels, at times, run considerable risk of striking these bars, and, in the circumstances, it would not be safe to exempt from this proviso ships engaged in the limited coast-trade. The Minister, before enforcing this provision, would take into consideration the nature of the trade in which a ship is employed. If a ship is employed in what is obviously a dangerous trade, he would be justified in insisting that she should have these double watertight False bottoms. To my own knowledge, there are cases in which the Minister might, with safety, exempt vessels from complying with the provision, but it is much better that we should make the provision here, and leave it to the Minister, by regulation, to meet the circumstances of each case. If we were to accept the amendment, the result might be that ships that ought to be compelled to comply with it would be exempt from what is a very necessary provision in certain circumstances. </para>

In the circumstances, I cannot see why the Minister should object to the amendment, though I can understand that he might have some objection to the amendment which I proposed. The amendment now under consideration would carry out the recommendation of the Royal Commission in exempting from this provision vessels already in commission and holding certificates of seaworthiness. The Minister might have some justification for objecting to a proviso exempting from the operation of this clause ships of 500 tons burden, but I hope he will agree to accept the amendment now before the Committee. </para>

                    <para>. - We appear now to be in a difficulty similar to that in which we have found ourselves on several occasions in dealing with this Bill. We are trying to frame a law which will be applicable to a whole continent and cover many varying conditions. If there is any meaning in the Constitution, we cannot differentiate between one port and another in Australia. We cannot do it by regulation if we cannot do it by an Act of Parliament. On the eastern coast of Queensland there is a large number of vessels trading within a radius of 150 to 200 miles. There are vessels trading between Rockhampton and Townsville, and calling at the ports of Broad Sound, Mackay, and Bowen. These are small vessels of perhaps 300 tons register, and. similar vessels are employed trading between Townsville and Cairns, going through Hinchinbrook Channel, and calling at Ingham and other small ports on the way. If this provision is to be applied to such vessels, the result will be to destroy a large amount of pioneering trade that is now being carried on. It should not be forgotten that the big steam-ships trading on our coasts are fed by these little steam-tenders or lighters that run in and out of the small ports, and bring hides, tallow, sugar,  and other produce to the larger ports, from which they are taken by the larger steam-ships. If these little vessels trading between the small ports are to be dealt with in the same way as ocean-going vessels, the effect will be to destroy a certain amount of trade now being carried on. The adoption of the clause will have the effect of stopping this pioneering trade', which is conducive to settlement. If the Government are prepared to do that, they must accept responsibility for their action. </para>

                        <para>- Then there exists a greater necessity for insisting that the vessels trading to such places shall be fitted with false bottoms. We know that in approaching Brisbane, there is a very nasty bar in Moreton Bay. The clause is sufficiently elastic to enable the Minister to make exemptions wherever he may deem it wise to do so. </para>

                    <para>. - I would point out that if the amendment be agreed to, the Minister will not be deprived of any power which he might otherwise possess. It will simply have the effect of exempting from the operation of this clause all ships trading along our coast, together with those in course of construction at the time of the passing of this Act. I object to give the Department of Trade and Customs the power to declare that all vessels which are now engaged in that trade must be fitted with watertight false bottoms. My complaint is that instead of being governed by Acts of Parliament, we are to a great extent governed by regulations. A large number of small craft trade along the coast of Queensland, between Geraldton, Cairns, Proserpine, and Bowen, during the sugar season. If a too strict interpretation be placed upon this clause, these vessels will be forced out of the trade, and the producers will be unable to get their produce to market. </para>

                        <para>- No. It is brought down to those vessels by small steamers. At Proserpine, there is a bar harbor which it is difficult to enter. The same remark is applicable to Mackay. If the clause be strictly enforced, what will become of these steamers? I have no objection to vesting this power in the Minister in the case of vessels which may enter the trade in the future. But to enforce such a provision at the present time would impose a great hardship upon our producers. Western Australia would be similarly affected. </para>

The Government have a Bill put into their hands, and the only reason they can give in support of different clauses is, " The Governmentcannot accept an amendment." I presume that the Bill has been so well thought out by the honorable senators in charge of it that it is not deemed capable of improvement. </para>

                    <para>-  I think so. Surely any reasonable amendment ought to be accepted. I ask the Minister again if he will accept the proviso if it be restricted to ships of 300 tons ? I remind him that if a second bottom has to be placed in a ship, there must be a reasonable space between the two bottoms, and that once that is done she cannot carry enough cargo to make her pay. If compliance with the provision is rigidly insisted upon a large number of vessels will have to be put out of commission. That will not be good either to the steam-ship companies, to the persons employed on them, or to the people of the country. </para>

                    <para>- No; but Parliament is asked to indicate its opinion on the subject. If the honorable senator wishes Parliament to admit that it feels itself utterly incompetent to offer an opinion on a matter of this kind, well and good ; but surely in the case of a ship of small size it can say whether it is wise or unwise to empower the Minister, or even to indicate to him that he is empowered, to prescribe this addition when it will be, not only absolutely unnecessary and undesirable, but will render the ship useless for the trade for which she was constructed ? I would remind the Minister that a number of small droghers - that is, vessels probably under 100 tons, certainly under 200 tons - trade up and down the rivers. They go alongside the bank, pick up a few bales of hay or lucerne, or a few bags of maize, and take them down to some central place with deep water which limited coast- trade vessels can navigate. It is the height of absurdity to talk of requiring the provision of transverse watertight partitions in droghers, which can only take a comparatively small quantity of cargo down the river at a time if their carrying capacity is limited. What we are asked to do is to empower the Minister to compel these little twopenny-halfpenny steamers to have false bottoms. Is not that reducing the whole thing to a farce? Surely Parliament ought to have sufficient self-respect not to make itself a laughing-stock after the direction in which it is asked to go has been clearly pointed out. </para>

If I think that some provisions have been omitted from this Bill, I have a reasonable right, without a sneer from the Honorary Minister, to ask why they have been dropped. I am quite willing to accept his statement, if he makes it, that clauses  207  and  208  of the last Bill appear in another part of this Bill. </para>

                        <para>. - This clause differs from the New Zealand section, and from the section in the Merchant Shipping Act, especially in regard to the proviso. In the Merchant Shipping Act, section  461,  the words used are - " Provided that not less than one-fourth of the crew being not less than three." This clause, however, reads - " Provided that where the complaint is made by two or more of the seamen." The meaning of the Merchant Shipping Act is that the complaint that a ship is unseaworthy has to be made by one-fourth of the crew, that proportion of the whole being not less than three. The reason of that is evident, because two seamen might <inline font-style="italic">mala fide</inline> bring a complaint. </para>

I have to tell the honorable senator - and I hope he will accept this explanation as applying to all similar cases - that in this case the Government are satisfied that they are right in making the departure proposed. We believe that if two or more members of the crew of a ship make a complaint  which obviously is not a frivolous one, security for costs should be dispensed with. That is all that is provided for in this clause. It is not necessary that we should rigidly follow the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act in every case. </para>

This provision is applied under the Merchant Shipping Act to every British ship proceeding from a port in the United Kingdom except ships under 80 tons register employed solely in the coasting trade or ships employed solely in fishing. I should like to know the reason for the considerable reduction in the tonnage of the vessels to which this important provision is to apply.

                        <para>. - The honorable senator will find that there is a tendency in colonial legislation to apply all provisions to ships of a lesser tonnage than those to which similar provisions are applied under the Merchant Shipping Act. For instance, under the Victorian Act this provision is applied to ships of 50 tons gross registered tonnage, and I believe that in some of the other States it is applied to ships of even lesser tonnage. The principle I laid down a little time ago in connexion with another clause applies also to this clause. The fact that only a limited trade is available because of the scattered nature of our population leads to the employment of very small vessels. Very much smaller vessels are required to carry on our limited coast-trade than are necessary . to carry on the same trade in Great Britain, where there is a very much larger population, and consequently a larger volume of trade. That is the principal reason why this provision is applied to vessels of such small tonnage. In South Australia I have seen vessels of very small tonnage loaded down to the gunwale with firewood and crossing a dangerous sea in St. Vincent's Gulf close to the ocean. In such cases a load-line is very necessary. Honorable senators are aware that along our coasts small ketches are employed in carrying limestone and various kinds of produce, and, unless a load-line in such cases is insisted upon, there will always be a tendency to load them up to the danger point. The section dealing with the matter in the New Zealand Act 1908 is section 207, and if. is applied to " every British ship except ships under 20 tons register employed in the home trade." </para>

I admit the force of the reason given for the application of this provision to vessels of smaller tonnage than those to which it is applied in the coast trade of Great Britain. I have not sufficient information on the subject to justify me in submitting any amendment, but I should have thought it was not necessary to apply such a provision to limited coast-trade ships of such limited gross registered tonnage.

                    <para>. - I should like to say for the information of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> that 15 tons has always been the limit adopted in South Australia. I might add to what the Minister has said one strong reason in support of the departure from the practice of the Board of Trade in this matter. These small vessels are usually sailing ships, and in the British coast trade a ship has always some port under her lee to run for in bad weather. On the Australian coast, with the wind from the sea, these vessels are on a lee shore, and there is no weather-bound port to which they can run. That is one of the strongest arguments in support of the reduction of the tonnage of vessels to which this provision shall apply. They have to stand out to sea when they encounter bad weather, whereas in the British coast trade vessels can take advantage of weather-bound ports, if not on the coast of Great Britain, then on the coast of Holland, Germany, or France. They have always in that trade a lee port to run into. </para>

I might mention the course followed in connexion with similar provisions in the Canadian Act passed in 1904 or 1905. In dealing with the load-line, a slight departure was made from the provisions of the Board of Trade, and the section of the Canadian Act dealing with the matter was prefaced with a special section providing that it was only to come into operation when it had received the Royal assent. If we make any alterations in the load-line in this Bill, it must be understood that the provision must be "reserved for the Royal assent. </para>

                <para class="block">Probably no honorable senator knows more about load-line legislation than I do, because it was my lot to pilot a Load-line Bill through the South Australian Parliament prior to the passing of the Imperial Act. The Imperial assent to that Bill was refused, but subsequently another measure was enacted by that Parliament which received the Royal assent. The assent to the first Bill was withheld because at that time the South Australian Parliament had not before it the report of the Load-line Committee and the scientific tables upon which the load-line was based. A rule of thumb had been adopted, under which a certain amount of free-board was allowed in every ship according to her depth of hold, and irrespective of her length and breadth. We have since adopted the tables of the Load-line Committee, and I am moving this amendment merely because of the abuse of those tables by certain Australian shipowners. Honorable senators must understand that when the surveyors are called upon to mark a vessel, their first duty is to define the deck-line. It is proposed in this clause that in computing the freeboard of a ship the upper deck-line shall be the point of departure. That is the line which was fixed by the Board of </para>
                <para class="block">Trade. The length, breadth, and depth of hold of a vessel are then taken into consideration, as well as any buoyancy which she may possess in the shape of deck-houses, &amp;c, and thus her free-board is arrived at. Let us suppose that a vessel's free-board is 3 feet. That free-board is arrived at by measuring from the upper part of the deck. This custom worked fairly well until recently, when some shipowners took advantage of it to sheath the iron decks of their vessels with wood. The practice is not a general one, but it has been adopted, and I ask honorable senators whether it is wise to allow a ship-owner to build on to the deck of his vessel to such an extent that virtually she has no freeboard? Under the rules laid down by the Load-line Committee, a very small margin of safety was allowed. In computing the tables which it adopted it merely inquired, " How much can this ship safely carry?" If we allow ship-owners to adopt the practice which has been adopted by a few of their number, we shall deprive their vessels of all margin of safety, and jeopardize the lives of our seamen. There can be no guarantee of safety either to our seamen or the general public if the upper part of the deck-line may be shifted at the whim of any ship-owner. I have consulted, a great many persons upon this matter, and I am satisfied that the position which I am putting to the Committee is an absolutely correct one. We ought not to provide any ship-owner with an opportunity to ignore the intentions of this Parliament. I ask honorable senators to extend to this proposal fair consideration, because of its great importance. </para>

                    <para>. - I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that this is not a matter which ought to be lightly passed over. But I trust that the clause is one which is not likely to be altered. We are acting on the experience of a good many years, and we must recollect that the load-line has been adopted by Lloyd's, the great underwriters, for the protection of their own interests.' We must also remember that it has been adopted by the Board of Trade and by every foreign country. With all respect to his seafaring experience, I am afraid that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has scarcely grasped the principles upon which the load-line is determined. He speaks as if the deck were the factor in determining it. </para>

                        <para>- Then what does it matter whether the deck is raised 3 inches or 3 feet? The Department does not say that every ship's load-line shall be 3 ft. 6 in. from the deck. In determining where the load-line shall be, it does not take the deck into consideration. The load-line is determined mathematically in accordance with certain tables, and after taking into consideration the structure of a ship's hull, and also her superstructure. There is a complicated set of tables for determining by mathematical calculation the load-line of a ship, in the course of which the contour of the vessel, as well as her depth and beam, is taken into consideration. </para>

                        <para>- An honorable senator has interjected about the free-board. That is only a term of reference, and it relates to the distance between the waterline, which may be below the load-line, and the deck-line. Honorable senators will, therefore, see that to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> proposition would be, not merely to alter the system of determining the load-line, but to adopt a system which is absolutely unsound. It would introduce a revolution, and an unsound one. Because then the load-line would be determined, not according to the buoyancy of the ship and a mathematical calculation, but according to where the deck was. The proposition is absolutely ridiculous. It disregards the matters of buoyancy and construction, all the mathematical formulae which have been worked out as the result of the experience of centuries, which have been adopted by the great firm of Lloyd's, the underwriters, and are regarded by them as giving perfect safety. I trust that the Committee will not do anything of the kind proposed. </para>

                    <para>. - I must object to being misrepresented by the Minister as I have been. Had he been paying attention whilst I was speaking, instead of consulting persons, he would have known that I placed the greatest reliance on the scientific measurement of' the ship to find the free-board. I mentioned that, to arrive at the free-board, the length, the depth, and all her reserve buoyancy had to be taken into consideration, and that there were tables for working it out. The only difference between the Minister and myself as to finding the free-board ;s that he starts from the load-line, when that has not yet been determined. </para>

                        <para>- My contention is that, after making the most use of the scientific tables, we come to the decision that a certain ship is entitled to a freeboard of, say, 3 feet. Where is it to be measured from? The Minister has told us that it is to be measured from the load-line. In the first place, we have to get a departure for measuring the load-line, that is to fix where it shall be placed. The Bill provides plainly that the free-board shall be measured from the upper part of the vessel's deck. </para>

                        <para>- As regards the measurement of the load-line, the honorable senator said that if a certain ship required 3 ft. 6 in., it did not matter whether the deck-line was raised 6 inches or not. If he will consult some experienced person, he will find that the measurement of the free-board has to be taken from the upper side of the deck. The free-board of 3 ft. 6 in., which he has just mentioned, has to be taken, under the Bill as it stands, from the upper side of the deck. If it is in the power of a ship-owner to alter at his sweet will the starting point, it will interfere with the free-board. Let me give one case in point. The ship <inline font-style="italic">Era,</inline> belonging to Melbourne, was measured for her freeboard, and the point of departure taken, Her deck-line was placed at the upper part of an iron deck, and her load-line was fixed, according to the tables, at the distance necessary from that deck, giving her freeboard. A wooden deck was laid on top of the iron deck, the deck-line was lifted by 3 inches, and the load-line certainly had to come up 3 inches. Because of putting that wooden deck on part of her - she is a well-decked ship - she is to-day loaded 3 inches more than she was intended to load, and the wooden deck has added nothing to her buoyancy. The Minister has emphasized the fact that mathematical tables have been approved by Lloyd's. </para>

                        <para>- Not only that ship, but others. There is an absolutely unsafe position. The upper part of the deck of a ship is a movable part, and my suggestion is that if the measurement is taken from the lower part of the deck there can be no alteration made. The Minister has misunderstood the very object of the deck-line being put there. There is considerable discussion going on in Melbourne regarding the ship I mentioned. The owner was perfectly justified, under an Act similar to this Bill, in doing what he did. But I think that the marine authorities were lax in allowing the building-up to go on and the load-line mark to be shifted, because it is a certainty that the scientific tables only give the ship a very small margin of safety indeed. </para>

At present, the clause lays down a point of departure in the measurement which can be shifted at the sweet will of an individual. That should not be possible where life and property are at stake. We ought to have a fixed point, and the only point which can. be selected for that purpose is the under part of the deck. I ask the Minister to again consider the amendment before he gives a definite reply as to whether he can accept it or not. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> could not have supplied a better illustration of what I was saying just now than he did in citing the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Era.</inline> On her certificate, the load-line was fixed by measurement from the upper part of the iron deck. The deck was not used in determining where the load-line should be put, because the tables determined that. But when they put on a new deck, 3 inches thick, and repainted the ship, they measured the load-line from the upper part of the new deck, whatever its thickness was. That, of course, gave her 3 inches less free-board ; and as I have just said, when the ship came to be underwritten, Lloyd's refused to undertake the underwriting. Why? Because the load-line was not in conformity with the rules. The owners had raised the load-line by a trick. The fault lay with the surveyor, who had allowed the vessel to go out of dock without being re-surveyed. If she had been re-surveyed, supposing that the old load-line had been 3 ft. 6 in., and the deck-line had been raised 6 inches, they would have had to put the load-line 4 feet from the top. If that had been done, the position of the load-line would have been exactly as it was before - proving what I have said, that it is not the deck-line that determines the load-line at all. The honorable senator's amendment would not have met that case. What happened there was that there was no re-survey. If the vessel had been re-surveyed, the load-line would have been put precisely where it was before: Those are the facts. </para>

The whole matter in dispute between the Minister and myself is this: After you have arrived at the free-board to which a ship is entitled, the question arises as to how that is to be measured. My contention is that under this Bill, the free-board will be measured from the upper part of the deck. </para>

                        <para>- I want to set up what is right and just. We are asked to re-enact a thing that we know is not right. The Minister admits that the ship ought not to be measured from the upper part of the deck, and yet we are going to re-enact what the Minister says should not be allowed. I say that the measurement should be taken from the lower part of the deck. The whole -position is absolutely easy and clear. I know that there is a prejudice against my proposal, because some honorable senators feel safer in following what has been enacted by the Imperial Parliament, and recommended by a great many marine architects, and other experts. But we have plain proof before our eyes that the load-lines of vessels have been altered, and that ships have been put in danger through that alteration. The only way to set that right is by making the measurements from the lower side of the deck instead of from the upper side. </para>

                    <para>. - I notice in the report of the Conference held in London, at page 136, that as small a difference as 2 or 3 inches rules between the North Atlantic load-line and the summer load-line. So that, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> contention be correct, that a ship-owner is free to add 2 inches to the free-board of a ship, it means a difference between the North Atlantic load-line and me summer load-line. Captain Chalmers, in his evidence, states that the addition to the summer load-line is in the case ot steamers 2 inches, and in the case of sailing ships 3 inches. So that, as has been mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> the subject is much more serious . than some honorable senators are inclined to think. As according to Captain Chalmers, the expert of the Board of Trade, 2 inches constitutes the difference between the safe load-line for winter traffic in the North Atlantic, and the easy load-line for summer traffic, it is evident that a matter of 2 inches is highly important. As to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> contention that the load-line is measured from the top of the deck, I can hardly agree with him. It is only lately that I have noticed in reading clause 223 how difficult it is to understand what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is aiming at. Sub-clause 3 of clause 223 states that - </para>

In this proviso there are two points to be taken into consideration. Firstly, there is the upper side of the deck; and, secondly, there is the line from which the free-board is to be measured. What is that line? If it is possible to add 3 inches, it is evident that that is sufficient to destroy the whole difference between the winter Atlantic load-line and the easy summer load-line. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is right in this matter. In the first place, what determines the amount of free-board? As pointed out by the Minister, it is determined by measurement. A ship of a certain length, a certain breadth, and a certain depth is entitled, we will say, to 3 feet of freeboard. Where is that to be measured from ? You cannot start from the load-line, because there is no load-line to start from. There must be a place from which the measurement shall start in the first instance. Now the place from which the measurement starts is the deck-line. The deck-line is mentioned in the preceding clause, which says that - </para>

                <para>The deck-line, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> says, should be measured from the lower part, instead of from the upper part, of the deck. The deck must be a permanent structure. Say that a vessel has an iron deck. It is, as honorable senators know, very thin. But if  2  inches of planking are added permanently to that iron deck, then that deck-line is shifted. What does that mean ? From that line the measurement is to the load-line. </para>

                        <para>- No; there can be no corresponding increase, because it would mean a decrease in the buoyancy of the ship. If, according to the measurement, it is estimated that a ship is entitled to 3 feet of free-board to give her buoyancy at sea, every inch taken from that decreases her buoyancy, and to that extent renders her more unsafe. What was done in connexion with the <inline font-style="italic">Era</inline> was all right, only the insurance people or Lloyd's might have said, " As you have made this alteration we shall no longer accept any responsibility in connexion with the vessel." That would not be because the law had been broken. The Minister says that if the surveyor had only re-surveyed the ship everything would have been different. But the surveyor would have been absolutely helpless, because he could not alter the deck. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator might just as well say that the surveyor could put the deck-line wherever he pleased. He has nothing to do but obey the law which provides that the deck-line shall be on the upper side of the deck. If the deck were a permanent structure the surveyor would have no power under the Act to alter it. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has rightly said, we should lessen the safety of the ship by reducing her free-board and so reducing her buoyancy. The reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> asks that the measurement should be from the lower side of the deck is that if that course were followed it would be impossible to alter the deck-line, no matter how much planking was placed on top of the deck, though that might increase the buoyancy of the ship and thereby increase her safety. </para>

                        <para>- If an alteration is made in the deck the deck-line is altered; but that is not a determining factor in deciding the load-line, as Senators Guthrie and Turley must admit. The determining factor in fixing the load-line is the mathematical calculation of the buoyancy of the ship. If that were not so, the load-line would have to be raised, simply because the deck-line was raised. Do not honorable senators see that the two things are mutually destructive ?_ If the position of the deck-line determines the position of the load-line, then the buoyancy of the ship is hot taken into consideration at all. Senators Turley and Guthrie must be aware that in fixing the load-line the measurements of the ship have to be taken into consideration, and two ships of the same tonnage might have the load-line in two different positions. This proves that the load-line is fixed by something other than the deck-line. Honorable senators will find that in clause 223 it is provided that - </para>

I have here a book, and I ask honorable senators to consider the depth from one cover to the other as the distance between the deck-line and the centre of the disc forming the load-line. We will say that it represents 3 ft. 6 in. I place on top of this book another to represent a wooden planking i inch thick on the top of an iron deck. It will be seen that I have now shifted the upper part of the deck from which the freeboard is measured, by 1 inch. </para>

                        <para>- No. The freeboard is arrived at in this way : The length, breadth and moulded depth of the vessel, that is, the depth from the underneath part nf her deck_ to her keelstone, are taken. The poops, deck-houses and forecastles are taken into the calculation. The whole thing is mathematically worked out, and it is found that the ship is entitled, because of her measurements, t'o a free-board of so much, say, of 4 feet. How then are you going to give the ship the 4 feet? First of all we say there shall be a mark amidships showing her deck-line, and 4 feet is supposed to be given from the deck to the water when she is loaded. </para>

                        <para>- And for many other purposes. The Plimsoll mark was first put on ships so that a sailor could see if a ship was fairly loaded before he went to sea in her. On the ship's articles the free-board must be inserted, and cannot be altered during the currency of the agreement. In the <inline font-style="italic">Era.</inline> the free-board was never altered, although the mark was raised 3 inches. From the upper part of the deck to the centre of the disc there was the same measurement. That is the point the Minister does not seem to grasp. </para>

                        <para>- That applies to finding the free-board. To measure the freeboard afterwards is another matter. The deck-line is only used for measuring the free-board, for showing the free-board on the side of the ship, for use on the ship's articles, and so on. If you shift that mark as you build up the deck you will lift the Plimsoll mark and put people's lives in jeopardy all the time. </para>
