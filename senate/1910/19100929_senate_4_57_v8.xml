                        <para>- I am speaking of an apprentice as a boy. The second schedule to the Bill specifies how many able-bodied seamen, and how many ordinary seamen, a vessel shall carry. If the recommendation of the Commission were adopted, we should entirely prevent a man from becoming an ordinary seaman, except in the ways I have mentioned. He would either have to serve an apprenticeship as a boy, or be carried as an extra hand for twelve months. I do not think that that is a desirable state of things to bring about. I presume that the manning scale in the second schedule to the Bill is based upon a satisfactory principle. If it is not, I should like to hear reasons advanced why it is not. But I understand that the manning scale follows the recommendations of the Royal Commission. That being so, it is extremely improbable that vessels will ever carry extra hands. </para>

                    <para>.- The Bill says that employment in limited coast trade ships under 30 tons shall only count as sea service up to the period of two years of that employment. But the Bill of 1908 mentioned coast trade ships under 80 tons. That is a remarkable departure, and I do not know the reason for it. I should like the Minister to tell us why the alteration was made from 80 to 30 tons. There may be an advantage in reducing the tonnage; but on the coast of Queensland there are ships under 30 tons trading between various ports. </para>

                    <para>. - The difficulty that I see about this matter is that, under this Bill, a manning scale would be provided for every ship. The question arises, as to what would be the qualification for an ordinary seaman. Suppose that a ship has to carry twelve A.B.'s and four or five OiS.'s. The efficiency of the. manning of that vessel will depend largely on the definition of " Ordinary seaman." Otherwise a ship might take up half-a-dozen men who knew nothing about work at sea, and the lives of the rest of the crew and the passengers might be endangered. In the Royal Commission's report it is laid down distinctly that an ordinary seaman should be one who had served twelve months at sea. Before we depart from that standard, we should have a full explanation from the Minister. There is a great deal of force in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> contention. Unless we adopt some standard, a ship might pick up half-a-dozen men anywhere and call them ordinary seamen. </para>

                    <para>. - I consider that the Minister's reply on this question was absolutely unsatisfactory. He referred us to the schedule to the Bill. Schedule 2 provides that, in ships between 50 and 100 tons net register not less than two able seamen, two ordinary seamen, and one boy are to be carried. What is the qualification required for those ordinary seamen? The Minister says that any one who wants to go to sea should be qualified as an ordinary seaman. But the recommendation of the Royal Commission was that a man should have had twelve months' sea service before he should be rated as an ordinary seaman, and should also be not less than seventeen years of age. </para>

                        <para>- That was also the recommendation of the British Manning Commission. Unless we have a better reason for this change I shall be prepared to move an amendment. It must be remembered that, under the proposed manning scale, two ordinary seamen are to be reckoned as equal to one able seaman in the effective manning of a vessel. Would it be justifiable for a ship-owner to pick up a cab-driver in the streets of Melbourne, put him on a ship, and call him an ordinary seaman? Would two such men be the equivalent of one able seaman who had served four years at sea, could steer, hand the lead, reef, and do all the other necessary things that an able seaman is trained to do? The proposal is absolutely preposterous on the face of it. I believe that the importance of the point has been overlooked by the Government. </para>

                    <para>. - - Looking to the second' schedule of the Bill, I wonder whether there is really any necessity for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> to propose an amendment. The schedule lays it down that in ships between 100 and 200 tons net register, not less than four able seamen, one ordinary seaman, and a boy should be carried. In ships between 1,000 and 1,500 tons net register, not less than eight able seamen, one ordinary seaman, and a boy have to be carried. So that the schedule provides that there shall be an increasing complement of able seamen to ordinary seamen. It occurs to me also that if a restriction is placed upon a man being classed as an ordinary seaman, it will be difficult for an apprentice to become an ordinary seaman, One object of the Bill is to afford facilities for apprentices to serve a certain time and then become able seamen. It seems to me that the manning scale laid down is quite sufficient. </para>

                    <para>. - An ordinary seaman under this Bill approximates to what on shore is called an improver. He is a man who is learning his trade. Probably he is a man who goes to sea after reaching adult age. He has to serve a certain number of years at sea before becoming an able-bodied seaman. The schedule provides that the proportion of able-bodied seamen to ordinary seamen shall be large in regard to steam-ships, and in no case is more than one ordinary seaman provided for. </para>

                        <para>- A Beck hand is an ordinary seaman. The ordinary seaman is the handy man. After a time he becomes, by reason of his sea service, an able-bodied seaman. Practically the whole of schedule 2 provides for the employment of able-bodied seamen. The manning scale prescribed under this Bill is higher than that under the New Zealand Act, which is, I suppose, the most liberal and up-to-date measure in existence. Our manning scale, for instance, as to ships between 1,000 and 2,000 tons requires nine able seamen, whilst a similar ship in New Zealand would only be compelled to carry eight. Therefore, we compel the ship-owner to carry one more able-bodied seaman than the New Zealand Act provides for, whilst, in addition, we say that he shall carry one ordinary seaman. I again point out the reason why we have not thought it advisable to impose any sea service as a condition in regard to ordinary seamen. If we do that, we practically shut the door on men becoming seamen, unless they enter as boys,'oi are. shipped as extra hands. If the Committee think, notwithstanding that we have made these liberal manning provisions in comparison with the New Zealand scale, and far exceeding the scale of any other country in the world, that ordinary seamen must have sea service, although they can only be carried in the proportion of one to nine able seamen, an alteration can, of course, be made. But  1  do not think that it would be a wise amendment to make. When we are compelling ship-owners to carry one more able-bodied seaman than the New Zealand Act requires, I think that we are going far enough. </para>

                    <para>. - I feel that in this matter an important point has been overlooked. It will be seen from the schedule that ships of a certain size will have to carry a certain number of able seamen, ordinary seamen, and boys. But there is no machinery provided in the Bill to enable a . person going to sea to qualify as an ordinary seaman. I think this is a mistake, and the omission may prevent people from taking to the seafaring life. If a youth of fourteen years of age takes it into his head to go to sea, he can serve three years and qualify as an able seaman. But if a lad were seventeen years of age when he thought of going to sea he would be twenty years of age before he would be qualified as an able seaman, and would, therefore, be compelled to work as an apprentice at apprentices' wages, when to all intents and purposes he was an able-bodied man. One of the objects of this Bill should be to make a seafaring life attractive to our people. </para>

                        <para>- That is just the question which we have to consider. We ought to make some provision for a lad who takes to the seafaring life at sixteen or seventeen years of age. Under this Bill he would be compelled to serve for three years before the mast before he would be qualified as an able seaman, and to ask a young fellow sixteen years of age to work for three years longer for the wages of an apprentice is to ask too much. </para>

That is recognised in the schedule to this Bill, which makes provision that certain ships shall carry a boy. After a boy has served for twelve months at sea he should be entitled to the rating of an ordinary seaman, and after he has served for three years as a boy and as an ordinary seaman he should be entitled to the rating of an able seaman. </para>

                        <para>- I agree that he should not be rated as an ordinary seaman until he is seventeen years of age. An apprentice is something entirely different. He may be trained only to become an able seaman ; but he will have to serve four years, and, according to a decision arrived at by the Committee last night,' he may, under this Bill, have to pay a premium. A lad whose parents cannot afford to pay a premium of <inline font-style="italic">£60</inline> to have him apprenticed on board a ship must ship as a boy, and provision is made in the manning scale for such a lad. Provision is also made for an ordinary seaman, but will the Minister tell me what is an "ordinary seaman" under this Bill? </para>

                        <para>- An " ordinary seaman " is not defined in the definition clause, but a " seaman " is defined to include a stewardess, a cabin man, a mate, an engineer, and, in fact, every person on board a ship but the master or an apprentice.' Three ratings are provided for in the manning scale, an able seaman, an ordinary seaman, and a boy, and we are now asking for what is provided for in every other Act of the kind. The British Manning Committee recommended a rating of an "ordinary seaman," and our Royal Commission made a similar recommendation. I ask why the Government have omitted the provision from this Bill ? </para>

The Government have themselves admitted it by including a rating of " ordinary seaman " in the manning scale provided for in this Bill. What persons are to be regarded as ordinary, seamen? Are navvies to be considered ordinary seamen? </para>

                        <para>- That is the position. Is it the policy of the Government to drown people? I intend to fight this matter out, and I shall submit an amendment to provide that a seaman shall not be entitled to the rating of an ordinary seaman unless he has served at sea for at least one year, and is seventeen years of age. I remind the Committee that under the manning scale two ordinary seamen are supposed to be equivalent to one able seaman. Will honorable senators say that two cab-drivers, who have never been to sea in their lives, would be equal to one able seaman? </para>

Under this Bill, we may have on deck only one man and a boy. If it is necessary to use the lead, is an ordinary seaman to be put to that work? </para>

Now the Government tell us that there is no necessity for it, and they gave us no reasons for the omission. They only told us that they, wanted to fill up a ship with navvies, cab-drivers, &amp;c. </para>

                        <para>- During the first twelve months, a lad will be rated as a bov ; after he has served for that period he will be rated as an ordinary seaman; and after he has served for three years he will be entitled to the rating of able seaman. That has always been the practice in the British mercantile marine. To allow any person to ship as an ordinary seaman in order to make up the complement of a ship will not only interfere with the rights of seamen, but put in jeopardy the lives of traveller s. </para>

No. Why the Government should object to my proposal I am at a loss to understand. Probably, if it had emanated from the other side no objection would have been made. I am not submitting the amendment out of any spirit of opposition to the Government, but in order to continue a recognised practice, which has been approved of by a Select Committee of. the House of Commons and a Royal Commission in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- If he is to be an improver, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has suggested, why should he not be defined as an improver, and given a certain standing under the Bill? Let us know what he is to do and regulate the time which he shall remain in that capar. city. To-day practically all trades are. regulated by Arbitration Courts or Wages. Boards. In Victoria there are over fifty awards under Wages Boards, and I cannot recall a trade which recognises a man of this description. Either he is a seaman or he is not. It seems to me wrong to make provision for men who are incompetent to carry out their duties. Shall we or shall we not regard a seaman as a man possessing some skill? Evidently we have determined that he is to be" a man with some skill, because we require that he shall have served an apprenticeship and acquired a certain amount of experience. In any other trade there is no recognition of this sort of incompetent individual, who seems to me to have no standing at all. Is there not sufficient provision made in the measure for apprentices? </para>

                        <para>- Why not define the man as an improver? If it is not considered necessary for a man to serve a definite apprenticeship; if it is considered that by the mere act of going to sea for a short period a man can gain sufficient experience, it is not so difficult to become a seaman as I thought it was. I should like to see the position of an ordinary seaman defined. Either he should be a seaman or an. improver, but nothing between those ratings, and the nature of his duties and the period of his service should be laid down in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- It defines "seaman," but not " ordinary seaman." We  are using an expression which may lead to much litigation. In their report, the Royal Commission expressed quite clearly their opinion. They recommended for an A.B. four years' service before the mast, and added -  the qualifications of  an  O.S. should be those recommended by the Imperial Manning Committee, <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> that he should be seventeen years  of  age, and have had at least one year's sea-service before the mast. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that it is. Our system of apprenticeship has practically been dispensed with, inasmuch as nowadays owners insist upon a premium of  £60  being paid for every apprentice whom they employ. As the outfit of an apprentice costs at least another£40 it is obvious that no boy can go to sea in that capacity unless his parents are prepared to pay£100 for him. Patents who can afford to do that are not likely to send their boys to sea. </para>

                        <para>- No. But an ordinary" seaman has to serve three years before he can become an able seaman. During that period he must learn to steer, to reef a sail, to use the hand-lead, to row a boat, and to perform a great many other duties. In fact, his duties can scarcely be specified. In this connexion there is a story told of an old admiral who went ashore one day to a spot where his crew were erecting a building for stores. One of the men was handling a shovel rather awkwardly, whereupon the admiral remarked to him, " You call yourself a seaman, and yet you are not able to mix mortar. " Although two ordinary seamen may be carried on a vessel as a substitute for one able seaman, they may not have the skill of an able seaman. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales)  [3.40].-!  quite agree that it is desirable that a man who goes to sea, except in the capacity of an apprentice, ought to have some knowledge of the duties which he will be required to perform. Under the manning scale laid down in the second schedule to the Bill, every ship will be compelled to carry a certain number of able seamen. She will also be required to carry so many ordinary seamen and a boy. But, under the Bill, if a man of twenty-five or thirty years of age wishes to go to sea, he will have to go either in the capacity of a boy or of an extra hand, in order that he may gain a knowledge of sea service. We must take a practical view of this question. The point which occurs to me is, " Is sufficient provision made in the manning scale for the employment of able seamen?" If there is, an ordinary seaman need not possess any experience of the sea. But have we a sufficient number of men with which to supply crews for our ships, if we provide that no man shall be rated as an ordinary seaman until he has had twelve months' sea experience? I agree with

                    that we ought to provide an age limit, although eighteen years strikes me as being rather a low one to apply to an ordinary seaman. I think we shall be making a mistake if we require a man, before he can be rated as an ordinary seaman, to possess twelve months' sea experience. Many a man of twenty-five or thirty years of age may wish to go to sea.

If a man has been employed upon boats year after year, will he be eligible to be rated as an ordinary seaman, or will he first be required to go to sea for twelve months? I fear that if we insist that before a man can be rated as an ordinary seaman he shall have twelve months' experience, we shall be placing an undue restriction upon him. </para>

                    <para>.- I fail to see why we should shut the door against persons with land experience as firemen or greasers who desire to go to sea. The work of a fireman or greaser on a ship is not purely marine work. A man need not necessarily have had sea experience to grease machinery or to stoke the firehole. There are many junior mechanics and shop hands who have been used to firing and greasing who might like to get employment at sea. Why should they be debarred ?

                    <para>. - In the first place it is absolutely unfair to a Minister in charge of a Bill of this description that an important amendment should be sprung upon him at a minute's notice. I have had no opportunity of consulting the advisers of the Government on this matter, which would involve a drastic alteration of the clause. For instance, under this Bill we contemplate that for the position of greaser a man shall have been a fireman, and that for the position of fireman he. shall have been a trimmer, for sis months. We have provided that sea service shall he taken in lieu of shop service in qualifying for a third engineer's certificate. Now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> wants a " junior mechanic " who has never been to sea at all to be qualified to serve as fireman or greaser. What is a "junior mechanic"? I am a mechanic, but I do not know what a "junior mechanic" is. </para>

That Act contains no reference to a " junior mechanic," nor do I think that under it a man who had been a greaser on shore could go to the position of greaser on a ship. The New Zealand Act enables a man who has served on land as a fireman to serve as a greaser at sea, but that is not quite what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> purposes.

                    <para>. - I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> will see that no good purpose is to be served by his amendment. My knowledge of engineers on the Australian coast and of engineers on foreign-going vessels, convinces me that not one of them would for a moment dream of putting an absolute greenhorn who had never been to sea in the engine-room as a greaser. The position is a responsible one. Even experienced men are generally maimed in some way. You will meet one man who has lost a finger or two, another who has lost a thumb, and others who have been knocked about in various other ways. To put a man who had merely worked in a shop to grease engines on a ship which was tumbling about and falling into all sorts of positions would be absolutely ridiculous. There is a great difference, too, between wheeling coal to a furnace on land where a man can go into a corner and throw something up if he feels ill, and carrying coal to a furnace on a ship, where it is not possible to lie down when on duty. No engineer that I know of would think of taking a man into his engine-room as greaser who had not had three or four years' sea experience. I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> will not press his amendment. </para>

The Bill recognises a long-standing practice, and we all know that an engineer would not dream of asking any man who had not a fairly lengthy experience at sea, and especially in an engine-room, to assist him in this position. Any practical man would refuse to give a landsman, no matter what experience of engines he had had ashore, the care of the complicated machinery of a ship's engine-room. If carried, the amendment would be inoperative, and I hope it will not be pressed. </para>

                        <para>. - There is an effort made in the first part of this clause to remedy a longstanding grievance. But I am afraid that what is proposed will not entirely meet the case. In remote and small ports, where the local labour can only be regarded as casual, there may be very little objection to the crew of a foreign-going ship working the cargo; but in well-established ports, where there is available the labour of men who depend for their livelihood upon the work of loading and unloading cargo, it is a positive grievance that permission should be given to have the work done by a vessel's crew. It really means that the crews of foreign-going ships, in working their cargo, take the bread and butter out of the mouths of local men. I think it will be agreed that we should put a stop to that. If we always had such a Government in power as the  present, who would rigidly administer this clause,. all would, no doubt, be well. But we have no guarantee that we shall always have in power a Government prepared to see that this provision is given effect to in the spirit as well as in the letter. I think we should make definite provision that in every port where there is a sufficiency of local labour to work the cargoes of foreign-going ships, that work should be reserved for the local people. </para>

                        <para>- That should not be a difficult matter to decide. Ministers might discover, through Government officials, the state of the local labour market in every port. We know that attempts that have been. made by the owners and agents of foreign ships to have their cargoes worked by their crews have constituted a grievance with local men, who have thus been left idle. I think we should say that, if, in any port, there is a sufficiency of local labour available to work the cargo of a .foreign-going ship, no Minister administering this Act should have power to permit the cargo to be worked by the vessel's crew.- That would leave it open to the Minister to give permission for the working of the cargo of a foreign-going ship by her crew at places where there is not a sufficiency of local labour to carry out the work. </para>

                    <para>. -  This is an entirely new clause, and is not to be found in any previous Navigation Bill submitted to the Senate, or, so far as I know, in any other measure dealing \vith the subject, including the Merchant Shipping Act. It ma)' have very far-reaching effects. I agree that where there are local men competent and willing to undertake the work of loading and unloading ships they should be given that work to do. But there are many ports where such labour is not available. I understand that many foreign-going ships carry extra men in order that they may be able to assist in the handling of cargo. Take the case, mI instance, of an A.B. who is a winch-man. Under this provision such a man would not be allowed to do any work in the loading or unloading of cargo. We know that very often troubles arise with wharf labourers, and, without saying who is right and who is wrong in such disputes, the result very often is that ships are unable to get the labour they require for loading or unloading cargo. This clause would impose a very great responsibility upon the Minister administering the Act. He would have to decide whether permission should be given to allow the crew of the vessel to work her cargo. I do not wish to see this work taken from local men if they are prepared and willing to do it, but we know from reports in the press that, on what have appeared to be very slight grounds, local men have refused to work cargo, and as a result ships and passengers have been delayed. This kind of thing may give a port a bad name and prevent trade. </para>

                        <para>- The ship-owners will see that the cargo in their ships is properly stowed. There can be no doubt' that this clause was introduced for the specific object of keeping this work in the hands of the local unions. I do not object to that if the men are available and willing to do the work. But under this clause I think the administrator of the Act will often be placed in a difficult position if he is to do absolute justice. There may be labour available but unwilling to do this work, and in spite of that fact the owners of a ship may be prevented from working the cargo with the crew of the vessel. I doubt whether the Imperial Government would assent to any measure containing such a clause. </para>

I look at the matter, not from the aspect which was put by the last speaker, that this provision would give increased labour to Australian workers, but from the aspect of the safety of ships. The principal cargo which a foreign-going ship loads in Australia is either wool or wheat. </para>

                        <para>- There is a large number. At least two-thirds of the wheat production of Australia is sent away in sailing ships Their crews have no experience in stevedoring. Experienced men are needed to load a cargo of wheat, because there is no more dangerous cargo afloat than a cargo of wheat, unless the bags are placed as they ought to be. It is of no use to put the bags one on top of another, as is done in the coasting trade. Bags which are put into a ship which has to go round Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope, have to be jammed one on top of the other, and stowed, in stevedore language, " bilge and cantling." The crews of foreign-going ships have no experience in the stowing of wheat. If the stowing is done by the crew of a ship, what is the result? The cargo shifts, and the ship is never again heard of. The most important thing in connexion with foreign-going shipping is the stowage of this article. A large quantity of wool is still sent away in sailing vessels, because there is no rush to catch a market. The wool is jammed, in fact screwed into the ship. She makes' a threemonths' trip, the value of the wool is growing all the time, and the freight has been earned by the time it reaches port. No crew of a foreign-going ship that I ever knew could stow away a cargo of wool to the advantage of the owner; and no ship-master whom I ever knew, would attempt to load his ship with his crew. A " scrap " ship is one which carries wheat, wool, tallow, hides, and other articles. That is a worse cargo to load than either wheat or wool. There is no -hope of the captain of a foreign-going ship attempting to load our primary products. In Western Australia, where jarrah is loaded, the captains of Norwegian and Swedish ships do attempt to load with their crews. The result is a great many broken toes and lost fingers. It really costs the owners more to repair the damages than they save by employing their crews. As regards unloading, that can only be done by trained men. Very often crews are used to discharge ballast. It is an uncommon thing throughout Australia for a foreign-going ship to discharge its own cargo. A stevedore takes a contract to discharge it, and he employs labour. The question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is, perhaps, the most delicate one of the lot; and that is that, in particular ports, labour is not available. Now, labour can always be obtained from elsewhere. There is no State in Australia which has more loading ports than has South Australia, because, virtually, every farmer has a loading port at his back door. The ships go along our western coast and Spencer's Gulf, and fill up. They do not load with their own crews, but with men who are taken from Port Pirie or Wallaroo or Port Adelaide. As .regards sub-clause 2, I gave notice of my intention to move the insertion of the words "other than able-bodied seamen," after the word " crews," because I contend that, virtually, it is the business of able-bodied seamen in the Australian trade, and the limited Australian trade, to load and unload as well as to work the ship. I think that that amendment will meet all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> wants. </para>

                        <para>- Not to foreign-going ships, because the crews have not had the necessary training. In the case of coastal ships, the cargo is not stowed, but put in in such a way that it will not roll about; but, in the case of a foreign-going ship, everything has to be stowed. The loading of no coastal ship is finished in a stevedorelike manner. It is the practice in Australian-trade ships for the crews to work the winches and assist in the loading and unloading; and in the limited coast trade the position is peculiar. Take, for instance, the river trade in New South Wales, where men are not available. A steamer carries virtually a double crew for the purpose of working the cargo. My amendment will meet that position. </para>

                <para class="block">I think that that will meet the requirements of the whole trade; and I believe that the Committee will agree that it is absolutely sufficient. Let me state one of the strong objections which are taken along the Australian coast to-day, more especially in Queensland ports. When a ship arrives there is not a sufficiency of labour to take in her cargo, and the whole crew, including the firemen and stewards, are employed in that work. The firemen are not competent to handle cargo, and the work is distasteful to them. The stewards do not want to work cargo, but they are pressed into it. If the words " other than able-bodied seamen" are inserted, it will relieve firemen, stewards, and others from being called upon to work cargo in out-ports, but it will give the ship the advantage of the help of the able seamen. I do not think that there is a single honorable senator who would wish that boys should be included, as they are not competent to handle heavy weights. </para>

                        <para>- It all depends upon the number carried and the quantity of cargo to be taken in. If there are only roo tons of cargo, and ten able-bodied seamen on board, they can load it easily in five hours, but if the ship wants to take in the cargo in two hours more men must be employed. It is all a question of men being available at a rush. It is a curious thing that throughout our ports, men may be employed one day and unemployed the next day. To-day you may go to Port Melbourne, Port Adelaide, Brisbane, or Sydney, and not see a single man unemployed, but to-morrow you may find 600 or 700 men unemployed, simply because there is no work for them that day. In Port Adelaide, for instance, there are a thousand men who look for . work on the wharfs, and nowhere else. On some days every man is employed, but on others not 200 are employed, and 800 are looking for work. It is only where a rush takes place that a provision of this sort is necessary. I do not know whether the Minister intends lo accept my amendment, but I think that if it is accepted it will get over all the difficulty, there will be no trouble experienced anywhere, and it will be a safeguard for the men on board ships. </para>

                    <para>.- In dealing with a clause of this kind, one feels. in a great difficulty in not- having a thorough knowledge of the conditions, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has. I quite recognise the intermittent character of the employment of the men. I do not wish to see a single man deprived of the work which ought to fall to him, but I ask the honorable senator if it is not a fact that in many ports labour cannot be obtained, and that ships put on additional men specially for this work. If they do that, are they not to be allowed to employ those men ? I do not think that any shipmaster or owner would desire to see his ship loaded in a- careless, slovenly manner, which would cause disaster and loss. I am sure that every one of them would like to see his ship's cargo properly stowed. I am almost afraid that this provision will have the effect of depriving many men of work, because I can conceive of no provision which would tend more to hasten the introduction of the elevator system in this country for loading wheat ships. I do not intend to fight the clause. Further, I call attention to it because it is a new provision, and is not to be found in any shipping Act. It 'seems to me that it contains an element of danger which will work adversely to the men whom it is intended to serve. </para>

I am under the impression that if owners find that they can load more conveniently by using machinery they will do so.

                        <para>- I think that ship-owners will use machinery to load wheat, or anything else, if they find that it is to their advantage to do so, irrespective of what our legislation may be unless our legislation prohibits it. But my objection to the clause is not only that it is entirely novel, but that it will have a. tendency to interfere with the popularity of our ports with foreign ships. At the present time the unions are strong enough to protect themselves in the matter of loading and unloading, ships. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has already pointed out that the services of skilled men are required to load wheat and wool. I have no doubt that a man skilled in the loading and unloading of vessels is a far better workman than one who is lacking in that experience." But I cannot forget that strikes sometimes occur amongst the wharf labourers at our ports. Thus it may happen that a ship may arrive at one of our ports when a strike is in progress,- and although its owner may be absolutely prepared to concede the demands of the strikers, the latter will refuse to load or unload his vessel because all the ship-owners will not agree to their demands. Under this provision, the ship-owner will be compelled to incur considerable expense, which might be avoided if he were permitted to employ his own crew in loading or unloading his ship. To my mind, it is dangerous to insert such a provision in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- No. All our ports" usually provide the skilled labour required for loading and unloading vessels there. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has advanced very good reasons why that labour should be employed. But if a strike occurs at one of our ports, I fear that this Bill will be used by the strikers as an instrument with which to bring the ship-owners to their knees. Thus our ports will speedily earn a very bad name. The ship-owners, in accepting cargo, will naturally take that circumstance into consideration. </para>

                            GOULD. - I repeat that ship-owners, in accepting cargo for Australia, will naturally regard a strike at one of our shipping ports as a contingency which they must take into consideration. The Minister should certainly assign some reason for the insertion of this provision in the Bill. I can conceive of no reason for it, other than that the Government desire to place in the hands of men who go out upon strike in defiance of the law a weapon by which they may bring the ship-owners to their knees. We have no right to do that, especially as strikes are illegal. It is unfair to insert this, provision in the Bill, unless adequate reason can be assigned for the adoption of that course. We must also consider its probable effect upon the trade of our ports. I for one will not assist to pass a clause which will strike at the very root of justice.

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> is entirely mistaken if he thinks that the Government have inserted this provision in the Bill with the object of aiding strikers. At the port of Bunbury, in my own State, a considerable quantity of jarrah is exported in foreign ships. Now, in a sense, a ship is a floating factory, and we have already provided either by State or Federal law that certain labour conditions shall be observed by every factory owner throughout Australia. These foreign ships go to Bunbury, whence the timber of which I speak, which is the birthright of the people of Australia, is shipped to foreign countries. Surely the benefit of shipping that timber - so far as it can be secured to the people of Australia - ought to be secured to them. </para>

                    <para>. - What we have just heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> must' impress us with a sense of the range of his lively imagination. When he tells us that the clause is likely to bring discredit upon our ports, my reply is that ships, like men, will go anywhere' where they can obtain employment. Their owners are not likely to be influenced by the consideration that there may be labour troubles looming in the distance, if they can get work for their vessels at our ports. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> is perfectly consistent, although he belongs to a dying school in politics - the old Cobdenite school. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator comes from a State which has been wedded to the policy of dragging all its trade to one centre, whereas other States have made an effort to distribute their maritime trade around their coastal fringe. Seeing that the men who are engaged in the loading and unloading of ships in Sydney are sufficiently powerful to make their voices heard, the necessity for this clause does not exist in New South Wales to the extent that it exists in Western Australia. It has been introduced for the purpose of protecting those ports in States that have not been wedded to the foolish policy of New South Wales. I can understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has not much sympathy with the unfortunate wharf labourer who wants a job. </para>

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould's</inline> idea be carried to a logical conclusion, what does it mean ? It simply means that the agent or master of a ship coming from some foreign country can employ the crew wherever it is deemed desirable - and that would be always - to unload her, and thus deprive a number of unfortunate men living on shore of work. Australians-, for all <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> cares, can go and whistle for their morning meal. If the honorable senator had a larger experience of our coast-line he would know that foreign ships have been allowed to come here, use their crews for loading and unloading, and take the bread out of the mouth of our own people. We desire to stop that sort of thing. The honorable senator, however, wants to keep the way open for it to continue. I do not blame <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould.</inline> He is perfectly consistent. He is a true disciple of Cobden. But he reads into this clause a motive that certainly has not impelled its authors. He has said in plain words that the object is to coerce ship-masters to keep their crews standing idle while wharf labourers do the work which the seamen might do. I have no such desire. I am quite prepared to give the Minister power to give permission for the crew of a ship to load or unload cargo when there is no other labour available. Other labour cannot be available when there is a strike. </para>

                        <para>- There is nothing more than that in the proposal. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> wants to read into it a desire to take advantage of the helpless position of a ship-master, and to keep his crew idle in order to help a strike. I say again that there is no such object. The motive exists simply in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould's</inline> imagination. This provision is simply intended to insure that our own people, living in the outlying ports, shall have the work that comes from the loading and unloading of ships. It is quite a common-sense proposal. An enactment of the kind has long since been required. But when it is submitted to the Legislature we find that, quite consistently, men like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> oppose it. I hope the Government will stand by the provision, in the interests, not only of those who are earning their livelihood in the outlying ports of the Commonwealth, but also in the interests of business people - the friends of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> - in order that they may benefit from keeping in the country the money that properly belongs to it. </para>

                    <para>. - We have 'had from the Minister in charge of this Bill a declaration that is rather startling in itself, though welcome in its frankness. He has given as an explanation for the inclusion of this provision that it is inserted for the purpose of securing to the labourers of Bunbury and other places a measure of work which would otherwise not accrue to them. The Minister went on to refer to the jarrah timber industry, and to speak of it as being "the birthright of Australians." Well, are not the grain trade and the wool trade equally their birthright? </para>

                        <para>- We now have the frank avowal that the purpose of this provision is not to increase the safety of the seamen, or to create additional facilities for our producers in shipping their produce abroad, but is simply to safeguard the interests of one single class - those who may be called upon to do the wharf labouring. If we were dealing with our own money, or even if we were voting public money, there might be something said, in certain circumstances, for such a proposal. But we are dealing with the interests of other sections of the community, who now learn that the only people who can hope to receive consideration from honorable senators opposite are those who work in an industry and get a daily wage. We learn that in this matter they are only prepared to think of the interests of the wharf labourers and those engaged in kindred employments. </para>

                        <para>- Unquestionably ; but I consider that I am not gaining additional work for the people if I destroy opportunities for work in the wheat-fields in order to secure more employment for labourers on the Bunbury wharf. If my honorable friends are to carry out this policy, they ought to impose a duty on wheat, to secure the grinding of wheat into flour in Australia. Similarly, they ought to try to prevent a single bale of greasy wool leaving Australia, and to say, in the pathetic language of the Minister of Defence, ' ' This wool is the birthright of the Australian people, and, therefore, we insist that the grease shall be washed out of it, and all the work in connexion with it done before it is exported." Again, why should there be men looking for a job in Australia while we are sending quantities of refractory and other ores to be treated abroad ? See the immense employment that would be given to labour if those ores were treated here. </para>

                        <para>- For my own part, I draw the common-sense line. I was at first inclined to support the proposition of the Government. That proposition is not objectionable in itself, but because I now regard it as the thin end of the wedge, and that wedge, when driven home, will mean an absolute impost on . every producer in this country in order to throw a little additional work, in the way, not of the great body of the workers of Australia, but of a few workers earning their living in our ports. I am strongly opposed to it. </para>

                        <para>- From the way I am speaking, the honorable senator ought to infer that I am diametrically opposed to it. My objection to this proposal is not so much because of what it states in itself, but because of what I see lying at the foundation of it. I can see that the entire policy of this Government is in the direction of that prohibition of the exports of our producers of which we have already had some signs. It is for that reason that I have spoken as I have done. </para>

                    <para>. - I fail to see why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> should base his remarks on this clause on questions affecting wool or timber, or any other product. An attempt has been made to saddle honorable senators on this side with an endeavour to handicap and hamper our exports. This is not a question of wool or timber, but of men. Surely it is the policy of Australia to-day to give preference in employment, if not to unionists, at least to residents of the Commonwealth. I have a personal knowledge of what has taken place in the past in this connexion. I shall instance, not Bunbury, but Fremantle. I know that, at Fremantle, white men have stood idly by whilst Asiatics were doing the work they were waiting to do. I instance Fremantle, because what occurred there came under my own observation. </para>

                        <para>- No; the people of Western Australia do not employ coloured labour, but foreigners on a foreign ship were employed at Fremantle to do work which white residents of Australia ought to do. I dare say that a . similar state of things has existed in the other States. If we are to give encouragement to Australian products, we should not refuse to encourage the employment of Australian residents. I dare say that honorable senators opposite pride themselves on being supporters of the White Australia policy ; but, in view of the adoption of that policy in Australia, is it not humiliating that we should see white residents of the Commonwealth, depending upon their labour for the support of themselves and their families, standing idly by while Mongolians are doing the work which they ought to be doing? Will honorable senators opposite defend that? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has tried to distract the attention of the Committee by saying that if we pass this clause we shall be endangering our exports, and the trade and commerce of Australia. But let us view the facts as they ought to be viewed. Honorable senators are aware that white men are left standing idle on our wharfs while foreigners are doing work which they might do. </para>

                        <para>- I am not speaking now of Queensland as a State in which coloured labour is employed. If this clause is given effect to, the white residents of Australia will not have to stand idly by whilst Chinese and Afghans are doing the work they ought to do. We should discuss the clause upon its merits ; and it must be admitted that, by passing it, we shall be doing justice to white Australian citir zens, while to reject it would be a travesty on our professed support of the White Australia policy. I can submit proofs of what I say I have seen done at Fremantle. If we carry out the spirit of the White Australia policy, we shall see that that work which is now given in some ports of Australia to Asiatics, is given to white Australian citizens. </para>

                    <para>. - It is quite characteristic, and part of the tactics of debate on the other side that, when honorable senators are pressed for arguments, they drag in the White Australia policy. That policy is not concerned in this matter. Why do not honorable senators opposite propose that we should pass a law that no one but a white Australian shall handle a single ton of cargo brought to any port in the Commonwealth ? Are the Government prepared (o go as far as that ? We know that they are not. Because while honorable senators opposite are willing to talk as they do about the Chinese, and say that one of the objects of this clause is to prevent Chinese from handling cargo, they dare not make a similar proposal in the case of a ship manned by Germans. If the Government were to make a proposal consistent with the lines of policy formulated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> they would say that no German or other foreigner, or even a Britisher shall handle a ton of cargo in any port i« Australia. </para>

What happened when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> was putting his objection to the clause before the Committee? The honorable senator was accused, as honorable senators of. this side are always accused, of a desire to deprive the wharf labourer of Australia of a chance of employment. How long will it be necessary for honorable senators on this side to expose the Pharisaism of that kind of argument? When the Minister of Defence was asked to give some reason for the introduction of this clause one would naturally have presumed that he would be armed with a gun, which, when fired, would silence us, but he gave an answer which showed the difficulty of his position. He said it was in order to protect jarrah timber-getters. When such a reason is given the clause should be kicked out. </para>

Let me direct attention to a remarkable change of opinion on the opposite benches during the last few . minutes. A few moments ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> proposed an amendment with his usual force and clearness, which would take a good deal of the sting out of this new clause, whoever its father or godfather may be. it is a little suspicious that we cannot ascertain anything more definite about the parentage of this clause than a reference, to the difficulties of some timber-getters at Bunbury. It has a most extraordinary parentage, any way. </para>

I ask him or the Minister to explain why it is sought to give to Australian ships a privilege which they will not extend to British or foreign ships. He has still an amendment to move in this clause, and that is part of our objection to this differential legislation. </para>

                        <para>- I waited for the honorable senator's answer. What he is here for is as patent as the light shining in front of us. There has been a combination between the Shipping Combine and the Seamen's Union, in order to get this privilege. Otherwise, why does the honorable senator display so much anxiety about his amendment? It is to give an advantage to a shipping combination which has been denounced time and again by honorable senators on the other side. I do not know whether they are right or wrong in asking for this privilege ; but it is an extraordinary thing that when this new clause is reached we should find the secretary of the Seamen's Union, in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> hand-in-glove with the Australian shipping combination to get an advantage which they will deny to British vessels. </para>

                        <para>- Probably. The Minister's answer was loaded from top to bottom, but he did not know it, and the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> shows what the public can see by reading the Bill. It is, as regards some of its important clauses, very largely the result of a joining of hands by two powerful combinations, capital and labour, to secure legislation in their interests, and in some aspects to let the producers and Australia go hang, so long as capital can draw its dividends, and labour make its own terms and conditions for employment. </para>

Let the honorable senator admit right away that, whether directly or indirectly, consciously or unconsciously, he and those behind him have been hand in glove with these combines for a particular purpose, and in order that that purpose may be effected, they intend to exclude the competition of foreign and British ships from the coast trade of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The question is explicit, and from a public stand-point, important. I hold no brief for the Shipping Combine, or for the Seamen's Union, or other body. It is a most extraordinary thing that in one portion of the clause we have British and foreign ships almost expressly excluded from the coasting trade, and that when the Government have more or less veiled that intention, we find <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> stepping in., and saying " Let us make it clear, at any rate, that the Australian ships shall not be prejudiced." Once more I ask the honorable senator to give a reason for making this distinction. </para>

                        <para>- After the word "cargo," I want the Committee to insert the words " or ballast," for reasons which I think must be obvious to every one. A large proportion of the foreign-trade ships which come to Australian ports, more particularly to Newcastle, come in ballast. Thus there is a considerable amount of work of which our shore labourers are robbed. I think that every honorable senator wishes to see as much work as possible given to Australian labourers. We do not desire that it should be given to the crews of foreign vessels, who might be more profitably employed in effecting necessary repairs which can be undertaken only when those vessels are in port.

I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger should have made unfounded charges which will appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> in reference to an alleged combination. Speaking, not merely as a member of the Senate, but as  President  of the Seamen's Union, I say, unhesitatingly, that no arrangement has been made by that organization with any shipping company in regard to one point of this Bill. When the Navigation Bill of 1908 was under consideration, the Shipping Federation supplied each honorable senator upon the opposite side of the Chamber with 300 amendments to it; but it did not supply me with a copy of them. </para>

The proposal which I have outlined provides that only able seamen shall be permitted to work cargo. Are the ship-owners likely to agree with that? I will undertake to. say that, before the amendment which I have suggested has been disposed of, some of them will interview honorable senators opposite, and request them to oppose it. 1 have already said that firemen are not cut out for working cargo, and yet, especially in Queensland ports, they are frequently required to carry sugar. </para>

                    <para>. - The idea seems to be to protect Australian labour in regard to work that can be done in Australia. But why pick out one small section of the community for this protection ? Why not protect labour against foreign competition in every direction ? Why allow produce to be sent from Australia in the raw state, and have it brought back in the manufactured state, if the process of manufacturing can be done in the country ? </para>

                        <para>- The Government are strong enough to do as they like. They could provide in this Bill that all wool leaving Australia must be washed before export. But, of course, honorable senators opposite have only one idea, and that is to suit their own immediate ends and purposes. Instead of carrying out their policy piecemeal, they should in a proper manner bring down a proposal applicable to all industries in Australia. Their present object is to bene fit a few people in Bunbury. All the talk we have heard about ballast is "buncombe." When a foreign ship is coming to Australia she bundles overboard a quantity of her ballast before she gets within the 3-mile limit. We have been told that Chinese and Afghans do this loading work in Western Australia. 1 am sorry for that. I do not think there is another State in Australia where the work is done by coloured labour. </para>

The case may be an exceptional one. Why does not the Wharf Labourers' Union prevent the occurrence of that kind of thing?  1  should like to see any vessel attempt to employ Chinese or Afghans in Brisbane or Rockhampton, or any port where the Wharf Labourers' Union is active. </para>

It is certainly wrong that a foreign ship should be able to employ her crew on cargo, whilst a British ship lying at the same wharf was compelled to employ labourers. If this amendment will prevent a foreign ship from being placed at an advantage in comparison with an English ship, I shall support it. </para>

The proviso that no permission shall be given for a crew to handle cargo whilst a sufficiency of other labour is available has been explained by the Minister. The proposal of such a proviso is a tribute to the want of confidence that honorable senators opposite would repose in any future Ministry.

                        <para>-  1  am glad that the honorable senator recognises the possibility of another Ministry succeeding the present one. The proviso has now been made pretty tight. It would still be left to the Minister to determine whether a sufficiency of local labour was available, and he might please himself as to whether he would exercise his power under this clause. I have not yet been convinced that the primary reason for its introduction is not that which I stated when I first addressed myself to the question. I do not think any one can contend that this clause is inserted in order that a few men at Bunbury may get a little more employment. The Leader of the Opposition pointed out that to carry such a provision to its logical conclusion we should apply it "to the stowage of wheat, wool, and every other product of the country. To do so would be to restrict and hamper cnr trade and commerce in order that n little benefit might be conferred upon a comparatively few individuals at the expense of our great producing interests. Would that be either fair or reasonable? I have no objection to honorable senators urging that we should protect this particular class of labour if they are willing to give the same protection to every other class of labour, and to extend the same fair play to the producers of our wheat, wool, and minerals. </para>

                        <para>- If we are to do the best we can for our people, we shall not pass legislation for the benefit of one section, which will be against the interests of others. An amendment has been suggested to provide that able seamen who are members of the crews of Australian ships shall be allowed to assist in the loading and unloading of cargo. That would make the clause a little better from the point of view of the owners of Australian ships. I shall not oppose that amendment, but later on I shall avail myself of the opportunity to vote against the clause altogether, because I think it is out of place in such a Bill as that which we have now under consideration. It is our duty to see that- no unnecessary restrictions are placed upon our trade, whether  oversea or coastal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> in speaking on the clause, remarked upon the danger of permitting men who are unskilled in the work to load ships with wheat and wool. The honorable senator said that because of unskilful loading ships have been lost. I should like the honorable senator to give me a list of the badly-loaded ships which he says have never been heard of after leaving port. </para>

                        <para>- The point is that this clause will not effect any improvement in that respect. It would not prevent overloading by regular stevedores, whether under the instruction of the charterers, or any one else. There might be something in the honorable senator's argument if he could show that ships have been lost because they were loaded by their crews. It is provided in this Bill that no unseaworthy ship shall be allowed to go to sea, and unskilful loading might be evidence of an unseaworthy condition. I wish to impress upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that without this provision at all. a vessel that is not properly loaded may be deemed to be in an unseaworthy condition, and may be refused a clearance.

I am referring to a reason given for this clause by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> and I have shown that it is not a cogent reason, because the Bill makes provision without this clause for preventing a ship going to sea if her cargo is not properly stowed, whether by ordinary stevedores or by her crew. </para>

                        <para>- I can at least say that if a ship is loaded by her crew, the attention of the authorities will be specially directed to the possibility that her cargo may not be properly stowed. I say that the reason given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> cannot be accepted as a reason for the introduction of this clause. The reason founded upon the experience of timber -getters at Bunbury, is a very inadequate one, and I again ask why this clause has been introduced ? I do not expect that the Government will frankly say, " The fact is that we believe it will prove a weapon in the hands of the strikers in the event of a strike of wharf labourers because the cargo of a ship is being handled by her crew." But I do not forget statements we have heard made here, perhaps jocularly, perhaps not, to the effect, " We are in power now, and we are going to look after a particular class of people." </para>

                        <para>- Under this clause the Minister will prescribe as and when he sees fit. But it does not say what will happen if the Minister does not prescribe anything at all. What would the honorable senator do then ? He could not compel the Minister to act. If a strike were on in any port, and a vigorous battle was being fought in connexion with this question, I very much doubt whether we should find any Minister prepared to prescribe that the crew of a vessel in that port might assist in unloading and loading her in order that she might get to sea. If- any Minister did so, the men on strike would probably say, " Here is a pretty Minister who, when we are at grips with the shipowners, permits them to use the crews of their ships to handle cargo in order that their vessels may get to sea." I say that it would be a cruel position in which to place a Minister, to ask him to prescribe under this clause in such circumstances. </para>

I do not suppose that any Minister would permit a vessel's crew to do this work if there was plenty of local labour available for the purpose. A Minister has to respect the law which he is called upon to administer. Even a Minister with extraordinary views on the other side of the question will consider it his duty to administer the law. </para>

                        <para>- We know how much it plays a part when a strike is coming on. One side or the other has got the bit in its teeth, neither side is prepared to listen to reason, and public opinion only comes in after the greater part of the mischief has been done. To my mind, this clause can only be proposed with regard to one specific object, and it ought not to be enacted. If the Ministry think that a policy of that kind can be carried out in the country, let them bring down a measure, and if it meets with the approval of Parliament it must be accepted_ until public opinion is educated sufficiently to make a change. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister  is  responsible for giving  us  an interpretation  of  the clause, while  it is  passing through the Senate,  in  order that we may thoroughly understand what it means. Let me quote an incident in point. In1910, the Parliament of New South Wales passed an Industrial Arbitration Act of a fairly drastic character. The Ministry placed great confidence in the Act, and some time after it was passed, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. B.</inline> R.Wise, K.C., as Attorney-General, wrote in the Australian <inline font-style="italic">Review of Reviews</inline> that no strike was possible in New South Wales because, he said, " We have enacted the most drastic provisions preventing employers from resorting to locks-out, and employes from resorting to strikes." If my memory serves me correctly, he said that strikes and locks-out would be at an end. </para>

                        <para>- When the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise,</inline> as Attorney-General, was called to the fact that the workers had to define the law, what answer did he make ? He said, " I will not prosecute - I cannot prosecute, because . the shearers have not struck. They have simply refused to go to work." The Act was thought to be complete and perfect to prevent strikes ; indeed, to establish a sort of economic paradise between workers and employers. Locks-out were distinctly forbidden." The leaving of work without notice was a penal offence; yet when the question came up for consideration in the Court, the Attorney-General, who was the author of the legislation, made the distinction which I have mentioned. What guarantee have we as to the interpretation which shall be given to the words " sufficiency of labour" if inserted in the clause? We are entitled to know what is the proper meaning and acceptance of the term. </para>

I ask the Minister whether he would hold a certain condition of affairs at a port to mean an insufficiency of labour because the labourers would not work, and allow the crew to load or unload the ship; but an answer to my question has not yet been given. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has partially anticipated the answer, but the Minister has remained silent. It is most important that we should know the meaning of the term before a division is taken. It is easy for the Minister to quibble about its meaning when he has accepted the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- When the sitting was suspended, I was dealing with the difficulty that will be experienced in interpreting the words" a sufficiency of labour," which are contained in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> amendment, if that amendment be carried. In this connexion, I would call attention to the fact that, although upon three occasions the High Court, with the assistance of the most eminent counsel, has carefully considered the meaning of the simple words contained in our Constitution, " A dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State," it has not yet arrived at an authoritative decision. In these circumstances, I say that, before we assent to, or dissent from, either the clause or the amendment, we are entitled to know the interpretation which will probably be placed upon them. The Minister has suggested that I have dwelt too strongly upon the attitude which would most likely be assumed by the Government in case of a wharf labourers' strike, either in any of our principal or outlying ports. But to my mind that is the kernel of the question. I have no hesitation in saying that the Minister should give us an authoritative statement of the interpretation which the Government place upon the words " a sufficiency of labour." </para>

                        <para>- I was on the point of closing my remarks when the Minister interjected. By inference, he has affirmed that if my example be followed this discussion will degenerate into a "stone-wall." I repudiate the charge, because one has merely to glance at the faces of Ministers and their supporters to see that they realize the importance of the proposal which is now under consideration. They recognise the importance which every worker in the community will attach to this clause, which is new, and to the amendment, which really constitute the crux of the Bill. During the course of my remarks, I was reminded by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that almost every clause of the Bill contains a similar objectionable feature. That is why members of the Opposition have brought it forward so prominently now. Notwithstanding that the Minister of Defence has placed an embargo upon his followers by declaring, in effect, that if they reply to hostile criticism they will be " stone-walling " the measure, I say that both the Minister and his supporters  will stand condemned, unless they offer a reasonable explanation of the probable interpretation which will be placed upon the words to which I have directed attention. The Minister ought to be in a position to tell the Committee what the view of the Government as to this amendment is, and how they will administer it if it becomes part of the Act. </para>

                    <para>. - Having some connexion with shipping, I have no hesitation in saying that this amendment is a blow aimed at that industry. I credit the present Government with <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> intentions to the extent that if they were in power when a strike took place they would see to it that if the ordinary supply of labour were not available, what is called free labour might be used. But, unfortunately, it is quite possible that in days to come a Government' dependent upon the trade union party may be in power ; and if a dispute took place in the shipping industry then, the consequences would be terrible to the country. A ship might come from abroad in ignorance of this law, and find that, owing to the strike, she was entirely unable to load or unload.' The Ministry in power might be altogether unsympathetic, and might afford no opportunity for free labour to be employed. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators on this side of the chamber have  occasionally  been charged with being monopolists. There is a great monopoly in Australia at present - a Labour monopoly - that 'is injuring the country. No doubt the unions are within their rights in trying to prevent outside people from interfering with them. But I believe in free labour. I hope that the day will never come when honest men will be compelled to belong to unions or lose their political liberty. </para>

                        <para>- In our debates it is always presumed that when an honorable senator alludes to an individual he is prepared to give chapter and verse for his allegations. Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger was ill-advised in his references to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise</inline> without giving the date of the statement. I have quoted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise's</inline> definite statement that the New South Wales Arbitration Act was not intended to prevent strikes. Since I submitted my amendment I have had occasion to redraft it, with a view to improve the phraseology. I therefore wish to withdraw the amendment now before the Chair, with a view of proposing it in an amended form. </para>

                    <para>. - As far as I can learn, this proposal is entirely new. I am not aware that a similar provision appears in any other Navigation Act. I waited patiently in the hope of hearing the Minister of Defence explain why it was necessary to include such a proviso, but no explanation could have been more lame and impotent than that given by him. It amounted to this - that at one time there was, at some port in Western Australia,, where timber was loaded, an effort to do some injustice to the wharf labourers. </para>

                        <para>- The reason given by the Minister for his support of the amendment was certainly not a good one, nor do I believe that it was the true reason. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> then came to the rescue with another explanation as to why (he amendment was proposed. He stated that the intention was to preserve life and to save ships; that the labour of a crew was not intended for the stowage or unloading of cargo. I do not believe that that is the true reason for this proposal. I take it that when a master brings his ship into port his anxiety is to get her unloaded as quickly as possible and get away. It would not be cheap to employ his own crew for loading and unloading. The time. involved would be greater than if he employed ordinary labour. Moreover, ordinary labour is very largely employed for this purpose. It would only be necessary to employ the crew of a vessel in exceptional cases. My belief is that the amendment is proposed in order to play into the hands of unionism, and for no other purpose. The intention is to prevent a crew from helping to unload a ship while a labour trouble is in existence. I do not think that we ought to legislate for such a purpose. I have no objection to men striking. 1 do not object to any body of men saying that they will not work for a certain wage. They have a perfect right to do so. But they have no right to put obstacles in the way of trade, or of a master getting his ship unloaded. If they are not prepared to do the work themselves they ought not to prevent others from doing it. Therefore, I am not prepared to vote for the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister has, by inference, charged honorable senators on this side with " stonewalling " this measure. When he was asked for a simple explanation Of this clause, his reply was, " Do you want me to assist in ' stone- walling ' the Bill?" That was quite unworthy of the honorable senator. We have discussed this clause for four and a half hours, because we believe that its importance demands such discussion. We have here a provision that is entirely new, and is not to be found in any Act of this  kind in this, or any other country. When the Minister was asked1 for an explanation of its introduction, he made a lame and halting statement about the hardships of certain men at Bunbury. I have made inquiries into the matter referred to since ; and I understand that on some of the limber ships visiting Bunbury, there are two or three men engaged because of their special skill in stowing timber. Winch-men, and others engaged on these ships, would be debarred from employment under this clause. We are opposing the clause, amongst other reasons, because we believe it will strike a blow at British shipping. Every reference we have made to British shipping and British interests this afternoon, has been received with a laugh and a jeer which was not creditable to honorable senators opposite. I am one of those who hold by the union with the Old Country. I recognise the great privileges she has conferred upon us, and what she has done for us. She is our best customer, and takes from us yearly products to the value of  ,£30,000,000.  It is on the money received for those products that we have to depend for the development of this country. The Old Country is, in a sense, our Mother., and yet honorable senators opposite endeavour to restrict her trade, and squeeze her business out in every possible way. I suppose that next year some of our honorable friends opposite will be going to the Coronation of King George V., and we shall have them flaunting their loyalty, their devotion to the Crown, and all that sort of thing. We shall judge their sentiments by the legislation they propose. </para>

Only a tithe of what they produce can be used in this country, and they must seek the markets of the world to dispose of their produce. We should assist them in every way we can, instead of placing embargoes upon the export of their produce. We should give our producers fair conditions to enable them to reach the widest possible market, so that they may get the best return for their labour. </para>

                        <para>- 1 was a member of a Government in Victoria that made provision for twenty-two Wages Boards - a greater number than was established by any other Government in Australia. We do not wish to deprive our own men of work. We desire that our wharf labourers and stevedores should have all the work we can possibly give them; but when these men are unreasonable, what are we to do? If British ships come here, whose owners are prepared to concede the terms, wages, and conditions asked by our wharf labourers, is the whole shipping of a port to be hung up, and our producers prevented from reaching their markets because the owners of one .or two foreign ships will not concede the demands of the men working on our wharfs? The Minister should make it clear in this Bill that, in such circumstances, the shipping, of our ports will not be hung up ; but he is afraid "to do so, because he knows that if such a contingency arose, he could not decide the matter, and that the Caucus would have to decide it. We oppose this clause on the grounds I have stated, not - as will be thrown in our teeth - because we wish to deprive our own people of the opportunity to labour. We are prepared to do them justice ; but we are not prepared, for the sake of one class, representing but a small section of our community, to rob our producers of their rights. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to characterize the honorable senator as a vicious man. He is not big enough to be vicious. I wish to say that the viciousness with which he addressed himself to this question has called me to my feet. I regard this clause as one which will very materially assist the shipping industry of Australia. It will be admitted that it is essential that there should be in all our ports a number of men engaged in the lumping industry. They are necessary to secure despatch in the discharging and loading of vessels visiting Australia. Every one will admit that without this class of labour it would be utterly impossible to carry on the shipping industry of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I have very little time for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> just now. He is so very far from the right road in discussing labour matters that 1 must pass him on one side. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> appears to be under the impression that Bunbury is a port in which only one or two men are engaged in the lumping industry. I wish to inform him, whilst I have no brief for Bunbury, that there are hundreds of men employed at that port for this particular work, and there are more winch-men on the wharf at Bunbury than there are engine drivers in the district of Bendigo. In submitting this clause, the Government are doing only what any sensible body of men would do. They are endeavouring to give ship-owners an assurance that there will always be labour available in our ports for discharging and loading cargo. If honorable senators opposite refuse to give a special guarantee that such labour will be available whenever required, they will - to use the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> - be dealing a decided blow at the shipping industry of Australia. We can insure that this class of labour will always be available if we make it clear that when there is work of this kind to be performed it will be the right of our wharf labourers to undertake it. </para>

                    <para>.- Whilst I believe that I have certain rights under the Standing Orders to speak, I am not sure that I have the permission of honorable senators opposite to do so. It would appear to be necessary for one to be very careful when speaking from this side if he desires to express an opinion which is not likely to be favorably received by his political opponents. It has now reached this stage, that, when one ventures to express an opinion from which honorable senators on the other side differ, one is liable to have his integrity assailed and his honesty impugned. </para>

It has been said that when any one uses a quotation, or attributes a statement to a public man, he ought to give chapter and verse, and I propose to do so. The quotation I am about to make is to be found in an article written in  1901,  and appearing in volume  19  of the <inline font-style="italic">Review of Reviews,</inline> at page  551,  column  1,  paragraph  4.  Is that particular enough for honorable senators? Unfortunately, magazines do not follow the excellent example which is followed in Acts of Parliament of numbering the lines, otherwise I should be in a position to enable honorable senators to place their fingers on the exact lines.

                    <para>.- In all seriousness I appeal to the Committee to come to a division. I recognise that there is room for a difference of opinion on the clause. But when I recollect that it has been under discussion for four hours, I think it is time to make an appeal to honorable senators. I recognise that there are sinners on both sides of the chamber in this regard, but I trust that the Committee will now come to a division and make some progress with the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - There is a misunderstanding as to the purpose of the amendment. We do not want to bring about a violent revolution in work. On every Australian-trade ship to-day it is part and parcel of the men's duty to assist wharf labourers in loading and discharging her. We ought, therefore, to provide that able seamen shall be permitted to work cargo under any circumstances. Let me take the case of a vessel which leaves Port Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">en route</inline> to Port Pirie or Port Augusta, and which has to call at intermediate Gulf ports. At these intermediate ports sufficient shore labour is not available to handle the cargo, and, therefore, the vessel has to carry additional labour. When she reaches the terminal ports, more shore labour will be required to work with the able seamen. The same practice is adopted by the vessels which trade to the Richmond, Clarence, and Hunter rivers. </para>

                        <para>- I have not heard of a single individual who has asked for an alteration of the established practice in this connexion. I would further point out that the men who put cargo into a ship's hold at the different ports know exactly where it is stowed when it has to be taken out. When they discharge that cargo, there is thus less likelihood of any portion of it being miscarried. I hope that the Minister will reconsider the matter, and agree to my reasonable request. It is not customary for firemen, trimmers, greasers, donkeymen, or stewards to handle cargo, but occasionally they have been forced to do so. Earlier in the day I remarked that on vessels employed on the Queensland coast the firemen on the off watch have been compelled to work cargo. They strongly object to that, although they have been paid overtime rates. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Minister will stand by the clause in its present form. The practice to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has referred has been the cause of a good deal of friction in the case of British vessels between one set of workers and another set. Indeed, I know of nothing which has engendered more bad blood between waterside workers and ships' crews. We have already laid down a definite principle in respect of British and foreign ships, and that principle, I think, ought also to be applied to Australian ships. I have seen cases in which longshoremen have had to stand idly by and watch the crews of vessels discharging cargo. </para>

I admit that during the time they are working they receive a fair wage. But their employment is so intermittent that their weekly earnings do not aggregate a large sum. Surely we ought to conserve their interests as far as we can consistently do so? I trust that we shall embrace the present opportunity to make their calling a more constant one. The seamen do not re quire this work. At any rate, they can do without it very much better than can the wharf labourers. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened attentively to the discussion of this question, and I confess that I have found it necessary to revise 'the opinion which I formed when the clause first came under review. It then appeared to me that there was no reason why we should discriminate between British or foreign ships and Australian vessels. It seemed to me that if the physic which we have prescribed for British ships was good, it could not be bad for our own vessels. But the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has thrown a new light upon the matter. He affirms that in Australia the custom has grown up on vessels calling at ports where shore labour is not available, of carrying extra hands for the purpose of efficiently handling their cargo. If trade has been developed upon those lines, we ought to be rather slow to deprive some men of their means of livelihood. I should not like to think that, by any law which we enact, we practically sign the death-warrant of any man so far as his employment is concerned. </para>

I admit that there has been some friction, but it has not been considerable. I would remind the Committee that this very question ' was raised on the Pacific Coast of America, and along the lakes of that country, and that a big conflict took place there between the longshoremen and the seamen. The dispute was referred to an arbitrator, in the person of the  president  of the Federated Seamen's Union, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gompier,</inline> who put the position in the light in which I have already presented it.

                        <para>- The Minister's guarantee is very comforting, but it would be much more comforting to ship-owners if we made provision in the Bill. Take the case of a vessel going from Sydney to Newcastle with water in her tanks. When she reached Newcastle she would, under this clause, have to put aside her own engineers and immediately call in a separate staff to pump out the water, because the Bill provides that ballast shall only be shifted by others than members of the crew. </para>

                    <para>. - There seems to be a conflict between this clause and another provision in the Bill. It has probably occurred owing to the fact that the provision with regard to seamen's inspector has been introduced since the Bill was originally drafted. Under this clause a seaman when engaged has to sign an agreement in the presence of the superintendent. In view of the fact that the seamen's inspector is authorized to engage seamen, is it also intended to allow the inspector to act as a witness to the agreement? </para>

                        <para>- But both the superintendent and the seamen's inspector are authorized to engage seamen, is it desirable that we should have two officials at one port authorized to do the same thing? The effect will be confusion, as one body of seamen may go to one official, and another body to the other. I think that there is overlapping in the Bill in this connexion. I believe it has arisen from the fact that, as originally drafted, the idea was that there should be a superintendent only, and that later it was suggested that the other official might act where there was no superintendent. Perhaps the Minister will take advantage of the interval between now and to-morrow to remedy the overlapping, if I am right in my contention. </para>

Crews will be engaged in the main ports of the Commonwealth, where they can be signed on in the presence of a superintendent. In case of emergency, should a shipmaster require to employ a substitute, he may be able to do so without the presence of a superintendent. </para>

                    <para>. - The Leader of the Opposition apparently does not understand the duties which are to be performed by superintendents and seamen's inspectors. They will, under this Bill, be charged with entirely different functions. There will be a superintendent of mercantile marine in every port of the Commonwealth.  1  may say that seamen's inspectors are known to the Board of Trade. In ports like London, Liverpool, and Shields, there are often twenty or thirty seamen's .inspectors. Their duties are to assist the superintendents and the masters of ships, who are in want of crews. They have to keep a register of the addresses of seamen out of work so that whenever a master is looking for a crew, a seamen's inspector may be able at once to put his hands on the men required. That will be one of the duties of a seamen's inspector under this Bill. He will be expected to supply seamen or apprentices, but not to engage them. When they are supplied by the seamen's inspector, they will be brought before the superintendent, whose duty it will be to put them on the ship's articles. The main object of appointing a seamen's inspector is to do away with crimping. </para>

                        <para>- No; he will be a Government servant under a penalty if he is found taking a tip from a seaman, or anything of that kind, and he will, of course, know that, if he does anything crooked, he may lose his position under the Government. A seamen's inspector may be required, after he has supplied men, and they have been signed on, to see that they are put on board the ship. This work is done by seamen's inspectors every day in London. They are on the pier heads, and if it is found that a ship about to go to sea has not a full complement of men, the seamen's inspector may have two or three men with him, who can be put on board at once. The duties of a seamen's inspector will be altogether different from the duties of a superintendent, who will be required to read the ship's articles, see that they are properly signed, and the provisions of the law carried out. When the ship returns to port, it will be the superintendent's duty to see that the agreement entered into between masters and men has been carried out, and that the men have had their money paid over to them in proper time. I think the clause as it stands is perfectly clear. </para>

The witnessing of the signing of articles is only one of the multifarious duties imposed under this Bill on the superintendent. The keeping of a register, and the supply of seamen will be the sole duties of the seamen's inspectors. </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">The Mercantile Marine Office is established for certain purposes. If the superintendent is to be called away to sign men on on board a ship, perhaps 3 or 4 miles away, most of the office business will be hung up, and other persons who wish to transact business will have to await his return.  A considerable amount of business- other than the signing on or off of men is transacted there. Persons, for instance, have to go there to get discharges. The office is also a savings bank, where men lodge money and withdraw it. It is charged with a hundred and one duties. It deals with the affairs of deceased seamen, and a number of questions which crop up. All the documents connected with the port are kept there. An agreement can be made better at the Mercantile Marine Office than on board a ship. One matter which was strongly commented upon by the Royal Commission was the necessity to prevent desertion. Suppose that men present themselves on board a ship before the superintendent for the purpose of being shipped. He has no documents with him, and, therefore, he does not know the ships which the men have left, or whether they have deserted or not. He is handicapped to a very considerable extent. It is sometimes a convenience, I admit, for men to be able to sign on on board the ship, but what happens? As a rule the superintendent says, "Yes, I will come down after  5  o'clock," and the ship has to pay overtime rates to him for coming down after his office hours. </para>

                        <para>- The business is put off, and some superintendents prefer to do the work after office hours, for the purpose of adding to their salaries. It is a bad practice. An agreement between a shipmaster and his crew is made in a public office, and it is there that any additional seamen ought to be signed on. In the case of any other public office, whether State or Commonwealth, it is not provided that business may be transacted at an individual's house. If any man wishes to transact business with a Government office, he has to go there. Why should a difference be made in this case? It is in the best interests of the seamen and the ship-owner that the business should be done properly and in order, and that can only be done at the Mercantile Marine Office. In England the shipping on the home trade is done anywhere, and by custom the Coast Shipping Office, as it was called, for a great many of the ships sailing out of London, was a low public house near Lower Thames-street, in Billingsgate. That was where the men made their agreements for the coast, and that is probably what will happen in Australia. As our shipping increases, we shall find men hanging about public houses in a place like Lower Thames-street, instead of attending at a Government office, where accommodation is provided while they wait for ships. That is the evil which has grown up in England, where it is optional to sign on elsewhere than at a Mercantile Marine Office. </para>

A Customs officer is not likely to accept a bribe to allow anything shady to be done.

In all cases, the. superintendent and his deputies will be Customs officers under pur control, and liable to dismissal for improper conduct.

When honorable senators consider the distance which the docks extend to the south and west of the Melbourne Customs House, they can realize that the amendment, if made, might cause very great inconvenience, not only to ship masters, but also to the crews. For these reasons, I ask them not to accept it. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister has given no facts. He has merely said that the amendment, if made, would cause inconvenience to shipmasters as well as to crews. I admit that it would cause some inconvenience j but, in every clause, that is done. Within a certain time of his arrival, a master has to go to the Customs House and enter his ship in. He has to go, lodge his articles at the Shipping Office, and, before he departs, he has to go back and get them. And he has to go to the Customs House to clear his ship out. No matter in what part of the harbor his ship may be laying, his whole business is centered round the Customs House while he is in port. </para>

                        <para>- They have to go to the Shipping Office when they are paying off. Take the case of a man who is about to be paid off after a three months' voyage. He has obtained a number of articles from the slop chest, and deductions have been made for tobacco, and one thing and another. Scarcely a ship is paid off without a dispute arising as to the amount due to a man. Is it fair that such disputes shall take place on the ship, dr on the wharf, rather than in the public office? Why is the office established, if it is not to transact the business in? A good deal has been said about the inconvenience which the acceptance of my amendment would cause. We might as well require the superintendent to go on board a ship to get the articles when she arrives, and to take her clearance on board when she is about to depart, as pass this clause. The Shipping Office is established for the protection of the men, who are making agreements which are to last, in some cases, for six months, and in others for three years. Surely a serious business of that description ought to be transacted in a place where it can be fairly, and well carried out. The Minister has pointed out that provision has been made in the Bill to protect seamen against crimping. But my amendment has no relation to crimping. It merely seeks to insure that the agreement with a seaman shall be properly drawn, and that it shall be fairly understood by him. As a matter of fact, some ships' articles require a lot of explanation. In many instances the agreement into which a seaman enters is for a period of three years. If some members of this Committee were about to sign an agreement which would bind them for three years, they would get a solicitor to explain its provisions to them. </para>

                        <para>- All deep-water agreements are for that term. As a matter of fact, some agreements cover voyages to any ports in the world. Under these circumstances, surely their nature should be fully explained to the seamen who are about to sign them. If Ministers had experienced the trouble which I have experienced in connexion with ships' articles, they would not object to my amendment. Let me remind the Committee that a dispute may occur on board ship between a seaman and the captain, in regard to a question of wages, and the captain may order the man to leave his vessel. If such a dispute occurred in the Shipping Office, the superintendent would be in full control, and the seaman would not leave the office until he had received justice. But on a ship the superintendent can exercise no control over the master. </para>

                    <para>. -I shall support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> amendment. When the Bill of  1908  was under consideration, this very matter occupied our attention for some hours. When the supporters of the proposal which is now put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> endeavoured to get it embodied in that measure, some honorable senators argued that great inconvenience would arise if the superintendent were prevented from signing men on articles on board ship. I have signed ships' articles upon a few occasions, but I have never signed them outside a shipping office. In large ports, if we except the British coastal trade, men are rarely asked to sign articles on board ship. It is just as well that I should speak frankly upon this matter, and, therefore, I ask honorable senators to allow their minds to revert to the year  1900,  when we experienced a big maritime trouble in Australia. At that time our maritime engineers complained that incompetent men were employed in the stokeholds, and that vessels were sent to sea with deck hands who were destitute of experience, and who, probably, would never have been engaged had they been required to sign articles at a suitable place. Every one of those men were signed on by superintendents in the ships' cabins. If we do not agree to the amendment, we shall be playing into the hands of persons who may again use this power to endanger the lives of passengers by sea, and to threaten the safety of valuable property. 1 repeat that many of the vessels at the period of which I speak were manned by incompetents. </para>

                        <para>- I do not suggest that it would. But it would have enabled other persons to enter an objection to their engagement upon the grounds that they were incompetent, and that their employment constituted a danger to the lives of the sea-travelling public. It seems to me necessary that the work of signing seamen on articles ought to be above suspicion. There  should be no possibility of the use of back-stairs influence. Consequently, it should be done on shore. In 1900, it was supposed to be the duty of the State Governments to see that only competent seamen were engaged. But in many instances the maritime engineers had to perform a good deal of the work which ought to have been performed by men who formed a portion of the crews. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is asking nothing unreasonable when he asks that all seamen shall be obliged to sign articles in the office which has been established by the Government for the purpose. Take the position which exists in Melbourne to-day. Are seamen signed on articles in the cabins of ships? Certainly not. Every man is signed on at the shipping office. The same practice obtains in Sydney and Brisbane, and all that we ask is that provision for this shall be made in the Bill. If that be done, we shall have the comforting assurance that in time of industrial trouble the lives of the sea-travelling public will be just as adequately protected as they are at any other time. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause relates to running agreements. Running agreements are made by ships on the Australian coast, and it often occurs that a ship may not return to her home port until after a period of six months. Such agreements are, however, usually made for six months. Take the case of a ship signing on in Melbourne, and going to Western Australia to trade on the north-west coast. The agreement may stipulate that the port of discharge is Melbourne. She may be kept in Western Australia on a rotation of voyages up and down the coast for twelve months. This clause as it stands would mean that the men on board would have to continue beyond the six months of their agreement, and until such time as the shipowner liked to bring them back to the port of discharge. I intend to submit an amendment the effect of which will be that such an agreement shall remain in force, in the case of a foreign-going ship, but that at whatever port the ship is when the term of the agreement ends, the men shall be. able to claim their discharge; and be sent by the ship-owner to the port of destination. Articles are often signed on in </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Melbourne, when a ship comes here for her overhauling. But though the articles are for six months, the ship is kept on the Western Australian coast for eight, nine or ten months, and sometimes for even longer than that. Very often there is no intention on the part of the ship-owner to bring the men back at the end of the six months. She enters upon fresh voyages without any attempt to return to the port of destination. </para>

These articles are drawn for six months, but when that term expires, the men are not paid off. If they were paid off at the port which the vessel reached at the nearest date to the termination of the six months, they would have to pay their own passages back to Melbourne. They' would thus spend all their savings in getting back home. </para>

                    <para>. - This is another instance of the unfairness of springing upon the Committee an amendment of a highly technical character, without giving the Minister an opportunity of considering it. I dp urge honorable senators who have important amendments to submit not to keep them up their sleeve, but to let us know of them some time before they are moved. It is 'but fair to a Minister in charge of a Bill of this description that that should be done. I am not prepared to deal with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> amendment in the dark, and if we were to sit on I should have to oppose it. Under the circumstances we 'had better report progress. </para>
