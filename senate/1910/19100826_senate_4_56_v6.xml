                        <para>. The subject-matter of this Bill has been pretty well threshed out on two previous occasions, so that there is no necessity to go into the details now as there was before. The main principle of the measure is the acceptance of the Northern Territory by the Commonwealth, and I think that to that principle every honorable senator, no matter on which side he sits, will be prepared to give a most cordial assent. That a grave necessity exists for taking over that huge slice of country is known to everybody, because, while it remains as it is - practically speaking a wilderness, totally undeveloped, and with no population worth speaking about - it is a menace to the wellbeing of the Commonwealth. It is essential, if Australia is to become a great nation, which we all desire, that steps should be taken to develop the Territory, and people it with a sturdy population of our own race. For a great number of years it has been under the control of South Australia, which so- far has failed, for one reason or another, to adequately develop the country. I am not blaming South Australia for the failure, because, to use the expressive words which were used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> " It bit off more than it could chew " when it undertook the government of the Territory. It is the duty of the Commonwealth to get control of the Territory, and proceed to develop it in the national interests. We want the country developed and, as I have said, occupied by a sturdy population of our. own race so as to add to our wealth-producing power, and above all to be a garrison to protect, that portion of die continent against invasion. I am in favour of the Commonwealth taking over the Territory, and, therefore,. I am prepared to vote for the second reading of the Bill just as I did on a former occasion. But it must be remembered that in connexion with its main principle there are several details which may not be nearly so acceptable to honorable senators on either side, and they have a right to say what the details shall be. The measure imposes upon the Commonwealth conditions with regard to taking over the Territory to which it should not be asked to accede. First, I want to know, and I hope that the Government will be able to  state, why extraneous matters were included in the agreement, and find a place in the Bill. I maintain that this question should be treated distinctly on its merits, without the intrusion of extraneous matter. </para>

                            <para>- Still <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest has been like Tennyson's brook. Ministries might come and Ministries might go; he appeared to go on for ever, but, of course, when the brook got to the sea it was swallowed up. I have mentioned one of the details to which I object. Because we do not wish to have the Parliament hampered as to its plans for the future development of the Territory, we have been accused by some honorable senators with taking up an anti-national attitude, whereas it is South Australia which is all the time taking up that attitude, because its Government say, " Unless you do this in accordance with our parochial wish and desire, vou will not be allowed to do it at all." It can be plainly seen at once where the anti-national attitude is most in evidence.  1  have never taken up an attitude which can be called anti-national. I have said that I am prepared to agree to the Commonwealth taking over the Territory with every shilling of indebtedness belonging to it, and every shilling of the accrued deficit which South Australia has accumulated in connexion with her administration of that country. What I am determined to insist upon is that if it is to be taken over, this Parliament shall be free to develop its resources as it pleases. I would point out that if it is taken over, then in any future developmental plans South Australia, in common with every other State, will have her full say. What more should she desire or ought she to get? It has been said that we want the railway to go here, there, or somewhere else. I freely confess that I do not know which is the best route to follow, and I venture to say that not a single member of this Parliament does. If we lay down hard-and-fast rules as to the route of the railway, then undoubtedly we shall be legislating in the dark, because no member of either House of this Parliament has sufficient information to enable him to say which is the best route to select with a view to efficiently occupying and developing the Territory. That is the position which I have taken up all along, and the one which I shall always stand by, because I hold that if the Territory is to be transferred to the Commonwealth, the Parliament must be left entirely free and unhampered as to the means to be adopted for its development. It is South Australia which assumes an anti-national attitude when she presumes to dictate to this Parliament what it should do. </para>

                            <para>- She does in the agreement which we are now asked to ratify. She says, " This is a great national project which must be undertaken by the Commonwealth for the development of its resources, its safety, and its well-being, but, unless you accede to our demands, we shall not allow you to take over the Territory." That is an anti-national and parochial attitude. In his second-reading speech, we were told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that the agreement was arrived at by two great Nationalists. He paid, I believe, a very well-deserved tribute to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Price, who was Premier of South Australia when the agreement was made, and whose death I am sure every one regrets., The honorable senator said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price</inline> viewed this matter entirely from the national stand-point when he was making the agreement. I interjected, " At the same time that honorable gentleman had a tender and a proper regard for the interests of South Australia," and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> of course, had to assent to that statement. I have no blame to attach to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price</inline> or to politicians in South Australia for trying to conserve its interests. What I object to is their assumption that they are taking a national view when at the same, time it is a mere parochial one. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> went on to pay an equally glowing tribute to the nationalism of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> In fact, in listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor's</inline> eulogy of that gentleman, I wondered how the Labour party ever had the temerity to oppose a Government led by such a great Nationalist as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> I ask the Minister if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> is not an equally good Nationalist as the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Price or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin?</inline> I challenge any Minister to deny that. Yet, what are the facts? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> voted against this proposal when it was submitted to another place last session. Ministers, if they say that the agreement was based on purely national lines, will have to deny to their present Leader that he was actuated by national motives when he voted on the question last year. </para>

                            <para>- I know all the tall talk that is indulged in by the representatives of South Australia on this question. We were told last year that if we rejected the Bill we should never get a chance to discuss it again. How is it that we are getting a chance this year to consider it? If South Australia was really so eager as we were led to believe to back out of the agreement, that we were never to be given another chance to pass it if we failed to take advantage of the opportunity afforded last year, how is it that we are getting another chance this year ? </para>

It is, that if we do not settle this matter now we shall find in ten years' time that South Australia will be only too glad to get rid of a Territory that is costing her a large sum of money every year, and from, which she gets no return. We who believe that this Territory should be taken over on national lines are not asking for any conditions at all. We do not ask that the railway shall be built here, there, or anywhere else. We do not ask that the line shall be run through a sandy desert, through a district in which all the water is salt, or through rolling sand-hills, where, like drifting snow, the sand will be continually covering the railway. </para>

                            <para>- South Australia, which has egregiously failed to develop the Northern Territory, wishes to lay her dead hand upon the Commonwealth. She says, "You must develop the Territory according to my ideas, although in trying to do it, I have failed absolutely." Is that viewing the matter from a national stand-point ? Let us examine the question a little more closely. I should like the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> who wishes to know my views. I ask why we should be compelled to take over a long length of non-paying railway in South Australia itself, extending from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, in order to develop the Northern Territory. Will the honorable senator repeat his statement that that line will have to be thrown on the scrap heap unless this is done? </para>

                            <para>-I shall try to keep within the mark, but if I have transgressed it was scarcely my fault, because I was drawn aside by interjections. South Australia, having built the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, tells us, through one of her representatives, that unless it is used as a part of the transcontinental line running through the Northern Territory it may as well be put on the scrap heap. I am inclined to believe the honorable senator, because I know from official South Australian documents that one train a fortnight is. found to be sufficient to carry all the traffic on that line. The country must be incapable of development if the railway communication - one train a fortnight - is more than ample to carry the traffic. Why should the Commonwealth be compelled, not only to take over this stretch of a non-paying railway, but also to build another stretch of non-paying railway through equally bad country ? </para>

                            <para>-The Macdonnell Range country is not nearly so good as some honorable senators try to make out. I admit that there is as good pastoral country on the Barclay tableland, and from there in the direction of Pine Creek, as in any other portion of Australia. It is first-rate, pastoral country, but south of the tableland we are told by every one who has attempted to travel through the country - and only very few have succeeded - that the country is of the same class as that along the line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. It is a fact that cattle being brought from any part of the Northern Territory down to Adelaide year in and year out have to be brought round through Queensland. If the country around the Macdonnell Ranges were good country, why should cattle travelling to Adelaide be brought by such a roundabout route? It must be because there is a lack of feed or water on the direct route. </para>

                            <para>- I shall not go as far as that, but they are certainly amongst the best paying lines in Queensland. I think I have disposed of the good country and splendid water that we are told are to be found in the southern portion of the Northern Territory. The fact that cattle travelling to Adelaide are brought from the Northern Territory down through Queensland and New South Wales is a proof that the country along the route which it is suggested the transcontinental railway should follow is unfit for settlement. That is the information we have about it at the present time, but, as I said at the outset, there is no member of the Senate who has any definite information as to the character of the country through which, under the terms of the agreement, the railway would be constructed. It is for this reason that I say the Commonwealth Parliament should be left free, after collecting all the information possible, to decide by what route the railway should be taken in order to develop the Northern Territory. I claim that that is a national view to take of this national project. There are honorable senators on both sides of this Chamber who appear to be fond of tying up the Federal Parliament, or, to use an expressive phrase used by an honorable member in another place, of " leg-roping " the Commonwealth. They desire that the Commonwealth should not be allowed to wander too far in this or that direction, but that we should go round in a circle circumscribed by the length of the " legrope." That is not a proper position in which to place this Parliament. No one who desires to see a national sentiment developed in Australia would wish to have this Parliament placed in such an invidious position. </para>

                            <para>- According to some accounts, it certainly is, and, speaking casually on the question, I do not think that in Australia we have any reason to be proud of the way in which the natives have been treated in any of the States. Every one of the States, when given the right of self-government, was given the right to build railways and establish harbors where it pleased, and to develop its territory in any way it thought proper. If the people of the States were not given that right, they would not have had self-government. But if the Northern Territory is handed over to the Commonwealth, under the terms of the agreement proposed we shall not possess the right of government of the Territory except in a limited sense. We must develop the country by a railway policy in accordance with the parochial ideas of South Australia. It might not be necessary for a very long time to build the transcontinental railway. It might even he found much better to do what has been done in the other States, namely, run railways from the coast into the interior of the Northern Territory. If that should be found the best means of developing the country, why should not the Commonwealth Parliament be free to take that course? It appears to me that not only are we expected to develop the Territory on the lines suggested in the agreement, but South. Australia expects us to develop that State itself by a railway policy. This is the first time in the history of the Commonwealth that we have been asked to assume railway responsibilities in any State. </para>

                            <para>- That is just what I have said. I say that we should be free, in the light of full knowledge after close investigation of all the facts bearing on the case, to take what seems to us to be the best course. South Australia expects us to take over a very long stretch of nonpaying railway and to relieve her of her responsibility on account of that railway, which has landed her in very considerable difficulties. What is the position in Queensland? Whatever else may be said of that State, she has, at least, done as much as any State in the Commonwealth to develop her country by the construction of railways. She has incurred the highest debt per head of population of any State in Australia in order to do so. And now, after incurring that debt to build her own railways, she is asked to incur further indebtedness to build a railway for another State ! The proposal will not hold water. It cannot commend itself to any fair-minded man. Why should Queensland be asked to carry out a railway policy in South Australia? </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that any South Australian senator will deny that while South Australia has attempted to develop her interior - if it were capable of development or worth development - by building the line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, she has not done so much proportionately as has been done by the other States to develop their interior. The map hanging in the chamber now shows only a portion of the railways in the other States, but it sufficiently indicates how much they have done for their Interior development in comparison with South Australia. The least she could have done was to build that line to Oodnadatta; and yet we are told that if that railway is not continued through the Northern Territory, so as to bring all the trade down to Adelaide, the railway must be thrown upon the scrap-heap. That is such a gloomy view of the possibilities of South Australia that I do not care to characterize it further. There is another point of view in connexion with the Oodnadatta line to  which I would like to draw attention for a little while. South Australia has not only failed to develop the Northern Territory, but she has actually failed to develop South Australian territory. </para>

                            <para>- Like " the flowers that bloom in spring" that has nothing to do with the case. It is a position unequalled on this earth that a State should have no less than three-sevenths of its whole population resident in one city. South Australia has confined herself to the development of Adelaide, and has allowed the rest of her territory to go hang. Now, having failed to develop the State, she comes cap in hand to the Commonwealth Parliament and asks us to develop it for her. That is the great national attitude that South Australia has assumed. I should like to remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that for the glorification of Adelaide, and the good of its trade, South Australia could afford to build a railway up to the border of another State in order to secure the trade of Broken Hill, while she has failed to develop her own territory. </para>

I venture to say that  a  large number of the Western Australian representatives were not in favour of it until the provision was inserted in relation to the railway for the benefit of Western Australia. </para>

                            <para>- It is not true so far as concerns either of the honorable senator who interject. But I am not going to mention the names publicly. Indeed,I ask the honorable senators from Western Australia what the railway affecting their State has to do with this matter at all What right has Parliament to coerce South Australia against her will in this matter? Is it a fact that there were certain South Australian senators who were not in favour of granting the concession to Western Australia, and had to be coerced into doing so? Will any honorable senator reply  to  that question? Yet we find that this spirit of huckstering and bargaining is pursued to such lengths that, in order to get support from all parties, entirely extraneous matter has been included in the Bill.I think honorable senators must see for them selves that the real national position with regard to this matter is to leave the Commonwealth Parliament free, after it take over the Northern Territory, to proceed  to  develop it in the full light of all the knowledge that can be obtained. </para>

                            <para>- Every member of the Commonwealth Parliament was prepared to vote for the taking over of the Territory, and for taking over every shilling of debt attachable to it, and also every shilling of deficit which South Australia had incurred through its attempt  to  develop the Territory. Having done  so  much, I say that this Parliament should not be asked to do a single thing more.I am not asking anything for the State which I represent. I am simply asking that the Commonwealth Parliament shall be left free to do the best it possibly can on the information available. But South Australia is asking for everything, and Western Australia is asking for something. Those are the States which assume the anti-national attitude. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know of any interests except the interests of the Commonwealth generally. Anybody who looks at the map must see that the projected railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie does not go within 500 or 600 miles of the Northern Territory. What in the name of Providence then has that line to do with the taking over of the Territory? It does not go towards the Territory, and has nothing to do with it. Why should such a stipulation be included in this measure? Will any reasonable man who looks at the map tell me why we should agree lo the stipulation to which I refer? </para>

                            <para>- It is not: but compulsion has been exercised on South Australia to give permission to build the Western Australian railway whether she likes it or not. Why, I ask again, should this Commonwealth dictate terms at the instance of one State to another State ? Why should we dictate terms to South Australia at the instance of certain representatives from Western Australia? </para>

I have said all I desire to say on the Bill at this stage. Later on I intend to move an exactly similar amendment to that which I submitted when the Senate last dealt with this question. That is to say, I shall submit a proposition to the effect that we should ratify the agreement, with the exception of the extraneous clause relating to railways, which has nothing whatever to do with the matter. We should leave the Federal Government free to develop the Territory as it pleases. In other words, we should express our willingness to relieve South Australia of a Territory which hitherto she has egregiously failed to do anything with. </para>

                            <para>- I think I am correct in saying that the honorable senator opposed the Trust Funds Bill. He opposed the Surplus Revenue Bill. Now he is opposing this Bill on the ground that he is a good Australian and a sincere Nationalist. Posing as such, he is doing his best to prevent the Commonwealth acquiring the Northern Territory. He knows very well that the agreement entered into by the Deakin Government on behalf of the Commonwealth, and by the Government headed by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Price on behalf of South Australia, included the condition that the transcontinental line should be completed. He knows that, unless that agreement be carried out, the Commonwealth cannot, under any circumstances, acquire the Northern Territory. </para>

                            <para>- Because South' Australia will refuse to hand it over to the Commonwealth? It has been frequently pointed out how inadequately Australia is defended in respect of its northern areas. It has been pointed out times without number that the Territory is a serious menace to every citizen in Australia, but when certain honorable senators have an opportunity of minimizing the danger which daily confronts us, they are determined, if they possibly can, to prevent the Common wealth from adequately protecting itself. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> said that South Australia,' when she took over the Territory, " bit off more than she could chew," and had failed to develop it. If she had pursued a policy similar to that pursued in Queensland, so far as developmental work was concerned, the Territory would have been peopled, as some parts of Northern Queensland are peopled today, by a piebald population, when it would have given us a big problem indeed to solve. </para>

                            <para>- That is merely an aside. The northern parts of Queensland have been developed by coloured labour, and it was because of the danger which the employment of such labour threatened to the whole of Australia that the consummation of Federation was hastened. That was, in a large measure, responsible' for Queenslanders being so ardent in their desire for Federation. </para>

                            <para>- The sugar industry, in Queensland, was developed by kanakas, or bond slaves, and, to-day, the banana industry, which Protectionists and Free Traders are extremely anxious about, is solely in the hands of Chinese in Queensland. According to <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> there are, in round figures, 23,000 coloured folks in Queensland, and in South Australia, including, of course, the Northern Territory, 4,650. It is quite true that the railway from Port Darwin to Pine Creek, covering a distance of 147 miles,, was built by Chinese labour, but it is also true that an Act was passed which would have enabled South Australia to introduce any number of Indian coolies into the Northern Territory for the development of it. There was a strong feeling in the Parliament which passed that measure that the only way by which that portion of South Australia could be developed was by the introduction of coloured labour, but an agitation was set afoot which stopped that. The State is to be complimented and congratulated upon having shouldered the burden for such a long period, and made it possible for Australia lo lie a white man's land. </para>

                            <para>- At what cost and price are we asked te take over the Territory? We are offered an area four and a half times the size of Great Britain and Ireland for - taking into consideration the cost of the proposed railway embodied in the agreement - about ,£10,000,000. That is an absolute bargain to the Commonwealth, because there are visible and latent assets in the Territory. It is admitted by geologists and mining experts that it is one of the most highly mineralized parts of Australia. Almost every known mineral has been found there. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> and other senators, are aware that it contains magnificent belts of pastoral country, fine belts of agricultural land, and some of the finest waterways. Surely these factors are worthy of consideration. There will no doubt be unanimity on the part of Queenslanders in respect to an amendment which will be submitted later. We know how vigorously its members fought before against" the carrying of a similar measure. </para>

                            <para>- I should say so. What would there be to prevent the Commonwealth from building railways in its own Territory. Reference has been made to the fact that two sections of this proposed transcontinental line are non-payable. That is perfectly true, but I have heard it argued in the Senate, and from innumerable platforms by Labour representatives and by men who are opposed to the Labour party, that we should not consider " railways from a payable view-point, that they should be considered from a community or a national aspect. A railway constructed to-day, costing some thousands of pounds, may not prove directly a profitable enterprise for some considerable time. But many railways which have been nonpaying for some time have, after developmental work has taken place, proved highly profitable enterprises. There is a desire growing up in the minds of numbers of Australians that, in some parts, railways should precede settlement. Our policy hitherto has been that settlement should precede railway construction. </para>

                            <para>- No. We are told by the opponents of this measure that this is huckstering business on the part of that State. Was there any huckstering spirit manifested by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Price, in regard to the Commonwealth taking over the Territory. On the contrary, he knew the influences that were at work, not only in South Australia, but also in London, to acquire the Territory for the benefit of profit-mongers, and that there was a keen desire on the part of certain investors to get the South Australian Parliament to pass an Act enabling those persons to build this railway, provided that a vast area was handed over to them. We know that during the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the Jenkins Government a Bill was passed by the State Parliament enabling a transcontinental railway to be built on the land-grant principle, and that it remains on the statute-book. What did that mean? That Act was an open invitation to investors that, if they built the railway, 90,000,000 acres of land on either side of the route would be- handed over to them absolutely free. In other words, that they would receive an area almost one and a-half times as large as the State I represent. Had that been done. South Australia might as well have handed over the whole of the Territory to the syndicates, because, holding the railway and owing .vast areas on either side, they would practically own the Territory, and, in a measure, they would own almost everybody who took up his abode there. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Price knew as well as every honorable senator knows the burden which South Australia had to carry in respect to the Territory. The influence which was at work in London and in South Australia is not, in my opinion, dead, because meetings have recently been held in South Australia, at which resolutions have been passed urging that State to hold on to the Territory, and suggesting that the railway should be completed on the land-grant principle. Knowing what these influences meant to Australia the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Price, as a good Nationalist, got into communication with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> and a mutual agreement was drawn up. There is nothing in the Bill, or in the agreement, which, in my opinion, any true Australian can oppose. -The time has arrived for the Commonwealth to assert itself. I believe that if a plebiscite of the electors were taken there would be an overwhelming majority in favour of the Commonwealth taking over, the Territory under the conditions specified in this Bill. </para>

Although at one time the acquisition of the Northern Territory by the Commonwealth was not favored by certain newspapers here, and strong opposition was offered in the National Parliament to our taking it over on the terms drawn up by the Government of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was Prime Minister, and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Price as Premier of South Australia, I never hesitated to express my views as to' the advisability of the Commonwealth Parliament acquiring the Territory as speedily as possible. For the reasons I have given this morning, and which I gave on a previous occasion when a similar measure was before us, I shall record my vote for this Bill. I hope it will have a better fate- than had a similar measure previously discussed. The latter was lost by two votes, but I trust that when the division is taken the second reading of this measure will be carried by a substantial majority. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not rise with a very light heart to speak on this matter.. I am told that the numbers are against us, and I intend to make only a very few remarks so that it may not be assumed hereafter that I gave my consent to this proposal. I was hoping that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> would be against the Bill, but as he is not, and I am paired with him, I shall be unable to record a vote against the measure as I wished to do. Though a supporter of the late Government I strongly opposed a similar measure introduced by them. I oppose this just as strongly, so that no charge of inconsistency can be levelled against me for what I am going to say. I do not think I have been charged with any inconsistency during all the time I have been a member of this Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid I have been led off the track. At my time of life, 78 years of age, I cannot be expected to be as lively as a two-year-old. I am not against the construction of a transcontinental line to Port Darwin. The Commonwealth will be acting very wisely in proceeding with the construction of such a line. I may say that I do not regard the proposed line from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie as a transcontinental line. I do wish to impress upon honorable senators that we should do well to leave the route of the line to Port Darwin to be selected by the most expert men for the purpose to be found in the Commonwealth, and after full inquiry. I know something of the country through which the existing line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta goes, because many years ago I had a good deal to do with the construction of the first section of that line. I am willing to commit the Commonwealth to the construction of this transcontinental railway, but I do say that the route should be left to expert knowledge after full inquiry. </para>

I think that the line might very much better be brought through or very near Queensland and New South' Wales territory. If such a route were adopted the country would be available for immediate occupation and development. That would be better than to take the railway through country which, in my opinion, and in the opinion of those best able to judge, is not suitable for settlement. </para>

On the subject of building railways on the land grant principle, we know that Canada has been developed by land grant railways, and would never have been developed <inline font-style="italic">hi</inline> the way it has been under a system of State railways. The land grant railway people in Canada have brought thousands of emigrants from the Continent and the Old Country into Canada, and provided them with houses ready built and cultivated farms. What Government would take that kind of work in hand ? </para>

                            <para>- I should never condemn a policy of that kind. I am prepared to go the "whole hog" in developing the country in any reasonable and sensible way. I contend that private enterprise can do infinitely more than any Government can do in work of this kind, in view of the difficulties that always confront the Government in holding their own. I am at a loss to understand the reason why Western Australian senators and some senators from Queensland have amalgamated in connexion with this proposal. Perhaps I ought to say combined. </para>

It would be far more profitable to the Commonwealth to take the line by the route I have suggested. A line by that route could be built in sections, and could be much more easily and cheaply constructed than a line over the direct route. </para>

                        <para>. - It will not be said that my attitude on this question is governed by parochialism, or bv a desire to promote the interests of one State at the expense of another. The question does not matter to Tasmania one way or the other. We -are not concerned with benefiting Queensland, or with bringing the railway through the centre of Australia for the benefit of Adelaide. I am open to conviction on the subject, although I know how I am going to vote as at present advised. The arguments that have been used have not convinced me up to the present that there is any justification for the Senate departing from the original intention to bring the railway down through the centre of Australia. An agreement has been entered into with the South Australian Government. It contains a condition to the effect that, unless the railway from Port Darwin to Pine Creek is connected with the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, she will not proceed with the contract. We have been confronted with contradictory legal opinions. The opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dashwood,</inline> the Crown Solicitor of South Australia, on the. point whether the agreement will be null and void if the railway is not built entirely within the Northern Territory, is that the line must be constructed between the two points mentioned. </para>

                            <para>- The weight of authority seems to be against the Federal Attorney-General, and, speaking as a layman, it seems to me that the words " to be built in the Northern Territory " must mean that the railway must be built entirely within the Territory, and that not one foot "of the line must go outside of it. There is another aspect of the question that has agitated my mind considerably. I have always held the opinion that the Northern Territory should be taken over by the Commonwealth for defence purposes, if for no other reason. Some five or six years ago, we had before Parliament a Bill providing for the survey of a route for a railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. I then expressed the opinion that it would be necessary in the interests of defence to connect the Northern Territory with the rest of Australia. In my opinion, the line with which we are now concerned is of even greater importance from a national and defence aspect than the line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. The defence aspect has always appealed strongly to me. Has it occurred to honorable senators that if a line is built from the present terminus at Pine Creek to the Queensland border, and made to connect with the present line from Melbourne to Brisbane, several breaks of gauge would be involved? From a defence point of view, it is evident that it would not be a good thing to have several breaks of gauge on a railway over which troops might have to be carried. If the line is built through the centre of Australia, however, those breaks of gauge will be avoided. I take it that the gauge of the Pine Creek line is 3 ft. 6 in. If that line were carried on to the Queensland border, it would connect with another 3 ft. 6 in. gauge line. This again connects with a 4 ft. 8^ in. gauge line in New South Wales, which joins on to a 5 ft. 3 in. gauge line in Victoria, and when Adelaide is reached, there is once more a 3 ft. 6 in. gauge line. That is an aspect of the question that has afforded food for grave thought to me. .It appears to me that for purposes of defence, which is the most important aspect, the weight of opinion is on the side of a line through the Northern Territory. An appeal has been made to the independent spirit of the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> who urges that the question of railway construction should be left open. But if we leave it open, may we not lose the opportunity of dealing with the matter at all? Will not South Australia be able to withdraw the offer she has made to the Commonwealth? If the offer is withdrawn, what is to prevent South Australia from attempting to develop the Northern Territory by other means? We certainly do not desire the defence of Australia to be dependent upon the caprice of the owners of a land grant line. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but it appears to me that the conditions offered are fairly generous. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> in his opening speech, referred to the millions of acres of land that the Commonwealth will acquire at 2 1/2 d.  per acre as the result of this agreement. If that statement be anything like correct, we shall be making no bad bargain. The reason impelling me in the vote that I shall give is this : We have now before us an agreement which, if not accepted in its entirety, may be withdrawn.. If we can satisfy ourselves that the agreement is a fairly good one for Australia, the reasonable course is to accept it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> who spoke of the national aspect, protested too much. I am not sure that his national views were not rather tinged by consideration for the interests of his State. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has properly alluded to the debt which the Commonwealth owes to South Australia for having done her best to develop the Northern Territory, and to keep it- free from coloured races. It might have been developed as portions of Queensland have been - by means of imported cheap labour. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator cannot get away from the fact that' a great deal of the country under sugar cane and bananas in Queensland was developed by cheap alien labour. To-day the greater portion of the bananas consumed in other parts of Australia are grown by Chinese labour, and the banana industry in Northern Queensland is practically in the hands of Chinese. Australia owes a debt to South Australia for not having descended to that way of peopling the Northern Territory. Before Queensland senators threw at South Australia the gibe that she has neglected her opportunities, and has not developed the Territory as she might have done, they might, I think, have considered that aspect of the question. The first time I ever heard the musical voice of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> was at Cairns on the night before the vote was to be taken on the Constitution Bill, and the chief reason which he advanced to a large audience why Queensland should vote for Federation was that it was dangerous to the interests of Australia that the development of the tropical or sub-tropical portions should depend upon foreign labour. That is exactly the view which South Australia took, and so it refused to develop the Northern Territory by cheap alien labour. For the reasons which I have given, I intend to vote for the Bill as it stands </para>

                        <para>. - I shall not only vote for the Bill in its entirety, but, if there is any doubt as to the phraseology not being clear enough to indicate that the railway must go through the Territory, I shall support an amendment to make it clear. I think that even the opponents of the measure will be favorable to the wording being made so clear that there can be no mistake as to what is to be done in that regard. If the Bill is passed I shall always be proud of having been a member of the Parliament which sanctioned so great a national project. We are told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> and others that the true national idea is to leave the opening up of the Territory by railways to the good faith of this Parliament, after having obtained expert advice and evidence. I think that within the boundaries of the Territory there is any amount of room for expert advice and evidence. We are told that its width is 560 miles, which leaves a margin of 280 miles on either side of the central point. It is clear to me that if, within such a wide margin, a railway could not be advantageously constructed, the Territory would be worthless. All this talk about South Australia dictating the terms to the Commonwealth is quite besides the issue. It takes two parties to make a bargain. The agreement which is embodied in the Bill must necessarily be accepted or rejected. It cannot be altered by one party without the other being consulted. Its rejection would necessarily mean the opening up of fresh negotiations or the abandonment of the project. If we should decide to abandon the project, then the talk- as to the danger of leaving the Territory open to possible invasion by aliens, which has been uttered all over the Commonwealth, will have been so much wind. If, on the other hand, fresh negotiations with South Australia are opened up that will mean delay. Perhaps South Australia may be glad of an opportunity to make fresh terms, and to give greater concessions. </para>

                            <para>- Suppose that South Australia would be glad to get rid of the incubus of the debt at any price, even then the rejection of this agreement would necessarily involve delay. Tt makes my national spirit thrill when we are offered an opportunity to bisect Australia by a railway as nearly as practicable through its centre. One has only to glance at the map suspended in the Chamber to see the shortest possible route from ocean to ocean. All the talk about population within an easy distance of the eastern seaboard being so great compared with that in other parts of Australia, that in the event of hostilities it would be much easier to get troops round to the point of danger if the transcontinental railway were constructed in a more easterly direction so as to touch the great railway arteries going from the Queensland coast westerly - evidences, I think, a very shortsighted way of looking at the proposal. First, it means, notwithstanding what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> said, a very considerable deviation lengthening the line by hundreds of miles, and second, it means that the Commonwealth would be constructing through a portion of New South Wales, and through a very large portion of Queensland, at its own expense, a railway primarily for the opening up and development of the latter State. </para>

                            <para>- Then let Queensland build the railway on her own account, quite distinct from this proposal. If she desires to take several railway systems further west, and ultimately to connect with a transcontinental railway, then, if that railway is constructed by the shortest route through the Territory, it will mean that eventually Queensland will have to extend the lines running from the coast westward right out to her western border, and so open up the whole length and breadth of her territory. </para>

                            <para>- The northern portion of the country may be opened up by a railway from Cloncurry, but we have to consider the connexion of Port Darwin with the extreme southern, part of the continent. I ask any one looking at the map on the opposite wall whether the red line from Oodnadatta to Port Darwin is not the shortest route. " That being so, lines from the east will, we hope, ultimately meet the transcontinental railway from various points. I think that, unless overwhelming advantages can be pointed out, it would be a big mistake to make that line very much longer in order to take it in a more easterly direction. I know that that idea is popular in a portion of New South Wales, but it has no weight with me. All through the late election campaign I advocated the construction of a transcontinental railway by the Commonwealth, and of course precedent to that the taking over of the Northern Territory as a really national undertaking of paramount and immediate importance. 1 said that even if the bargain with South Australia were not so good as it was, it would be better for the Commonwealth to close with the offer - to take over the Territory at almost any price rather than to incur delay. I think that if we were to act session after session on the lines sketched by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> we should, like Nero who fiddled while Rome was burning, be wasting precious time. Already we have waited too long before deciding to undertake this national work. If there is any reality in the talk about defence, then clearly every honorable senator must realize that it is not enough to have troops. </para>

                            <para>- I would remind the honorable senator that no person can be both buyer and seller, and that there must be two parties to every agreement. The rejection of the agreement embodied in this Bill would, I repeat, entail delay, because fresh negotiations would have to be opened up. Those who say that they are favorable to the main principle of the Bill, and will vote for its second reading, but object to the terms laid down in the agreement, are not giving it honest support. They are merely supporting it by words, and opposing it in reality. It reminds me of the objection which was offered in New South Wales for years to the introduction of a system of local government. The Bill was always killed ici the interests of the parish-pump politicians. So it is with honorable senators who are opposing this Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that a railway from Bourke or some place in that vicinity will ultimately join on to the Queensland system at Cunnamulla, but let that line, be considered on its merits. It should be no part of a transcontinental railway. It is a travesty to talk about bisecting Australia with a grand transcontinental railway, and then to take it within a comparatively easy distance of the eastern coast. I suppose that even a large proportion of what is now looked upon as a wilderness in Western Australia will in course of time be opened up. Why should there not be opportunities in the future? Why should we not have a sufficiently large outlook to foresee the time when not one line will go from Perth to connect with the other systems, but perhaps several lines will go from different parts of that vast western State across to the transcontinental railway running north and south. In the same way I foresee the day when a network of railways, unless they are superseded by some better invention, may, continue the lines which now run -from Rockhampton, Townsville, and other centres of Queensland right across to the proposed transcontinental railway, linking up the whole continent north and south, as well as east and west. Having no large waterways, it is only by a vast network of railways that we can hope to make the whole of this continent fit for settlement and habitation. The proposed railway will be as it were a backbone line bisecting the continent as nearly equidistant from east to west as it is possible to be. I admit at once that the route indicated with red ink on the map from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek may not be the best to follow, but surely it will be possible to pick the best available route within an area 560 miles wide. There is margin enough there" to afford ample opportunity for the Commonwealth to exercise .1 wise judgment as to the route, and to comply with the spirit of the conditions laid down in the agreement. Those who talk about the large amount of money which will be required to develop the Territory, and to pay the interest on the accumulated deficit, take the gloomy, despondent view that there will be no assets in return. </para>

                            <para>- It is not quite fair to state it in that way. Assuming that it has bee'n a losing proposition up to date, admittedly that has been because the small community comprising South Australia proper has not been able to spare sufficient money to properly open up the Territory and develop it. Every one who is acquainted with the Territory says that it contains vast areas near the coast which can be devoted to pastoral and mineral pursuits, and the growth of tropical products. If it is capable of development in that way, may we not hope that this will eventually become a paying proposition? The money we put into the investment will not be sunk for all time. Even if it does not pay from a purely commercial standpoint, it must pay from another point of view, if the defence of Australia is not to be a mere pretence and sham. The only possible way in which we can protect that danger point in the Commonwealth is by connecting it with other portions of the Commonwealth by rail. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose that every Government are more or less amenable to public pressure. I hold the opinion that, from ,a national point of view, we have no time to lose in the construction of the transcontinental railway. A reference has been made to the varying gauges of Australian railways, and I should like to say that some attempt should be made to decide upon a standard gauge for the railway systems of this country. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid that we shall not until the Commonwealth has control of the whole of the railways. I advocated that when Federation was first proposed. I thought that Federation without the federalization of the railways would be very much like <inline font-style="italic">Hamlet</inline> with the Prince of Denmark left out. I think the Government should convene an Inter-State Conference for the discussion of the question of a uniform gauge, and. when such a gauge is adopted, the proposed transcontinental railway should be constructed on that gauge. I do not think that the  3-ft. 6-in.  gauge prevailing in South Australia should be the gauge adopted for a great transcontinental railroad. If the proposed railway were constructed on a standard gauge, I believe that the existing railways would rapidly be brought into line with it. I understand that the New South Wales gauge is the standard gauge of the world at the present time, and that might be adopted. I do not say this because I represent that State in the Senate. There is a possibility that the mono-rail may be found capable of fulfilling all requirements, and the transcontinental line might be constructed on that system. I think that this Bill should be amended to make it perfectly clear that the line shall be constructed through the Northern Territory. We should leave no room for litigation involving the Commonwealth and the States in expense and delay, and giving rise to friction and bad feeling. I believe that if we delay the settlement of this matter it will not be a question of a mere huckstering bargain with South Australia, but we may be faced with such danger from the coloured races lying to the north of Australia that we may curse the day we put any obstacles in the way of carrying out this project speedily. I regard the project as an essential part of our defence scheme. I believe that the provisions of our Defence Act will be ineffective unless this is undertaken as one of the most pressing obligations of the Commonwealth. I am prepared to go further than many honorable senators on my own side, and say that I have no doubt that, however much this railway will cost, it will be possible to build it out of revenue. </para>

                    <para>And I am prepared to advocate the construction of this line out of revenue if I should be alone in doing so. I remind honorable senators that it would absolutely dislocate the labour market of Australia to spend more than£500,000 on the construction of the line in one year. In my opinion, there would be nothing to prevent the Commonwealth expending that amount out of revenue in each year. Assuming that the line will cost£5,000,000 to build, it is clear that it could not be constructed in one year ; and I see no reason why it should not be constructed in sections out of revenue. So far from its being beyond the bounds of possibility, I think that it is well within practical politics for the Commonwealth to construct that railway, administer the Territory, and pay the interest on the debt already incurred, without borrowing money for the purpose. I remind honorable senators, further, that for defence purposes the construction of the line could be justified, even though it passed through a sandy desert the whole of the way, and if we are not going to borrow for defence purposes, I do not see why we should borrow for the construction of strategic railways. </para>

                        <para>. - I am in favour of taking over the Northern Territory, with all its liabilities. I would invite honorable senators who accuse those who think there should be some modification of the agreement to ask themselves whether our position is not the national one, and theirs the provincial one; whether we are not the " big Australians " and they the " little Australians " ; whether we are not the promoters of national ideas, and they the upholders of localism, and, to put it in plain native English, of parish pump ideas. Every member of the Senate  is in favour of taking over the Territory. I do not know what its resources are, and I do not care. It is enough for me that I believe that portion of the Australian Continent ought to be under the control of the people of Australia. I am willing that the Commonwealth should take it over with all its liabilities, present and contingent, but the crux of the matter, from my point of view, is that if the people of Australia are to assume responsibility for a present debt of ^6,000,000, and a future debt of, probably, another ^6,000,000, they should have the right to lay down the policy for the future development of the Territory. That would be an honest and honorable method of conducting the business. But one portion of the future development of the Northern Territory is laid down for us in the proposed agreement. Whether South Australia has a right to seek to impose conditions or not, I am not going to offer an opinion ; but I say that men sent here to look after the welfare of the Commonwealth are not acting in the interests of the people of Australia if they are prepared, on behalf of the people, to assume a present liability of ^6,000,000, and a future liability of another ^6,000,000, and hand over the direction and control of the Territory to the people of one State. The people of Australia, as a whole, will have to find the money for the development of the Territory, and they are, therefore, entitled to lay down the policy. That is all I am contending for. Speakers on the other side have talked all round the Bill. They have put up Aunt Sallies, and knocked them down again. They have dealt with everything but the one point of difference between those who are in favour of the Bill and those who are opposed to it. The one question at issue is whether the future development of the Territory is to be under the control of the people who will have to find the money, or to be carried out on lines laid down for them at this stage by South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- 1 repeat that a section of the policy of future development is laid down in the agreement. If South Australia wishes to get rid of the Northern Territory, and if she wishes to get rid of her Oodnadatta railway - and I do not wonder that she should, for a more madcap scheme than the construction of that line was never undertaken in Australia - that should be frankly stated. The railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta runs for its whole length through what is neither more nor less than drifting sand. There had been a strong wind on the day previous to my arrival at Oodnadatta, and on going down to a camp of Afghan carriers, who had put their goods on the ground the previous night in readiness to be loaded on to the camels' backs next day, we found that the goods were buried under heaps of sand which had drifted over them in one night. * </para>

                            <para>- There are other honorable senators here who can corroborate my statement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> cannot deny that there is no agriculture, and that the pastoral industry is carried on in but a very small way in the country through which this railway runs. It is quite unfitted for settlement under present Australian conditions. The line cost over ^2,000,000 to build, and the South Australian Government run a train over it once a fortnight, at an annual loss of ^80,000. They admit that, but I am personally of opinion that the loss is very much greater. The South Australian Government claim that there is a balance of ^12,000 on the working of the line after paying working expenses. There are twenty-six trains run over it each way per annum, which would mean a revenue of ^500 a trip. I do not believe for a moment that traffic to the value of .£500 was ever carried over that line in one trip. There is no traffic there. The country through which it goes is a desert, and 1 am sure that South Australia would be exceedingly glad to get rid of the line. </para>

                            <para>- It is not usual for people to run a railway into a desert to begin with. If there is desert country  in any State, the people do not go there until they are compelled to do so. They do not attempt to develop the desert part of their country while there are hundreds of thousands of square miles of good country awaiting development. That would be a fool's policy. It may be the policy adopted by South Australia, but I hope it will never be the policy of the Commonwealth. I do not think the people of Australia are such fools as to adopt any such policy. I believe that they are a wise people, very much wiser than many of their representatives, and they will endeavour to develop the best portions of Australia to begin with. Only when they are compelled by stress of circumstances should they retire to the desert fastnesses of Australia. No one is more anxious than I am to develop this country. I have proved that throughout my public life. I have consistently endeavoured to remove obstructions from the path of development. Australia is capable of maintaining a very much larger population than she has at present. I believe that that population can be grown here as a consequence of proper legislation and administration. We have tens of thousands of square miles of fertile country, which we ought to develop before we tackle the desert. So much for that point. My principal contention is this : The Commonwealth will have to bear the expense of developing this Territory. The people of Australia will have.. to pay the piper. Therefore, they ought to have the privilege of calling the tune. But if some honorable senators have their way, such will not be the case. A section of the people will lay down the policy for which the people of Australia, as a whole, will have to find the money. Is that Democratic Government ? Is that the kind of proposal one would expect from a party or a Government whose cardinal principle is equal opportunities for all ? Where does the equal opportunity come in here? It reminds me of a story about two boys. Each had a penny. One gave his coin to the other, who bought a two-penny cigar, lit it, and smoked it. When it was nearly consumed, the other boy became alarmed, wondering when he was going to get a pull. He asked where he came in. " Oh," said his mate, " You looks on and spits." Thai is how the Commonwealth is to be treated by this Government. It can look on and spit, while South Australia lays down a policy for which the whole Commonwealth finds the money. If that be national sentiment translated into action, it seems to me to be something too funny to be heard of outside a lunatic asylum. Are we going to allow one State to dictate as to how our Consolidated Revenue shall be applied? We would never permit such a thing. No section of the community would have the impudence, the audacity, or the impertinence, to ask to be privileged in such a way. But South Australia, forsooth, while she is very anxious to get rid of this white elephant of hers, wishes to dictate, as one honorable senator said to-day, as to how the elephant shall be fed. We hear a great deal about the dangers which confront us in the north. If South Australia were the truly patriotic State that her representatives would make us believe her to be, she would come to the Commonwealth and say, " Here you are; we have sustained the burden of this Territory for a number of years; we have incurred a certain amount of debt upon it; we are not able to go any further; take it from us, and God bless you. Pay us what it has cost us, and develop the country as the people of Australia think proper." </para>

                            <para>- Who is going to take it? This bugbear of defence is continually brought up in connexion with the question. The whole of Australia is in danger until our population is increased. I believe that every honorable senator is wide-awake to that fact, and is anxious that the population of this continent should be largely increased at as early a date as possible. But the whole of the danger does not lie in the Northern Territory. Does any man in his senses dream that a Power like Japan or China, or any other great Power that wanted to invade Australia, would land an army in the Northern Territory? Nothing of the kind. They would come down here, to the heart of Australia, where they could capture fertile areas. They would come where it would be possible for their people to live in comfort, and even in luxury. They would not plant themselves in a God-forsaken land like that. If we want to provide for the defence of Australia, we must populate Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, and South Australia; although I must say that there does not seem to be much chance in the latter State. The place is so absolutely barren. Only one portion of it is fit for habitation. The proof of that statement is that there is no country under the sun whose population is so largely concentrated in one city as South Australia. Why does everybody in the State run to Adelaide? Because they cannot live elsewhere, and if it were not for Broken Hill they could not even live there in Adelaide. Heaven knows what will happen to them when the Broken Hill mines cease to be productive ! </para>

                            <para>- The proportion is too great everywhere. But South Australia is, I think, far the worst of all the States in that respect. The impression conveyed to my mind from reading the statistics is that the evil to which I have referred is more accentuated in South Australia than anywhere else. The reason for . that, as far as I have been able to discover, is that there is in South Australia less land fitted for close settlement than in any other State of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Much of the good land is locked up. No doubt there is a great deal of fair land in South Australia, but the climatic conditions are not very favorable. The rainfall is scanty. Within about 200 miles of Adelaide the country is something like land in Queensland which is  500 or 600 miles from the coast. That was the impression conveyed to my mind when J passed through it. </para>

                            <para>- This is a case of a property, the owner of which is very anxious to get rid of it. South Australia has had the Territory for a long period of years. I have no doubt that her intentions were, and are, admirable. She would have  developed the Territory if she could have done so. But, unfortunately, circumstances were against her, and the task was beyond her capacity. Therefore she is willing to hand the Territory over to the Commonwealth 3 but on one condition only, and that is that it shall be developed on lines which she has laid down. Those lines are intended to bring all the traffic of the Territory down to Adelaide. </para>

                            <para>- I do not care where the trade comes from, or where it goes to; what I insist upon is that if the Commonwealth assumes this responsibility, and pays this money, it ought to lay down, on behalf of the people of Australia, who will have to find the cash, what the line of development shall be. _ I do not know what the resources of the Northern Territory me and I do not care. My point Ls that, in the interests of Australia, .some attempt should be made to develop the Territory ; and that if the people of Australia take it upon their shoulders to carry it on, they should frame the policy. That proposition is denied by the supporters of this Bill.  They say, " You can take the debt and the responsibility, but we will dictate the policy." That is a beautifully national sentiment !

                            <para>- The great majority of people who are there at present are Chinamen. If the country had been anything like what some people say it is, there would have been thousands there instead of a comparatively small number. With regard to defence, my own opinion is that the danger in regard to the Northern Territory is not so great as some people say. Any great foreign Power invading Australia would aim its blow at the heart of the country. Moreover, we may rely upon it that any Power which came down to these seas with a hostile intent would be strong enough to attack us in our chief citadels, and be done with us. Taking the matter from the point of view of those who favour this proposal, it means the building of a railway right up from Port Augusta to Port Darwin. Suppose that an enemy landed at Port Darwin some morning at an early hour. What would happen when that fact was wired all over Australia? Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria would have to rush their troops round to Port Augusta to be conveyed to Port Darwin. </para>

Unless a very much larger amount of revenue was raised by the Com &lt; monwealth, or unless, on the other hand, our expenditure in other directions was very much less, it would take us about half-a-century to build the line out of revenue. I am not saying that I object to the policy. I am quite willing to leave it to the people of the Commonwealth to lay down .the policy after sufficient evidence has been collected. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but if that policy were adopted, and the railway built right through the heart of Australia, no matter what the character of the country may be, Queensland and New South Wales would have to extend their lines right out to the border of the Northern Territory, and the Commonwealth Government would have to build spur lines from the main trunk line to join with them. The whole thing would have to be linked up, and that would take a very long time. I am not attempting to suggest a policy. I am quite willing to leave that in the hands of the Commonwealth. I am quite willing to take over the Territory with every obligation which it now carries - a debt of ;£6, 000,000. </para>

                            <para>- I might just as well turn round, and say that the honorable senator is endeavouring to prevent it. The only difference between us is that whereas he asks the Commonwealth to take over the Territory, and to be responsible for the money, while reserving to his own State the right to dictate the policy, I am quite prepared to vote for taking over the Territory, with its debt, present and prospective, but I claim that the people of Australia, who will have to find the money to do that, ought to lay down the policy. He wants South Australia to dictate to the Commonwealth, but I want the latter to be master in its own house. </para>

                                said he was sure that if the voice of the people could be taken by means of a referendum, a large majority would be in favour of taking over the Northern Territory. I quite agree with him there. But he said also that they would be willing to take it over on the conditions laid down in the agreement. I beg leave to differ with him there. I have never yet discovered that the people of the Commonwealth were willing to allow a section of the Commonwealth to dictate a policy to them, while they collectively had to find the money to carry it out. If a man has to find money he wishes to have some voice in the expenditure of it. What was the cry of the early reformer in Great Britain? It was, ' No taxation without representation." Taxation without representation is exactly what certain honorable senators are trying to thrust down the throats of the people of the Commonwealth. They want the people of the Commonwealth to develop the Territory, but refuse to them any voice in laying down the developmental policy. That is in direct violation of the national idea, and the men who preach that doctrine, and call themselves Nationalists are, to put it mildly, labouring under a delusion. They are nothing of the kind.

                            <para>- I said that I was prepared to vote for taking it over, but on exactly the same conditions as I am stating now. and the electors returned me. What they said to me in effect was, " Take  over the Territory, but insist upon the Commonwealth laying down the policy." I am carrying out that mandate this afternoon. And even if they had not said that to me, if they had told me to work the handle of the parish pump, I do not think that I should be very willing to do it, because it is an operation which no man who professes to be an Australian ought to attempt to perform. We should not have any parochialism here. There should not be any State ideas in the Commonwealth Parliament. We are all one people, with one destiny I hope, and a community which is afraid to trust itself in the hands of the people of Australia as a whole is one which ought not to be trusted. South Australia takes up this position. " You can take our debt, we will give it to you, and welcome, but you have to manage this business in the way we tell you." That is not a policy which those who represent the people of Australia ought to accept. It is not a policy which South Australia should ask them to indorse. </para>

                            <para>- If South Australia would say, " We will give you the Territory to develop in the way which the people of the Commonwealth think best," then I would say that it had done something patriotic, that it was possessed of national spirit, that it was, so to speak, a fit citizen. But when it comes forward in this huckstering fashion, and says, " Take our debts, take over the Territory, but develop it in the way we desire. If you do not, then you cannot have it," then it is playing a dog-in-the-manger game. It is not a Nationalist State. It is a pettifogging, huckstering, bargain-making State. I do not particularly blame its representatives here, because I know what politicians are. They have to accommodate themselves to their environment. If they do not they will lose their seats. The last thing which any politician desires is to lose his seat; indeed, in many cases, he would rather lose his life. So the honorable senators from South Australia, who take up this attitude, are to be excused, but those who come from other portions of the continent are not to be excused. They, at least, ought to stand up for the national idea. They, at least, ought to see that justice is done to the people of the Commonwealth. They, at least, ought to see that Australia is kept to the front all the time, and not any particular portion of it. The only difference between the supporters of the Bill as it stands, and myself, is that they are advocating not nationalism, but localism - sectionalism - which, the Parliament ought not to tolerate for an instant. I shall vote for the second reading, but if the Bill can be altered in Committee in the way which I have indicated, I shall be glad. I shall do my very best to bring about such alterations as will bring it into line with my ideas on the subject. </para>

                        <para>. - Since this Bill was defeated last session, a general election has been held. In Queensland, the candidates were opposed to the Northern Territory being taken over on the terms laid down by South Australia, but they were not opposed to the Commonwealth taking it over with the right to develop it in whatever way it might think fit. They were quite prepared that the Commonwealth should pay the money which South Australia had expended on the Territory, and deal liberally with its people. I have no fault to find with them for trying to make the best possible bargain, and, if they can, to compel the Commonwealth, by means of the votes of their representatives here, to take over the Territory on their terms. What I do find fault with is the statement that South Australia does not want to part with the Territory. After the previous Bill was defeated here, the State had ample time in which to withdraw from this business, but it did not do so. The statement that the people of South Australia do not want to part with the Territory on any terms, even on their own terms, is rather too thin, or, if you like, too thick for the people of Australia to swallow. We have seen vast sums voted to different States for different reasons, but now we are asked to accept a proposal which I do not believe for a moment the people of Australia would ratify if they had a chance to express their opinion. I, for one, should be quite prepared to take a referendum of the people on the question of taking over the Northern Territory on the terms laid down in the agreement. </para>

                            <para>- What they say now is, " This is a national project ;. we- are in power, and will carry it in spite of any obstruction which you "may offer." Well and good. I suppose that eventually I shall have to submit, but I do not intend to submit, so long as I can raise a voice in protest. I am not against the second reading of the Bill. Far from it. I am quite prepared to allow the measure to go through if the route of the railway is left  an open question. But I am not prepared to vote for a proposal which I believe in my heart the people of Australia would condemn if they had a chance to speak. At the last election, this question was not made a burning one. In Queensland, the candidates declared that they were willing that the Commonwealth should take over the Territory from South Australia, and pay a fair and reasonable amount, but they were not willing to be bound by the agreement. Of course, we hear a lot about South Australia. I do not wish to take away any credit which is due to her for the effort which she made to develop the Territory, a task which she found to be beyond her financial resources. I, with others, went to inspect the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. 1 had heard a great deal which was not favorable to the line, and what I saw convinced me that the position was really worse than had been alleged. At the same time, I give every credit to the people of South Australia and its Government for their pluck in attempting to build the line through to Port Darwin. I know that they have expended a large sum of money, and that the Territory has been a white elephant to them for years. Forty years ago it was offered to Queensland, but she had sufficient country of her own to develop, which I am happy to say she is doing very rapidly. Thinking that there was money to be made, South Australia took over the Northern Territory, but found that it had made a mistake. We know very well that if the agreement is adopted,' as no doubt it will be, the people of Queensland, as well as the people of Tasmania, who, through a representative, asked the Senate this morning to redress their grievances, will be compelled to pay their portion of the millions which the Commonwealth will be called upon to expend. Tasmania is unable to do so, and remain financially sound. Queensland, I am happy to say, is able to do so, and remain financially sound. At the present time, the latter State has more railways than has any one of the other States, </para>

                            <para>- The land adjacent to the Roper River is the best portion of the Territory. It can be developed by that railway at the cost of the people of Queensland, without asking them to pay a share of the cost of making a railway' through one of the most infertile portions of the Commonwealth. South Australia, I repeat, wants the Commonwealth to take over the Northern Territory on conditions which are not fair to the other States' That is the reason why we had no voice in the making of the agreement. </para>

I opposed this measure when it was introduced by a Government I supported. I do not come here tied . hand and foot to vote for anything a Prime Minister proposes. The Queensland railways are being extended out to the west, almost up to the border of the State, and branch lines are being constructed from the main trunk lines. But this railway construction is being carried out at the expense of the taxpayers of the State. We have a right, therefore, to ask that South Australia shall develop her own territory. If we take the Territory over, we should be at liberty to develop it as we think fit. The people of Queensland never thought of asking the Commonwealth to extend their line from Townsville to Cloncurry^ </para>

I travelled over the line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, in company with the South Australian Minister of Railways, the Railway Traffic Manager, and other officials, and  12  or  15  miles out from Port Augusta we were shown a number of stone houses that had been erected by the Government for people settled along the line. We could just see the top df the chimney of one of them, as the rest of the house was buried under drifting sand. </para>

The railway has been in existence for a good many years, and a number of experiments have been made to deal with the drifting sand without success. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> in his wisdom, may think that he knows more of the matter than do the South Australian railway officials, but I prefer to take the opinion of the officials, some of whom were bom in the country, and have lived there all their lives. On the occasion of our visit, wa were told that another storm might remove a portion of the sand we saw covering the houses, and that if we came back in a months' time there might not be even the top of a chimney to be seen. When we got to Quorn, I was driven out to see a little of the country, and I admit that under the foothills there was an oasis, a patch in the desert with good crops, but  6  or  7  miles away the crops were an absolute failure, and we were told by the residents that this was due to the fact that there had been no rain except under the foothills. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, I am. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> risks money on a business and does not make interest on it, he loses money. South Australia had to borrow money with which to construct that line, and must pay interest on that money. There is no doubt that the line is run at a dead loss. From Quorn we went on to Oodnadatta, and what did we see there? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has described one camp that we saw. It has been stated that the people did not tell us the truth, but I do not know why they should not do so. We were taken to see the best land, and it was very bad. I walked a few miles out from Oodnadatta, and no sign of vegetation could be seen. We asked the local people why the Commonwealth should be invited to take over a country which is nothing but a desert, and that is swept with sand carried by a wind which has blown. up from the Gulf from time immemorial ? We saw small metal raked up in heaps along the line, and we were told that Afghans were employed in collecting it. All that it is necessary for them to do is to rake it together in heaps. A railway employé told us that one heap was larger than he expected it to be, and on digging into it he found a dead camel in the middle of it. That is a fact, vouched for by railway men working on the line, and it shows that the Afghans are not as simple as they look. After seeing all this desert, the only consolation the local people could give us was that  200  miles ahead, on the Macdonnell Ranges, there was better country. That reminds one that men wandering on the plains in search of water are buoyed up with the hope that they will find it ahead. They see a mirage on the plains, and go on until they perish. South AustraLia wants us to go ahead with this railway until some of the smaller States perish for lack of the funds which will be required to construct it. I should like to say that I believe in the White Australia policy, and fought for it long before many men in this Parliament thought of it. I was then in North Queensland, where we opposed, as strongly as we could, the introduction of black labour. I hope, sir, you will allow me a little latitude in dealing with this matter, because we have been told from the other side that Queensland was developed by black labour. </para>

                            <para>- Was not the opening up of the mines a means of developing the country? I repeat that North Queensland was developed by white men. It was white men who opened up the Palmer, which was then as far removed from civilization as are any portions of the Northern Territory to-day. I repudiate with scorn the statement that North Queensland was developed by black labour. It is true that black labour was introduced to carry on one branch of the sugar industry. </para>

                            <para>- No, I wish only to be allowed to make a passing reference to the subject. The statement which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> made can have reference only to the action taken in connexion with one branch of the sugar industry. It is the white people of North Queensland who developed the country and assisted to bring about Federation, and they have always protested against black labour, as I hope they always will. I should like to enlarge upon the subject, and some other time I hope to be able to deal with it more fully.. We have been told that the Northern Territory has been kept white, but the- fact remains that after forty years of control by South Australia there are two coloured men for every white man in the north, according to the latest statistics, and the numbers of both coloured and white are diminishing. In spite of this fact, we are given glorious accounts of the Territory, and are told that it will keep thousands of people. I am satisfied that in time it will, but it will not be until the better and more accessible lands of the Commonwealth are all occupied. The Northern Territory may then be settled and developed by people born and reared in North Queensland and Western Australia under somewhat similar climatic conditions. That is what happened in connexion with settlement in America. It was not until hundreds of years after the good lands of America were settled that what were called "the bad lands" in the United States were taken up.

                            <para>- No, a very big corner, which includes the Roper River, the lands along which are the best areas in the Territory. I can remember a time when Queensland had no railways, and even then people were settled 600 miles west from the coast grazing sheep there, as they are doing to-day. The wool was brought down to the port in bullock drays, and the settlement of the country was carried on profitably. How much of the Northern Territory 600 miles from the coast is settled? The country might be opened up if the railways from Rockhampton and Townsville were extended to the Macdonnell Range country, and further north from Cloncurry. </para>

                            <para>- Queensland will do her duty, and does not come here to ask consideration from the honorable senator. We have been told that the railway from Port Darwin to Pine Creek has been constructed by South Australia, but how was that railway made? White men attempted its construction, and had to leave it to be finished by Chinamen. In the construction of that railway, Chinese were harnessed to carts, with which they dragged the stuff out of the cuttings. That is the. way in which the Northern Territory was kept white by South Australia, and, as I said before, there are now two coloured men for every white man in the country. </para>

We are told that this transcontinental railway will be a line of defence, and I may say, in reply to that argument, that if an enemy landed at Port Darwin, and there was no railway to the south, they would have as much chance of getting south as they would have of flying. </para>

                            <para>- An enemy could find plenty of good country on which to establish a base without going into a desert. They could establish a base at Normanton, where they could find plenty of cattle and sheep, and an abundance of water. What would they be able to get at Port Darwin? If they landed there they would have to take with them every ounce of food they required, and when they had established their base they would be in very much the same predicament as were the soldiers of Napoleon after they reached Moscow. Why should an enemy, intending to invade Australia, pack himself away in a corner of the Continent when, by making his attempt elsewhere, he would find everything he wanted convenient to his hand ? Honorable senators who make such statements must be hard pressed for arguments, and must have a very low opinion of the capacity of the generals who would plan a campaign against Australia. Only a fool would think of landing an army at Port Darwin, and marching it across the desert. If we leave that desert untraversed by railway, Australia will be much safer from attack in that direction than she will be if we build a line through it. If, however, we really want a. railway for military purposes in the north, our best plan would be to build a line from Pine Creek to the Queensland border. I have no doubt that the Queensland Government would then link up the line with the general railway system of Australia. As regards the quality of the Territory itself, it is true that the Barclay table lands contain some very good grazing country. I know, as a matter of fact, that hundreds of Queenslanders, Victorians, and New South Welshmen, have been all over the Northern Territory looking for country. If they could find good land to suit their purpose they would be quite willing to take it up. </para>

                <para class="block">Here is land for which the South Australian Government are getting no more than 1s. 3d. per square mile per annum, and yet we are told what valuable land it is. I admit that there is a considerable quantity of pastoral land, but certainly not sufficient to warrant the expenditure of £10,000,000 on the building of a railway to bring down the wool grown in the Territory. I was reading some time ago a book by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lindsay,</inline> who represented that the land of the Territory wanted nothing but capital to make it valuable. Of course his boos was a kind of prospectus written for a certain purpose. We all know what mining prospectuses are. Such things are produced to gull the public. This gentleman told his readers that sheep can be fed in thousands in the Territory. Even if we admit so much, what guarantee is there that the Commonwealth would receive an adequate recompense for the money spent upon a railway? Of course, while the price of wool remains high a fair case could be made out, but in ordinary seasons there would be not enough traffic on the line to bring it within reach of paying. The whole proposal is simply absurd. Personally, I am quite willing that the Commonwealth should take over the Territory if it is allowed to develop it on its own lines. But we ought not to permit our hands to be tied by South Australia. We should be free to do whatever we think best in the interests of the Commonwealth. I would pay South Australia for what she has spent on the Territory, and would treat her in no niggardly fashion in that respect. I shall not oppose the second reading of the Bill, because I am in favour of taking over the Territory, but I shall certainly endeavour to get the agreement modified in Committee. Those who some time ago were complaining about the leg-roping of the Commonwealth under the Financial Agreement, certainly ought not to vote for the proposed agreement. I shall do my utmost to support the amendment foreshadowed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> and will fight to the last ditch in opposition to the condition sought to be imposed by South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator said that I was in the habit of opposing, every measure brought down by the Government, altogether ignoring the fact that last week I sat up all night in order to assist them to get through the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and that I sat up last night to assist them to pass this Bill. Simply because I will not swallow every detail, I am to be accused by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> - and I pin him down to his specific statement on this Bill - of not giving to the Government that support which they have a right to expect. There was one main principle in this Bill, and that was the return of 25s.per <inline font-style="italic">capita</inline> per annum to the States: The question of when it was to be given was a detail. The question of how long it was to continue was also a detail. The one principle was the amount to be paid over. I supported the second reading of the Bill, but I did not agree with all the details, and in Committee I exercised my right to get them amended. I assisted the Government by staying here all last night to get the Bill put through, and I am now prepared to vote for the third reading. In the face of these facts, ] want to know what justification the Honorary Minister had for making such a reckless statement. </para>

                <para>I have seldom to thank the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> politically, for anything it does or says. i beg, however, to thank you for your leader of to-day, in which you draw such graceful and personal attention to myself and my article in the July number of the <inline font-style="italic">Contemporary Review.</inline> i note, however, that you quote extracts which wrested from the text are in every instance a complete perversion of it. Pilate on a memorable occasion did something similar. He then asked, "What is truth?" and finally washed his hands of his own self-confessed iniquity. Wrest the texts, and a Barabbas deliverance follows as of course. </para>
                <para>With so much of your leader as refers to me, personally or politically, i have no concern here, and little anywhere else. But i note that the whole of your leader is a sort of hedge built round myself, and the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Review,</inline> from behind which to lire at those Liberals who followed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> in the formation of the Fusion party and policy. </para>
                <para>I do not belong to a party, nor do I hold scarcely any vital or fiscal opinion which the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> could indorse. Conversely, I might put it, that any vital or fiscal opinion which the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> could indorse as such, would almost necessarily be one which I could seldom support. And because of that, I and others are dubbed Conservatives, Re-actionaries, or Tories. This is reminiscent of the proverb about " Hard names and buttered parsnips." </para>
                <para>You say of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's</inline> action in the formation of the Fusion party and policy, if not directly, by necessary inference as to him and all of us, " It was a sordid junction for the one sole purpose of a grab at office." Now, I am no blind admirer of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> but if' ever a statement was personally unfair and unjust, surely that one is, if directed against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> Every office in the Commonwealth's gift has been open to hint for less than his asking for it. To any of them he might have retired for life, and at any time, with personal -ease and comfort to himself, and probably with the highest efficiency and certainly the highest honour in the discharge of it. Not his worst enemy, .nor his bitterest critic or opponent, but should feel, not only the shame - </para>
