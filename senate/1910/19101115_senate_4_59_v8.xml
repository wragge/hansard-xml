I desire to obtain a suspension of the Standing Orders to enable me to get leave to introduce the measure to-day, and move its first reading, with a view to fixing its second reading for to-morrow, otherwise it will not be possible to have the Bill printed and circulated today.

                        <para>. - I have no objection to the postponement of business to meet the convenience of the Government in this connexion, but I foresee that if the course proposed be followed, we shall land ourselves in a very serious difficulty. The first Order of the Day relates to a call of the Senate. It will be within the recollection of honorable senators that we suspended the standing order which compels twenty-one days' notice of a call of the Senate to be given, in order to permit of that call being made for today. The call having been deliberately made for to-day, I hold that we cannot disregard our decision by postponing it till to-morrow. There may be some honorable senators who will be out of reach tomorrow, and I claim that the call of the Senate, if postponed to-day, will not be valid to-morrow. This is. a very important matter. The Bills in reference to which the call has been made relate to proposed amendments of the Constitution, which are vital, and consequently we ought not to incur the slightest risk of rendering invalid any action that we may take. I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council to take this question into his serious consideration. Whilst the call of the Senate may be postponed till a later hour of the day, I submit that it will not be valid if it be postponed till to-morrow. Perhaps the Vice-President of the Executive Council may urge that, as we have suspended the Standing Orders in regard to it, a postponement of the call will be valid. But I would remind him that we have suspended the Standing Orders only to the extent of dispensing with the twenty-one days' notice which is required under them. I believe that the safer course to adopt will be to postpone the call until a later hour to-day. I strongly deprecate postponing it till tomorrow. </para>

I quite understand the point which has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> that the Standing Orders were suspended to enable the call to be made for to-day. But in view of the fact that the Leader of the Opposition pointed out that certain honorable senators may not be able to attend to-day, is it not possible to postpone the call until to-morrow? </para>

The Standing Orders allow that to be done. When a piece of business is postponed, it is not necesasry to give fresh notice. We are in a position similar to that of a company. Our meeting having been properly constituted, we can proceed with business to-day or adjourn it till tomorrow, as we think necessary. </para>

                            <para>- It is not at all necessary. Otherwise the standing order would leave us but two alternatives - to decide the business or to discharge it. But the standing order does nothing of the kind. It gives a third alternative, which is the one proposed by the Government, who desire to adopt a course which I, in all good faith, asked them to pursue last week, and which I believe they are quite justified in doing. </para>

                        <para>- - It is just as well that this matter has cropped up. I have no doubt that if the ordinary meaning is attached to the language of the standing orders quoted we have power to postpone a call of the Senate. But at. the same time it seems to me to be rather farcical to make a standing order in connexion with calls of the Senate requiring us to fix a call for a certain day, and then, when that day arrives, for a postponement to be moved under another standing order. I think that the Standing Orders Committee should take this matter into consideration. What is the object of ordering a call of the Senate? It is to obtain a full attendance of honorable senators. The necessity for it arises from the fact that all honorable senators are not in the habit of attending here every- day. When a call is ordered every member of the Senate is informed that he is expected to be in his place on a certain clay at a certain hour. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. Obviously the object of making a call of the Senate is to let every honorable senator know that certain business will be taken at a certain time on a certain day. Accordingly, every honorable senator who thinks the business of sufficient importance will take care to be in his place on that day, no matter how urgent his private business may be. But by postponing the call we are not treating fairly those who have taken the trouble to be here to-day, but who may, to-morrow, have other business to attend to which would .necessitate their absence. Moreover, if we can postpone the call of the Senate for a day, what is to prevent us from postponing it for a week, or indefinitely? </para>

If that procedure be adhered to, no honorable senator will be able to complain of being put to inconvenience by reason of not having sufficient notice of a call. A certain number of honorable senators did not think the matter of sufficient importance to compel their attendance to-day. </para>

The object of a call of the Senate is to enable all honorable senators to be here on a certain day if they consider the business to be discussed of sufficient importance, and I think that the convenience of those who do attend in response to a call of the Senate should be considered before that of those who do not attend. Before resuming my seat I repeat that I believe that, under the Standing Orders, we have the power to postpone a call in the way now proposed, though I think it is a pity that the Standing Orders should so provide. </para>

When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> was giving notice of the call I asked that it should be made for Wednesday in order to suit the convenience of honorable senators representing Tasmania, but the Government did not then feel disposed to agree to the request. I have to thank the Government Whip 'for the courtesy extended to me of informing me at the earliest possible moment on Friday afternoon that the call would be taken on Wednesday instead of to-day, but it was then too late to enable me to alter my arrangements, and I had to remain here. If we had known in time that the call would be taken on Wednesday instead of on Tuesday, other honorable senators, as well as myself, would have ordered their arrangements differently. </para>

                        <para>. - This is a matter about which it seems to me there is some little difficulty. Taking a superficial view one might easily come to either conclusion, but I contend that a call of the Senate cannot be treated in the same way as an ordinary motion. It is an intimation to every honorable senator that a call will be made on a particular date. The whole matter in dispute is whether a call can be postponed from one day to another, or from one hour to another, of the same day. Looking into the matter closely I have come to the conclusion that the standing order means to refer to a postponement from one hour to another of the same day. Under the Standing Orders a call of the Senate is to be regarded as the first Order of the Day for which it is made, and it might be found more convenient to postpone it to a later hour of the same day. I know that the Government are relying upon standing order 73, which reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">I think that those two Standing Orders have some bearing on the issue, because the former is imperative in its language, and only contemplates the postponement of an Order of the Day when other business intervenes. But they must be read in connexion with standing orders 280 and 281. It seems to me that once a Minister, or even a private senator, gives notice of a motion, and it becomes an Order of the Day, the business is in charge of the Minister or private senator in question to bring on at that time. If that is so, it is governed by standing orders 156 and 157, and must be proceeded with. For instance, if the senator in whose name it stands were not here, it would lapse. In a case of this kind, has the Government more power than a private senator? Having regard to the imperative form of standing orders  156  and  157,  the business has to be dealt with. During the last three or four months, we have been suspending our Standing Orders just as the <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Act was suspended by the most tyrannical king on earth. </para>

                        <para>. - It may seem rather presumptuous on the part of a new senator to attempt to interpret Standing Orders to older and much abler senators, but the fear that these two very important measures might be endangered by a non-compliance with the order for a call must be my excuse for taking part in this discussion. I join most cordially in the protest which has been made by some honorable senators against the postponement of this business to another day. I hold that we are bound to deal with it at some time to-day. Otherwise, in terms of the Standing Orders, the two Orders of the Day must be discharged from the notice-paper, and the call renewed for a subsequent date. If the order for a call of the Senate - which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has pointed out has been made for a definite purpose, and for a certain time - was not a direction to honorable senators to be in their places to deal with the question on the date for which they received notice, what is the value of such an order? If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> argument is sound, that the Senate can control an order for a call, just the same as it can govern any ordinary business, what is the necessity for making an order for a call? </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators are given specific notice to be in their places on a definite date to transact certain business. I submit that standing order  281  is very definite, and that it is competent for the Senate to postpone the consideration of this question to a later hour of the day for which the call was made, but not to a subsequent date. I am not in -a position, perhaps, to fully appreciate the danger of the Government's proposal ; but I have a fear that it may affect the validity or legality of the important business for which the order for a call was made. </para>

                        <para>- - It is wonderful how very little matters occupy great minds so much. I wish to point out something in respect to the circumstances of this case, and to show honorable senators how needless are their fears in respect to the two Constitution Alteration Bills. We are dealing, not with constitutional questions, which require an Act of Parliament and a referendum of the people before an alteration can be made, but with Standing Orders which we have power to suspend, if necessary, in the interests of carrying on the public business. When the question of the third reading of the Constitution Alteration Bills first arose, I thought of asking the Senate to suspend the Standing Orders, and put the Bills through that stage there and then, as we had the power to do, if we had a constitutional majority, that is, nineteen senators, on our side. But, having regard to the advice of some honorable senators, and also of the  President,  it was thought advisable to give notice of a call of the Senate. Twenty-one days' notice was not given, but only a week's notice, thus reducing the notice to a week. There are some honorable senators who may reasonably urge that a week is scarcely long enough, and that their business is of such an involved character that twenty-one days' notice is little enough. But notice of the call was reduced to a week, thereby admitting our right to dispense with notice. Last week some honorable senators told the Government that it would be very inconvenient for them to be here on Tuesday, and that if the call could be postponed until the following day they would be present. That is "exactly why we have submitted this motion. We have no desire to put any honorable senator, no matter whether he is for or against us, to the slightest inconvenience, so long as the third reading of the two measures will not be endangered. The language of the Standing Orders is so plain that I wonder that there is any doubt about their meaning. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, with his stupendous knowledge of the Constitution, and his unlimited knowledge of the Standing Orders, not only confused things in his own mind when he talked about what standing orders  156, 157, 280,  and  281  do, but caused a hazy . feeling in the minds of others. He actually clouded his own imagination. What does " dealing with "  a  notice of motion or an Order of the Day mean? It means dealing with the question forthwith, postponing it, or wiping it off the business-paper. Consequently, that is what the Standing Orders contemplate. Some honorable senators imagine that a call of the Senate must be made for a particular purpose. But it may not be ordered for any such purpose. The object of a call of the Senate is to insure the attendance of honorable senators- </para>

                            <para>- There is no necessity for a call of the Senate being made except for a particular purpose. Whenever we have such a purpose in view it is competent for us to suspend the Standing Orders. Seeing that we can entirely suspend those orders in regard to this question, is it not foolish to urge that if an absolute majority of the Senate be prepared to postpone a call of this Chamber from to-day until to-morrow, or until next week, it has not the power to do so ? The Senate has power to do anything that it may choose in relation to its own business. But in order that there may be no doubt in the mind of any honorable senator that we are conducting business according to our Standing Orders, -we have taken the precaution to consult the highest legal authority connected with the Government. He has advised us that the course which we are pursuing is absolutely the correct one. </para>

There are other honorable senators who occupy similar positions. I trust that the health and happiness of those who are present today will not be interfered with by our action in postponing the call of the Senate for one day to meet the convenience of our brother senators. </para>

                            has raised the point that the Order of the Day relating to the call of the Senate has not been read. That is correct. But I would point out to him that our Standing Orders do not require an Order of the Day, relating to business which it is proposed to postpone, to be read. Standing order 65 sets out the routine to be followed, and provides that before the Orders of the Day are read, it shall be the duty of the  Chairman  to ask if the Government wish to postpone any of their business, and to inquire if private members desire to postpone any of their business.

                            Ledger has raised practically the same point, so that the reply which I have given to
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story's</inline>
                            objection will also meet his objection, namely, that the Orders of the Day have not yet been called on. The Standing Orders provide that any business may be postponed on motion by a Minister or by the private member who is in charge of that business. The reason why a call of the Senate was ordered for to-day is 'that Bills in which amendments of the Constitution are proposed, require to be passed by an absolute majority of honorable senators. Our Standing Orders have been framed with a view to enabling honorable senators to know when such measures will be brought forward. Standing orders 278 to 283 relate to this matter.

                        <para>. - In the early days of the existence of the Commonwealth this Parliament did all that it possibly could to prevent the influx of undesirable immigrants into this country. I am glad to say that nearly everybody in Australia, and many persons holding high positions in other parts of the world, are beginning to recognise that the policy -which we then adopted is a wise one. But. whilst legislating in respect of immigration, the members of this Parliament did not think that the necessity would ever arise to enact laws in respect of emigration. But from time to time circumstances have arisen which point to the absolute need for something being done to prevent aborigines and young persons of European race from leaving or being taken from Australia without the knowledge of the Government and without the protection to which the citizens of any country are entitled when they go abroad. Upon several occasions the newspapers have emphasized the abuses which have resulted from aboriginal natives and young children being induced to leave the country by plausible stories on the part of certain individuals who wished to make a profit out of them. They have pointed out that when these aborigines and white children have been taken to other countries they have not received that treatment which should have been meted out to them. Owing to these abuses the Government have been compelled, even at this late stage of the session, to introduce legislation for the protection of aborigines and young persons. That is the only reason why this Bill is before us to-day. It merely provides that no aboriginal native and no persons under the age of eighteen years shall be taken from Australia without a permit unless they are in charge of some reputable individual, who will look after their welfare while they are absent. The measure will not debar aborigines or young persons from leaving Australia, but it will compel them to obtain the permission of some Government official, who will see that they are carefully protected while they are abroad. That is really all that the Bill provides, and I hope, in view of what honorable senators already know of this question, that we shall experience no difficulty in passing it through all its stages without delay. I have pleasure in moving - </para>

                    <para>It seems to me, therefore, that the Bill will cover ships' apprentices, and I do not think it is the intention of the Government that these apprentices shall require to obtain a permit under its provisions. I raise this point now because I recognise that we are endeavouring to dispose of the remainder of the business of the session at something like high pressure, and if I wait until the measure is in Committee, the opportunity of the Vice-President of the Executive Council to confer with his officers upon it will undoubtedly be lost. I ask the honorable gentleman to take notice of the point. </para>

                        <para>. - This clause seems to act as an absolute prohibition against those who are under the age specified going abroad. I should like to ask the Minister whether it is intended to prevent children from going abroad without permit, even though they travel with their parents? It seems to me that the clause would prevent a child being sent abroad by a parent without the permission of a Government officer. </para>

                        <para>. - The clause applies to persons under eighteen years of age. I should not be drawing on my imagination too much if I said that there are men in this Senate to-day who travelled in and out of this country, before they were eighteen years of age, without getting a permit from any one ; and I think that, generally speaking, the Australian who reaches the age of eighteen is quite as well able to look after himself as is any other person. Under this clause, a young man who wanted to go to New Zealand for a trip would have to get the permission of a Government officer. He would have to say, " Please, sir, may I go abroad for a month?" The object of the Bill is right enough, and honorable senators are disposed to welcome it; but the principle should not be carried to absurd lengths. </para>

Fancy a young man of eighteen being prevented from going abroad unless in charge of a nurse ! This is going a little too far. If it were a case of persons going out under contract, there might be a reason for supervision, but there is certainly not that reason in the case of young men going out of Australia to look for work - say, to New Zealand, in shearing time. I should think it a piece of impertinence if any one said to me, " You cannot go abroad without permission." </para>

                            <para>- Unfortunately, I am ; but there are many people in this country who are not; and it is surely undesirable to bring every one down to the condition that they cannot live or move without the permission of a Government official. As originally framed, the definition of " child " was applied to a person " under the age of sixteen years," at which age many persons are greatly in need of supervision. But the age was altered to eighteen. The alteration may have been desirable to make it apply to a class of persons who are primarily responsible for the introduction of the measure - young girls going out under contract on theatrical tours. But there is no reason for including those who may merely wish to leave Australia for other purposes, to which I have referred. </para>

                        <para>. - I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> does not mean all that he says. When some honorable senators see anything in print, they take it in at a glance, and object to it straight away. The clause does not mean what the honorable senator imputes. We know perfectly well that an Australian young man or woman is usually just as well able to take care of himself or herself as any one else.. But there are young people whom we do require to protect, and it is for their protection that the age has been fixed at eighteen. The majority of young men and women in Australia could be trusted to go to any country in the world, but it is desired to protect the few who are unfortunate enough not to be so strong minded, or so well developed physically, that the clause is designed. Legislation of this class is not intended to apply to the great majority of people. It is proposed for application to special instances, where wrong or fraud may be attempted to be committed on those who are not well able to protect themselves. I can imagine no officer or Minister in the Commonwealth who would administer . a measure of this description- as one of general application. It will be administered for the protection of aboriginals and white children for whose protection, at present, we have not sufficient power. It is in their interest that the Government desire that no alteration shall be made in the age of eighteen contained in the definition clause. As far as relates to apprentices on board ship, I have ascertained from the Attorney-General that in his opinion the Bill will not apply to them. When the Navigation Bill is under consideration, all the protection that apprentices require will be extended to them. </para>

                        <para>. - The Government, in their effort to do a desirable thing, seem to have proposed a foolish one. We wish to guard against the taking out of Australia of children to perform in theatrical, operatic, or other similar companies. There may not be much danger of the application of the clause in such cases. But paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of sub-clause  1  goes too far altogether. The paragraph does not affect the mischief which the Bill is intended to cure, and may do a great deal of mischief in regard to persons to whom it is not intended to apply. Take the case of a boy or girl under eighteen years of age, who ' may, by passing some high examination, win a scholarship which can only be properly taken out in another country. Scholarships are frequently given in order that students may be enabled to pursue their studies abroad. This provision would prevent their going abroad without a Government permit. </para>

The Vice-President of the Executive Council tells us that he cannot understand the measure being so administered by any sane Minister as to apply in such a case. But the other day, the Senate laughed out a series of questions proposed by a Minister in regard to the census. We are not going to trust Ministers in everything after kicking out one Minister's regulations. </para>

But, under this clause, I should have to go with him, to send him in charge of some adult, or to get a permit from the Government for him to go. That, in my opinion, is an altogether unnecessary interference. If there is wrong-doing which the Government desire to prevent, let them propose to do so in a direct way. If no amendment is submitted upon this clause, I shall be disposed myself to move the omission of one or two of its provisions. The Government have no right to interfere more than is absolutely essential with the liberty of any one. A young man of seventeen years of age, who h'ad been "on his own" for two or three years, might desire to go to New Zealand to take up certain work, or make a contract with a sugar company in Fiji, and although, if he were unable to start at once he might not be able to secure the job for which he was looking, he might, under this clause, be obliged to go to a Minister in Melbourne, or Yass-Canberra, to get a permit, when it might not be possible for him to leave until the next boat. I quite recognise that the Government may, in this matter, be doing their best to remedy a growing evil, but that is no reason for any undue interference with people who have no intention to do evil. Unless a better clause than this can be proposed, I shall be prepared to vote for striking out every provision in it except that with respect to aborigines. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware of that. I mentioned the case of a lad named Kruse. Many years ago this lad showed that he possessed undoubted musical talent, and public subscriptions were asked, to enable him to complete his musical education abroad. That: lad was under sixteen a.t the time. I agree that no injustice should be done, but I think that it is necessary to restrain. &gt;people in certain circumstances. To my knowledge girls under eighteen years of age have gone through a form of marriage, and have been taken to India, and become what are called, the white wives of people there. The less said about these things the better, but from the evidence dealing with the matter, which came under my notice about two years ago, I think I am warranted in saying that they were taken from here for purposes of prostitution. I think that parents should be restrained, from allowing their children to leave their charge, and go out of Australia, as did. the parents of the children of the Pollard company that came under notice some time ago. We should restrain parents who are willing to allow their children to travel outside the Commonwealth regardless of the consequences to them. I agree that if the clause would prevent a lad leaving Australia to secure employment elsewhere under the circumstances stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> it ought to be amended, because that might be oppressive, and against the best interests, not only of the young people, but of the parents themselves. </para>

The Minister's answer to this is, that there are a number of young people in the Commonwealth, who, because of mental or physical defects, are not as well able to look after themselves as are the average of our young people.

The Minister implied that some latitude would be expected in administering the measure. I took him to mean that an officer would not enforce the Act unless he had reason to think that some person was leaving Australia under circumstances not making for his own interests. How would the person find that out? Would he go on board a steamer and wait to see if he was to be arrested? How is he to ascertain that the official thinks it safe for him to leave? If such latitude creeps into the administration, no one will attempt to apply for a permit. </para>

                    <para class="block">No one will think that he is not able to look after himself. But when he is on board the ship an officer may step on board and, under clause 12, arrest him, simply because he has decided to go to New Zealand to look for a shearing job, or on a holiday, without an official passport. When a lad is arrested by the officer, what is to happen? If he is tried on an indictment and convicted, the offence is to be punishable by imprisonment not exceeding two years, or by a penalty not exceeding £200 ; and if he is convicted by a Court of summary jurisdiction he will be liable to imprisonment not exceeding six months, or a penalty not exceeding£100. As regards the class to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker</inline> referred, and the class which the Ministry had in mind when they shaped the Bill, there can be no exception to these penalties; but surely they should see the desirability of drafting a provision  which will relieve a large number of persons who wish to leave Australia for perfectly legitimate purposes, such as a trip to the Islands, Colombo, New Zealand, or, it may be, to the other side of the world. At eighteen years of age I thought I was quite capable to go anywhere without the sanction of any person. </para>

                            <para>- In all probability they will come under its provisions. But the young men and young women under the age of eighteen years who go to New Zealand are few and far between, unless they are accompanied by their parents or a guardian, or unless some person on the ship, or the captain or an officer, has been asked to take charge of them and has been good enough to accept the responsibility of doing so. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is only building up hypothetical cases when he says that there are hundreds of such persons in Australia. I have seen a number of boats laden with passengers leave different ports in Australia, but I have never seen young women or young men of the tender ages mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and others leave on a ship unless they had been intrusted to the care of somebody thereon. </para>

                            <para>- No one desires that such a person shall have the authority of a parent or guardian to, for instance, whip a youth. The introduction of the words "or of the written assent of the parent or guardian" will not get over the difficulties which we find confronting us every day in regard to children of tender years being taken from Australia for other than legitimate purposes. Nor will the amendment cover Asiatics. It will not serve the purpose for which the Bill is intended. The Government are not absolutely wedded to every line of a Bill which they bring in, but I cannot see that there is anything to be gained by striking out paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of clause  3.  That would leave, perhaps, a loophole which might enable the persons we wish to get at to carry on some practices which are not in the interests of children of the ages desired to be protected. I hope that the clause will be allowed to remain as it stands. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that in this case the Government ought to listen to reason. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has just spoken of a lad of eighteen years of age not being able to take care of himself. Before I was of that age I weighed  15  stone, was a member of my union, and had travelled out of the country.I have a boy of the same type. It will be ridiculous if I have to ask permission for him to go to New Zealand or other places. I think that in this provision the Government have gone a little too far, and ought to make it possible for a lad to travel outside the State without having some person to look after him. </para>

                        <para>. - The arguments of the Honorary Minister have convinced me that there is good reason for amending the clause. He spoke quite lightly of the ease with which it will be possible for a man to get the captain or an officer or some person on board a vessel to look after his child.. Enact such penalties as are provided in this clause and every man will experience very great difficulty in getting any person to take charge of his child. Even a man's best friend would hesitate to bring himself under the punitive provisions of the Act, when otherwise he would be very pleased to give an eye to a friend's boy or girl while on board. </para>

                            <para>- Under subclause  2  any person who takes or attempts to take a child out of the Commonwealth in contravention of the section will be guilty of an offence, and the penalties provided are very heavy. Suppose that a stranger to the country wished to send his boy or girl of seventeen years of age on a visit to friends in New Zealand. Under this clause he will be required either to travel with his child or get some person to do so. It will be a most difficult matter to get any person to take charge of the child on a vessel. </para>

In attempting to deal with one evil the Government run the risk of causing great inconvenience to persons desiring to travel. It is quite possible to deal directly with wrongdoers without inconveniencing persons who have no desire to do wrong. The Minister's arguments have convinced me more than ever of the desirability of striking out the provisions. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Under such a provision I think that we should secure a careful administration of the Act. But my experience is that if the public wish' to obtain satisfaction, Commonwealth Departments are the last places to which they will go. Take the case of a man who has engaged as an under-steward on board ship. What officer in the Government Departments would look after his interests and grant him a permit at short notice ? Let us deal with the evil which the Bill aims at suppressing, and not endeavour to create further trouble. </para>

I have a lad over sixteen 'years of age, and if he were about to leave Australia I should be exceedingly glad if anybody -would inform me of his intentions and of his destination. In that case, I should probably give him a few shillings to prevent him from being stranded in a foreign country. But I should take steps to prevent young girls; leaving the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I can quite understand that in some European countries legislation of this kind may be required, but it is preposterous to think of people being desirous of sending their children out of Australia to better their condition. I am inclined to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> proposal. We should, as far as possible, keep the responsibility on the parents. </para>

                                has had an experience that has not fallen to my lot. Had he not been connected with the Trades Hall Council in an official capacity, I do not think that his knowledge -of such cases would have been so extensive. To place children on board a ship under the care of the captain is, I should think, equal to placing them under the care of nobody at all. Whilst I cast no reflection on the captains or officers of vessels, my experience shows me that their professional duties are sufficiently onerous without placing upon them responsibility for children. I have often been amused when I have heard a father or a mother saying to the captain of a ship, " We place this child in your care."

I assume that parents will not give permission for their children to go abroad unless they are quite satisfied as to how they will be treated. If I wanted to send a child abroad, I should take care to appoint somebody to meet the ship on its arrival. Why should I be subjected to all the bother that this clause would entail? </para>

                            <para>- We should not load up our statute-book with molly-coddling legislation that is really not wanted. The Bill has been introduced simply because of an abuse that has occurred in one particular case, which, however, the measure as drafted would not have prevented. It will be more workable if the amendment is accepted. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that the amendment is in the wrong direction, and would render the clause useless. In some European countries any person who wishes to go abroad has to get a permit from the Government. Of course, we do not want to see anything of that sort in Australia. The Bill is admittedly intended to meet exceptional cases. I oppose the amendment because a dissolute and conscienceless parent would be the very person to give consent. </para>

Such an amendment would, I believe, meet the objections which have been urged to the clause better than would the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline></para>

                            <para>- It is for the protection of the many against the few that legislation of this kind is passed. This measure is directed against individuals who are prepared to take our young people away from Australia and make use of them for their own satisfaction or gain, and not against the children or their parents. It is intended for the protection of the children and the punishment of unprincipled individuals who may wrongfully exercise authority over them when they are taken away from Australia. This legislation is required, not for the mass of the people of the country, young or old, but to prevent the operations of a few unprincipled people who are prepared to injure the most innocent section of the community. , </para>

                        <para>. - I find that honorable senators do not understand what the Government propose. It may be because I have not yet made myself clear as to what is the object of this clause. The Bill is mainly the outcome of representations made in another place, and elsewhere, with respect to a white Australian girl who was taken to India by her stepfather. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> desires that every facility shall be given to young Australians to go to any part of the world provided their parents consent. This young girl, who went to India with her stepfather, obtained the consent of her parent to leave this country. I have here the letter which was written by her mother. It is as follows : - </para>

I have turned to my husband's religion (Islam), and I also wish my little daughter to follow the same, which she cannot do in this country, and I will soon be going home to his country myself; but she is just at the right age to be taught our religion, and that is the full reason I want him to go and take her with him. We have a farm in the country, and we cannot both go at once. Whoever reads this letter will see it is my greatest wish to send my little girl with him and nobody must stop him. I have given my husband her birth certificate to take with him, and if anybody wishes he will show them. </para>

It is because we are extremely anxious to prevent a repetition of these cases that we desire that paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a, b,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of subclause 1 shall be retained. To strike out paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> or amend it in the way suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would weaken the Bill, and would permit such cases to occur from time to time. We do not want any repetition of them, and for that reason I hope the amendment will not be agreed to. </para>

One thing that the discussion has suggested to my mind is that the public outside may well wonder what kind of a Parliament this is.

                            <para>- Because one very flagrant case has occurred to which the attention of the Government and people of Australia has been very properly directed, the Government propose that all children in Australia under eighteen years of age, and their parents, should, in this connexion, be kept under the strictest surveillance. I have said that I think paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of sub-clause 1 is unnecessary. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> does not go so far, and, wishing to preserve the intention of the measure, suggests a modification providing for the written consent of parents or guardians. Without special reference to the colour of the skin it may be said that no "white" man would allow his child to leave Australia without taking such precautions as are suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> If any Australian parent neglects to take such precautions, it will be time enough to interfere, and not until then. The people of Australia recognise that with respect to some children engagements might be made of an immoral character. That is why we are considering this Bill. But the parents of Australia are not prepared to go so far as to leave it to the unqualified discretion of a Minister or official to say when and how their children shall leave 'the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> goes half way to meet the Government, and suggests that when the parents of an Australian child desire that he should leave Australia for a legitimate purpose, and are unable to go with him, they should have an option. </para>

                                suggests that they should be in a position to adopt the safeguard of laying  down  instructions as to the persons to whom the child is to be sent, and that it is only where that care has  not  been taken that the Government should intervene. To give an illustration, it is proposed that a child sixteen or seventeen years of age shall be sent  put  of the Commonwealth, and the Government ask," Why is this child leaving Australia?" The answer would be from the parent in the first instance, " My child is going to so-and-so; here are the directions to the authorities and those to whom my child is going. Whether you legislate or not that is practically what will be done. That is what
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                                is contending for. When the discretion is exercised in writing by the parent there ought to be no interference by the Commonwealth. The objection to our contention is that a particular case has happened where, according to official documents, a consent was given to a girl being taken outside the Commonwealth. This measure will not prevent a case of that kind from occurring.

                        <para>. - The letter read to the Committee by the Honorary Minister has furnished another reason why we should make haste slowly with this clause. It is all very well for the honorable senator, with an after knowledge of events, to say that under this Bill permission for the girl to leave Australia would not have been given on the terms of that letter. I wish to point out how harshly this provision will work. Suppose that a parent sends a letter to the Minister saying that his daughter is about to go, not to India, but to a foreign country, for instance, to China, as a missionary. Before a permit can be obtained, the Minister has to be satisfied on certain points. </para>

                            <para>- Suppose that the Minister receives a letter from a mother saying that her daughter, who is seventeen years of age, is about to go to Fiji to act as governess in a family. Possibly he is an astute man, and, having read between the lines of the letter, he will subject the girl and her family to an inquiry, to which decent persons should not be put. As soon as. the Commonwealth or a State steps in to interfere with the arrangements of a family-, it will not prevent what it is aiming at, but will only harass a number of innocent persons. I am not finding fault with the good intention of the Minister or the measure, but pointing out that it will be ineffective to achieve its object, and will cause a large amount of trouble and inconvenience to citizens. In my opinion, the clause confers on the Minister too much power, and I think that the Committee will be well advised if they negative it. I shall vote for the. amendment to improve the clause, and then vote to strike it out of the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that that would be a disadvantage. Those who wish to convert heathens may find any amount of work to do in Australia, instead of going to China, where such work is very much like pouring water on a duck's back. If the written consent of the parents of young persons who wish to leave Australia be required, will it not put them to as much trouble as if you asked them to get a permit from an official ? Some reference has been made to the case of young persons going to Fiji. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> paid a visit to that country, and, according to his statement, it is a very good place to stay away from, particularly in the case of women, who, of course, lack the physical stamina to withstand the climatic disadvantages which he possesses. As regards the far-fetched cases of young girls going to the Old Country to complete their education, I do not believe that there is one case in a thousand where a girl has gone without a guardian, because I reckon that there are dangers to be guarded against even on a long sea passage. </para>

                            <para>- There is no doubt that any budding musical genius who desires to visit the Old Country to complete his or her education can easily escape the restrictions imposed by this Bill. I think that honorable senators opposite are raising imaginary troubles. In all old countries, and probably in some new ones, there is a white-slave traffic in women, and it is very much wiser for us to endeavour to cope with that evil in its initial stages than to delay action until it becomes a public scandal, as it has done in some parts of Europe. The little inconvenience which will be occasioned to young persons who may wish to leave the Commonwealth, by compelling them to secure a permit, need not worry anybody, because it will be to their advantage that the legal authorities here should know the country to which they are going, and also why they are going. </para>

                            <para>- We know that the growth of children of tender years becomes stunted, and that their moral nature is liable to be warped when they are taken to foreign countries under such conditions. Therefore, whilst I think_that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of sub-clause  1  should not be amended in the way that has been indicated, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> might be so amended with advantage. To my mind, a limit of sixteen years would be sufficient to provide in the case of males. </para>

                        <para>.- 1 trust that the amendment will not be persevered with. We are now dealing with children under contract, and we have to recognise that no child under eighteen years of age ought to be allowed to leave the Commonwealth unless his or her welfare has been adequately safeguarded. We are not considering the cases of boys who are eighteen years of age, but those of lads of nine years or ten years of age who wish to leave Australia under contract. Surely no honorable senator desires such children to leave the Commonwealth without some supervision being exercised over them ! I was very much surprised that an honorable senator upon this side of the chamber should have submitted this proposal. We ought to recognise that -the "provision contained in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of sub-clause  1  is very different from that which is embodied in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b.</inline> I trust that the amendment will not be carried. </para>

                                has referred to boys of sixteen or seventeen years of age going abroad to be apprenticed. The Government are prepared to re-commit the definition clause, and to fix such an age for boys as the Committee may desire. But, as far as girls are concerned, I do not think that any honorable senator wishes to reduce the age below eighteen. The Government are prepared to bring the age for boys down to sixteen; but not lower.

But the children of Australia ought never to be treated as were the children of older countries fifty or sixty years ago. In some States of this country, boys are not allowed to leave school before they reach the age of fifteen. The Government are quite prepared to meet honorable senators in a reasonable way ; but, if they are opposed to the Bill, they should not have consented to the second reading. </para>

                        <para>. - This clause seems to me to be altogether useless. How is it possible to prove that the master, owner, or agent of any vessel " has reason to suspect " that a passenger is a prohibited emigrant? If the captain of a ship takes his vessel away with a prohibited emigrant on board, how is it to be proved that he or the owner or agent had " reason to suspect " ? It appears to me that the clause cannot possibly have any effect, and, indeed, cannot be worked. It is not the duty of a ship's captain to look after such matters. </para>

Some people think that when a tooth falls out the proper thing to do is to sprinkle salt on it and to throw it in a certain direction, when everything will be all right. This clause is like salt on an old tooth. But surely we have got beyond that sort of thing nowadays. </para>

I may as well tell those who are always endeavouring to protect somebody from danger that exists only in their imagination that the clause is for the purpose of preventing collusion between any one who wishes to get a young person away from Australia and the master of a ship. When such a provision is inserted  in  an Act of Parliament the master of a ship knows that it is his duty, if he has reason to believe that he has a prohibited emigrant on board, to report the fact to the authorities. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> mean to say that under certain circumstances the master of a ship will not have reason to believe that there is something wrong which he ought to report? I am quite sure that all honorable senators desire to put an end to such a traffic as we have in view, in the interests of the children of this country. </para>

                    <para>I wish to state the reason for the introduction of the Bill and its objects. In November,  1907,  a subscriber to the Newcastle Telephone Exchange complained that the name of a livery-stable proprietor had been placed opposite his telephone number in a telephone list published, and that, in consequence, he and his wife were subjected to much annoyance and inconvenience. Inquiries made by the Department showed that the complaint was well founded. As a result, they sought the opinion of the Crown Solicitor, in order., if possible, to prevent the publication of unauthorized lists. He gave it as his opinion that the Department had no power under the Post and Telegraph Act, or any regulation thereunder, to prevent the issue of such lists, and he went on to say - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para class="block">The matter could, in my opinion, be dealt with by a regulation framed for that purpose, or by registering each list as it is issued, by the Department under the Copyright Act of 1905. In my opinion, however, an appropriate regulation would be the better way of dealing with the matter. </para>

                    <para class="block">Following upon that advice; a regulation was drafted by the Crown Law authorities, and received' Executive approval in 1908. This was the regulation drawn up and circulated - </para>

                            <para>- That is the course Ghat was adopted. Tenders were accepted, one for the privilege in. connexion with directories of New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria, and another for Queensland, Western Australia, and Tasmania. In January, 19 10, after the regulation to which I have referred had been approved of, the firm that secured the contract for the advertisements for Victoria called the attention of the Department to the fact that unauthorized lists were being printed, in which advertisements appeared, and complained that these were injuring his interests, since he was under the impression <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> tendering that he would have the sole right to issue directories in which advertisements might appear. The publisher of the unauthorized list felt that he was in no way contravening the Act, and continued to publish a list containing advertisements. The Department stepped in to prevent his action, and the case was contested in the High Court, with the result that the High Court ruled that the regulation I have quoted was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> In consequence of that ruling, we ask honorable senators to pass this Bill, which has already been approved' of in another place. We believe that it is necessary for the effective working of the Department, and in order that we may do justice to the firms that have been successful in tendering for the publication of these directories. Those who print and circulate private lists have claimed that they are accurate and reliable, but I am able to say that, as the result of an examination by departmental officers of one of these lists, no less than sixty-seven errors were discovered in sixty-three pages. </para>

                            <para>- Under the existing Act a private individual might publish a list whether it was correct or incorrect, and the Department contend that no unauthorized individual in any part of the Commonwealth should be allowed to do that. In connexion with the matter of offences, clause 4 of the Bill deals with the destruction of insulators. Under the Post and Telegraph Act the only means of dealing with those who break insulators is by proceeding against them under section 130, which makes a person found guilty of the offence liable to a penalty not exceeding <inline font-style="italic">£25,</inline> or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding three months. In the case of children proceedings under this section are, of course, objectionable from many points of view, and we propose an alteration of the law in order that we may proceed in such cases not against children under sixteen years of age, but against the parents of those children, in order to put a stop to their mischief in damaging departmental property and causing inconvenience to telephone subscribers and the stoppage of telegraphic communication. </para>

                        <para>. - lt is somewhat difficult to follow the Minister's principal argument in support of this Bill to the effect that the High Court has ruled that the Government have not the sole right under the existing Act to issue telephone lists. I am not interested in the rest of the Bill. At the present time the Government issue a telephone list, of which I have a copy in my hand. It contains advertisements, and, on the whole, is not a bad list, but in some respects it does not compare with a private list which was published not long ago, which also contains advertisements, but which is arranged on a far better system. I think that it applies to only Melbourne and its suburbs, and to country exchanges connected with Melbourne. Apart from the advertisements, which, I admit, are a bit of an annoyance, it is, in my opinion, much better than the departmental book. It not only gives an alphabetical list of everybody connected with the various exchanges, but also gives the exchanges arranged in numerical order. Suppose that a man lives in a boarding-house, and a person calls at the place, and says, " Kindly call up 244 Yarra later." By turning to the book he can immediately find out who 244 Yarra is - a thing which cannot be done by means of the departmental book. It is quite a common thing, if a person happens to answer a telephone call, for somebody to ask, "Is that 611 Yarra?" or "Is that 244 Windsor?" and the answers from one person to another are very often given by means of numbers and the names of the exchanges. Here is a privately-owned book, in which, of course, I have no interest, and which I received the other day. It does not matter whether you get the name or the number when you are called up. So long as you get the exchange you can always ascertain by a reference to the book who has called you up. It is compiled in the same form as the double entry catalogue which is issued in connexion with libraries, and which gives the name of the author of a book and the number it bears in the library. The same principle is followed in the compilation of this privately-owned telephone book. If you may know the number which is calling you up, you are able to immediately ascertain who the person calling is. With the official book, what can you do? You must know the name of the person who is calling you up or you cannot identify him. When I came to Melbourne three or four years ago I wanted to find certain persons. I could not ascertain the name of the boardinghouse in . which they were supposed to be living. I could not find them anywhere, until at last I met some person in the parliamentary building who happened to know the name of the person who ran the boardinghouse. Honorable senators will realize that if a person has to go through all the numbers in order to pick up 244 Central, or Malvern, or Cheltenham, it will occupy him a very long time, probably a week. I do not suggest that the Department should not compile its telephone book according to this system, which, in my opinion, is the better one. If I thought that in future - the Department intended to compile its book on that system, I should probably be quite agreeable to allow it a monopoly of the business. Apparently, what the Government are scared about is that competition is going to be set up with the departmental book, and that the persons who are issuing the private telephone book will get better advertisements and higher prices, and that they will lose advertisements. They do not despise advertisements. On nearly every page of the departmental book are advertisements, and, apparently, the Government are afraid that they will be wiped out. </para>

                            <para>- I venture to say that the honorable senator will not propose an amendment' to that effect. . I only want to discuss the difference between the two kinds of telephone book. I hold that the privately-owned book is better than the departmental book. I ask the Government how far is this thing to be carried. Take the Mutual Store, which I believe has a number of telephones in connexion with its various departments. Does this Bill mean that the Mutual Store will not be permitted to post in its own building a list of its various telephones? I venture to say that it does mean that. Again, take the Hotel Metropôle in Sydney. Does this Bill mean that on each floor of the building the proprietors cannot post a list of the various connexions from the telephone for the benefit of the residents ? That is what it means if it means anything. Then take the case of a small country township where cards containing 30 or 40 or 50 names are published and distributed among the subscribers to the telephone exchange.I notice that a patriotic Government always lets a contract for the publication of the cards. The contractor goes round the township and collects advertisements from business men in order to surround with advertisements the names of the few subscribers on the cards. Are we to understand that in future no private firm in a country township will be allowed to post on its own premises a list of telephone subscribers? I venture to say that there is not a member of either House of this Parliament with a telephone on his premises who has not a list of the principal persons whom his house is accustomed to call up. In my opinion, the Government are making a mistake. If the Department is not able to compete against all comers and issue the best possible book it ought to ask for no legal authority to suppress opposition. They are afraid that somebody or other will issue a better list. Yet they turn round and tell us that they fear that some person may publish an incorrect list. A business firm which publishes an incorrect list will do themselves far more damage than they would do the Department. The latter would not be damaged because the former published an incorrect list. I venture to say that the Minister will not be able to show that any damage would be done to the Department. </para>

If that question were before the Senate, I might argue that that right should be given. I know many parts of Australia where the telephones run by private persons are far better than those run by the Department ; I refer to the telephones on sheep stations. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope that this Bill will meet a fate similar to that which has been meted out to one or two other measures which were more or less a very stupid travesty on legislation. Of course, the introduction of this Bill is due partly to a decision from the High Court in a case where the right of a private individual to issue a telephone list was fairly contested. The case also involved the construction of the Post and Telegraph Act. As the result of the decision which was given, the Government now come down and propose that nobody in the Commonwealth shall be permitted to issue a telephone list. What is to be gained by the passing of this measure ? I do not suppose that the Government will trouble about the matter, provided that they can secure a monopoly for some particular purpose. I admit that not only in postal and telegraph matters, but in other matters, we have to consider "the establishment of a private monopoly ; but the time is fast coming when the most stupid of all monopolies is going to be created - a Government monopoly in respect to almost every action of our lives. </para>

                            <para>- I only completed a quotation, sir. We have to be careful in dealing with this measure. I wish to ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council what public object he expects to attain, or what particular object can be attained, by restricting the right of a private individual to issue a telephone list? If it be superfluous, there is one benefit which flows from that superfluity in that every man who has the enterprise to embark upon this business is afforded an opportunity to make something out of it, and to provide employment for somebody to print that particular telephone list. Does any disadvantage result to the worker if a man chooses to invest his money in an enterprise which proves to be a superfluity? As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> has already pointed out, if a private individual issues a telephone directory which is inaccurate, and if the Government publish one which is consistently accurate, people will, of their own volition, gradually cease to use the former, and will pin their faith to the latter. Nobody will suggest that the telephone directory which is issued monthly by the Government is an infallible publication. There is scarcely a member of the public who has frequently to use that directory who does not discover- errors in it, If the intention of the Bill be to grant a monopoly in the matter of mistakes to the official telephone list, well and good. But surely it is better that we should have a telephone directory in competition with the Government publication - a directory which costs the taxpayer nothing, which may be advantageous to him, and which has the effect of making the official directory more accurate than it otherwise would be. No injury can result to the public from the issue of private telephone lists. But evidently the Government wish to establish a monopoly in the matter of advertisements. They desire to say to the public, " We intend to issue for telephone and postal purposes a book qf our own. We propose to fill it with advertisements, and to charge for them exactly what -we choose." Will that be advantageous to the public? I notice that the Government telephone directory contains advertisements by Smith, Jones, and Robinson. I was about to say that, so far, it does not contain any advertisements relating to whisky. But I find that somebody's wines are advertised in it, and that a chemist also advertises in its pages. We know that there are some chemists who advertise wares whose use is not ' advantageous to the- public- </para>

                            <para>- The Government wish to secure a monopoly in the matter of advertising. When the Minister interjects, I always know that I am drawing him. Every postal directory in the world contains advertisements, and the cost of those publications is defrayed chiefly by the prices paid for the' advertisements. Do the Government intend to eliminate advertisements from the official telephone directory ? I am speaking on behalf of the individualist and of private enterprise. </para>

                        <para>.. - The whole of this trouble seems to have arisen from the fact that the Government have entered into the' advertising business, and that somebody has come into competition with them with the result that they have suffered. They should cease inserting advertisements in the official telephone directory forthwith. The Telephone Branch of the Post and Telegraph Department is a big commercial department. Those who use the telephone are obliged to pay for the service rendered to them. In return, they have a right to be supplied with a telephone list as complete and convenient as it can possibly be made.  If the Government will do that, and throw out their advertisements they will have no competition. Surely it is beneath the dignity of a great public Department to canvass for advertisements for the sake of' the few paltry pounds which they derive thereby. </para>

                        <para>-A rather unfortunate interjection was made just now by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> when he suggested the possibility of the Government granting authority to a private person to issue a telephone list. The plea made for  this Bill is that unauthorized lists sometimes contain errors, whereby the Department is subjected to some inconvenience. What would happen if the Department did give authority to a private person to issue a list which contained errors? The "authority" provision may be taken as merely one of those pieces of padding which make for attractiveness in a Bill, but are not intended to have any effect. It is not intended by the Department to grant any authority to issue private lists. Otherwise, this Bill would not have been introduced. </para>

                            <para>- The Department may allow a small list of the public offices to be. printed for the use of members of Parliament, but we may take it for granted that no authority will be given to issue lists which will be generally useful. I admit at once that I cannot offer any strong opposition to the Bill, for the simple reason - and this is the strongest condemnation I can offer - that I do not think that private lists are likely to succeed1 or will continue to be issued five minutes after the Department issues a. convenient list of its own, In New South' Wales, at any rate, telephone lists were originally issued by the Post and Telegraph Department, on the model of lists privately issued in Melbourne. It was possible, by means of such- a list, to- turn up the number of. any subscriber whose name one had forgotten, because the occupations were classified. There were lists of tailors, tinsmiths, and so forth, grouped in convenient form-. No privately-issued list came into competition with the Government: list when it was published in that form, for; the simple reason, that She Government studied the convenience of the- public, arndt  the : list contained everything which a priv ate firm could offer. It was not until the Department made its lists less attractive and useful that private enterprise said, ".Here is a want which the Post and Telegraph Department is not meeting, and it is not unreasonable that we should attempt to do so." There is the whole position. I venture to say that if the Government would issue a properly up-to-date and business-like telephone list no private list could live three months in competition with it. The real reason why the Government want this Bill is not shown bv the flimsy excuse offered by the Minister - that some errors have occurred in private lists. If the Department is to follow that line of argument it should go much farther. The real reason is that the Department finds that its own lists are being neglected in favour of privately published lists. Why? People do not spend even so small a sum as is. upon something which they do not want when the same tiling is supplied gratuitously by a public Department. Why do the public buy these private telephone list's? Because they contain something which the official directory does not supply. The Government not having supplied what the public want, private enterprise has determined to do so. But now the Government come along by means of this Bill, and play the dog-in-the-manger. They say, " We will not supply this convenience to the public ourselves, and will not allow any one else to do so." Let me show how flimsy the excuse offered by the Minister is. Not infrequently country newspapers publish, for the convenience of their readers, time-tables and telephone lists relating to the small local exchanges. If the Department be sincere in its protestations that these privately-published lists sometimes contain errors, why do they not prevent every country journal in Australia from publishing that kind of information ? Is it proposed to do so now ? No. Why not? Because the newspapers do not come into competition with the Department's own inferior lists. The Department does not care how many errors are made, and does not raise a finger to stop them. </para>

                            <para>- I say that the telephone list issued in New South Wales before Federation was a superior one to the list now issued by the Government. In addition to giving all the information which the Government list gave, it also grouped the telephone subscribers in accordance with their occupations. Before the Government attempt to suppress private enterprise, they ought, at least, to supply that which private enterprise is willing to supply. There is no justification for the Government attempting. to suppress private enterprise, unless it makes a reasonable effort to do just as much for the public as private enterprise does. </para>

                            <para>- Th.e Post and Telegraph Department is not doing that now. There might be some justification for what is proposed if the Government list were sold  to subscribers. They might then say, " We will not permit a competitor to come in." But, as the Government list is issued free to subscribers, it can make no difference whether the user of a telephone chooses to have two directories alongside of him or not. The Government is not interfered with in any way if a subscriber chooses to buy fifty telephone directories. </para>

                            <para>- The answer to the honorable senator is that the public buy the book. Why do they do so? Is it for charity or for fun? Is it a freak on their part, or is it not because it supplies something which the Department do not supply ? The fact that the private list finds a circulation is ample proof that it contains something which the Department do not include in their publication. If it is a question of the paltry revenue derived from the advertisements- </para>

But it is a pitiable spectacle that for the sake of a paltry <inline font-style="italic">£50</inline> or ^100 a year, derived from advertisements in the official directories, we should be asked to pass a Bill to suppress private enterprise. It is an admission that this Government Department is unable to hold its own in competing for a few paltry advertisements against private enterprise. If I had anything to do with the Department, I should be ashamed to make such an admission. Run on proper lines, it should be able to overcome all competition of this kind; but the fact remains that it is unable to do so. </para>

I say, with respect to the telephone directory that the public are not getting what they want in the Government free publication, and that is proved by the fact that they buy what they want from some one else. The Government should see that, in this matter, the Department mend their ways, even though it should be necessary to go back to provide such a directory as was provided ten years ago in New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- What is the remedy for the ordinary individual ? Even a member of this Parliament has the greatest difficulty in getting satisfaction from any of the public Departments. They will carry on a correspondence at great cost; but will not admit that they have made a mistake,  and rectify it. Directories of post-offices and telegraph stations are also published; and I have gone to the  Deputy  Postmaster-General in Tasmania and found that he could not discover the name of a telegraph station in the State from the official directory. A telegram was returned for the reason that it was not properly addressed, and that there were two places in the Commonwealth of the same name, and the name of the telegraph station to which it was addressed was not to be found in the Government .publication. If this matter is left solely in the hands of the Post and Telegraph Department, we shall find them very hard to move. It is admitted that a directory issued by a private firm in this place gives better information than does the official directory; but the Government propose to suppress the private publication. If we knew that the Department would issue a list equal to, or better than, the private list issued, we might have some excuse for passing this Bill. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator reminds me that we have now a Labour Government; but, in another place, a member of that Government said that he was simply a rubber stamp. He said that the Department ran the business, and he merely used a rubber stamp. It was a foolish admission for a Minister to make ; but I believe the honorable gentleman stated a positive fact. The officers of the Departments run nearly every Minister who takes, charge of them, because Ministers have little knowledge of their working, they must rely upon their officers, and cannot take a firm stand. The Postmaster-General, for instance, has no more knowledge of the way in which a telephone list should, be issued than has any private member of the Senate. We have to look to the Department, and riot to the Minister, to carry out this business properly. The only reason offered by the Minister for the introduction of this Bill was that some person got wrong information from ' a private telephone list. If the Government -were as keen about general complaints -with regard to the working of the Telephone Branch as they have been about this matter, we should have seen a great improvement in its working. We have to ask ourselves why the public pay for a private list when they may obtain the official list for nothing. Business men only do that, because they find the private lists issued in various towns in the Commonwealth better than the official list. The Government propose to prevent them taking advantage of lists which they prefer to buy rather than use the official list which they can have for nothing. The Government, in my opinion, should be only too glad to find private firms willing to publish reliable directories. I have been in many places where the Government directory is thrown on one side, and the private directory used. Private enterprise in this matter would be productive of good. Men are always to be found who are willing to supply the public with what they want. Unlike the Departments, they have to exercise their brains to provide something for which the public will be willing to pay. We are asked to suppress its issue. The Government will not allow private individuals to print a telephone list, but want to keep the business in their own hands, and no matter how bad the departmental list may be, that is all the public will get. That is a wrong way to legislate; it is not advancing, but going back. Apparently the heads of the Department think that it should have the control of this business, and, therefore, they brought before the Minister the complaint of a person that, at some time or other, he got possession of a private telephone list containing a mistake. Surely there are mistakes enough in the departmental list. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> has mentioned- a case, and I have heard of a number of cases where the name of the last tenant of a house has remained on the official list for a month or six weeks. Can there be anything more absurd than for a man to be unable to find in the list the name of a friend who he knows is a subscriber to the exchange ? The departmental heads are very eager when they want to make out a case. I suppose that they have made out one to the satisfaction of the Minister, and that Parliament will be pressed to pass this measure. I am very sorry that it has been brought in, as it does away with the possibility of any improvement which we might expect to get on the official list, and we shall have to take whatever the Department chooses to supply. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators who are opposing the Bill say, in effect, that all that work shall be available to any person in the Commonwealth if he likes to issue it for commercial purposes. They argue that it is issued for such purposes. Further than that, the proprietors are obtaining advertisements. If any person who has compared the two books says that the private directory is superior to the official one, he knows little or nothing about the art of printing. The only difference between the two publications is that the private one has, in addition to an alphabetical list, a numerical list. As regards the alphabetical list, there is no comparison between the two publications. Holding a directory in his hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger told honorable senators what sort of advertisements it contained, but he did not state that he was reading the advertisements in a directory published by private individuals. </para>

Will any fair person say that there is any comparison between the advertisements in the official directory and those in this unsightly publication, for such it is to me as a printer? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> asks, "How is it that persons pay for a private directory?" They do not. </para>

                            <para>- If any errors appear in our publication they are quickly righted. The Department has power to stop the issue of private publications, but it has to be exercised in a roundabout way. Under the Copyright Act it can copyright every issue of its directory, but that is a cumbersome method to follow, and, therefore, the Parliament is asked to pass this measure so that no unauthorized person shall publish lists to the annoyance and inconvenience of telephone subscribers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> has said that if we eliminated advertisements from our publication we should have no competitors. Does he seriously think that for a moment ? Private directories would thrive then, because their proprietors would have the field to themselves from the advertising point of view. </para>

                            <para>- The elimination of advertisements from the official directory would not stop the publication of telephone directories by private individuals. Whether advertisements appear in the official directory or not does not in any way affect my line of reasoning. What we want to see is that no unauthorized person in any part of the Commonwealth shall be permitted to print, circulate, or distribute a telephone directory. The numerical list which formerly appeared in the official directory was to me very convenient indeed. I have been inconvenienced very much at times on being told that such and such a number rang up, and that no name was given. Formerly one was able to look at the numerical list in addition to the alphabetical list. The Government have under consideration the advisability of restoring the numericallist. </para>

It was considered at one time that if the two lists were continued the directory would become so bulky that complaints would be made that the expense was not justified.

I do not know of any business firm which has twenty or thirty distinct telephones installed on its premises, but such a firm would only post the numbers of its telephones in its various departments for the convenience of its employés. There is nothing in this Bill to prevent the publication of such a list. The measure is intended to prohibit unauthorized persons from publishing telephone lists throughout the Commonwealth for commercial purposes. </para>

                    <para>I am afraid that a measure dealing with the preservation of Australian industries has come to be regarded as a sort of hardy annual. So far pur attempts to legislate for the suppression of monopolies and trusts has not been very successful. Honorable senators will doubtless recollect that from the outset the members of the party, with which I am associated viewed that legislation somewhat sceptically, and certainly our experience since the parent measure was placed upon the statute-book has not tended to strengthen our confidence in its efficacy. </para>

                            <para>- I think so. There are two causes for it. First, defective legislation, and, secondly, the restraining influence imposed by certain sections of the Constitution which hamper the powers of the National Government. In regard to the legislation which we have enacted, there have been some fifteen or twenty inquiries into cases in which requests have been made that prosecutions should be instituted. But out of the whole of those cases there have been only two prosecutions, the final result of which was that two sections of the principal Act were declared by the High Court to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of the Constitution. That is not a very encouraging record. The Government, however, take up the attitude that there has been an undoubted demand on the part of a large section of the people that a restraining influence should be exercised on monopolies. That wish has been voiced by various sections in Parliament, and we are prepared to give our anti- trust legislation a full and fair trial. With that end in view we have introduced this Bill, which is designed to give the Commonwealth further powers - powers which are declared by the Crown Law officers to be absolutely essential if any effective steps are to be taken to prevent monopolies and trusts in Australia from doing things which are detrimental to the public interest. </para>

                            <para>- I shall endeavour to do so. One provision to which the law officers of the Crown, point as a source of great weakness is section 4 of the principal Act, which reads -  (1.) Any person who, either as principal of as agent, makes or enters into any contract, or is or continues to be a member of or engages in any combination, in relation to trade or commerce with other countries, or among the' States - </para>

                    <para class="block">That section contemplates two things which it is almost impossible to prove. In the first place, it declares that it is necessary to prove intent to restrain trade - not merely the act of restraint, but intent to perform it. Secondly, it provides that it shall be necessary to prove that the act of restraint is detrimental to the public welfare. It has been found impracticable to establish these two things. Moreover, in this legislation we are endeavouring to copy, to a large extent, the legislation of the United States. Although our legislation in this connexion has very largely followed the Sherman Act, judgments have been given in the United States - I have them here, but I do not intend to quote them unless I am asked to do so because they are somewhat lengthy - the result of which has been to extend the operation of that Act beyond the limits conveyed by its actual wording. If honorable senators will read them, they will find that the amendments which we now seek to make in the law, follow those judgments. In this Bill we propose to take away the obligation to prove that restraint of trade is to the detriment of the public, and we seek to enact that the commission of the act shall be held to prove intent. That is to say. we intend to make the subsection which I have just quoted, read - </para>

                            <para>- Yes, in that regard. The difficulty that the Crown has experienced is this - that it has had very often to go to two interested parties, one a buyer and the other a seller. The one is often under some obligation to, or occasionally is in the power of, the other. The Crown can only prove certain things by means of the evidence of one or other of those parties. Consequently it has to compel one of them to give evidence against the other. When you have two interested parties in such relations to each other, it is often very difficult for the Crown to prove its case. The only way of doing so is to make one of the parties a defendant in the case, and then call upon the other to give evidence as to the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the action, and as to whether anything done was detrimental or otherwise. </para>

                            <para>- Under those circumstances, there is a different spirit animating the parties. In the one case the Crown makes a victim of a person who gives his evidence unwillingly, if he gives; it at all. In the other case, one of two persons in business relationships deposes as to whether a certain action was unreasonable or not. Although we are extending the wording of the existing Act, I can assure honorable senators that if they read the United States Law reports, they will find that we have not gone further in our amendment than the law of the United States has done. I mention this with some trepidation, trusting that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger will not inflict upon us quotations from the Iraq reports. I may, however, give a reference to the volume - No. 193, pages 328 and 351. I shall refrain from quoting the passages, and trust that, although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger may refer to them for his own information, he will spare us a lengthy citation from them. If the Leader of the Opposition refers to the report he will find that what I have said is absolutely correct, and that the language which we are adopting is in consonance with the judgment of the United States Court. A further amendment has been made in the direction of increasing penalties. We are now not merely imposing a penalty on conviction ; but if, after the prosecution has been undertaken, the defendant has continued in the offence, and that is proved, the Court can, if it think fit, provide for a continuing penalty up to the date of the conviction. A point has been raised as to whether this provision would be retrospective; that is to say, whether the operation of this new provision would have a retrospective effect in applying to offences committed before this Bill comes into operation. The answer to that is - No ; the new provision will not have effect except from the time of the coming"' into operation of the measure,  though it will have effect as to offences committed by an existing combine. </para>

                            <para>- Then the penalty would be imposed if the offence was continued right through, That is what the law 'officers say on the point. It is held that if the offence is committed continuously the penalties will operate on the continued offence. These corporations, of course, have their lawyers, and know the effect of the law ; and if in defiance of the law a corporation not only commits an unlawful act, but continues to do so, then it will be penalized for the time during which it has continued to break the law. A further point in this Bil! is a new clause' by which we can take minute books, records, and documents, and use them in the prosecution of a combination. </para>

But still, it has been held that they cannot be used, and so under this Bill we are taking power to use them. It is the opinion of the Crown law officers that the provisions of this Bill are necessary in order to enable us successfully to deal with combinations where they are illegitimately restraining trade and doing injury to the public. Therefore the Government trust that this Bill will pass, and that prosecutions instituted under it will be conducted with the object of carrying out what was intended under the principal Act - not to break up combinations, not to try to turn the hands of the economic clock backwards, but simply to enable the Government to institute prosecutions and sheet home convictions when combinations' are doing wrong. </para>
