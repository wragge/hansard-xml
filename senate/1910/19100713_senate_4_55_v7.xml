                        <para>. - - As a new member of the Senate- in spite of my previous experience of this Chamber - I naturally share the diffidence which has been expressed by other honorable senators in approaching such a great national programme as has been laid before us in the Governor-General's Speech, lest I should be unable to criticise it as it deserves. It is not my intention to dilate at length upon any of the measures mentioned in that document, but I feel that it is almost necessary for a new senator to express his views on those questions which may be called national, rather than party, and as to which I trust party votes will not be cast in this Chamber. The first portion of the speech that strikes me as being very important from a national point of view, and which certainly has been subjected to keen criticism by the Leader of the Opposition, in his excellent address of last week, is that dealing with those financial transactions of the Government which the Opposition say are not exactly in accordance with political honesty. But it seems to me that it was better <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the interests of the States, and certainly in the interest of the Federal Government, as there were trust funds lying idle and of no present use, either to the State; or to the Federation, that those funds should be used, in the special circumstances explained by the Prime. </para>

                            <para>- W - What was done has been fully explained by the Leader of the Government in the Senate and by the Prime Minister in another place, and it is clear that no matter what had been done, it would have had to be done without parliamentary authority in the special circumstances. I cannot see that the Government have been guilty of any heinous crime in the nature of financial or political dishonesty in using the trust funds as they did. After all the money belonged to the public; it was merely used to get over a temporary difficulty; nothing dishonest occurred, and I feel sure that even the members of the Opposition do not feel so strongly about the subject as their language would lead one to suppose. Regarding the financial policy of the last Administration, which was the subject of a referendum on the  13th  April, it seems rather strange that although all the States returned to the Senate representatives pledged to the Labour platform:, nevertheless a considerable majority of the people in some of the States voted in favour of the Financial Agreement. That I say is a peculiar state of affairs. The explanation seems to me to be this. The people were opposed to the incorporation of the Financial Agreement in the Constitution. Consequently those who advocated so strenuously the embodying of it in the Constitution in opposition to what was regarded as the truly national policy were relegated to that political obscurity which I had the honour to adorn for three years. In my own State a considerable majority of electors voted for the agreement because, as I interpret the result, there was a loose kind of feeling that from the point of view of the amount to be paid it would be a good thing for Tasmania. But, nevertheless, the people voted for those candidates who were most strongly opposed to the agreement, because they did not want it to be embodied in the Constitution. What they wanted was to secure that the States should receive  25s.  per head for ten years, and they were quite satisfied to trust the Federal Parliament in the future to see that justice was done. One of the most remarkable features of that attempt to handcuff the Federation is this : Ten years ago the leading statesmen and authorities on finance in Australia met together in a Convention, and framed the financial provisions of the Constitution. One of those provisions distinctly prescribed how the Federal revenue was to be divided for ten years. The leading statesmen in Australia at that time were quite prepared to trust the people and the Federal Parliament at the end of the ten years' period. Yet the Fusion party, in the last Parliament, endeavoured to foist the Financial Agreement upon the people, and were not willing to trust the Federal Parliament ten years hence. I consider that ten years is sufficiently long for the  25s.  provision to endure, and Parliament should have an opportunity of reconsidering the matter at the end of that time. In relation to the financial proposals of the present Government, there is one matter which deeply affects the State that I have the honour to represent. While I recognise the propriety of what seems to be a very generous provision indeed regarding Western Australia - and it does seem a most generous provision for the Federation to make- </para>

At the present moment I am not quarrelling with it. But I do say that, if there is one State that is entitled to some special concession as well as Western Australia, it is Tasmania. </para>

                            <para>- I w I would ask those honorable senators who are not disposed to agree with me just now to wait until the proper time comes, when I shall tell them my reasons. I take it that this is not a suitable occasion for going into details, and, therefore, I do not intend to do so. I have, however, ample facts and figures to prove the justness of my contention. Perhaps 1 may give one or two, by way of illustration. Since Federation, whatever we had in the way of manufactures in Tasmania have been almost wiped out. As was said by a member of another place, Tasmania is now almost a suburb of Victoria, as regards its manufacturing industries. Take the boot trade. Before Federation there were  332  persons employed in that trade in Tas- mania. To-day the number has been reduced to 252, in spite of the natural increase of population. In other branches of manufacture, the same tale has to be told. </para>

I want honorable senators representing other States, however, to look at it in the same light. Because Tasmanians have been good Federalists, they have suffered financially. They have been in the habit of purchasing goods manufactured in other States, and also the products of those States, in preference to purchasing manufactured goods and products from over-sea. Had those manufactures and goods been purchased from abroad, Tasmania would have collected Customs duties upon them. But she has not done so, and, consequently, has suffered financially. </para>

                            <para>- I d o not think so. Tasmania has suffered in a far greater measure than the figures- which have been supplied by the Prune Minister in this connexion - and which it is very difficult foi one to refute - would seem to indicate. She has been penalized considerably by reason of the leakage in the revenue that has been going on ever since the inception of Federation. People have come from that State - especially from along the north-western coast, which is nearly as close to Victoria by water as it is to Launceston - and have purchased goods in Melbourne. The western ports of Tasmania are nearly as close to Melbourne as they are to Hobart; and there is very little difference between the passenger rates from that portion of the island State to the two capitals. </para>

                            <para>- Tha That is not the question. The fact remains that every month a large number of persons come from Tasmania to Melbourne, not for the purpose of holiday-making, but in order to transact business. They have been doing this for years. I quite recognise that, in the light of the figures which have been supplied, and in view of the small <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> contribution which Tasmanians make to the revenue, that State will not be under any disability if, in the future, 25s. per head be returned to it by the Commonwealth. But we must recollect that figures can be made to prove almost anything. T repeat that a great many persons come from Tasmania to Victoria and purchase goods for which they do not trouble to take out Inter-State certificates. Thus, the State which I represent has lost considerable sums. The Government Statistician of Tasmania has pointed out that it has lost, approximately, ^40,000 annually by way of leakage in this connexion, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne himself admitted in an interview in that State that it had lost at least £20,000 per annum. How does this leakage occur? I will give an illustration. Not very long ago, a Tasmanian friend of mine visited Melbourne, where he purchased a Cashmore gun for £26 10s., for which he paid cash. Speaking from memory, <inline font-style="italic">J</inline> think that the duty upon guns is something like 25 per cent. The weapon in question wa's manufactured outside of Australia, and the duty upon it, which was due to Tasmania, was therefore <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> or £6 But that State was not credited with the duty in question. Why ? Simply because the purchaser did not know that he ought to have obtained an Inter-State certificate. The' ordinary purchaser from Tasmania does not stop to think about Inter-State certificates. If he purchases £100 worth of goods, which are dutiable at 20 per cent., when they are imported into Victoria, and which, therefore, ought to yield Tasmania a revenue of  ;£2o,  he does not pause to worry about obtaining Inter-State certificates. Of course, a merchant who is doing a big business with Tasmania would do so. But the casual purchasers from Tasmania, who number thousands a year, do not. It will be seen, therefore, that, whilst the bookkeeping system has been in operation, the State from which I come has lost, approximately,  ^40,000  a year. </para>

                            <para>- Tha That is a side issue. I have no doubt that, whatever revenue was derived from that source, my honorable friend contributed to it. I submit that the question of whether or not the measure of justice for which I am contending should be granted to Tasmania is one which deserves fair and earnest consideration at the hands of honorable senators. Of course, I ask for nothing in the future, but merely that the State which I have the honour to represent should be recouped for the loss which she has sustained in the past. I do not quarrel with the proposal to grant a special concession to Western Australia </para>

                                could not support that proposal, because it would tend towards unification. With respect to the much-discussed and much-abused land tax proposal, I have only to say that I am whole-heartedly in favour of it, because no one has had a better opportunity than I have recently had in travelling through Tasmania of knowing the disastrous effects of land monopoly in that State. Without labouring the question, I believe that the imposition of the proposed land tax will do something to break up land monopoly; and, if it will not, let our opponents suggest a better scheme for the purpose, and they will find us willing to accept it. Until a better scheme has been suggested, we must go on with that which we have proposed. I must express my disappointment that the Government have not included in their immediate financial proposals one for the consolidation of the State debts, and to provide that future borrowing by the State- Parliaments shall be done only through the Federation. We must give the Government time, however ; and I hope that, not later than next year, something in that direction will be done. We must have the consent of the people of the States before State borrowing can be controlled by the Commonwealth authority ; but I think it would be financial suicide for the Federation to take over existing State debts before this Parliament has acquired the right to control future State borrowing. When the Government are submitting certain questions to the people by way of referendum next year, I trust that they will be asked to give the Commonwealth Parliament this power. One question which we are told is to be brought before the Senate is that of quarantine ; and I hope that when the Government bring down their measure dealing with the subject it will be found to propose a radical alteration of the present quarantine laws in operation in Australia. I trust that it will take from the State Governments and hand over to the Federal authority all the quarantine powers now exercised by the various State Governments, and will give the Federal authority absolute control of all produce passing from State to State. Hundreds of people in the State from which I come were only a few months ago faced with' die prospect of black and bitter ruin as the result of the operation of the very unfair quarantine laws existing in some of the States. I can quote an instance that actually happened. A certain shipment of potatoes was passed by the Tasmanian inspector on the wharf at Devonport. It was sent to another State, where it was reported as unsound by the inspector of that State. It was shipped back to Tasmania, and without any picking over the potatoes were spilled from the bags in which they were contained into clean bags, and then returned to the port at which they had been condemned, and the same inspector passed them.

                            <para>- Tha That is so. The Minister administering the Tasmanian quarantine law prohibited the introduction of certain oranges shipped from Queensland or New South Wales on the ground that they were infected by some pest. I suppose he was afraid that if he allowed these oranges to be introduced the pest would infect the orange groves of Tasmania, where we dc/ not grow an orange. That is only another instance which shows what followed from having these quarantine laws operated by the different States. </para>

                            <para>- U - Undoubtedly, that should be prevented. I hope that the Bill to be submitted by the Government will give the Federal authority absolute control in the matter. Another question which is likely to exercise the minds of honorable senators very seriously is the Capital site question. I believe that I shall have the support of some of my honorable friends in New South Wales -when I say that before another pound is spent on the Yass-Canberra site the new members of the Federal Parliament should be given an opportunity of visiting that site and the site first chosen by this Parliament. I do not suggest another picnic. We do not want any more picnicking, but let the new members of this Parliament visit the sites at their own expense. When I look round the Senate I wonder how the decision of the Parliament fixing the site of the Federal Capital at Dalgety came to be altered. When I read the division list I -could scarcely believe what I saw. I had listened in this Chamber to some splendid arguments upholding Dalgety as the best site for the Federal Capital, and I found that some of the honorable senators who used those arguments reversed the votes they had previously given, and voted in the last Parliament for Yass-Canberra. They may have had good reason for doing so; perhaps they knew more of Yass-Canberra then than they did when they previously voted for Dalgety, but, in any case, I submit that the new members of this Parliament should have an opportunity of visiting both sites. </para>

                            <para>- It hink that the new senators can best acquaint themselves with the chief features of the site by going there in small parties, but certainly, before any more public mo'ney is spent on the site, they ought to be afforded an opportunity of making a personal inspection. It would be well on towards the middle of the session before an inspection could be completed, because all the senators could not go up to the site at one week end. I do not believe that the feeling in New South Wales is so much against the selection of Dalgety as we are led by Sydney newspapers to believe. However, the representatives of the State here are better authorities on that subject than I am, and they can put that side of the question before the Senate. I am not opposed to the selection of Yass-Canberra, because I have not seen the site. I thought' that Dalgety was a good site to choose, and until I have seen the Yass-Canberra site I shall adhere to that view. I spent some clays in traversing the Dalgety site, and it seemed to me that it was a suitable one. </para>

                            <para>- I - I am not quarrelling with that view at all. If the Government choose to take the new senators to Yass-Canberra, they may do so. But that is only a small matter. The chief point is that, inasmuch as the territory is to serve for all time, the best one, if possible, should be chosen. I do not hold any strong opinions about Yass-Canberra, but I want to see that site, and wish other honorable senators to have a like opportunity. Since the  13th  April a good deal has been said about the necessity for electoral reform. It is very hard to get the dominant party to agree to change that kind of electoral system which has suited its book. I am sure that my honorable friends on the other side will agree with me. </para>

                            <para>- l - am glad of that interjection. My honorable friend is consistent, and I trust that his consistency will be shown if the question is brought forward here. I am still of the opinion which I expressed here nine years ago, when the question was first raised. It will be remembered that the Electoral Bill of  1901,  which was originated here, provided that' the senators should be elected under what was known as the Hare-Clark, or proportional, system, of voting. It was shown that it would be a cumbrous system to work in the big States, but I was always in favour of its adoption. When the provision was deleted, it was replaced with an optional system of voting. The Government brought down a clause providing that a man should be allowed to vote for one, two, or three candidates, as he chose, and should not be compelled to vote for the three candidates. That was put in in place of the original provision, but it was knocked out. I remember that, by interjection, if not by speech, some honorable senators who sat on the Opposition side, and, it may be, some senators who were in favour of the Barton Government, said they believed in that system which would allow a slight majority of the electors in a State to have the whole of its representation. </para>

                            <para>- Tha That is so under a democratic system of government ; but we are always told that we would not have had Federation without the provision for the equal representation of the States in the Senate. While I am quite willing to allow that a proportional voting system which might be successfully used in the smaller States would be a very cumbrous one to work in New South Wales, still it is time that there was an alteration in the electoral system for the Senate. My plan would be to divide every State into six parts, and to allow each part to elect one senator. That would preserve the continuity of the Senate. </para>

My impression is that responsibility is good for us all, and when we are in a responsible position some things are not so easy to manage as they seemed when we were merely spectators. I desire to compliment my friends, Senators McGregor, Pearce, and Findley, upon the positions which they occupy. I am sure that we all regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> state of health necessitates his absence. The sooner he comes back the better pleased we shall be. I believe that we have never had a more competent Minister of Defence than the honorable senator since the Federation took place. Of course, it is not unreasonable to suppose that, as the Ministry have a large majority, they will be in a position to allow, occasionally, a private senator to have the chance of bringing in a Bill. In days gone by it has been very difficult for a private senator to get a Bill passed through the Senate. I also desire to congratulate the proposer and seconder of the Address-in-Reply. I am glad to see that my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> stands out for the great importance of the clans commencing with the prefix Mac. He says that the Macs, hold their own very well, and even in the Senate we see how well they, do that. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> that it is very desirable that we should not have very long speeches. In days long past we used to credit the Labour party with being the best " stone-wallers " here. We cannot for a moment say that we are  equal to them in that respect. Our duty rather is not to waste time, but to criticise, and endeavour, as far as we can, to improve the Bills as they come before us. <inline font-style="italic">Ai</inline> I am not very well this afternoon, I do not propose to occupy much time. The Governor-General's Speech is composed of thirty paragraphs. It would be rather tedious to go through each paragraph, but the sixth one refers to a matter on which I desire to say a few words. It speaks of the payment of 25s. per head to the States commencing from the 1st July. I am not aware that the Braddon section of the Constitution has been altered. It provides that for ten years the States shall receive three-fourths of the net income from Customs and Excise duties. I maintain that the States are now entitled to receive that proportion until the 31st December next, and that, therefore, the proposed payment of 25s. per head can only commence legally on the 1st January, 191 1. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but they proposed it by an alteration of the Constitution, which, however, the electors rejected. The Braddon section is still in force, and the States are undoubtedly entitled to receive three-fourths of the net revenue from Customs and Excise. I draw the attention of new senators to the fact that this is essentially a States House, and we are bound to stand up for the rights of the States under the Constitution. Reference has also been made to the fact that the proposed Financial Agreement provided that the States would give £600,000 towards an estimated deficiency of £1,200,000 in the Commonwealth revenue. That promise was made on the condition that the provision for the payment of 25s. per head of the population was put in the Constitution. One part of the agreement not having been carried out, the other part need not necessarily be carried out. But if it is to be carried out in spirit, it should only cover one-half of the actual deficiency in the revenue. If the deficiency is £400,000, the States should be asked to pay half that amount. Many matters which are mentioned in the Speech will come before the Senate when Bills are introduced, and, therefore, I do not. propose to deal with them. I now come to the proposal for a Commonwealth note issue. That is a matter on which I think I can speak with a little knowledge. It is, perhaps, not known to many honorable senators that in days gone a certain Government had an idea of bringing in a note issue, and a meeting of bankers was held. I do not object to the principle of a Federal note issue, but I do maintain that if it is to be introduced, it should be as satisfactory to the every-day trader as the other note issue is. The heads of the banks met together and arranged that each bank should guarantee all the notes of the other banks, so that the public would have the joint and several guarantee of all the banks for every bank note, and the bank notes would be taken at par in any part of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The Government to which I refer did not proceed with the matter, but I dare say that the banks would still be willing to carry out the arrangement. It is proposed by the Government that with the Commonwealth note issue gold shall only be obtainable at the Treasury in Melbourne. At the present time the Queensland Government have six places within the State at whichGovernment notes can be converted into gold. I have that fact on the authority of the general manager of the Commercial Bank in Sydney, who gave me the information the last time I saw him. The Government will surely recognise that those of us who have to stand up for State Rights must insist that, if the Federal notes are only to be convertible into gold in one State of the Union, that will be unfair to the other States. Gold should be obtainable for the notes in each of the State capitals. Let me show what will happen if that be not done. A man can pay his debts in legal tender notes, and the creditor cannot refuse to receive them. But if he goes to buy goods, and proffers legal tender notes in payment', the seller is not obliged to accept that form of currency. Take the case of a man who holds Federal Government notes in Perth, and who goes to a banker, and says, " I want to purchase a draft on London for £100." Suppose that he offers notes in payment. The banker may, perhaps.  consent to take them, but if he likes he may say, " No ; notes are not gold ; if I take those notes I shall have to send them to Melbourne to get them cashed. Each of those notes is practically a Melbourne cheque. We shall have to charge you exchange on Melbourne." </para>

                            <para>- I am not going to say anything on that point. Having found fault with the scheme of the Government so far, I will suggest what I think would meet the difficulty. I think that the Government ought to have a Department to look after the note issue. There should be nonpolitical Commissioners, with probably bankers to assist them, in charge of the work. The Department should be conducted on business lines. The Commissioners should be able at any time to show their liabilities on one side and their assets on the other. If the Department were carried on at a profit, that profit should go into the general revenue of the Commonwealth. In that way we should have persons responsible for seeing that there was no undue issue of notes, and that there was an ample gold reserve. </para>

                            <para>- Personally, I do not think that the 25 per cent, gold reserve is sufficient. I have never thought so. The more places there are at which persons can get gold for the Federal notes the greater the favour with which they will be received by the public. If there are six places in the Commonwealth at which the notes can be converted, they will be regarded with more favour than if there is only one ; and, again, if people know that they can get gold for their notes at any time, the probability is that they will not ask for it, because they will know that it is there. I have no objection to the principle of the Government controlling the note issue of the country, but we should see to it that the public are not penalized thereby. Take the Queensland system. In that State it is optional on the banks to pay a sovereign for every one-pound note they take. But if they prefer it, they need only pay one-third in gold and two-thirds in a fixed deposit for two years at 2 per cent. interest. That is one reason why the Government note issue in Queensland is looked upon favorably by the bankers of that State. I understand, however, that there is no intention to offer such facilities in the case of the Federal note issue. The consequence is that if the bankers have to retire all their notes, and then pay for £4,000,000 of notes introduced by the Federal Government, their facilities for lending money to the public will be less than they are to-day, and borrowers will be put to a disadvantage. I hope I have made that point clear. I also wish to make a few remarks with regard to the proposed progressive land tax. I gather that under the Constitution it is impossible to discriminate between town and country lands. How can a person having a large shop in town cut up that property so as to reduce the amount of his land tax? </para>

                            <para>-  I can only suggest one way by which he could. Those of us who have had dealings in land may know that a person may own a piece of land absolutely, but may parcel it out to three different persons, each one of whom will have an undivided third of the unimproved value of the land. That is a very complicated thing to do, and it is not altogether fair in some cases. I am interested in a piece of land in Fortitude Valley, Brisbane, in which three persons each hold an undivided third. I am sorry to say that it is not so valuable to-day as it was twenty years ago. </para>

                            <para>- Are not the banks entitled to some return  011  the enormous capital invested in their business ? At the present time in Papua, which is a very important and rising Territory of the Commonwealth, two banks, I am glad to say, have opened branches, to the great delight of the inhabitants, who recognise that banking does a vast amount of good. It is a legitimate occupation, and why should any one speak of bankers as if they were frauds ? Why should banking be referred to as " one of the frauds by which capitalism fleeces the people " ? As a matter of fact, banking is one of the blessings; of our social system, and but for it this country would not have gone ahead as it has done. As an old banker, I am hereto stand up for the banking institutions of this country, and I contend that they have contributed in a very large degree to the prosperity of Australia. With regard to defence, I have on more than one occasion in the past said that I regard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> as an admirable Minister. I am alf the better pleased that he is again, at the head of the Department, because he is apparently determined to act upon Lord' Kitchener's report. I also commend his action in determining to get Admiral Henderson to come and report on our situation/ from the naval point of view. I think the Minister of Defence deserves great credit. I am not one of those opponents who do not think that the present Government are capable of governing the country. I think they are quite capable. I am also glad that they intend to have one postage stamp for use throughout Australia. That is a very sensible proposal. There are several other matters in the programme of the Government as to which something might be said, but I prefer to wait until we see their measures. I observe that the Navigation Bill is to be resuscitated. I recognise, as I think we all do, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is probably the most competent man in this Chamber to deal with that matter, subject to Ministerial control. Would it not be a good thing to appoint <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> with one or two others, as a Committee to look through the Navigation Bill, and then accept their report upon it? It would take months to deal with the measure in the Senate. We always had it brought before us when we had nothing else to do. </para>

Leaving this question, I  come now to the proposed amendment of the Immigration Restriction Act. I hope that . there will be a good deal of elasticity in the new Act. However much we may be in favour of a White Australia, there are times when considerations of humanity are above those of colour. For the benefit of honorable senators, I propose to read an account of certain incidents which occurred within the past few days. The extract is as follows : - </para>

                        <para>Some difficulty has cropped up between the shipping companies and the Commonwealth Government in connexion with the castaways of the wrecked " steamer <inline font-style="italic">Kilburn.</inline> Portion of the crew of the wrecked vessel were Chinese, and after the vessel was wrecked at the Fiji group they were forwarded on to Sydney from Suva as distressed seamen. Four arrived by the steamer <inline font-style="italic">Tofua,</inline> of the U.S.S'. Co.'s line, and the balance by the A. U.S.N. Co.'s steamer <inline font-style="italic">Suva.</inline> Under the Alien Restriction Act the Chinese were not allowed to land on arrival, and the companies, although compelled to carry them as distressed seamen under the British law, found themselves responsible for their safekeeping. It so happened that the <inline font-style="italic">Tofua</inline> had to proceed to Newcastle for coal, and while there one of the Chinamen escaped from the vessel. Efforts have since been made to trace him, but without avail, and now the Customs authorities have notified the captain that he is liable to the extent of £100, and the fine will be inflicted unless the man is forthcoming. The Chinese oh the steamer <inline font-style="italic">Suva</inline> were also thrown on the hands of the ship's company that carried them from Fiji, and they have since been put to considerable expense to prevent them from landing pending arrangements for their departure from the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I want considerations of humanity to run through the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act. I feel sure that the Vice-President of the Executive Council is with me on this matter. With every desire not to be discourteous to the Government, I fear that a large portion of the legislation which they intend to bring forward will be of a class character. Australia has come to be divided into two great parties - unionists and non-unionists ; and it seems to me that nowadays it is a crime for a man to be a non-unionist. To my mind, the tendency to give a preference to unionists is distinctly objectionable, and should be scouted by all moderate men. " Fair play is bonnie play," as they say in Scotland. Unfortunately, there will always be great differences in the financial position of individuals in this world. Some men will be rich, whilst others will be poor. I recognise that no persons are kinder to the poor than are the poor themselves. But good as are many of our friends who are not well off, they are, in one respect, sadly wanting. As a rule, they do not give that fair support to our hospitals which they ought to give. </para>

                            <para>- I think that Senators McDougall and Ready expressed their delight at being in a position to accord fair play to a section of the community which had always laboured under disadvantages. Admitting that to a certain extent the latter portion of their statement be true, I say that at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, a public institution, no charge is made for admission; and that a man who meets with an accident, and who is taken to that institution, receives the benefit of the very best surgical treatment. There is no better surgeon in Australia than is <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. MacCormick,</inline> who can command almost any price that he chooses to name for an operation. Yet, any unfortunate who meets with an accident can be taken to that hospital, where he will receive the benefit of the surgeon's skill. But, after patients leave that institution, they scarcely ever make any contribution to it. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing at all. I happen to be connected with a private convalescent hospital, which has been open for sixteen years ending last 30th September, and during that time 13,000 patients have been through the hospital. They were treated as guests. The hospital authorities will not take money from their patients, but they say to them, " If you think you are justified in giving something to the other hospitals as a token of gratitude for the treatment you have received here, we will send on your contribution for you." During the sixteen years that privately endowed hospital has spent over £50,000 in treating patients as well as they could be treated in any part of the world, and yet during the whole of that term the authorities of the hospital have not received £50 to give to the other hospitals from the patients they have served. The figures go to show that for each £1,000 given by those to whom honorable senators opposite would refer as plutocrats, the other people have not given £1. While I recognise that, speaking generally, poor people are kind to the poor, I have no hesitation in saying that a great amount of. obloquy has undeservedly been heaped upon the better-to-do classes in Australia. 1 hold that they are as liberal as any other class in the world. </para>

The practice of debating the Address-in-Reply has this value attached to it, that it gives members of all parties' an opportunity to mention measures which meet with their cordial approbation, or which they consider particularly dangerous.. </para>

                            <para>- lt may be a pity that I should not be as well informed as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, but in escaping the infliction of listening to the honorable senator's speeches I had compensating advantages. Though we heard ringing throughout the Commonwealth these prophecies and forebodings of disaster, we find that the remnant of the political parties opposed to us who have crept back to these chambers are apparently still as well satisfied with their financial and business position as they were. They do not seem to be fleeing the country. During a recent visit to Sydney, I noticed that the building trade there is booming quite as much as it has during the past two or three 5'ears, and none of the disastrous things that we were told would happen appear to have started to happen yet. However, it is of no use to flog a dead horse, and the other party is practically in that position to-day. I might express my great feeling of rejoicing at the fact that the Government are able to bring down a programme which, while it is not all that one might desire, is an instalment of many important reforms embodied in the Labour platform. I feel sure that if the greater part of the measures outlined in the Governor-General's Speech are placed upon the statute-book, the industrial and social life of Australia will be to a large extent revolutionized.' i have been too long a student of politics to imagine that any party, however strong, can bring about great reforms in a moment, or that it is possible to accomplish anything like the millennium even in a very lengthy period. But in the reforms outlined in the references in the Governor-General's Speech to land taxation, the nationalization of monopolies as a question to be submitted to the people by referendum, and the blow that is being struck at the borrowing policy by the advent to power of the Labour party, we shall be laying the foundation of great things in the future of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I shall do so when I arn ready. While strongly approving of the programme outlined in the Governor-General's Speech, and realizing, as one must, that only a vague and general outline is traditionally given in opening speeches, I must say that I am somewhat disappointed at one or two omissions from the Speech. I believe that even as the Constitution stands at present the Government would have done well to indicate their intention to propose an amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in one or two directions. I think there is no occasion to wait for an amendment of the Constitution in order to extend the scope of that Act. When the Conservative forces were predominant in this Parliament, our party found it impossible to pass into law such an Arbitration Act as they desired, and by reason of the then, strength of Conservatism, provisions were included in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act restricting its operation. Those provisions should be removed without any delay. One of them prevents preference being given to unions whose rules provide for political action. It has become obvious to members of any and every political party that politics are indissolubly bound up with the Labour movement, and that industrial and political action are part and parcel of the same movement. It is of no use now for Conservatism to try to prevent the rightful concession of preference to unionists on the plea that unions undertaking political action should not be treated in the same way as the old unions that held aloof from politics. There is one union in the Commonwealth which has exercised possibly a greater influence on politics in Australia than any other half-dozen. </para>

                            <para>- I allude to the Australian Workers' Union, to which I have had the honour and privilege of belonging during the whole twenty-four years of its existence. That union three years ago secured an award from the Federal Arbitration Court which meant an addition to the wages paid to the workers of the Commonwealth of something like £250,000 per annum. But because the union has specifically laid down as a part of its constitutional rules that it intends to secure social justice by political as well as other means, and its rules permit an expenditure at the rate of is. per member per annum in aiding the return of Labour candidates to Parliament, it is disqualified from securing preference for its members, however well qualified they are in other respects. </para>

                            <para>- No, it is still registered. The union that withdrew was, I believe, the Machine Shearers Union. That was .the bogus Shearers Union established by a conspiracy amongst the pastoralists - the politico-industrial' tool intended to burst up the genuine union, the strike-breaking organization fostered and established by the pastoralists' money. That organization withdrew its registration, not because it had anything to do with politics, but because it would have been compelled to show a balance-sheet, and that it dare not do, the greater part of its money consisting of a subsidy from the Pastoralists Union. It dared not show its books, because, if it did, its bogus nature would have been exposed to the world. Even such a political opponent of ours as the present High Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, publicly admitted that the Machine Shearers Union was a bogus concern and a disgrace to those associated with the Pastoralists Union, who fostered and helped to build up that organization. That was the body that withdrew from registration. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. There is the Pastoralists Union's history, but mine is the true one, and is based upon the facts that have been elicited. I complain that there is no reference in the Governor-General's Speech to any intention on the part of the Government to submit an amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to repeal the foolish disqualification to which I have referred. Every union worthy of the name takes an active part in politics to-day. Politics touch the life of the community in every direction, and it is practically impossible for any industrial organization, whose members suffer as they do from evils  created by past legislation, to abstain from active political work. Now that we have a majority in both Houses of the Federal Parliament, we should deal with this matter without delay. Another restriction which exists under the present law, and which was proposed by the strength of Conservatism in these Chambers a few years ago, is that preventing the employes in the agricultural, horticultural, and viticultural industries from registering their unions under the Act. It was supposed - and that was the only reason which I have ever heard advanced - that these industries were, to some extent, dependent for their markets on the ruling prices of the world, and not on local conditions. They were not to be subject to any laws regulating the rates of wages or the conditions of labour. If .it is right that a union should exist in connexion with the pastoral industry, such as the Australian Workers Union, when pastoral products have to compete in the markets of the world, then what argument can be advanced  against  the wheat-grower or the grower of grapes not receiving the benefits of the Act? There is a union in the industry with which I am connected. There is a small struggling union of orchard employes; and I, as a small fruit-grower, can assert that there is no other industry in which the employes are worse treated as regards rates of pay and hours of labour. Yet, under that disqualification, if the Orchardists Union becomes federated all over the States, it will be unable to avail itself of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act. There is another body known as the Rural Workers Union, which intends to cover farming, harvesting, and all that sort of work ; but it is precluded from registering under the Act. I think that the Government, in view of the fact that all these persons connected with unions are the most active Labour supporters, should lose no time in bringing in a short Bill to remove the disqualification. It will not involve any complicated work, as the object is simply to remove restrictions which our Conservative opponents succeeded in placing in the Act a few years ago, and which did a great deal to impair its usefulness. But in regard to the general question the proposal to take two referenda as soon as possible is one which meets with my heartiest approval ; and which, I believe, will be indorsed by every well-wisher of the movement throughout Australia. I do not wish to wait for three years to get an amendment of the </para>

I am entirely at one with those who believe that no general revision of the Tariff should be attempted until we are absolutely sure of obtaining all the benefits which can be secured by the system roughly known as new Protection. It would be a suicidal policy to grant further concessions to manufacturers until we have got them sufficiently under the whip, to see that those advantages are distributed throughout the whole community, and their employes guaranteed fair wages. </para>

                            <para>- There is a big difference. What the honorable senator would regard as having an industry under the whip would be having it in such a position that it could be crushed. My contention is that when an industry like the agricultural harvester industry gets all the advantages which it is possible to obtain from the Tariff, and refuses to give to the employes what they have a right to receive, and what a Judge of the Arbitration Court  awarded  them, it would be the utmost folly to do anything to assist either that or any other manufacturing industry by further benefits under the Tariff until we have first obtained ample power to insure that both employes and the general public shall get their share of those further benefits. </para>

You would soon  bring that unscrupulous class of persons to their senses if you acted in that way to one or two "industries ; and even if. incidentally, you inflicted some loss of employment upon those whom they had attempted to rob, the sum total of the good which would be effected would be much greater than the suffering which would be occasioned. When we cannot get all the good which we want, then, as a matter of common sense, we get the greatest good for the greatest number. 'Evidently, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> thinks that the old Protection is so effective that it is better to have that assistance than to wait for the new Protection. He believes that that will help to build up industries and find men employment. Well, I think so little of the good to be effected by fiscal changes that I do not even attach any marvellous importance to the new Protection. I do not think that any industrial salvation can be expected from mere fiscal changes. </para>

                            <para>-  I am not going to say a word on that point now, but when, twenty years ago, I was beseeched by one party ito become a Protectionist and by another party to become a Single Taxer, I refused to join either party, because I was then, as I am still, a Socialist. I believed that in Socialism lay the only true remedy for these evils. That being so, I think that any great amount of energy spent in obtaining the sort of doubtful benefits which may flow from fiscal reform would be better spent in attacking what we really believe to be at the root of our troubles, and that is a monopoly of wealth by a few, and the practical wage slavery of the many. However, I have no doubt that the proposed referenda will, if submitted to the people within twelve months, be carried by a huge majority. I think that the people generally are anxious that Parliament should not be fettered in carrying out those laws which the Constitution at present gives it some power to enact. The average man in the street sees no reason why there should be permission given in the Constitution to establish an Arbitration Court to deal with the prevention and settlement of disputes extending over more than one State, and a whole army of lawyers be almost continuously engaged in trying to prove that this or that particular matter is not within the jurisdiction of the Court. The majority of people, while they are foolish enough to allow themselves to be humbugged, do not like to be humbugged, and do not wish- the Constitution to put them in that position. They want to see equal justice extended to employers and employes so far as any tribunal can do that. I believe that throughout the whole industrial ranks there is a desire that the Arbitration Court should be clothed with sufficient powers to enable it to deal with any cases of industrial disputes which extend beyond the limits of a State. I go further than that;- I believe that the majority of the unions would like to have the right to appeal from their own little narrow industrial tribunals to what they would naturally regard as the most just, fair, and broad-minded tribunal established in the Commonwealth. </para>

It was only by agreement between the States and the Commonwealth that the Inter-State Commission was to have any power to deal with the matters. </para>

                            <para>- In pre-Federal days all the States would admit that legislation on a certain principle was necessary. But when it came to a question of getting down to business it was practically impossible to get them to act in a uniform way. It was a most cumbrous, round-about system o'f circumlocution. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and his colleagues proposed the creation of an Inter-State Commission as a Court of Appeal from wages boards they knew that it was only a bit of political piffle. Let us go straight to the root of the evil and say that the people want power to settle industrial disputes by means of the Arbitration Court ; let _ us put it beyond the power of the High Court to declare anything unconstitutional by so broadening the Constitution that the former will possess those powers beyond dispute. </para>

                            <para>- If we can amend the Constitution in such a way as to give power to the Arbitration Court where power does not now exist, or is doubtful to that extent, it will remove those matters from the jurisdiction of the High Court. That is all that we contend for. We want to give the High Court less to do by making the powers of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court broader. During the late campaign I frequently heard the question of the High Court raised. One of the Senate candidates made a. great song about his proposal to alter its constitution. Whilst that may be a very difficult thing to do, yet it seems to me that to widen the powers of the Federation is to that extent to restrict the power of the High Court to interfere with the will of the people as expressed through the Federation. Apparently the High Court, owing to the narrow construction which it places on the Constitution, is the last refuge of the reactionary forces in the Commonwealth. I am not going to be one of those who are slaves to precedent; and only so far as the rules of this Senate compel me will t pay respect to the High Court when I think it is wrong. I do not believe in erecting idols and worshipping them. The High Court is purely the creation of the Commonwealth Constitution, and if we find that it is in the road, we shall have to modify its powers, or sweep it out of existence. </para>

                            <para>- Straight to the mark every time ! While we have a Federal system, it is probably necessary to have some such body to interpret the Constitution and determine what powers are vested in the Commonwealth, and what remain in the hands of the States. I can easily comprehend the purpose and reason for the existence of such a body. But if we have given the High Court too much power, and have given the Federal Parliament too little, the obvious way of restricting the present obstructive and restrictive tactics of the High. Court is to widen the powers of the Federal Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- The High Court has become the last refuge of the reactionary forces of the Commonwealth, and the hope of the Tories, of whose doctrines my honorable friend is recognised as a leading exponent. In regard to the nationalization of monopolies, I was asked to define what a monopoly is. I do not profess to be an encyclopaedia, or even a dictionary ; but whilst it may not be easy to give a definition, I am satisfied that honorable senators know very well what a monopoly is. Take the word " genius." While there are some who are incontestably worthy of being called men of genius, yet there has never been a definition of that word which has given general satisfaction. Similarly, although we may know a thing to be a monopoly, and may feel the evil effects of it, yet we may be unable to give an exact definition of the word we use to describe it. I contend that wherever any industry requires such a large amount of capital to make it successful that only a few individuals or firms can possibly undertake it, that industry becomes a monopoly. Where a few firms only undertake any industry, combination among them is easy. Indeed', it is practically impossible to prevent combination by any legislation which we may pass. We may have honorable or dishonorable understandings between men and firms; but when only a few of them are engaged in any business, or are conducting any public service or utility, the experience ot the world is that in such instances the natural tendency is for them to combine for their own advantage, irrespective of the well-being of the community they are serving. </para>

                            <para>- I never said anything of the kind. I spoke of " preference to unionists," but that does not in any way mean monopoly to unionists. I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> say a little while ago that he believed in every one getting a square deal. We contend - and, I urge, for reasons that cannot be refuted - that those who, by their energy, by their sacrifice, and by their time and money, build up unions, are more entitled to whatever benefit springs from such combinations than are those who, by staying outside the unions, not only limit their power from the commencement, but render active assistance to the employers in breaking them up. </para>

To propose, therefore, that those .who have been a hindrance to the triumph of the unions - those who, either through ignorance or through the love of petty personal gain for the time being, have been willing to throw over their fellow men - are to be placed on an equality with those who have worked and sacrificed to establish unions, is to propose more than, I am certain, the honorable senator himself would be willing to grant in circumstances affecting himself. </para>

If an employer who is personally adverse to a union finds that no obligation is cast upon him by agreement or by legislation to give a preference to unionists, and if his desire be to burst up the union, then, other things being equal, he will give a preference in employment to non-unionists. Thus, a premium is offered to those who are seeking to break up those organizations. The newspaper press, which opposes us, and voices the views of my honorable friend opposite- </para>

                            <para>- It is a testimony to the wide-spread circulation of the honorable senator's views, that I have obtained a knowledge of them. These persons are continually stating that, if preference to unionists be granted, a number of men who are not members of the unions will be starved. What does that statement amount to ? It amounts to saying that there is not enough work to go round amongst all the persons in the industry in question ; and that, therefore, if a preference be given to unionists, there will be a balance of employes who will have no work to do. Suppose that no preference were given, and that unionists and non-unionists were employed indiscriminately. Suppose there were 10,000 men looking for work in a particular industry, and that it could not employ more than 9,000; it would follow that 1,000 men would either starve for want of work, or would have to seek other employment. Whether the 9,000 who were employed  were i unionists or otherwise, there would still be 1,000 who would have no work. Therefore, those who say that preference to unionists means the starvation of non-unionists, make a false deduction. In so doing, they really launch an impeachment of present industrial system ; because, in any case, there would be a number of persons out of employment who would be left to starve or battle for casual work' for a crus It is, </para>

                    <para class="block">I repeat, an impeachment of the whole system, and bears out entirely what ad vanced Labourites have always preached," that so long as production is conducted for profit only and not for use, so long as our present iniquitous commercial system continues, unionism is absolutely necessary, or wages will be reduced to a mere subsistence level. It is only that surplus labour under our present system that enables the employers to compete one against another, and causes dissension between unionists and non-unionists. Without prolonging the debate unduly, I should like to say a word or two as to the financial policy of the Government. Nothing gave me greater pleasure than the announcement in the Governor - General's Speech that the Naval Loan Bill is to be repealed. I have heard it stated that the Commonwealth Labour party has not, at any time, pronounced absolutely against borrowing ; but simply wishes to restrict borrowing. I have heard the present Prime Minister, and other leading members of the party, say that they strenuously object to making the Commonwealth a seventh borrower while the States are indulging in the system of unrestricted borrowing; and that, until the States debts are consolidated, or some arrangement is made to limit and control the borrowing powers of the States, they view almost with horror the idea of the Commonwealth going into the money market. I may say at once, if that be the common idea, that I am absolutely opposed to borrowing altogether. I have frequently been faced with this question, which the questioner generally thought to be a poser which could' not be answered: " If you can borrow at a certain percentage, and invest that money in such a way as to make 3, 5, or 10 per cent, out of it, would you not be foolish to decline to borrow ? And, if that be the case in regard to an individual, is not it equally the case in regard to a Government?" My contention is that there is no analogy whatever between a private individual and a community or nation. If an individual finds that he can borrow at  6  per cent., and earn  8  or 10 per cent, with the money, it is perfectly legitimate for him to borrow, under present-day conditions. It may be his only way of making any money. If a man wants to extend his business operations, and there is no other way of increasing his capital than by borrowing, he is justified in doing so. But a nation is in an entirely different position. A private individual or a firm does not possess the taxing power by which a nation can raise the money necessary for carrying on its transactions. Consequently, a nation can do very many things without borrowing at all. My contention is that borrowing not only leads to a profligate and spendthrift policy, but also to taxing the poor for the benefit of the rich. I want to do the reverse. Any community which borrows for other than emergencies is simply assisting an idle class to live upon the interest which is drawn from the sweat and blood of the workers. So far as we can abstain from borrowing, we shall be helping a vast majority of the people. The total debt of the States is over ^250,000,000. The public debt of New South Wales exceeds ^90,000,000, and every year New South Wales pays by way of interest approximately j£3, 250,000. Let us consider for a moment what an enormous proportion of the total revenue derived from legitimate forms of taxation has annually to be paid away in interest upon our indebtedness. Let us consider the increasing percentage of revenue, which, as our public indebtedness grows, must be paid away as interest upon past liabilities. Let us reflect for a moment upon how public work after public work has been undertaken, how it has served its purpose, how it has been replaced by another work without the original loan ever having been liquidated, and how a fresh loan has been contracted to pay for its replacement. Yet this is the sort of thing in which our alleged statesmen have been revelling for generations. If we consider the position, we shall find that the persons who are living upon the interest which we pay, and who comprise a large portion of the moneyed and leisured classes of Great Britain, are just as truly living upon the workers of this country as are the individuals who derive a profit from gambling, or from any other source without working for it. The statement that we have had the benefit of the money thus borrowed is an absolute fallacy. As a matter of fact, the total amount which we have received represents only a small percentage of the sum borrowed. If we take into consideration underwriters' charges and other incidental expenses, it will be found that we have obtained only a very small proportion of the money which we are supposed to have borrowed. Time will not permit me to deal with this question exhaustively, but even those who do not share my own views upon it must admit that above all things we ought to pay spot cash for the defence of our country. We talk about an Australian Navy. I hold in my hand a copy of a proclamation forbidding the <inline font-style="italic">Cerberus</inline> to fire salutes in the future to visiting men of war for fear she should break up. I suppose that we have all heard of the boat on the American River which could only whistle when she slopped. In other words, she could not whistle and steam at the same time. It seems to me that the <inline font-style="italic">Cerberus</inline> occupies very much the same position. If she fires a salute, she will probably damage herself. </para>

                            <para>- The proclamation in question is dated 27th April, 1910, so that it was issued subsequent to the recent general elections. Apparently, it was a sort of dying kick by the late Administration. Fancy borrowing money with which to build a Navy composed of vessels of that class - ships which dare not fire a salute for fear of sinking themselves instead of the enemy. We all know that in consequence of the improvements which are constantly being made in warships, vessels of the most approved type now become obsolete in a few years. Consequently, to borrow money in times of peace for the purpose of constructing vessels which cannot have a lifetime of more than ten or twelve years would be the most spendthrift policy imaginable. If we regard defence as a form of national insurance, we ought surely to be prepared to pay the premiums upon that insurance year by year as they fall due. In that respect, I trust that the policy of the Government will be steadfastly upheld, and that in the future no party will go back upon it. I have no desire to traverse the whole of the Governor-General's Speech, but I do hope that at an early date the Ministry will afford the Parliament an opportunity of remedying a serious defect in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Honorable senators are doubtless aware that under a recent decision of the High Court that statute has been placed in further jeopardy. At the present moment, a big case, which must shortly come before the Arbitration Court, is pending. It must come before that tribunal within a few weeks, and I contend that in the interim this Parliament ought so to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act as to place the Court in a position to know definitely whether or not it is entitled to grant a preference to Unionists. The Australian Workers Union is the industrial body interested in that case and it is now going through the necessary legal formalities prior to its claim reaching the Arbitration Court. I submit that the law should be so clarified or extended as to enable that tribunal to know exactly what are its powers in such cases, so that a union will not be put to vast expense in upholding its claim after an award has been made. Whilst unions have been penalized for striking on the ground that they have been afforded a lawful and expeditious method of settling their industrial disputes without resort to that barbarous weapon, they have, in reality, been, giver* only a stone when they asked for bread. After expending a large portion of their funds in attempting to secure, a judicial settlement of their disputes, after bringing incontestable evidence of the justice of their claims, and after being granted a measure of relief by the Arbitration Court, they have been robbed of the fruits of their victory upon pure technicalities. It will be a standing disgrace to the Ministry if they permit such a state of things to continue a moment longer than is unavoidable. We know that the Government are in entire sympathy with the aims and ideals of industrial union. But it is not sufficient for them to be sympathetic with those aims and ideals. They must utilize the machinery which is at their command for the purpose of meting out justice to the workers. At the recent general elections, thousands of persons who are not connected with our organizations voted for Labour candidates. </para>

                            <para>- It is not. The honorable senator's knowledge of it may be new. But the fact is as old as is the Labour movement itself. Ever since the inception  of that movement, persons who are not connected with trade unions have been as welcome to join our political labour organizations as trade unionists themselves. When the Labour party was originated in New South Wales, in June, 1891 - the first Labour members were elected to the New South Wales Parliament in that year - the Labour organization which gave birth to that party was not composed exclusively of trade unionists. A body, which was then known as the Labour Electoral League, was formed, and it admitted freely to its ranks persons who had never been members of a trade union, provided that they subscribed to the principles laid down in its platform. Further, it has never prevented a member of any class from becoming a candidate for Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend says " Yes," but I say " No." We have a rule in our Labour leagues to the effect that if there is a union in the occupation followed by a man who desires to be a Labour candidate, he must be a  member  of that union before he can be selected. Some industrial unions do not permit a man to continue his membership when he ceases to follow the occupation of the union. I think the coal miners take that stand. </para>

                            <para>- Just so ; he could not then remain a member of the Typographical Association. But if he became a member of a Labour league he would be eligible for selection as a Labour candidate. It is only when a man can by the rules of a union belong to it, and refuses to do so, that he is disqualified from being a Labour candidate. I think we should be very inconsistent if we did not have a rule to that effect. </para>

                            <para>- I think the honorable senator will find that I am right in what I have stated, and that if I am not I ought to be. If what I have stated were not the rule, I should propose it at the next conference I attended; but I know that we carried such a rule some three or four years ago. I wish now to say a word or two about the Federal Capital. During a campaign that extended over a good many months, I do not recollect that 1 was once asked whether I was in favour of Yass-Canberra or Dalgety. Once or twice I was asked in a general way what I thought about the Federal Capital, and my answer was That what seemed to me of infinitely greater importance than the site to be chosen was that we should secure a provision that not one inch of the Federal Territory should ever be sold. I held that to keep the freehold of the Federal Territory as an eternal  heritage for the Australian people was of infinitely more importance than the exact location of the Capital. </para>

                            <para>- No, but I have been in the locality. I do not know the exact site. I was in the district when there was no idea that it would ultimately be the site of the Federal Capital. I was also at Dalgety in the good old days, when it was known as Buckley's Crossing, and there was certainly no idea then that it would ever be the site of the Federal Capital. Honorable senators will agree with me that a man travelling through those districts as I did would not observe them in the way in which he would do if he understood that they were likely to be selected for the site of the Federal Capital. I have not now a clear recollection of the nature of the country I saw at Dalgety or in the neighbourhood of Yass-Canberra. If the matter has not already been settled by mere administrative action, and if there is to be any reconsideration of the question in this Chamber at all. I believe that an opportunity should be afforded honorable senators who have not seen the two sites to visit them. I cannot see how one could pass a fair and impartial judgment upon them otherwise. So far as it can be determined by mere observation, my mind is at present quite open as to the special advantages or disadvantages of either of the sites that have been suggested, and in considering the matter on broader grounds as to whether Yass-Canberra is too near Sydney and Dalgety too near Melbourne, I can promise that I shall take no parochial view of the question. Personally, I believe that the further we get away from Sydney, without getting too near Melbourne, the better, and it would be well if we could secure a suitable site about equi-distant between those two cities. If a suitable site could be found away up in the Northern Territory, I think that is where I should like to see the Federal Capital established. Man is by nature better fitted to inhabit the </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that they cannot. The honorable senator misunderstands me. I may read half-a-dozen reports, and amongst them one that is unbiased, but what test can I subject them to in order to learn which is the unbiased report? Unless a man has visited the sites he is not competent to judge whether any report upon them is unbiased. When I have visited the sites, and have looked into the facts and figures, I shall be able to say whether I think a case has been made out for one site or the other. My predilections have been in favour of Dalgety, on account of the superior quality and volume of the water available in the Snowy River. It' is possible that an ample supply of water may be obtainable from the Cotter and Molonglo Rivers. </para>

                            <para>- Even my brother Labourite, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, cannot convince me of that until I see it for myself. I have always been of a sceptical nature, and require to be convinced by the evidence of my senses. I cannot take even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> "Russell's absolute pronouncement in this matter. I want to know the cost which will be involved in constructing a railway from the proposed site at Yass-Canberra to Jervis Bay. I wish to know, also, whether the agreement to cede the territory to the Commonwealth can be amended or modified to provide that the Commonwealth shall have not merely occupation rights, but sovereign rights, over the strip of country on which the railway is to be constructed, and over the land to be ceded at Jervis Bay. Though not a lawyer, I- understand that there is a great difference between having possession of, or the right to occupy, land and having* sovereign rights over it. If, as I understand, the Commonwealth is merely to have the right to occupy the land on which the railway from the capital to Jervis Bay is to be constructed and the area ceded at Jervis Bay, that will not suit me. I desire that the Commonwealth shall have absolutely unassailable sovereign rights over not only the Federal Territory in which the Capita'l is established, .but also over the area at Jervis Bay and over the strip of land connecting the bay with the Capital. Furthermore, I want the proposed Federal Territory to be enlarged until it embraces the watersheds of the rivers supplying the Capital. I should be content to accept nothing less than that for Yass-Canberra, Dalgety, or any other site. The Commonwealth Government should not be placed in the position of having to depend upon the goodwill or charity of any more or less cantankerous State Premier to be assured that the water supply of the Federal Capital will be conserved, and will not be polluted or otherwise interfered with. The watershed of the rivers supplying the Capital must be under the absolute sovereignty of the Commonwealth. Any honorable senator who read the press comments, especially in New South Wales, about what that State is called upon to give away will know the tremendous outcry that was raised against the area of land asked for. It is provided in the Constitution that the area ceded for the purposes of the Federal Capital shall not be less than  100  square miles. The Sydney newspapers in particular interpreted that to mean that it should not be more than  200  square miles. They contended that in good faith the provision with respect to  too  square miles meant from 100 square miles to  200  square miles, and that the State was extravagantly generous in conceding  900  square miles for the Federal Territory. I ask honorable senators to reflect for a moment that New South Wales has an area of  310,000  square miles. An area of  1,000  square miles or of  5,000  square miles deducted from the total area of the State would amount to practically nothing. </para>

                            <para>- I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is aware of some cattle runs in the State from which he comes having a greater area than the proposed Federal Territory. I think that if the Government of a State, possessing an area of  310,000  square miles, could not spare the odd  10,000  square miles for the purpose of a Federal Territory without making a song about it, they must be pretty mean. When those who are opposed to granting so large an area denounce Dalgety as a barren worthless land, and at the same time raise an outcry against the extortionate demands of the Commonwealth, the one assertion disproves the other. If the land is so barren and worthless as they represent, why should they object to part with it? I believe that a majority in each House is in favour of preserving the land to the people, never to be parted with to the land speculator. If that is so, why should we not have a sufficiently large area to secure the whole of the unearned increment for the Commonwealth, and not allow the speculator to come within coo-ee of our Capital? I look upon this as a very important question. When, some few years ago, the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> of Sydney stated, as though it was an unpardonable crime to even think of it, that the desire for a large area was in order that a Labour majority, when it got hold of the Parliament, might conduct socialistic experiments, I cheerfully admitted that that was my object. I  want to see socialistic experiments carried on, in fact, I want to see any experiments carried on which will demonstrate the inherent rottenness of the present system. But land ownership is not an experiment. It is as simple as A. B. C The Duke of Westminster, in London, by simply holding on to some lands which may have been swamps when his ancestors got possession of them, can reap enormous fortunes ; and a man does not need to possess intellect above that of an idiot to hold land once it has been acquired. We know very well that if the Commonwealth retains the ownership, the land in the Federal Territory is bound to grow in value. Most capitals in this world have grown up, more or less, by accident. As to very few towns have we had the advantage of knowing beforehand that they were going to become large or great. In Australia, inland anyway, the beginning of an ordinary town has been a public-house established alongside a crossing over a river or creek, a blacksmith, and other persons following the publican, until, by-and-by, a village has grown up. This has become, in time, a town, or even a big city. In the case of the Federal Capital, however, we know beforehand that some millions will be required to build the necessary official buildings. The head-quarters of the Departments, the Governor-General's residence, the Houses of Parliament, and other works of a durable and important character, will involve an enormous expenditure, extending over a long period of years. Is it not certain, therefore, that those who will have to minister to the wants of the men engaged in the building operations, not to speak of the Legislature, and the Civil Service, will constitute a large subsidiary population, so to speak, whose presence is bound to give an improved value to the Commonwealth lands? Nothing seems clearer than that, if we retain the lands, all this talk about the vast expense of a bush Capital will fall to the ground ; because the enhanced values will absolutely cover the cost of constructing buildings and laying out the 'site. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator can get a sufficient majority to knock out the exemption, I suppose that he will be able to occupy this side. I am now dealing with the argument that the establishment of a bush Capital would be an unnecessary drain on our resources. If we established a permanent Capital within an existing metropolitan area, it would cost infinitely more than it will cost to erect a Capital in the bush. We should require to put up fresh buildings, and the value of the sites would far exceed the cost of establishing a new Capital on Federal Territory.-. I rejoice very much that, owing to the State I represent - in a very narrow spirit, I thought at the time - trying to make a grab for the Capital, and not leaving it an open question, as a checkmate to the effort to drag it to Sydney, the other members of the Convention, in consenting to the Capital being established in New South Wales, made the condition that it should not be established within 100 miles of Sydney. I hold that it would be a fatal mistake to have our Capital in a coastal city, or even to have it in an existing town. It should be established in what is at present uninhabited territory, so that the growing land values shall belong to those who make  them, and shall not be the property of the speculator. I have spoken at much greater length than I had intended. I- trust that the programme which has been placed before Parliament, certainly in a very vague and general way, so far as the Speech is concerned, will be carried into effect without delay. I feel certain that honorable senators opposite will not oppose in an obstructive way the measures which will Be submitted. Not only are there very few of those honorable senators now, but we have knocked most of the fight out of them, and as practically every one of the leading proposals of the Government has received the indorsement of a huge majority of the people, they, for the sake of their own political skins three years hence, will shrink from putting up much, of a fight against any one of the measures, and, in a general way, they do not seem much inclined to obstruct. I want them to realize, however, that we shall attempt to capture the remaining seats at the next election. As they know that no mercy will then be extended to them, they will, of course, be quite within their rights in fighting us here. I hope that whilst this programme, which, generally speaking, I support, will be carried into law, it will only be the forerunner of much bigger things. Instead of looking upon it as an extreme one, I marvel at its moderation. I think that if there is one fault which can be found by the electors who returned us with such a sweeping majority, it is at our not grasping at a great deal more. I trust that the Senate, which, by force of circumstances, is put in a kind of subordinate position to the other House, will assert itself, and prove in the future to be the more democratic and advanced Chamber of the two. </para>

                            <para>- No. I believe there might have been a bit more pressure applied in Western Australia. I give my honorable friends from that State every credit for resisting to the extent which they did.- Of course, those who proposed to make the payment for twenty-five years consider that a payment for ten years is a very moderate instalment. Others consider that, in all probability, whatever party may be in power five or six years hence it will be compelled to review the situation. It is not a question on which there should be a great party clamour. It is a question of what we shall be able to do with the money which we have, in view of the obligations which we have to meet. I have a very great doubt, as I should have even if I were in favour of giving the States <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> per head for  100  years, as to whether we shall be able to pay them even the  25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> five or six years hence. In my opinion, the proposal to place the Financial Agreement in the Constitution was one of the most shameful conspiracies against the liberties of the people which have ever been entered into by a party. I know that, whilst some may have honestly believed in the. agreement, the vast majority of those who advocated it did not believe in it. They knew that they had foresworn their consciences and thrown their principles overboard in order to secure office. And that was the only object which they had in view in presenting such a shameful contract. </para>

                            <para>- The greatest of all the States - New South Wales - rejected the agreement, and so did Victoria and South Australia. I believe that a majority of the electors did not very clearly understand the question, and that the Fusionists did their best to fog them. We know that very many of the Fusionists argued that the matter could be much more easily adjusted if the agreement were put in the Constitution than it could if the payment were fixed for ten years. They said, if it were put in the Constitution, it would not be in for long, because it could be taken out by merely passing a law. But if the Labour party's attitude were adopted, and the agreement were made for ten years, the people would put the States in a much tighter corner. In the next breath, prominent statesmen like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Waddell</inline> would say that the only security which the States could get from putting the agreement in the Constitution was that it could not be taken out readily. We know that electors who do not make a study of these complicated financial questions were fogged. One of the charges made against the Fusionist politicians is that they humbugged the people and caused them to feel so confused that they did not know how to vote. </para>

                            <para>- It does not tie me. up at all, because if the people had had three years more in which to consider the subject they would have defeated the Fusion party by ninety to one. They would have had a bigger beating the longer they waited for it; but we gave them such a thrashing at the last election that we need not bother about giving them a bigger one till three years hence. Undoubtedly we shall then. Many candidates urged that the Financial Agreement should be made to operate for ten years. Some of the members of the present Government advocated that term. But many of us made no such promise. My objection is not to giving to the States whatever can be spared after providing for national necessities ; but my extreme fear is that it will be impossible to pay the amount proposed for more than five or six years at the outside. I should like to allude to one little departure that has been made by the presiding officers of both Houses of the Federal Legislature. They have discarded the wearing of the wig and gown. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that both statements are true. I do not think that " clothes make the man," and I consider that if any institution representing the people is to carry the respect and esteem of the country it should do so on its merits. I do not believe that the real dignity of any office is assisted by the wearing of horsehair or millinery of any description.. If an official, shows that firmness, tact, and ability, in the performance of the duties of his office, which are necessary, his conduct will win that respect and esteem of which he is deserving. If he is not deserving of it all the horsehair and millinery in creation will not cause him to be respected. </para>

If the rules of the Senate did not forbid me, and it was more comfortable to do so, I should be happy to come here with my coat off. On one occasion at a public dinner, when the weather was very hot, I did peel off my coat. There were no standing orders there. Others did not follow my example, but that did not matter. I think there should be the utmost freedom in these things. </para>

                            <para>- The party to which the honorable senator belongs is not attending much to business at present, anyhow. He is the only representative of it present.' Even he is going out. It is something like a triumph for me to drive the last enemy from the ramparts. The discarding of the wig and gown by the  President  and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is a step in the right direction. In the past we have paid too much respect to frills and furbelows, and have not paid sufficient regard to the real worth behind them. What has been done marks a distinct advance. Some people are too much in the habit of creating idols and then bowing down to them. For my own part, I believe that the more simplicity is displayed in the conduct of our business the more effectual will be the results. I should like, before concluding, to refer to some of the arguments used in reference to the proposed Commonwealth note issue. It has been said that the Labour party is against borrowing, and yet that we are really securing a forced loan of some £3,000,000 or £4,000,000. The Government scheme provides for keeping 25 per cent, of the amount of the note issue in gold, and additional security will be provided by Treasury-bills being prepared and kept ready for issue at any moment to cover the whole of the notes issued. That has deprived our opponents of the cry they raised about a wild-cat scheme in imitation of those South American republics which have indulged in a debased paper currency. Our opponents being deprived of the charge that the Labour party are going to debase the currency, it is now said that the Federal note issue is in the nature of a forced loan. In another Chamber an eminent financial authority, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> Smith, used that argument. </para>

                            <para>- I thought I might be treading on forbidden ground. Now I know it. However, a member of another place - it may have been in Kamschatka - stated that the Labour party were about to issue a forced loan, in spite of the fact that we professed to be against borrowing. But I take it that the reason why we are against borrowing is because it loads the public with a burden of interest. If we could get loans for nothing I should not be opposed to borrowing. Personally, I should have no hesitation in raising a loan for a considerable amount if there was no interest to pay. </para>

                            <para>- I should not mind paying back the principal if I had no interest charge to bear. The objection to loans, from a national point of view, is the burden of interest that they carry. I take it that if  75  per cent, or  70  per cent, of the note issue that is not kept as a reserve fund is at the disposal of the Federal Treasurer, he will not only have that sum without interest, but he will have a loan which will never require repayment. A loan that does not require redemption is practically a gift. If the banks have to deposit a sovereign for each note issued, and if the total amount of the deposit leaves a margin after providing a reserve of some  ,£4,000,000  or  £5,000,000,  and the notes have to be constantly renewed, it follows that the Commonwealth will get that sum free, and will be able to spend it for public purposes. That is far higher finance than the kind which consists in going to the money-lenders of Great Britain for a loan. It seems to me that this note issue is a preliminary to the establishment of a Commonwealth bank. I recognise, however, that that will be a much more delicate matter, and will require very careful consideration. Still, however, I see nothing whatever to prevent the Commonwealth from managing a bank just as wisely and as prudently as such an institution can be managed at present by private individuals. We are continually told that in the Public Service every one is simply trying to get through his day's work with the least possible exertion, that the Government stroke prevails, and that if a Government bank were established those responsible for it would consider it immaterial whether they made a good investment or a bad one. Those who hold that opinion know very little about our Government officers. I venture to say that in the Government Departments there are some of the most honest, capable, and energetic men in the country. Many of them regard their work as their principal interest in life, and devote far more time to it than is required under the rules of the Service. I know of men of the highest calibre who have broken down in health through enthusiastic devotion to their work. They regard it as far more than the means of earning a livelihood. It is a mistake to suppose that the shareholders in joint stock banks know more about the business of banking than do the ordinary members of the public. A man who invests his money in the stock of a private enterprise bank has to trust to expert ability for the efficient management of the institution. He- has to trust to men who hold salaried positions to use his money wisely. There is no reason why men who are paid to do the banking business of a Government should not discharge their duties as efficiently as do those who are paid to transact the business of a joint stock bank. There is no reason why a Commonwealth bank should not be as efficiently managed as is any bank in the country at present. If a private banking company can obtain the services of a good managing director, a Commonwealth institution can do the same thing whenever the time is ripe to launch this scheme. I confess that there is one disadvantage from which the State suffers, namely, that too often those in authority place too low an estimate upon the market value of the labours of those whom they employ. The manager of a great public Department is frequently paid for his services so very much less than is paid by private enterprise for the performance of similar duties, that he relinquishes State employment for private employment. But if we are prepared to pay the true market value for a man's services, we shall be able to secure the very best talent available to manage an institution of this kind. I trust, therefore, that, whilst the utmost care will be exercised in framing a measure of this character, no time will be lost in initiating this desirable reform. I believe that if we once break down the land monopoly on the one hand, and the money monopoly on the other, we shall be in a fair way to secure to the whole community those social powers which are necessary for its effective government and economic management. It appears to me that a great many men - even some of the members of my own party - have been rather reluctant to confess themselves Socialists. They nave been afraid that, to many persons, the word had such an evil significance that such a confession would imperil their political existence. I contend that the trend of events the whole world over is in the direction of Socialism. That trend is inevitable. Nothing can avert it, because it is the result of economic conditions. I hold that the Labour movement is the practical expression of so much of that Socialism as the community is ripe for. We are not attempting to injure any class, irrespective of whether they be land-owners or land users. We are not, as our opponents argue, a mere body of city unionists who are engaged in well organized and highly paid "trades - in short, we are not what has been contemptuously termed, a " Trades Hall party." But we are advocating principles which, if given effect to, will gradually result in the substitution of well ordered, collective action for the present chaotic, competitive system which satisfies nobody and impoverishes thousands. While, under that system, a few build up fortunes, and a few more occupy comfortable positions in life, the great body of the people - though not perhaps cast in that poverty which is prevalent <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> other countries - find no security in their position. They do not know from day to day, or month to month, whether or not the income which they are now deriving will be secured to them. No working man "knows what will become of his widow and helpless children, if his health breaks &lt;3own, or if death overtakes him. This insecurity and anxiety for the future are responsible for many premature deaths, and for a good deal of ill health. In other words, worry and work are very inequitably distributed at the present time. Our object is to. bring about a fairer distribution. We know that this can be accomplished only so far as the great body of electors are prepared to work with us, to understand the principles which we advocate, and to vote for them. For that reason, our party propose nothing of a " wild cat" character to revolutionize society. We propose only to introduce reforms which will pave the way for that collective organization of society in which one will help the other. Whether it be called Socialism or national cooperation, it is clearly a higher and more advanced stage of human development than that in which we live to-day. I trust that my efforts, and those of my colleagues, will help forward this movement, which - even if we opposed it - present-day economic conditions of themselves would inevitably bring about in the not distant future. </para>

                        <para>. - It is not my intention to prolong this debate, because I have always held the opinion that a discussion upon the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply has not very much to recommend it. Long before I entered Parliament, I expressed the view that the time occupied in debating this motion was merely so much "hot air," as they say in America, because whatever may be urged either for or against the different legislative proposals contained in the Governor-General's Speech must be repeated when those proposals subsequently come before us. Therefore, the time which is devoted to a discussion of this character might much more profitably be employed in dealing with the practical business of .the session. But on the present occasion, I recognise that there is even less excuse for debating the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, because usually it supplies honorable senators with an opportunity to have a tilt at their opponents. </para>

                            <para>- That is what I wish to know. My heart is in my boots when I look around the chamber - as I have done during the past few days - and notice the empty Opposition benches. After the battle, when the rival parties appear in Parliament, and we start to sum up the results of a general election, we begin to reflect how we got here, and how some of our comrades failed to do so. But on this occasion our opponents have been entirely vanquished. Talk about the fate of the Light Brigade ! There is only a slight resemblance between their fate and that of our opponents at the last election. Before proceeding further, I wish to congratulate you, sir, upon the very commendable stand that you have taken in discarding those emblems of mediaeval mysticism - the President's wig and gown. They have been handed down to us from the time when they were worn by the few - an insignificant few - to impress upon the vast majority a sense of their importance. I am very glad that you have blazed the pathway for other governing" bodies throughout the Commonwealth to follow, and that you have disregarded the beaten track which has been so long trodden by your predecessors. I only hope that the practice of discussing the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply will also be abolished. There are other innovations, I think, which might be introduced with very great advantage to this Parliament. We have all witnessed the opening of the Commonwealth Parliament at different times, and it appears to me that at that ceremony, the military part of our citizenship figures with undue prominence. I think that that feature might well be eliminated. There is no reason why this Parliament should not be opened in the sane, deliberate fashion that is observed in other countries. It would lose nothing in dignity, and its sphere of usefulness as a Legislature whose function it is to give expression to the will of the people, would be in no way impaired. Indeed, if it were opened with the simplicity which characterized the opening of the United States Congress some years ago, when  President  Jackson rode up to the Capitol upon his shaggy pony, hitched it, entered the Congress, opened it, remounted his shaggy pony and rode away, it would stand upon an equal plane with that body. There is no necessity for a military display at the opening of the Commonwealth Parliament. Personally, I have an innate horror of such spectacles, because my mind instinctively reverts to the time when I saw the red-coats used by a small and insignificant minority of the people for the purpose of crushing the majority- with a strong hand. When every effort was being made by a struggling people to rise from a position of degradation to a higher level, there was an unnecessary parade of militarism. </para>

                    <para class="block">Although I have no desire to waste time,, because I recognise that important work awaits us, I cannot close my eyes to the tactics which were adopted by some of the men who led that campaign against the Labour party. A gallant effort was made by the leaders of the Fusionist movement to divide the sheep from the goats - to bring; under their banner every- element in the political life of this country save that of the Labour party. But if we cast our minds back for a brief period, we shall remember that no great zeal was then displayed for the formation of only two political parties. I can recollect the time when the Labour party exercised very great influence in the New South Wales Parliament. While it was engaged in keeping in power there what was then regarded as the most progressive political party, politicians saw no necessity to bring about the two-party system of government. On the contrary, they found it very convenient to have the assistance of the Labour party. The clamour for the two-party system was due simply to the growing popularity of the Labour party. When, by dint of our efforts in the political field over a number of years, and with a powerful press against us, we had at length succeeded in reaching the popular ear, and in impressing upon the majority of the people a sense of the justice and wisdom of adopting the views we had taken so much trouble to place before them, our opponents recognised that we were steadily advancing in popularity, and it was then that they clamoured for the two-party system. It was then that we found brought into one fold men whose political opinions were as wide apart as the poles, and who were agreed only in their inveterate opposition to a Labour candidate. The Fusion candidates posed throughout the country as exemplars <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> politics as well as in society, but what did they do ? From my observations in one part of the Commonwealth, I noticed that they scarcely left anytHing of a shady character unsaid or undone to place themselves in a favorable light and to down their opponents. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and that is even too mild a term to describe the action of some of these exemplars of society. We found some of the men who had the cheek to put themselves forward in this way in the press resorting almost to the tactics of the gimlet brigade. They sent a photographer  around to take photographs of four-roomed houses occupied by Labour candidates, and exhibited these as affording a reason why the Labour party should not be supported. I grant that they omitted to "say whether there were mortgages on these four-roomed houses. They even went so far as to go to South Africa to secure a photograph of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chris.</inline> Watson with a Kaffir beside him. Perhaps we should be thankful for small mercies, and the wonder is that they did not pursue their policy of espionage still further. I wonder that they did not employ the gimblet  brigade to find out the internal arrangements of the four-roomed houses j to find out what the Labour candidates had for breakfast, and whether they slept between sheets. I wonder that they did not send out photographers to discover where Labour candidates got their meals. I begin to think that I may have had a happy escape, because after a trip in the country I have sometimes plunged a little, and have visited a shilling restaurant. I am  surprised  that my footsteps were not dogged by the agents of these people in order that a photograph might have been secured of a Labour candidate who bacl the audacity to patronize a shilling restaurant when there were plenty of sixpenny restaurants to which he might have gone. This does not exhaust my indictment of the tactics of the Fusion party at the last election. </para>

                        <para>The Labour party is trying hard to secure the support of the farmers, "but this shows what a leading Labourite thinks of them. 1 do not so much object to this as to the endeavour which was made throughout Western Australia to induce the farmers to  believe that this isolated expression ot opinion was a responsible utterance on behalf of the Labour party as a whole. To suggest that the Labour party would be unjust to the farming interest is certainly not in accordance with the facts. The pamphlet to which I have referred is signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clarke</inline> James, who was one of the principal agents of our opponents in Western Australia. It shows the extreme lengths to which they were prepared to go to misrepresent the attitude of the Labour party to the farming interest. I speak as a farmer, and I say that the farming interest has nothing to fear at the hands of the Labour party. Wherever our policy has received the remotest encouragement, the farmers, as a class, have been the direct  gainers. We can point to innumerable instances in South Australia where, as the  result of the modification of the policy <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> our opponents, through the pressure exercised by Labour members in the State Parliament, many benefits have been brought to the door of the farmer which he would not otherwise have received. The circulation of the statements of this member of the South Australian Labour party, which had not the indorsement of the party as a whole, did not complete the efforts of our" opponents in Western Australia. In another circular signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clarke</inline> James, the leading agent of the brigade responsible for the dissemination of these tarradiddles, I find the statement - </para>
                        <para>The policy of the Labour party is to starve the States, and if they had their way with the financial agreement our revenue from the Commonwealth would decrease as our population increases. 1 have analyzed the various proposals submitted to  this  Parliament during the last three or four years for the settlement of the financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth, but I have been unable to discover anything in the financial proposals of the Labour party to suggest that it is their policy to starve the States, o'.- that if their policy were carried out, it would have the effect of decreasing the returns to the States as their population increases. Such a statement of the effects of our policy is,- of course, at total variance with the facts, hut it was quite good enough to suit the book of our opponents in the Western State. They circulated these two " De  Rougemonts,"  because they are nothing else, with a view to render our party unpopular in the country. I recognise that political parlies do not always rigidly adhere to the truth in the prosecution of their campaign, and this is borne out in the document bearing the signature of our opponents, and professing to describe the effect of the financial policy of the Labour party as being calculated to starve the States, and to decrease their revenue as their population increases. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, but I feel that we are entitled to complain of the tactics resorted to by men who have been accustomed to claim that they alone can honorably conduct a political campaign. 1 should like to say that our Electoral Act requires amendment to provide for the exercise of a closer supervision of the expenses of candidates. We had evidence in the Western State that money was flowing from a central treasury in Perth to every small centre of population in a particular district of the State, expressly to forward the interests of Fusion candidates. We were puzzled to know where the money came from. We cannot understand where it came from. But from reports to hand from time to time, and especially from the admissions of the real actors in the play, we are at least entitled to assume, if not to decide, that the amounts which are specified in the Electoral Act were far exceeded in Western Australia. In touring the Swan division, I found, from the reports of friends, and sometimes of opponents, that an unlimited amount of capital was being expended in every small centre. When one arrived at a small place, the first person of any importance one would meet would be a representative of the Fusion party. In Bunbury, the only place which we are told can give birth to a Premier, £200 was expended, according to the best authority. I wish it to be understood that the opinions I am expressing are not my own, nor those of our supporters in the field, but the opinions which were held, with every justification, I believe, by our opponents. It was universally admitted in that centre that at least £200 was expended to advance the interests of the  Fusionist  candidate. Another gentleman whom I know very well was a travelling organizer, who confined his attention 10 the Swan electorate. He must have received at least £4 or £5 a week for a period of six or seven weeks. In the Newcastle district there was a gentleman who described himself as a Fusion agent. There was also a Fusion agent in Bridgetown, Mundijong,  Yaloop, Pin jelly,  and Albany. In various places throughout the Swan division there was a man stationed who, if he did not devote the whole of his time to electioneering, had little time left to apply to his own business. </para>

                            <para>- I have passed by the efforts of our vanquished opponents in the field of journalism. In addition to stationary agents in the Swan division we had a walking delegate on behalf of the Fusion named <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mills,</inline> who had stood as a candidate at the previous Federal election. He toured the whole of the southwestern portion of the State, and the natural presumption is that he did not do that for love of the work in which he was engaged. Of course, he indulged in his customary raillery against the Labour party, and his system of misrepresentation. Amongst the misrepresentations which I had the opportunity of charging him with was his statement that if the Labour party came into power, this Parliament would immediately impose an export duty on wheat. Honorable senators may imagine the effect which such a statement, coming from what had been hitherto a rather representative type of citizen, would have upon a gathering of farmers, meaning, as it did, that if our party came into power, their first effort would be to reduce the price of farm produce. </para>

                            <para>- This travelling agent of the Fusion in the Swan division was engaged, we  may feel assured, at a very respectable salary for a lengthy period, to set forth the position of the candidates who found him the cash, presumably; but above all to misrepresent, in a most gross and unfair way, the attitude of the Labour party towards the farming interest. I am glad that we have this chance of describing how the election campaign was conducted, and the unfair means which were resorted to by our opponents, in order to place the Labour party unfavorably in the eyes of the public. There were also lady  canvassers - four or five - who took a tour in that part of the constituency. The sum total of this financial effort was, according to my best calculations, that at least £480 was put up for the purpose of paying the officials in the employ of the Fusion party, and advancing their interest in that small part of Western Australia. I do not intend to labour these events, except to show that there is need for holding an inquiry. If the Government are satisfied that money has been unlawfully spent for the purpose of violating the provisions of the law which we are all supposed to observe, it is their duty to probe the facts of the last contest in Western Australia, and to find out if any money .was expended, especially illegally expended, for the purpose of bringing about our defeat. It is the particular duty of the Labour Government to set a standard for all other Governments to follow, and therefore I hope that they will institute a searching inquiry. I do not know that I have much criticism to offer regarding the Speech, which sets out the main intentions of the Government. In the first place, it refers to the adjustment which is about to take place in the distribution of the net revenue from Customs and Excise. So far as the time is concerned, I certainly think that ten years is a rather short period, although in expressing that view I feel that I am at variance with some members of the Labour party. </para>

                            <para>- I think so. The States are indissoluble units of the Commonwealth ; they cannot be dissolved except by their own motion. Taking into account the fact that they are engaged in carrying out very necessary works, apart from the functions of preserving order and carrying on the civil government, we have every reason to give some encouragement to the States, and not to be guided by the treatment which other Federations extend to their component parts. Take, for example, States like New South Wales and Western Australia. How do they compare with Canadian provinces, or even with the divisions which form the German Empire? They are not merely carrying on the civil government, but they are advancing far ahead of the provinces and the divisions to which I have alluded. They are, for example, carrying on the transport services, looking after the water frontage and the waterways, and in other directions taking the place of private effort. </para>

                            <para>- Not to the same extent as here. It is quite true that Prussia has a large railway system, but in Canada and the United States the component parts of the Federation have little more to do than to preserve order and uphold the civil government. They are also carrying on an educational system, but they have nothing to do with the land, especially in Canada, and certainly they have nothing to do with the collective efforts which the States in Australia are at present making. When we reflect that the States of the Commonwealth stand on an entirely different basis from the divisions of other Federations, I think that we should move very gradually in the matter of cutting short the supply of funds which they have been in the habit of receiving from Customs and Excise. I am at one with those who fear that when the revenue from those sources sinks from 50s. a head to 30s. or 25s., it will be absolutely impossible to pay anything to the States. But, so long as the revenue keeps n the neighbourhood of 50s. a head, I chink that there is a sacred obligation cast upon the members of this Parliament to see that the springs of revenue which have been sustaining the life blood of the States should not be dried up so soon as some seem to indicate is desirable. </para>

                            <para>- Unfortunately the revenue would rise, because we would have to purchase our supplies. In 1902, the revenue from Customs rose, because we had to get our supplies wherever we could, and at whatever it might cost. Looking at the matter broadly, I think that we are not entitled at present to limit the payment to the States to even ten years. I would favour a much longer term, the term of twenty-five years, which it was sought here last year to get inserted in the agreement. Certainly a longer term than ten years would best suit my view. I recognise that in this matter I may be suspected of being a believer in the State Rights policy. I do not think it necessary to argue that matter very fully. I need only point to the action which we took in Western Australia to get the Financial Agreement voted down. To all appearances that State stood to gain more under the agreement that did any of the other States, yet when the time came for expressing an opinion, we stood firmly by the attitude that this Parliament alone should have the final say in the distribution of the revenue from Customs and Excise. We had a strong opposition raised against us. We even had amongst our opponents some misguided adherents of Labour who thought that we were acting wrongly. We then took a stand which cannot justify a charge that I favour the State Rights policy if on the present occasion I say that ten years is rather too short a period to adopt. Of course, the object of the Financial Agreement was to try to keep the Fusion party in power at the expense of crippling the Commonwealth. It has been said that none sees the course of a game so clearly as do those who are watching it from the outside. It is, therefore, advantageous to read what the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> has had to say on the situation. Writing on the 1 6th April, that journal said - </para>

                    <para class="block">So that <inline font-style="italic">The Times,</inline> reviewing the position from a distance, dispassionately, concluded that the proposal of the Fusion Government was calculated to place the Commonwealth at the mercy of the State Parliaments. Of course, I rejoice that the advice of that party was not taken by the electors; and I must add that a most systematic attempt was made in several States of the Union, not only to secure the acceptance of the Financial Agreement, but also the rejection of those who were opposed to it. The members of the State Governments themselves brought influence to bear, and even took to the platform and strained every nerve with the object of bringing about the defeat of the Labour nominees. This fact warrants the conclusion arrived at, not only by the members of this Parliament, but by a considerable number of the public outside, that the agreement arrived at by a secret Conference in Melbourne had a political significance which did not appear upon the face of the document. I notice in the Governor-General's Speech a very mild reference to the transcontinental railway. While I am glad that the subject has been mentioned, I should have been better pleased if the intentions of the Government had been set forth more explicitly, as was done with other items in their programme. </para>

                            <para>- But my party does not imitate the characteristic of other parties in dangling promises before the  public, and seeking to gain support by dangling alone. Ours is a party of action, and 1 am prepared to accept this mild reference to the subject as an earnest of the intention of the Government that something will be done in the direction of the performance of this great national work. Because, after all, it is a great national work. Look at what has been done by other Federations. In the United States three-quarters of a million dollars were spent on the survey of a transcontinental railway to connect the western sea-board with the east. In Canada, also, the Dominion Government fostered the construction of a transcontinental line. I suppose that there were some " little Canadians " who opposed the work, just as my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has opposed our Australian railway. I hope, however, that he is now prepared to" look at the subject on broad Australian grounds, willing and anxious that the . Federal Government should take up so large and important a public work. I have no desire to make a special appeal for my own State. I am quite content to let this work rest on its own merits. But I cannot refrain from focussing attention on the fact that the western State has not benefited to the extent that the ardent supporters of Federation at the outset promised that it would do from the accomplishment of national union. I have always been content to depend upon the public spiritedness and the high sense of patriotism of the Federal Parliament to insure the completion of this work, and I do so still, but may I make a few remarks as to how Western Australia has been handicapped. I was sent here as a Protectionist, and the majority of my colleagues have also voted solidly with the object of fostering Australian industries, irrespective of whether Western Australia was concerned in them or not. But I regret to say that an examination of the facts shows that Western Australia  has scarcely benefited at all. I take the following figures from the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book.</inline> In New South Wales, from 1901 to 1908, the number of factories increased by 1,100. Victoria, in the same period, erected 600 new factories. In the case of South Australia and Queensland, the figures are not quite reliable, because a uniform system of recording industrial statistics was not adopted until considerably after Victoria and New South Wales agreed upon a common method. But the figures before me show that ninety fewer factories were in operation in South Australia. In Queensland, the number of factories decreased by 700. Tasmania built 130 new factories, and Western Australia only thirty-five. The increase in the number of employes is still more important. The term " factory " is vague, and conveys no idea of the number of persons employed. It is evidently better to have one factory employing a hundred persons than ten factories employing only ninety. In New South Wales, the number of persons employed in factories in the years mentioned increased by 23,000; in Victoria, by 20,000; in Queensland, by 3,000 ; in South Australia, by 5,000 ; in Tasmania, By 1,200 ; and in Western Australia by only 200. These figures are not encouraging in view of the fact that Western Australia has steadily supported Protection as a national policy. In view of that fact alone, reasonable consideration should be given to our claim, for the building of the transcontinental railway. I did not come here simply as a Western Australian. I came as an Australian, prepared to vote for bounties and for duties irrespective of the States that would benefit chiefly from them. But when we find that a State like Western Australia has so willingly participated in a policy which has benefited other States, it is surely only proper and just that the Federal Parliament should take stock of the position and give her some form of <inline font-style="italic">quid fro quo.</inline> I am somewhat disappointed that a more firm pronouncement has not been made concerning this great national work. I am anxious to see the two great lines constructed that will bridge over the vast spaces of our interior, and divert the activities of many' of our people from the coastal districts to the inland areas. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt it would ; but I do not see anything to prevent the two policies being carried out simultaneously. As far as land taxation is concerned, members of the Labour party have talked themselves hoarse on the public platform by devoting a great deal of time to impressing upon their constituents the need for this desirable reform - a reform which has been too long delayed, and which this country has been labouring to secure for many years. Had a progressive land tax been imposed in the past, it would have prevented our unfortunate settlers from trekking out to the dry arid soils of Australia, simply because they had been denied an opportunity of settling on the more fertile areas within the coastal fringe. Yet some honorable 'senators have the hardihood to suggest that the imposition of such a tax will constitute an intrusion upon State Rights. As a matter of fact, the position in regard to land legislation to-day is a standing monument to the stupidity of our politicians of the past. It is a standing indictment of the way in which they have shirked their duties by allowing settlement to run in directions that no country with any pretensions to sanity would allow it to run. In the State of Queensland, for which I have a warm corner in my heart, notwithstanding that it has returned <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> to this Parliament, what is the position? Settlers have been pushed out into the rainless districts beyond Dalby. </para>

In Western Australia, too, there is a far greater area available than is available in any other State, because it was settled very much later. Yet, even there we have the large land-owner bringing about the same public injury that he has inflicted upon other States.

I am sure that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> B.; Watson did not contribute to that value. Nor have the beneficiaries under his will done so. Of course, it may be argued that to impose a tax on land of that description would penalize the purchaser. But city lands have not yet reached their maximum value.

The latest sale in Melbourne has demonstrated that land in this city is worth  £650,000  per acre. As population becomes denser, land value.? will increase, both in the city and in the -country. If we do not demand a .proportion of the increased value which is given to land by the community, we shall not be entitled to the name of a progressive party which champions the rights and privileges of the workers of this country. I hope that when we have settled down to the practical work of discussing the schedule of reform which is set out in the Governor-General's Speech, the promise of the Leader of the Opposition will be amply fulfilled. </para>

                    <para>. - Having heard a rumour to the effect that, after this week, it is proposed that the Senate shall adjourn for a considerable time, I wish to ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council whether that is the intention of the Government; because there is one piece of legislation which is urgently required, and with which I think the Senate might deal very expeditiously. I refer to an amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I know that such an item does not appear upon the Government programme, although their views upon it are entirely in accord with my own. There :i re two points in the Statute which need to be dealt with before the Conciliation and Arbitration Court is called upon to hear the -complaint to be made to it by the Australian Workers Union - an organization which covers the whole of the Commonwealth.. In this matter, the interests of the whole community are at stake; and, if a short piece of legislation such as I have outlined were carried by the Senate, I am satisfied that the other branch of the Legislature would rapidly dispose of it when once it was seized of its importance. It seems to me that it is inadvisable that the Senate should adjourn when there are matters with which it might effectively deal whilst the other Chamber is occupied with other work. </para>

                    <para>. - Before the Vice-President of the Executive Council answers the question put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> I should like to be allowed to say that it is news to me, and possibly will be information for the Leader of the Opposition, that the Government contemplate another adjournment this week. It scarcely reflects credit upon the conduct of affairs by the Vice-President of the Executive Council that, notwithstanding the fact that the members of the Opposition in the Senate have during the last fortnight displayed great self-denial and restraint, wilh <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> view to immediately entering upon the real business of the session, he should be looking forward to a further adjournment. The announcement, coming from this hardworking Government, has given me somewhat of a shock. In making these remarks, I do not lose sight of the fact that the Government have submitted a very comprehensive programme, including very important financial, administrative, and social measures, which they are entitled to take time to fully consider before presenting them to Parliament. Admitting the importance of the measures which the Government have to submit, I hope that if the Vice-President of the Executive Council is forced to ask for a further adjournment, he will make it as brief as possible. </para>

                    <para>. - I may state, for the information of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> that the matter to which he has referred is in the hands of the Attorney-General, and I have no doubt that it will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible. I should like to remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, and those very eager members of the Opposition who are prepared to do such an enormous amount of work but are never here to do it, that the greater proportion of the legislation foreshadowed in the Governor-General's Speech is of such a character that it must of necessity be introduced in another place. So far we have had only the Address-in-Reply and business of a formal character to deal with. There are some small Bills which we might pass, measures which have already been considered in the Senate. The previous Government, supported by the present industrious Opposition, brought them to a certain stage and then left them. They were apparently good enough to waste time with. As a member of the present Government, I have no intention of wasting time with anything. When we take a Bill in hand, I hope that we shall finish it expeditiously. In view of the fact that thirty-six members of Parliament who are not excessive talkers will not occupy as much time in dealing with the same measures as will seventy-five very fluent and often loquacious members, it is in the interests of the country that we should adjourn for a week or two until another place overtakes us in carrying out the parliamentary business. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger should remember that while we sit here occupying a considerable time in doing what we might do in a few minutes, the electric light is burning, stationery is being wasted, and the time of members of the Senate and public officers is being practically wasted when it ought to be usefully employed. When we have an adjournment, we should have one which will suit the convenience of the majority of honorable senators. A very substantial majority of the members of the Senate have interests in Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania, and an adjournment for a day or for two or three days is of no use to them. I shall advise the Government, if possible, to provide for an adjournment which honorable senators will be able to make use of to visit their homes and their constituents. Although I cannot make a very definite statement to-night, I hope tomorrow afternoon to. be in a position to make a definite statement with respect to an adjournment for more than a few days. We have before us a Bill dealing with lighthouses, light-ships, beacons, and buoys, which has already been considered in the Senate under the late Government. </para>

                        <para>- It does not matter. I gave notice of two other Bills to-day and my honorable colleague gave notice of a third. They are very short Bills, and if honorable senators are anxious to work, as I have been invited to believe, I hope we shall have finished with them on Friday, and we shall then be able to adjourn for two or three weeks at least. That is the position at present, and I need only add that we shall find work for the industrious senators opposite as soon as possible. </para>
