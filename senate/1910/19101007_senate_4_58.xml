      <para>Last night I intimated to the Minister my intention to move certain amendments in clauses  136  and  137.  What I alluded to then was principally the question of the accommodation to be provided in various ships. It is almost impossible to deal with one matter without, to a certain extent, referring to the other, and therefore I ask the indulgence of the Committee if I transgress the rule of debate. Clause  136  is limited to steam-ships registered in Aus- tralia, or engaged in the coasting trade. I do not take any exception to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of sub-clause 1, but, as regards paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> I appeal to the Committee to reduce the space from 180 to 120 cubic feet. In the Merchant Shipping Act no special accommodation is provided for officers. It is supposed to be equal to that which is allowed to the seamen. I understand that in all the larger ships a certain amount of special accommodation is given to the officers for many reasons, which must be manifest to honorable senators. When we are asked to deal with the question of space and accommodation for officers it is very necessary to take into consideration the special circumstances in which our coasting trade is carried on. I am not in a position to speak with special authority regarding the position in the States generally, but I know that it is difficult for a steamer to enter very many of the ports along the coast of New South Wales, because the depth of water is very limited. Not only have small ships to be employed for that reason, but their length has to be limited in consequence of the tortuous character of many of the channels which they have to negotiate. After a very full consideration of this question, the Navigation Commission arrived at certain conclusions, which are really in accordance with the amendment I propose to submit. </para>

      <para>So much for the recommendation of the Commission. It is quite clear that only a tithe of the witnesses examined were in favour of a larger air space than 120 cubic feet. When I turn to the Merchant Shipping Act of 1906, I find a similar provision on that subject. Section 64 reads - </para>
      <quote>
        <para>Sub-section 1 of section 210 of the Principal Act, which provides for the space required for each seaman or apprentice in any place in a British ship occupied by seamen or apprentices and appropriated to their use, shall be construed as if a space of not less than 120 cubic feet, and of not less than 15 superficial feet, measured on the deck or floor of that place were substituted for a space of not less than 72 cubic feet and of not less than 12 superficial feet measured on the deck or floor of that place. </para>
      </quote>
      <para>So that the amendment I have proposed is strictly in accordance with the recommendation of the Navigation Commission, the evidence given by a majority of the witnesses and the provision in the Merchant Shipping Act of 1906. Still further, it is in accordance with the Bill introduced into this Parliament in 1908. If honorable senators refer to that Bill, they will find that it provided that the air space should be  120  cubic feet per man. With all these reasons placed before the Committee, the Minister might very well see his way to accept my amendment as one which is in agreement with the most advanced opinion in regard to the requirements for air space. Not only have a large number of ships for the Australian trade beenbuilt during the last few years on the lines laid down in the Merchant Shipping Act of  1906,  but ships are now being built and the requirements for air space are being met in accordance with that Act, the recommendations of our Royal Commission, and the proposals of the Navigation Bill of  1908.  It would manifestly be very unfair towards those who have been constructing vessels in good faith, and meeting those various requirements, if they were suddenly confronted with the necessity for providing a larger amount of air space than has hitherto been considered necessary. The increase of air space must limit the carrying capacity of ships. Vessels in the coasting trade are necessarily small ; and it follows that every ton of cargo which they are prevented from carrying adds to the cost, thereby imposing greater burdens on the producers of the country. </para>

          <para>-  My argument must be applied in a fair . and reasonable way. I said in my second-reading speech that I had no desire to limit unnecessarily the convenience and comfort of the men engaged in the shipping trade. I recognise that under old laws they were not reasonably treated.- But we have a double duty to perform - a duty not only to the shipowners and sailors, but also to our primary producers, whose progress depends in no small degree upon the material prosperity of our mercantile marine. It has been pointed out to me that the extra space for sleeping accommodation required by this Bill, with mess-rooms, bath-rooms, &#38;c, will materially decrease the earning power of our steamers. A steamer of about  200  tons burden will require about  40  cubic tons of space for sleeping accommodation alone. </para>

          <para>- We cannot accept that statement. I find that the minority report was signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> B. Edwards, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox, Mr. Macfarlane,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dugald</inline> Thomson. The report which the honorable senator signed was that of the Commission as a whole. Ship-owners, seamen, and shippers are all affected by this legislation. If this increased accommodation were required in the case of ships of large carrying capacity - vessels of  10,000, 12,000,  or  13,000  tons, such as we frequently see coming to Australia - the case would be entirely different. But the vessels engaged in our coasting trade range in tonnage from a very small size up to about  1,500  tons. . This provision affects the smaller ships as well as the large ones. If a line could be drawn between the small vessels and those over  1,000  tons there might be something to be said in favour of the increased accommodation proposed to be given. None of us has heard any complaint - at any rate from the Old World - with regard to the amount of accommodation that is now supplied to sailors. Before  1894, 72  cubic feet was considered to be a sufficient allotment of space. There were complaints about that. The accommodation was increased to  120  cubic feet, and additional, provision was made. for the safety and convenience of the men. But since then we have heard no complaints with regard to the accommodation. I therefore urge that the accommodation that is necessary on our ships has been provided, and that ship-owners have acted in good faith in building vessels in view of the requirements of the Merchant Shipping Act, the Royal Commission&#39;s report, and the Navigation Bill of 1908. For these reasons I trust that the amendment will be accepted. </para>

          <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> is, of course, quite correct in saying that the requirements of this Bill exceed those recommended by the Navigation Commission. But the Navigation Commission&#39;s report in this respect represents a compromise between two sections in order to secure unanimity. The Commission point out on page 13 of their report that the amount of space recommended by the British Labour Commission was 140 cubic feet. This, however, referred to conditions prevailing in England, and had in view a temperate climate. Very many of our ships work in climates that are not temperate. This Bill covers vessels trading in the South seas, to Fiji, and in the waters of Northern and North-western Australia, where the conditions approximate to a tropical character. The Royal Commission, of course, gathered evidence from men who had been working under set conditions, and it is. always difficult for such men to get away from their preconceived ideas as to what is the right thing to do. In saying what they thought would be a fair amount of space to provide they naturally had regard to conditions with which they were familiar. One can quite understand that in their recommendations they did not feel inclined to go quite as far as they would have done had they been considering the case on its merits, and quite apart from existing conditions. Enormous alterations have been made in recent years in connexion with the passenger service. Honorable senators who, like myself, have had to travel much at sea during the last twenty years will be able to make a comparison between the accommodation provided for passengers twenty years ago and that now provided in our Inter-State steamers. There has been a tremendous increase of the space allotted to passengers, and a vast improvement in the ventilation and in conditions generally. I have never heard any one say that the passenger trade has: suffered in consequence. On the con trary, it has increased, and become most lucrative and profitable to the steam-ship companies. It is also to be borne in mind that the conditions which we prescribe will apply to all ships engaged in the Australian trade. There will be no unfair competition from foreign vessels. The Australian ship-owner will not be able to complain that he is compelled to provide 140 cubic feet of space per man whilst his foreign competitors provide only 75 cubic feet. The British Labour Commission recommended 140 cubic feet in face of the knowledge that if their report had been carried out there was nothing to prevent foreign ships which provided only 75 cubic feet of space for their seamen competing with British ships. We are going to make the conditions in this respect on the Australian coast even, and it is therefore worth our while to insist upon what is generally conceded to be sufficient space being provided to insure the health of the crew.&#39; </para>

        <para class="block">So that in the case of existing ships, every endeavour will be made to administer this provision with as little harshness as possible. Honorable senators will see that the Bill makes provision for exemptions from compliance with these requirements where the structure of the ship will not allow of the crew space and accommodation being supplied in the way provided for. Of course, when the measure comes into force, ship-owners will know the law, and in any future ships built by them they will be required to comply with these provisions. We know that the life of a modern steamer is very much shorter than that of the old wooden ships, and in a comparatively few years all the ships trading on the Australian coast will have to comply with these provisions. I admit that, under this clause, the owners of British foreign-going ships will be placed at some disadvantage as compared with foreign owners. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> in moving his amendment, has admitted that this clause will not affect a large ship so much as a small ship, and the foreign-going trade is carried on with large ships. In the case of large ships, the cubic contents represented by the accommodation space required will not be of so much consequence as in the case of a small vessel. </para>

            <para>- In the case of the Australian trade the competition will be equal, because all vessels will be subject to the same conditions. In all the circumstances the Government feel constrained to ask the Committee to accept the clause as it stands, although they recognise that it represents a big advance upon any provision of the kind in any other legislation. We think these provisions are justified and are necessary amongst other reasons in order to encourage young Australians to take to the mercantile marine. One cannot read the report of the Navigation Commission without being struck by the references to the decline of the British mercantile marine. The decline is not in the number of the ships, their tonnage, or the capital invested, but in the number of Britishers employed in the ships. This is largely due to the fact that, while sanitary and housing conditions ashore have steadily improved, such conditions on board ship have not improved. We need to make the housing conditions on our ships as nearly equal to those on shore as practicable if we are to. encourage the people to take to the sea for a livelihood. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment. </para>

          <para>. - I hope the Committee will very seriously consider this question and that honorable senators will listen carefully to the evidence from both sides. I have no hesitation in saying that some of the information we have received for our guidance in this matter comes from agencies of ship-owners. We are as much entitled to place that information before the Committee, provided that we consider it <inline font-style="italic">bona fide,</inline> as honorable senators opposite are to submit information supplied by officers and seamen. We can afford to dismiss considerations of interested motives in discussing this question. I intend to support the amendment. It must be as obvious as the fingers on one&#39;s hand that if ship-owners are required to provide increased accommodation and these extra conveniences for their seamen, it must limit the carrying, and therefore the earning, capacity of their vessels. We should remember that a profitable trade is springing up along our coasts which is of the greatest importance to Australian development. If we increase the obligations of ship-owners engaged in this trade, we must expect an increase of freights and fares. We have therefore to consider whether any request in the direction of this provision is fair- </para>

            <para>- It ever will be said. If some persons were given the accommodation of the Kingdom of Heaven they would get up and strike against it.  1  admit that the converse of the proposition is also true, and that there are some persons who will not respond to the claims of humanity, no matter how insistent they may be. The common-sense view is always a compromise between the views of the extremists, who are the despair of all legislators and every community. It is in that spirit of compromise that I hope we shall discuss this matter. The expense involved in the increase of the obligations placed upon ship-owners by this Bill must come out of the trade, and as a result freights, and especially fares, may be so much increased that travelling by sea may become a privilege of which only the rich may be able to avail themselves. It is generally admitted that a sea voyage is one of the best remedies for a condition of ill-health, and we should do nothing which would debar the poor from taking advantage of such a remedy. No one can deny that freights, and especially fares, have been increased immensely of late. The cost of travelling by sea has within the last five or six years gone up by 50 or 60 per cent. for first and secondclass passengers, and if the obligations of ship-ownersbe still further increased sea travelling may be denied to a large section of the community. The Minister has said that it has been generally recognised that 140 cubic feet ought to be provided for seamen. In his plausible remarks in defence of the clause the Minister failed to recognise the fact that he was casting a slur upon the merchant shipping legislation of almost every other country on earth. In the pragmatical spirit which is often displayed on the Ministerial bench, the honorable senator practically claimed that the present Government are the only persons who recognise the common claims of humanity in dealing with seamen. I cannot indorse that opinion. There have been three Acts &#39;dealing with navigation passed in New Zealand. One was passed in 1903, another in 1908, and the third in 1909. The accommodation to be provided for seamen was thoroughly discussed in connexion with every one of these measures, and in the light of expert evidence. But notwithstanding this fact, the New Zealand Parliament in their last amending legislation on this subject in 1909, maintained the provision of 120 cubic feet for a seaman. Section 16 of the New Zealand Act of 1909 is in these terms - </para>

        <para class="block">That section was passed in order to preserve and conserve the coastal trade. Their amending Act shows how much the New Zealand Parliament thought of that trade. Our coasting trade is as important to us as the New Zealand coastal trade is to the Dominion. The New Zealand Par liament considered this matter from an economic, as well as from a humane, point of view, and was exceedingly careful to vest in the Minister power to compel shipowners engaged in its coastal trade, to provide fair accommodation for the crews and officers of vessels.

        <para class="block">It will be seen, therefore, that when I characterize the remark of the Minister that this is the first Legislature which has considered a Navigation Bill from a humane stand-point, as pragmatical, I am justified in doing so. The New Zealand Navigation Act was most carefully considered by the Dominion Parliament, and the seamen of that country appear to be well satisfied not only with the provisions of the Act itself, but also with its administration. Over and over again this question of accommodation has been brought before the Board of Trade and before the Imperial Parliament. In the Merchant Shipping Act, the accommodation to be provided for each seaman has been increased from 72 cubic feet to 120 cubic feet. It must be well within the knowledge of those who have studied the course of shipping legislation that the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 had been so carefully considered by Select Committees that it passed through the House of Commons - notwithstanding that it contains more than 700 clauses - in less than half-an-hour. The accommodation which has found general acceptance with seamen is 120 cubic feet. </para>

            <para>- I was about to refer to that matter. It may seem strange to the honorable member that from one point of view the fact that our coastal vessels trade largely in a tropical climate may be used as much as an argument in favour of  1 20  cubic feet of space being allotted to each seaman, as against it. The Minister of Defence has already pointed out a fact which is unchallengeable, namely, that the passenger traffic along our coast has materially increased. It would be a damning circumstance if it had not done so. That increased traffic merely means that the population of Australia has increased. As the size of our ships is increased naturally they provide increased acommodation for their crews. Both passenger fares and freights have been increased, because our prosperity has been abnormal. This season will probably be a record one. </para>

            <para>- I wonder if the Minister has ever read the classical story about the horse which neighed first before the sun rose, and whose master was in consequence made King. I have travelled a good deal along the tropical coast of Australia. I have been several times round Thursday Island, and down the Gulf to Normanton, and I have made the trip at all seasons of the year. As the result of my experience I say that a passenger&#39;s cabin is the last place to which he will go. If a man had the whole saloon to himself he would not go there unless he were ill. Even the spacious dining saloon is a most uncomfortable place in which to remain. On board the vessels trading along this route it is customary for the passengers and crew to sleep on deck unless the weather be very stormy. The cabins are the last places to which resort would be had, even if they were fitted with patent electric ventilators. . From that point of view the Minister of Defence will note that his argument cuts both ways. I do not for a moment suggest that decent accommodation ought not to be provided for our seamen. But in asking for  120  cubic feet of space to be allotted to each man we have all the authority of precedent. It has been said that the fixing of space was the result of a compromise. But all our legislation represents compromise. The Minister himself is a compromise. He and his followers would not be where they are to-day but for compromise. </para>

            <para>- I do not.I think that he requires more space than that.. Six feet by  6  feet by  2  feet represents; little more than a grave. The Navigation Bill of  1908  increased the accommodation proposed to be granted to each seaman to  120  cubic feet, with  16  superficial feet, and with  4  feet clear between the bunks. In the measure which is now under consideration, the accommodation for each seaman has been still further increased to140 cubic feet, and to not less than  18  superficial feet measured on the deck or floor, with  5  feet space between the bunks, and additional space is allowed in respect of mess and bath-rooms. I dare say that if the consideration of the measure were delayed for five or six years, the accommodation for each seaman would be increased to  160  or  170  cubic feet. </para>

            <para>- At any rate, there must be a diminution of the carrying capacity, whether it amounts to a fourth or a fifth. We &#39;do not wish to see the wages of seamen or the salaries of officers decreased, but it must be evident that if the carrying capacity of vessels is materially decreased the fares and freights will be increased, and, consequently, the trade is likely to be less patronised and therefore less remunerative, -My experience in travelling is that an ordinary cabin for Saloon passengers usually contains four berths, and a four-berth cabin on what are practically first-class steamers measures about 8 feet by 6 feet by 7 feet ; that is about 436 cubic feet in all, or about 106 cubic feet for each passenger. I make that statement largely from personal observation, and it is verified by inquiriesI have made. I do not believe that on the best of our coasting steamers more than 120 cubic feet of air space is provided for each passenger in a four-berth cabin. Perhaps less space is provided in many cases on a first-class vessel. </para>

            <para>- Let me remind the Minister that one-half of the seamen are on duty while the other half are in their berths. In the case of passengers, however, four are sometimes down in their cabin at the same time. If we allow a space of 1 20 cubic feet to each seaman, and a four-bunk cabin is occupied by only onehalf of the seamen at a time, then we shall give the seamen vastly more space than the passengers are allowed, or could reasonably claim. My retort to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> is that the seamen are to get twice the amount of accommodation and ventilation which is to be provided for the passengers. I ask him to address himself to that aspect of the question. </para>

            <para>- If I thought for a moment, or if it be shown that the non-provision of 140 cubic feet of air space for a seaman was likely to materially injure his health, I should not support the amendment, but when we remember that 120 cubic feet has been considered a sort of standard accommodation, why should it not be adopted in this measure ? Our coasting trade is almost as important to us as is our oversea trade, and certainly as years go by it will be an increasingly important factor in the development of Australia. We have also to bear in mind that in many cases only ships of a very limited draught can be employed in our harbors and rivers. We might alter the ships, but we cannot materially alter the bars and harbors. They will always require the employment of a certain type of vessel. For the reasons I have given, I support the amendment. </para>

            <para>- On the Australian coast I have seen ten and twelve passengers in a room on ships in the coasting trade. I do not object to the clause prescribing the accommodation to be provided for seamen and officers. What I contend is that the accommodation for passengers should be prescribed and should not be left purely to regulation. Clause 268 provides that the accommodation for passengers is to be left entirely to regulation. When we are legislating specifically with regard to the  accommodation for ships&#39; officers and crew, surely we ought to legislate specifically for the accommodation of passengers. </para>

            <para>- We are dealing with the question of accommodation, and I say that there ought to be a clause providing for the accommodation of passengers. The honorable senator has no right to say that I am out of order. I have seen vessels so overcrowded that the accommodation for the people on board was utterly insufficient. I may be told that the overcrowding was the fault of the marine authorities. To prevent that sort of thing we should insert in this Bill a specific provision insuring a proper amount of air space for people who have to travel by sea. </para>

He pointed out that a number of witnesses did not regard that space as sufficient. But when I turn to the report of the Commission I find that eight medical men were examined, and the report states thatthey were &#34; practically unanimous in recommending the minimum of at least  120  feet&#34; as a space that &#34; would insure the convenience, as well as the health, of the seamen.&#34; The next paragraph in the report says - </para>

            <para>-  I have not been there, and am glad that the honorable senator speaks merely from information received. He should remember, however, that a man in gaol is very much more confined than is a sailor on board a ship. Of course, it would be very much better to have  140,  or even  200,  cubic feet of space. But the question is not how much we should like to have, but how much is reasonable. It is a matter of degree and of the surrounding circumstances. The Commission were unanimous that  120  cubic feet would meet all requirements. </para>

        <para>There not even the words &#34; at least &#34; are used. Clearly the Commission thought  120  feet quite sufficient.

          <para>We think that all ships should comply with all the required conditions, but if it can be shown that the structural alterations are unreasonable so far as cubic and superficial capacity is concerned a ship might be exempt; but in the case of sanitary hygienic and other arrangements no exemption should be made in any circumstances whatever. </para>

        <para>There is no proposal now before the Committee for any exemption in respect of general sanitary, hygienic, and other conditions. That is the only dissent which these gentlemen recorded. They did not record any dissent from the recommendation that the space provided for each seaman should be  120  cubic feet. There is another dissent signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> in which he does not deal with this matter at all, but mentions his objection to the reference in the report to Board of Trade certificates. These are the only two matters upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> considered it necessary to indicate any dissent from the recommendations of the Commission. That being so, we have a right to expect that the honorable senator will now be prepared to adhere to the recommendation with respect to the space to be allowed to each seaman, to which he attached his signature. It is not reasonable that he should now ask that the space should be  140  cubic feet unless good reasons are submitted for the alteration which were not stated to the Commission. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie is nowpresent, I should like to direct his attention to the recommendation which he signed. </para>

        <para class="block">We have no desire to reduce below reasonable limits the space to be provided for every person on board a ship, but I point out that in New South Wales there is shallow water on the bars of many of our rivers, and we have shifting bars. Shipping companies in consequence must consider the depth of water drawn by vessels engaged in the trade between our ports. This must affect the size of the vessels employed in the trade, and if we require them to provide unnecessary space for the accommodation of seamen - and I use the word &#34; unnecessary &#34; advisedly, because I do not wish to be misunderstood in this matter - we shall hamper the operations of people who are engaged in developing this country. </para>

The honorable senator might just as well have asked me how much space I would allow on board ship for a sheep, or for the proverbial goat, about which we heard so much recently. The Government propose that  140  cubic feet of space shall be allowed for a sailor, but we know that in the passenger accommodation provided on some of the first-class ships on our coasts nothing like that space is provided for each passenger. It should be remembered also that the passenger has to pay a considerable fare, and is confined to his cabin much more than the seaman is confined to his quarters. </para>

            <para>- Assuming for the sake of argument that that is so, I remind the honorable senator that a passenger requires more ample accommodation than a seaman, because he is often very much confined to his cabin. The seaman has many more opportunities of being on deck and breathing the fresh air. I agree that seamen should be provided with all necessary accommodation for their health, comfort, and convenience, but we should not forget that the accommodation available upon any ship must be limited, and to legislate in the way proposed in this Bill would be to put an undue embargo upon our coasting trade. The argument of the Minister of Defence that every ship engaged in our coastal trade must provide the same accommodation does not appeal to me as sufficient to justify this provision. We have to consider the interests of our producers, and we should not unduly increase the cost of the transport of goods from port to port in the Commonwealth in order that we may make provision for fanciful and unnecessary accommodation on board ship for seamen or passengers. I remind the Committee that if a passenger requires extra accommodation he has only to pay for it. If he wants a four berth cabin all to himself he can get it by paying for it. There is no precedent and no necessity for this provision, and it appears to me that it is absolutely without justification. </para>

          <para>. - When we remember that shipowners derive very reasonable returns from the capital they have invested in the shipping business, and that passengers are very well catered for, it is surprising that there should be so much opposition to this proposal to give relief to the workers in the shipping industry. I have been surprised to find <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger speaking as he has spoken on this question. When before the electors I have no doubt the honorable senator posed  as a bright and shining example of what an advocate of the cause of the workers should be. But we now find him making every effort to resist a provision for adequate accommodation for seamen, and to reduce what is considered to be only reasonable breathing space for them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> ignores the fact that the British Labour Commission recommended 140 cubic feet as the space to be provided for each seaman. </para>

            <para>- He also ignores the fact that in making its recommendation the British Manning Commission kept in mind the circumstance that most men sailing from British ports are engaged in a temperate clime, and that, as a result, they require very much less accommodation than those who are engaged in tropical climes. He also forgets that when the Queensland Parliament framed legislation dealing with shearers and bush-workers, It did not limit the sleeping accommodation to 140 cubic feet per man, but fixed it at 240 cubic feet. </para>

            <para>- I am merely emphasizing the remarkable attitude which has been taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger. The Queensland Parliament also provided that not more than four persons should be domiciled in one compartment. In view of these facts, it is difficult to understand the position of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger. He comes from a State which has recognised the necessity for providing reasonable breathing accommodation for bush-workers, and yet he refuses to provide similar accommodation on board our ships. What has been happening in the maritime world for quite a number&#34; of years past? Those who have invested their capital in maritime ventures have been reaping a handsome reward. According to a report which was tendered <inline font-style="italic">to the</inline> Melbourne Chamber of .Commerce in 1901, the freights along our coast have almost kept pace with the freights from the Old Country. The freights which ruled in 1902 were 20s. per ton higher than those which ruled twenty years previously. </para>

            <para>- I am not concerned with the dividends. Further light can always be thrown upon balance-sheets. The balance-sheets of some companies appear to be specially devised to conceal profits. We have ample evidence that balancesheets are not a true index of the financial position of companies. Upon page  40  of the report of the minority section of the Navigation Commission, it is pointed out that between  1854  and  1900  the number of men per hundred tons required to work a steam-ship decreased from  7.6  to  2.2.  During the same period the number of men required per  100  tons gross register to work a sailing vessel decreased from  3.9  to  1.6.  Taking steam and sailing craft combined, in  1854 1,166  men were required to do the work which  389  men performed in  1900.  In other words, only about a third of the number are now required. Yet the freights and fares along our coast are higher now than they were twenty- live years ago. Consequently those who have embarked their capital in maritime ventures - the individuals of whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger is such a stalwart champion - are not only working their vessels with a very much smaller number of men than they did formerly, but are maintaining fares and freights at higher rates than prevailed twenty years ago. I can recollect the time when I was able to travel from Brisbane to Sydney for  10s.  The report of the Navigation Commission shows very clearly that foreign ships provide conveniences and accommodation for their crews which are undreamt of in our coastal trade. Upon shore a man can always ventilate his dwelling, but upon board ship that is not always possible. In rough weather the port holes may have to be closed for hours, and perhaps for days. I hope that honorable senators will agree to grant each seaman  140  cubic feet of space by way of sleeping accommodation, especially as by so doing we shall only be giving effect to a recommendation by the British Labour Commission. </para>

          <para>The existing law for regulating immigration ships as contained in Part ill. of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894, under the provisions of sections 355 and 713 of that Act, is to be carried into execution in the British Islands by the Board of Trade and by officers called &#34; emigration officers,&#34; acting under their direction. In the absence, however, of emigration officers or their assistants, or at ports where there are no- such officers, their duties and functions devolve on the chief officer of Customs. </para>

        <para>These regulations have to be carried out by every officer under Part III. of the Merchant Shipping Act relating to passengers. All our Inter-State steamers have to comply with that Act, which makes provision for passengers. It provides that there shall be  18  superficial feet measured on deck, that there shall not be more than two tiers of bunks, and that the house shall not be less than  6  feet high. </para>

            <para>- No; but a ship which is virtually built to go over a grass paddock if there is a bit of dew on it. She is practically to have no draught, and is to be short, because of the bends in the river. Surely to goodness, if there is a trade for that ship, the owners ought to house the men in something like decent comfort. </para>

I feel satisfied that honorable senators on the other side are only raising this opposition for the sake of objecting. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline> I take it, is going to vote with us, because he thinks that a space of 140 cubic feet is little enough, only he contends that the same accommodation should be provided for the passengers as for the crew. </para>

            <para>- We are following the recommendation made by the honorable senator, amongst others. He had an opportunity of qualifying the recommendation if he had seen fit to do so, and he did not. We on this side have only one object in view and that is to do what is fair and square as between man and man, and between various sections of the community. Why should we object for the mere sake of opposition? We look at the Merchant Shipping Act, the report of the Navigation Commission, the New Zealand Act and the draft of the Bill presented to the Senate in 1908, and we find that they concur in one thing. I shall not labour the matter, having simply risen to repudiate the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline></para>

          <para>.- I also resent &#34;the imputation that the Opposition have been discussing this question for the mere purpose of seeking an unnecessary alteration. I have listened to the debate, and carefully weighed the reasons on each side. The Minister of Defence made a very lame attempt to justify the change proposed by the Bill.  His  principal reason was that the British Labour Commission had recommended an area of 140 cubic feet. When reference has been made to the Merchant Shipping Act and the New Zealand Act, honorable senators opposite have said, &#34; What have we to do with other legislation ? &#34; I might retort now, What have we to do with the British Labour Commission? We may take it for granted that the Commission recommended more than it thought was likely to be granted. It has also been said that the 120 feet was recommended by the Australian Royal Commission as a compromise. Compromises are generally arrived at when there is a close division of opinion between parties. But we find that out of thirty-one persons who gave evidence before the Royal Commission only three - less than one-tenth - were in favour of 140 cubic feet. Those who have no interest in the matter ought to pay respect to the advice of a properly constituted body like the Royal Commission. A provision inserted in the 1908 Bill, in conformity with the recommendation of the Commission, should be fair and reasonable. The first Bill dealing with navigation that was considered by the Commonwealth Parliament was drafted by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> who could not be accused of lack of sympathy for workers of all kinds. That Bill left the measurement standard at 72 cubic feet. </para>

            <para>- Circumstances have not altered materially since the report was published. As a matter of fact, however, the Government, in dealing with this measure, have simply been trotted along by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> and they seem to be content to adopt whatever he chooses to recom mend.  1  find that of the thirty-one persons examined by the Royal Commission on this subject, eleven were in flavour of 120 cubic feet, eleven in favour of 100, and six in favour of 72. Of the eight medical men examined, not one made a recommenation in excess of the minimum of 120 cubic feet. It is also curious that the witnesses examined by the Commission speak of the British Labour&#39; Commission having advocated 120 cubic feet. I do not know where the 140 cubic feet idea came- from, though honorable senators opposite have been continually referring to it as the recommendation of the. Labour Commission. I propose now to quote from the evidence taken by the Royal Commission. I find that Captain Mark Breach, whose evidence is printed on page 696, was examined as follows - </para>

        <quote>
          <para>Have you read the provisions of the Bill before the Commission which provide for the accommodation of the crew and the officers. There is a clause which says that there shall be not less than 72 cubic feet of space allotted to each seaman, and that there shall be no paint locker, or lavatory, or excrescence, or any encumbrance whatever permitted inside that space. The Manning Commission and the Steam-ships Subsidies Committee appointed by the Imperial Parliament have made recommendations on that head. The Labour Commission, in their report, advocated 120 cubic feet for each man, and a witness, giving evidence before us a few days ago, advocated 140 cubic feet. From your long experience at sea, both as a seaman and as master, what, in your opinion, would be a fair area of space for each seaman ? - I should think that 72 cubic feet would be quite enough. Go on board any ship and into the forecastle and see what it will &#39;measure. There is a great big space, or there was, on the Aberdeen line, that carried a much larger crew than is carried now in the same forecastle. You will see there a big, cold, barren place, and if there were twenty-six men in it there would yet be plenty of room. 72 cubic feet should be the minimum allowance. </para>

        <para>I do not say that I agree with that, but  1  quote the evidence because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> told us that we should not consider what the Commission recommended, but should turn to the evidence itself and see what the witnesses said.

If you were to measure a.  corner, part of which you could not perhaps see, that would be quite different; but to take any square on the deck and give a man 72 cubic feet it would be quite enough. </para>

          <para>With regard to section 135- the cubic capacity is placed at 72 cubic feet of air space and 12 superficial feet of floor space. I think this is much too low. This would be equal to a space for each seaman  6  feet in length,  6  feet high, and 2 feet wide, the sepulchral accommodation which a man is entitled to at his own interment. This section has evidently been taken from the Merchant Shipping Act of 1854 practically without amendment. It is interesting to note that in the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 there is still the same amount of cubic capacity, so that in England there has been no progress  in  this direction for over forty years ; but since 1894, the cubic capacity has been increased, owing to the efforts of the health authorities. </para>

          <para>The difficulty of adopting an ample and liberal provision is to apply it to ships already constructed.

          <para>Some vessels are incapable of yielding 100 feet without expensive alterations? - It is very desirable to get as much as you can. </para>
          <para>We have to fix a minimum. If we do not take into our purview the large number of ships already existing, and the fact that it would cost a lot to effect structural alterations in them, we will make this minimum for future ships less than we otherwise would .if we considered only future ships. Do you not think it would be a wise thing in the interests of the future to fix 120 feet for ships built after the passing of this Act, and 72 (or as much more as can be effected without expensive structural alterations) for ships built prior to the passing of the Act? - You must effect certain structural alterations, and why not make it 100. </para>
          <para>All ships now have 72 feet if they comply with the present law. You may come across a, ship in which you could not, without great expense, provide for 100 feet. We should have a clause to enable us to compel alterations, but if it were impossible to alter to 100 feet without expensive structural alterations, would it not bg better to leave that old ship - which would probably soon pass out of existence - at 72 and legislate so that all vessels constructed after the passing of this Act should have 120 feet? - Yes, I think that is a good suggestion. </para>

          <para>Can you in any definite way express what should be required in the shape of ventilation for forecastles and the accommodation for seamen at sea? - I was at sea myself for a year  in the China trade. As regards the means by which air should be admitted, in the first place, you must have a certain cubic capacity, otherwise a man would be blown out of his bunk. The greater you increase the cubic space the less risk there will be of the men shutting up the portholes, and so forth. Seventy-two cubic feet per man seems much too small ; I should say 100 or 120 cubic feet was little enough. </para>
          <para>Say you have 120 cubic feet for each man ; can you express in definite words what ventilation is required? - The only way is to take samples of the air. Is it not possible to say that certain mechanical means shall be adopted to change that air in a certain space of time, or that certain sized openings should be in it? It could be provided for in that way. </para>
          <para>Would that definitely do it?- No, because the condition of the atmosphere varies so frequently as regards temperature, &#38;c. </para>
          <para>If you give 120 cubic feet to each man, it really means 240 to the men who are in it, as only half of them are there at the time? - It does not necessarily follow that is so, because they are all in it when in port. </para>
          <para>Do they continue to occupy the forecastle when in port? - Not in all cases. </para>
          <para>You do not think science is yet capable of definitely describing any form of ventilation that would be perfect? - No, I do not think so. </para>

            <para>- I do not wish to take up too much time. I was asked to refer to the evidence, but as there is no index of witnesses attached to it, it is a very difficult matter to pick out the evidence of a particular witness. It is a matter of indifference to me whether the space decided upon be 120 or 140 cubic feet. If the space could be increased without disadvantage, . I should not hesitateas to the course I would adopt, but we cannot overlook the fact that to increase the accommodation of seamen in the way proposed must have the effect of decreasing the cargocarrying capacity of a ship and so of reducing her earnings. Such alterations of  the  law must lead to an increase in freights and fares, and in view of the evidence I have quoted in favour of a provision for 120 cubic feet, and of the fact that that space has been recommended by the Navigation Commission, it seems to me that we should do well in fixing the space to be . provided at 120 cubic feet, as was done in the 1908 Bill. I think that that would be a fair provision, and I intend to support the amendment. </para>

          <para>. - I have no wish to continue the debate, but I desire to put on record a few opinions from the evidence given before the Royal Commission, in opposition to those which have been cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl.</inline> It will be found that, in answer to question 24040, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Dick,</inline> medical officer at Newcastle, said that 100 or 120 cubic feet of space is little enough. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Robertson,</inline> assistant medical officer of the Board of Health, Melbourne, in answer to question 16228, suggested 140 cubic feet as the minimum space which should be provided. It will be seen from the answer to question 162 11 that in the <inline font-style="italic">Grantala,</inline> an existing ship, the space provided is 260 cubic feet per man. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Ramsay</inline> Smith,  Chairman  of the Board of Health, Adelaide, in answer to question 14541, said that 120 cubic feet would not be too much. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Ham,</inline> who is now  Chairman  of the Board of Health, Melbourne, made, in answer to question 21794,a general statement as to the condition of the men&#39;s quarters on board ship which is anything but flattering to those who permit such conditions to continue to exist. In the answer to question 21758 the statement appears that the Royal Labour Commission recommended 120 cubic feet as the minimum; but that was for cool and cold climates. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Thompson, President</inline> of the Board of Health, Sydney, said, in answer to questions 16698 and 16705, that the cubic space per man provided for should be not less than 100 feet, and he would be glad to see 120 cubic feet provided. One point which, so far, has not been considered is the fact that this accommodation for seamen is deducted from the registered tonnage of vessels in computing the tonnage upon which harbor dues are payable. Honorable senators will see that we shall be able in this way to equalize matters to a certain extent for Australian ship-owners. The clause has now been very fully discussed, and in view of the many contentious questions which have yet to be dealt with, I appeal to honorable senators to let this matter go to a vote, and I ask the Committee to stand by the clause as printed. </para>

If the vessels engaged in our limited-coast trade are forced outof commission, there will be so much less employment available to our seamen. On the other hand, if the public cannot afford to pay the increased freights which the owners will demand, the produce will not be carried. It will be allowed to rot. As a matter of fact, I know of instances in which that has actually occurred. Under these circumstances, I have a right to ask the Government to seriously consider the question. The Minister has not attempted to answer the objections which have been urged by honorable senators upon this side of the Chamber in regard to vessels employed in our limitedcoast trade. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has himself admitted that the carrying capacity of these ships will be reduced by one-fourth or one-fifth, if we agree to the clause in its present form. </para>

On the latter point Ido not intend now to submit an amendment, as I accept the decision of the Committee in the last division as final regarding any alteration of the space proposed in the Bill. Nor do I intend to propose an amendment in the following clause to reduce the number of cubic feet to be allowed tothe seaman, because I take it, after the long debate to-day, that the Committee is in favour of the larger space being allowed, at any rate at present.

            <para>- I know that the paragraph only refers to the officers, but the effect of the amendment if adopted would be to increase the number of ships with the lesser requirement. On this, point the honorable senator has not given any reason why we should make the alteration. I admit that he made out a good case for the previous amendment, but I do not see that what he said then has any bearing on this proposal, unless, of course, his aim is to attain his object byanother means. If this amendment were carried he would obtain in this way what he endeavoured to obtain previously. </para>

The present proposal to increase the gross tonnage is made, of course, with a view to provide a sufficient or a greater quantity of accommodation for the carriage of cargo and passengers by any ship between  300  and  500  tons gross register. Earlier in the day I pointed out that, owing to the nature of the harbors and rivers which the coasting ships of New South Wales have to navigate, it is very desirable that the steamship companies should have the opportunity of carrying as large a cargo as possible in their small ships. It is with that object in view that I urge this extension of the gross tonnage. </para>

            <para>- There are some ports and harbors which ships of  500  tons can enter, but which ships of  600  or  700  tons cannot enter. At the same time, there is an enormous quantity of produce to be carried and, naturally, it will go to the ships which are available. If  500  tons of produce could be put into one bottom, obviously it would be much less expensive to run a ship containing that tonnage than to run one capable of carrying only  300  tons. The producers would be benefited, because the shipping companies would be able to carry their produce at a lower rate than they could do if they had to incur heavier expense. In other words, one ship of  500  tons would be able to do almost the work of two ships of  300  tons each. The effect of my amendment would be to reduce the cost of maintenance and the freights and fares. I do not think that the Minister can seriously contend that it is very objectionable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has interjected that we on this side are anxious to get this extra accommodation at the expense of the officers. </para>

I wish to bring under their notice the fact that we have a mercantile marine, and to suggest that if they intend to convey members of Parliament to England they might charter an Australian ship, man her with Australians, and load her with Australian produce, in order to advertise the Commonwealth there. I believe that it would be money well spent. </para>

              <para>- I would also remind my honorable friend that if everything is to be Australian he would be barred, because he is an imported man. The first business to be taken on Tuesday will be the third reading of the Trust Fund Advances Bill, and then the consideration of the Navigation Bill in Committee will be resumed. Some little alterations have been made in the census papers, and regulations will have to be laid on the table of the Senate. The census papers which have already been tabled will be withdrawn, and any honorable senator wishing to alter the regulations will have an opportunity, if he likes to do so, to give notice of a motion in that direction. </para>
