                        <para>Considering the large attendances at Flemington on each of the four days of the Spring meeting, the number of offences was unusually small. Three men on Derby day were arrested for uttering counterfeit sovereigns, and a barman was also arrested for larceny. Melbourne Cup day was a blank, no arrest being made. </para>

                    <para>I understand that something like 120,000 persons attended the Melbourne Cup meeting, and that no arrests were made. Will the Minister have inquiries made as to whether that record has ever been surpassed by any country in the world, as a counter-blast to reflections which certain persons are continually casting on the people of this State? </para>

                    <para>As Yass-Canberra has been definitely chosen as the site for the Federal Capital, one can reasonably hope that this Bill, which is essentially a machinery measure, will pass through its various stages without unnecessary delay. When the question of the Capital site was last under consideration here, I think it was generally agreed that when the vote was taken, finality would be arrived at so far as the opinions of different senators were concerned. </para>

                            <para>- This Bill contains eleven clauses, which I think are devoid of really debatable matter, but I shall explain the necessity for the different provisions. The object of clause 3 is to prevent certain Acts of the State of New South Wales from applying to the Federal Territory after it has been handed over to the Commonwealth. There are certain State Acts which the Government consider ought not to be applied in the Federal Territory, and therefore they desire that they shall not be continued in force after the issue of the proclamation. These are the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of 1899, the </para>

                    <para class="block">Industrial Disputes Act of 1908; the Industrial Disputes Amendment Act of 1908, and the Industrial Disputes Amendment Act of 1909. Were these Acts to remain operative in the Federal Territory they would have to be administered by State officials, or new Commonwealth administrative machinery would have to be provided at an expense which would be out of proportion to the circumstances of the Territory. For that and other reasons the Government desire the rejection of the Acts I have mentioned, and that the Commonwealth law shall be made applicable without creating new machinery or incurring additional expense. We also consider that there is no necessity for the retention of the Local Government Act of 1906, the Local Government (Loans) Act of 1907, and the Local Government (Amending) Act of 1908. If those Acts were operative within the Federal Territory they would give rise to differences and complications. The area comprised within the Territory forms part of several shires, and under these Acts the shire councils would, of course, have authority partly in Commonwealth territory and partly in State territory. It is provided the Governor-General shall have power to make Ordinances, so that any necessary provision can be made in that way. We also desire to reject all State Acts imposing rates, taxes, or duties, except so far as they impose duties on the estates of deceased persons. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is referring to the probate duties? All Acts of New South Wales imposing rates, taxes, or duties, &#34; except so far as they impose duties on intestate estates of deceased persons,&#34; are not to continue in force in the Territory. The reason for that is that if Stamp Acts were continued in&#39; force the Commonwealth would have to provide the necessary machinery for their administration, and that machinery might cost much more than the revenue from this source would yield.&#39; Clause 4 enables any State Acts which are continued in force to be modified by Ordinance from time to time, and also allows State Acts to be continued in operation from time to time. Clause 5 pretty well explains itself. The object of it is to make provision for the application of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-10 to the Territory. Clauses 6 and 7 are for the purpose of applying the Australian Industries Preservation Act and the Secret Commissions Act 1905. Clause 8 is considered necessary to prevent the transfer of the Territory having an adverse effect upon postal and telegraph rates. Clause 9 refers to the disposal of Crown lands. Clause 10 deals with the jurisdiction of inferior Courts. It may not be convenient at first for the Commonwealth to establish a complete judicial system of its own within the Territory. This clause gives the necessary jurisdiction to inferior Courts, such as County Courts, and Courts of Petty Sessions, in cases arising within the Territory. Clause 11 empowers the Governor-General to make Ordinances  having  the effect of law in the Territory. I hope it will be understood that the power thus taken is one which will safeguard the interests of the Commonwealth. No danger need be apprehended, because Parliament will have supreme power, and will be able to disallow any Ordinance which may be disapproved. I do not think that further explanations are required. If they are, I shall be happy to give any other information connected with the measure when we get into the Committee. </para>

                        <para>. - As one of those who put up a pretty strenuous fight against the adoption of Yass- Canberra as the site for the Federal Capital, I recognise - that site having been selected, much against my will, and in spite of my strenuous opposition - that it -was necessary for the Government to bring in a Bill of this kind. I do not propose to cavil at the measure in any way, nor do I complain because the Government have introduced it. It was essential that they should do so before the Territory was finally taken over. </para>

                            <para>- We put up a pretty stiff fight before, but we were defeated, and I, for one, accept that defeat. I did my very best to prevent the selection of Canberra, which I considered to be an unsuitable site. But Parliament having thought differently, I, in common with other citizens of Australia, whose views were rejected, am now compelled to bow to the decision. There is, however, just one point that I want to bring under the notice of the Minister. When we had before us another Bill dealing with another Territory a few days ago, we were told that because it was a Territory it dropped automatically under the control of the Department of External Affairs - that, so to speak, it could not help itself. Here is another Bill of exactly the same kind with regard to a Territory. Yet we find that it is under the control of the Minister of Home&#39; Affairs, whose representative in the Senate has introduced it. This is the first time that I ever knew that a matter could drop automatically into the control of one Department, and that a Minister representing another Department could take control of it. The form of this Bill proves my contention with regard to the Northern Territory to have been correct. Of course, I quite recognise that the Minister of Home Affairs is the proper Minister to take charge of the Federal Territory. </para>

                            <para>- That explanation may do as well as another, but neither explanation will hold water; and I regret to say that there is very little water to hold at Yass-Canberra ! This being merely a tentative measure, I do not think that there is any need to subject its clauses to a close scrutiny, or to cavil very much at them. I believe that the Government are adopting such Acts of New South Wales as are necessary to give them authority to administer the Territory in a proper manner. There is only one other point to which I wish to draw attention. It is provided in the schedule that certain Acts of New South Wales shall not apply to the Territory. Of course, none of the New South Wales Acts will apply to the Territory after we have provided our own laws in every respect, but in the meantime the New South Wales Acts are to have a general application, with the exception of those specified. Amongst the Acts which are not to apply are all Acts imposing rates, taxes, or duties, &#34; except so far as they impose duties on the estates of deceased persons.&#34; I fail to understand the reason for that exception. I recognise that if any person died within the Territory, while it remained a portion of New South Wales, and while the person was a citizen of New South Wales, he would, in all fairness, be subject to the same probate and death duties as any other citizen of the State, and that New South Wales would have the right to collect and receive those duties. If they were not duly paid, the Commonwealth should, of course, give the Government of the State facilities for collecting them. But in the case of a person dying within the Territory after it is taken over by the Commonwealth, I say that New South Wales has no right to collect death or probate duties any more than it has the right to collect duties on the estate of a person resident in Timbuctoo. Therefore, I fail to see the reason for this exception. Probably, there is a good explanation, and I hope that the Minister  will be able to give us one in Committee. If has been said, I believe, that the State of New South Wales should collect the duties within the Territory, and hand them over to the Commonwealth, less the cost of collection. But I say that we should not permit anything of the sort. We should not accept a law of New South Wales imposing duties on any citizen within the Territory without full consideration by this Parliament. If this Parliament, in its wisdom, chooses to impose duties on Commonwealth citizens in Commonwealth territory, it can do so. But until this Parliament has decided that such a mode of taxation shall be adopted we should not impose the duties by a measure of this sort. Therefore, I hope the Minister will be able to furnish us with information that will satisfy the Senate. That is all that I have to say on the Bill at this stage. I offer no opposition to it. As I have said, we put up a good fight against the selection of Yass-Canberra. We were defeated, much to my regret, and also, I may add, in my belief, much to the regret of the Honorary Minister, even though he voted for the selection, and to the regret of many other honorable senators. But, having been defeated, we have to bow to the decision of the majority, and make the best of a very bad bargain. </para>

                        <para>.- I recognise with the last speaker that we ought not to raise unnecessary opposition to this Bill. I feel just as strongly as I did on a previous occasion that this new Parliament, in which there is such a large accession of new representatives of the people should have had a voice in the selection of the Federal Capital. I also think that we should not rush into expenditure for which there is no need, and that the question of the Federal Capital might have been held over for a considerable time to come. I do not think that it is creditable to Parliament as a whole, that such an important matter should have been settled on a tie vote. It would have been much more satisfactory if further time had been given, and further consideration devoted to the question. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly so. I hope that the fine spirit which the honorable senator has displayed in approaching this administrative act will be displayed generally by the Senate, and that we shall all regard the matter as settled, leaving the Ministry to take such further steps as are necessary, with, of course, a due sense of their responsibility to the Commonwealth Parliament. I wish to add a word of comment suggested by my honorable friend and colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> who has referred incidentally to the prospective expenditure upon the Federal Territory. Opinions on the same lines have been expressed in both Houses of the Legislature, and for a long time past have been thundered out from the press, not only of Victoria, but by other important and influential journals throughout Australia. I think that too much has been said1 on that subject. I have visited&#39; the Territory, and I see no reason why, with wise administration, which we must assume will be the consequence of taking over the Territory, it should be absolutely unremunerative. On the contrary, I believe that, before long, it will pay for the cost of its establishment. By the introduction of population to the Territory., I have no doubt that all our initial expenditure will be more than recouped. I compliment the Government on the courage they have displayed in giving effect to the verdict of Parliament. In my opinion, it does not matter by what majorities the question has been advanced to its present stage. In the face of very strong opposition from some of their supporters in both Houses of this Parliament, the Government have exhibited consistency and courage. I almost despair of getting to the Capital site as speedily as I should like, but I shall now say something which I think is in the minds of many honorable senators, and that is that we shall transfer the Seat of Government from Melbourne with regret. The State of Victoria has treated the Commonwealth Parliament handsomely. I am afraid that the many attractions, especially from a social point of view, of this city may weigh with some, and lead to a desire to stay here longer, but we have a high duty to perform to the people of Australia, and in this matter, especially to the people of New South Wales, and at the earliest possible date we should establish this Parliament in a home of its own,&#39; in its own Territory. The atmosphere of a home of our own, in our own Territory, will give us a proper sense of our jurisdiction and duty to the Commonwealth as a whole which it would be impossible for us  to acquire if the .Parliament continued to meet in any State Capital. I hope that the Ministry, if they continue in power, will take every step necessary for the speedy transfer of this Parliament to the Federal Capital. We may be called upon to suffer many inconveniences if it is transferred to the Federal Capital in the immediate future, but it is our duty to the Commonwealth to assist the Government in every step necessary to establish this Parliament in the Federal Capital within its own Territory. </para>

                        J. RUSSELL (Victoria) {11. 3&#93;. - As an Australian, I have always believed that the Federal Parliament should meet in its own Territory. I have never been an advocate of delay in the settlement of the question of the Federal Capital site. I am glad that we have now a Government who are prepared to do things. I differ from them as to the site which they are agreed should be selected, but I have to admit that it has been selected. I should not be expressing my true sentiments if I did not say that I regret that the settlement of the question which is responsible for the introduction of this Bill has not been accomplished without the humiliation of the Commonwealth at the dictate of a particular State. I regret that the grand opportunity afforded for the establishment of the Federal Capital at a site on which we might have expected that it would grow to be a great city has been missed by the Commonwealth Parliament. I believe that there have been incidents connected with the settlement of the question which, perhaps, it would be better not to revive. I &#39; remind honorable senators that the people of Victoria voted for the Commonwealth Bill when it contained no provision respecting the Capital site. They manifested their desire for. Federation, and their willingness to make great sacrifices to obtain it. When, in a later Bill, it was distinctly stipulated that the Federal Capital should be established in territory in the State of New South Wales, what was the attitude of the Victorian people towards that Bill ? Even by a larger vote than they had recorded in favour of the previous measure, they declared again for Federation, and showed that their adherence to it was not affected by any question as to the location of the Federal Capital. I wish now to take exception to the advice tendered by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline>
                        that we should not expend money at present on the establishment of the Capital at Yass-Canberra. A decision having been arrived at, there is not, in my opinion, the slightest reason why there should be any unnecessary delay in giving effect to it. Those who talk about a &#34; bush Capital &#34; cannot have the slightest conception of what may be done in the Federal Territory by a large expenditure of Commonwealth money. Although I do not approve of the site selected, I honestly believe that it is not so bad as to be altogether hopeless. I do want to say that it comes very ill from the honorable senator whose vote was responsible in the first instance, for the substitution in the Senate of Yass-Canberra &#39; for Dalgety, to suggest now that we ought not to do what is necessary to carry out the contract to which we were pledged in accepting the Constitution. I have no desire to take up so parochial an attitude. Shortly after the last decision of this Parliament was arrived at, I announced that, although I had fought a strenuous fight against Yass-Canberra, and that, in my judgment, it was not the most suitable site to select, I was still sufficient of a Democrat to believe that we should accept the verdict of the majority. I do not propose to adopt the narrow attitude dictated by a few individuals, or by parochial councils in this State, who, in their endeavour to misrepresent the position  would lead the people to believe that the establishment of the Federal Capital at Yass-Canberra will cost an enormous sum of money. On the contrary, I believe that it may be made the means of considerable profit to the people.

                        <para>- That is so, but I do not believe that it need cost anything. If it does, it will be because of maladministration. To-day there is a clamour on the part of a large section of Victorians that the establishment of the Federal Capital should be delayed in every way possible. .1 have been in the forefront of the fight against Yass-Canberra, but I say that if those Victorians who voted for the Constitution, knowing of the existence of this provision, now desire to shirk their responsibility, it is most unfair to Victorian representatives in the Federal Parliament to ask them to do any such thing. I, as one who puts Australia first, refuse to be a party to anything of the sort. I do not believe that the mass of the people of Victoria will be influenced by this clamour, though they are under the impression that the best site in the interests of Australia has not been selected, and that the methods adopted for its selection were not too clean. I strongly object to the misrepresentation of the position, and I am determined that those who gave a vote to change the Capital site from Dalgety to Yass-Canberra at the beck of a Government, and for party purposes, shall not make this a party question to-day. I do not believe that the bulk of the citizens of Victoria are  parochialists  in any sense. They have, in this matter, put up a strenuous fight, in which I have joined them, in the interests not of this State, but of Australia. They have expressed an opinion on the matter on two occasions, and my regret is that the decision at first arrived at was altered, not merely by the action of politicians in another State, and I say this in justice to them, but by the treacherous action of some of the politicians of Victoria, who, now, for petty reasons, wish to further delay the settlement of this great National question. I give ray full support to this Bill, and from this time on it shall be my honest endeavour to see that the city erected on the site selected for the Federal Capital shall be made worthy of the Commonwealth, leaving the responsibility for the selection upon the shoulders of those who should bear it. </para>

But until local machinery is provided, it may be extremely advisable for many reasons to have certain work there performed by the Government of New South Wales. We took that question into account when we were considering the Seat of Government Acceptance Bill. Section 6 of that measure makes provision for the matter which has been mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline></para>

                    <para>There is a big difference between this amendment and section 10 of the Seat of Government Acceptance Act, which provides that the value of any land resumed by the Government shall not exceed its value on the 8th day of October, 1908. The amendment affirms that when lands are resumed by the Commonwealth compensation shall be paid to the owners for all improvements which they have effected up to the date of such resumption. A similar provision has been inserted in the Northern Territory (Administration) Bill, and I feel sure that it will meet with the unanimous approval of honorable senators. </para>

It is to prevent the creation of a difficulty that the proposed new clause has been submitted.

                    <para>. - Since Friday last it has been made manifest to honorable senators, at any rate it has been brought home to myself, that the standing order under which we proceed to discuss statutory regulations is so faulty that it might as well be out of the code. The Standing Orders leave a motion of this description to the mere chance as to whether or not the Government is prepared to afford an opportunity for its consideration. We can discuss this matter quite free from any party feeling, or even personal feeling, because in this case the Minister has done the right thing and agreed to furnish us with an opportunity to express our views. But I submit that there can be no sense or force in a provision that the regulations made under a law shall have force and effect, provided that either House of the Parliament does not dissent therefrom within a certain period, unless our inherent right is respected. Pressure of circumstances may crowd out the opportunity which it is clearly intended by law that we should enjoy. I think that the Standing Orders Committee should be asked to revise the standing order, so as to insure that a motion of this kind shall by right become the business of the Senate, and that an opportunity for discussing it shall be provided by the forms of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- It ought to be the business of the Senate, and not the business of the Government. It is quite evident that the Minister agrees generally with what I am saying, that an opportunity should be created, quite apart from Ministerial action, for the discussion of such a motion. Turning to the census questions, I hope that the Minister will recognise that there is an objection to some of them, or, if not, an objection to the questions themselves, an objection to making them obligatory. I do not regard most of them as objectionable so much as useless. It is highly improbable, I think, that the first three questions will elicit any information from householders and citizens generally which will have the slightest claim to be regarded as reliable. Take, for instance, the first question - </para>

                <para class="block">Any one who is acquainted with industrial life knows that a very large number of our working men are employed intermittently. It was said here the other day, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I think, that in the trade of which he has the most intimate knowledge, a man, on an average, worked nine or ten months in the year. I venture to say that an ordinary man in the trade does not keep a diary showing how many days- he has worked and in what months of the year.  His  answer to this question will be the result of a rough-and-ready guess, which is as likely to be wrong as right. We have always to draw a wide distinction between questions submitted in the census-paper which are based on some public need for the information, and questions which may rest merely on an idle curiosity, or a little fad on the part of some person who wants to know something about the business of other persons. I certainly think that the last question in the census-paper can be so described, and that is - </para>

                        <para>- How long, too, has the total abstinence to exist before one answers the census question? Suppose that a persons fills in the return between drinks. He is entitled to say, then, &#34;I am a total abstainer at the present moment.&#34; It reminds me of an inquest in which a lady was asked to give her knowledge of the deceased. Asked by the coroner as to whether the deceased was a drunkard, the lady replied, &#34; Certainly not. He only took a drink now and again.&#34; &#34; What do you mean?&#34; inquired the coroner, and the lady answered &#34; When he could get it.&#34; In the census-paper, there is no period fixed for which a person must have abstained from intoxicating drinks before he can say that he is a total abstainer. There is no question submitted in the census return which, in my opinion, will be played with more than will that question. Apart from that, I resent any one asking me what I eat or drink. They might as well ask whether I eat certain articles which a large number of persons deem injurious. Some persons have a strong belief that certain kinds of meat are highly injurious to human beings. Are we, for that reason, to be asked whether we eat those meats or not ? Why should not our habits as to narcotics also be inquired into? It seems to me that the Minister has yielded to a very zealous, very praiseworthy, but, sometimes rather fussy section of the community. I cannot believe that these questions can in any way help forward any movement for the public good. On the other hand, they do suggest something in the nature of a personal impertinence. Take, for instance, the fourth question, as to the amount of money held in the house in gold, notes, silver, and copper. I venture to say that the question invites fraud on the part of those who will have to fill in a return. A very large number of persons living in small houses will naturally hesitate to give publicity to the fact that they have a little money in their possession. They will naturally feel, even householders in large establishments, that the information, if supplied and revealed, might bring very undesirable visitors to their homes. A large number of persons who occupy the poorer homes in this country have a great deal of reluctance to tell any one, even on an official paper, what little wealth they have in their possession. I know many persons who occupy little homes. I have frequently argued with such persons on this subject, and suggested that their money should be placed in the Post Office Savings Bank; but, for some reason or other, they prefer to keep a little stock in the house. They all know that there is no protection in the house against a visitation of the kind I have suggested. They are not likely to set out in the census return that they have any money in the house ; or if they do answer the question at all, they will give information which is misleading. Now, the fate of the Ministry is not involved in the fate of this motion. The census-paper is not a plank of the Labour party. It has not been approved at any Labour conference ; and, therefore, it can be fairly argued on its merits. I venture to say that there is not a single question in this regulation which would have commended itself to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> if he had been asked to look at the questions impartially, and apart from his Ministerial position. I feel certain that they were not suggested by the officers of the Department; and a proof of that is to be found in the report of the last Inter- State Conference, at which the statisticians met and conferred over the form of the census-papers. To that Conference, any number of suggestions were made by various members; but the statisticians brushed them on one side for what I regard as an excellent reason, and that is, that they did not think it advisable to go outside the questions which have been approved after long experience by the civilized countries of the world. </para>

                        <para>- That may be taken as implied. Older countries have shaped the census questions as the result of experience. They have evidently found that there is a point beyond which inquiries cannot be pushed. It is a curious thing that nearly all the nations which take a census have practically fallen back on the questions which we had on our original paper. The statisticians saw the wisdom of following the lines which have been marked out by the experience of older countries. Now we have submitted to us a series of questions which have never been advocated by responsible persons, except in a jocular spirit. These questions have been put into the paper, not because of any merit in themselves, but as a concession to those who have asked for them. Ministers will get into a very bad way indeed if, because they are asked to do a thing, they at once show compliance. It is so easy to get out of a difficulty in that way ! .Even if the Government do not desire to abandon these questions, they should at least make them optional. If people like to answer them, let them do so ; but they should be free to decline. I venture to say that the answers furnished by volunteers might be taken to be reasonably accurate, and certainly they would furnish enough information to enable the statistician to judge as to the facts applicable to the whole community. If, for instance, you obtain information as to the coin in possession of 50 per cent, of  the population, you have sufficient data to enable you to judge of the coin in possession of the whole number of people. And so with regard to the other questions. If, however, you compel reluctant people to give answers, they will undoubtedly furnish information which, to say the least of it, will not be correct. I suggest to the Government that they might consider the desirability of making these questions optional. There may be a number of people who wish to answer them. Give them the opportunity of doing so, but do not enforce the questions. There is a large section who dislike them, and who ought not to be compelled to furnish answers. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree entirely with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in regard to this subject, except that I consider that if the questions were made optional, the answers would be absolutely useless. The result would be that people would pay no attention to them, and the figures obtained would be entirely useless. The Government do not seem to have calculated the difficulty which some people would experience in giving answers to these questions. Take that as to the amount of salary or wages earned per day or per week at the time of the census. There are workmen, whose employment is intermittent. Wharf labourers, for instance, sometimes work two days in one. While they are employed they work frequently sixteen hours at a time, and they are paid extra rates for their overtime. If a wharf labourer happened to have a good run of employment shortly before he came to fill up his census-paper, the result might appear that he was earning ,&#163;300 Or ^400 a year. But that information would be entirely misleading, because his earnings would probably average not more than <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> a week. Furthermore, it is not usual for labourers to keep accounts as to their earnings. Perhaps they earn <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> one week and <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> the next. They simply spend the money as they get it, and at the end of the year have no record as to what they have earned. If they are compelled to answer these questions they will have very great difficulty, and will probably run&#39; about asking their parliamentary representatives what they are to do. Then take the question as to the number of hours worked. How is it possible to expect an ordinary labouring man or even an artisan to answer them ? Very &#34;few of them keep a diary in which they record the time they work. Sometimes they are out of work for a week or two, and at other times they work hard for a long period. It is absolutely impossible for them to tell the numbers of hours they have worked during a year. I do not see what object the Minister can have in putting on the paper the question relating to the amount of money held in gold, in notes, in silver, and in copper. The information might be furnished by the most unintelligent member of the community, but what on earth would be the use of it when obtained ? The further question as to whether persons are total abstainers or not is absurd. The Leader of the Senate has himself given an illustration of its absurdity. He said just now - and I have frequently heard him say - that every alternate year he is a teetotaller, whilst in the other years it is a case of &#34; anyhow von like &#34; with him. It is quite probable that there are thousands of people in Australia who are teetotallers for a year, or for a month, or for three months at a time. If they happen, to be in one of their teetotal periods when the census paper has to be filled up, the information they give will be utterly unreliable. These questions appear to me to be absolutely useless and unnecessary. Moreover, they would prove to be very difficult and irksome for the mass of the people to answer. Therefore, I propose to support the motion. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline>
                    Ledger&#39;s motion to leave out the figures i., ii., and iii. The effect of that would be to enable the first three questions to stand as they are in the census paper, and to strike out the remainder. I cannot agree with
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline>
                    that it would be useless to obtain particulars as to the amount of salary or wages earned, or that it would be impossible to get a fair average reply to that question. Nor do I think that it would be difficult to obtain particulars as to the number of hours worked. As one who has worked at various occupations during a number of years, I cannot, for the life of me, see that it would be very difficult for any ordinary working man to state the number of hours, worked during the year preceding the taking of the census. Any ordinary working man. in my opinion, would be able to give particulars under that heading. Possibly the information obtained might be of great use for statistical purposes, and particularly to those who are concerned with the solution of social problems such as exercise the mind of the thinking public to a great extent nowadays. If such information would enable some problems to be worked out T think we might take advantage of the opportunity afforded by the census to obtain it.

                    <para>- There may be a little difficulty in that case, though it is not insuperable. At any rate there is a tendency nowadays to shorten the hours and lighten the labours of domestic servants. Indeed, we know there is a necessity for doing so, as is shown by the very  great  difficulty of getting a sufficient number of domestic servants under present conditions. </para>

                        <para>- There are very few members of Parliament in Australia, and the public know quite enough about their work. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story,</inline> as a contractor of experience, should know that there will not be much difficulty in getting information as to the number of hours worked by the average workman, or as to the wages earned. The figures obtained may not be of great use generally, but still they may be of some value to those who are concerned with the study of social problems. But I do not think that Ministers themselves can seriously believe that questions iv. and v. ought to be allowed to remain on the census paper. I look upon question iv. as affecting a matter that is purely one of private concern. I believe that a large&#39; number of people would object to putting down in writing what money they have in the bank, or in the house, on census day. Of course, the Savings Bank statistics are easily obtained, but the question bears an aspect of prying into the private affairs of persons, and, as such, may be resented. If the information obtained were likely to be of great value one might be disposed to overlook the inquisitorial character of the question; but under present circumstances I am satisfied that it ought not to remain on the paper. Personally, I should absolutely refuse to set down what amount cf money I had in the house, because I should think that that was a matter that concerned me alone. Question v. is even more ridiculous. I cannot understand how a responsible Minister should have al lowed a question of that sort to go upon the census paper. In my opinion, the question is an impertinence. Furthermore, what is meant by asking a person whether, he is a total abstainer from alcoholic beverages? Does the Minister mean by &#34; alcoholic beverages &#34; such liquids as are sold as patent medicines, and have been shown on analysis to contain various proportions of alcohol? Are they alcoholic beverages? A temperance lecturer might frequently take some of these quack medicines, believing they possessed valuable medicinal properties. What about the unfortunate mother who has to give her child a spoonful of gin because it has the colic ? Is that child lc- be put down as a total abstainer or as one that consumes alcoholic beverages? The question is absurd. If the object is to discover what beverages are injurious <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> health the question does not go far enough, and we should ask the householder whether he is accustomed to drink tea or coffee. I was under the doctor a few months ago, and he told me that I was slowly poisoning myself, because I was in the habit of drinking four or five cups of tea in the twenty-four hours. The question is impertinent as well as absurd, and has no doubt been included to please the total abstinence section of the community, who are engaged in what they no doubt believe to be a good work. If they want this information they ought to get it in another way. A person who is in the habit of taking a glass or two of an alcoholic beverage in a week or in a month will probably say that he is an abstainer. The answers given to this question will not be reliable, and it must fail in it&#39;s object. I move, as an amendment - </para>

                        <para>- I think there is ample justification for them. The necessity exists for obtaining the information, which, we hope, will be made available when these questions are answered. Time after time statements are made that in Australia the industrial classes work shorter hours, and receive higher remuneration, than the working classes in any other country. The Savings Banks returns are often quoted as. a further evidence of the prosperity enjoyed by the working classes in this country. We have no reliable information as to the accuracy of these statements. Is it not of importance to every one, whether he approves or disapproves of the Labour party, to know what the real conditions of the working classes are? Will any working man, or woman, have any great difficulty in replying, for instance, to the first question as to the amount of salary or wages earned per day, per week, or per month, at the time of the taking of the census; or the second question, as to the average number of hours worked during the year preceding the taking of the census? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> mentioned the case of wharf labourers, and explained that they worked very long hours at certain periods, and that, after working a certain number of hours under the rules of their organization, they are paid overtime. But there should not be any very great difficulty in arriving at the amount of money which a wharf labourer would earn during the eight hours recognised by the Union. A man might work sixteen hours in one week and twenty-six hours in the next. . But he should have no difficult)&#39; in estimating approximately the number of hours he has worked during a year, or in estimating in the same way his average earnings. We should, in this way, obtain some reliable information as to the conditions of this class of workmen. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think a member of the Senate should have any great difficulty in stating approximately the number of hours he has worked during the year. Working men and women in Australia will, I think, be able to state approximately the number of hours they have worked during the year, and their average earnings. In most occupations men &#39;have permanency of employment, and in connexion with all skilled trades organizations have fixed the rates of pay. The information which might be obtained in the* way proposed would be very useful, especially for statistical purposes. I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was serious in suggesting that the question with respect to the amount of money held in gold, notes, silver, and copper at midnight before the census day should be made optional. </para>

The returns may not at first be as satisfactory as those responsible for proposing these questions would desire, but we must make a commencement, and the people will soon see that they have nothing to be afraid of, or to be ashamed of, in answering these questions, and that they are asked in their own interests as well as in the interests of the country. </para>

With all due deference to those who hold a contrary opinion, I say that there is nothing absurd in the questions which it is proposed to ask. I believe that our citizens will answer those questions to the best of their ability. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened to the eloquent tirade from the Honorary Minister who made a laboured apology for the impertinences which are disguised in these questions. What have personal matters to do with the taking of a census ? Would it not be an impertinence if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> as a young man and a bachelor, were asked how many times a week he kissed his sweetheart? Information to be of any value must be reliable. If it is not reliable it is worse than useless, because it will only lead us to form wrong conclusions. The object of taking a census is to obtain reliable information from which fair conclusions may be drawn on matters of public interest. Hitherto in the taking of a census it has been the practice to put certain questions to householders, and as a result we have obtained valuable statistics in regard to the number, the prosperity, and the progress of the people. If we could obtain any extended knowledge upon these points by putting more questions to our citizens, this Parliament would heartily approve of those questions. But looking at the additional questions which it is proposed to put to them, I fail to see that we shall attain any such object. Indeed, I cannot understand what public interest attaches to some of these questions. Take, for instance, the question of whether or not a man is an abstainer from alcoholic beverages. The individual who has not taken a drink for an hour previous to filling in the census-paper can conscientiously say that he is a total abstainer. </para>

                        <para>- Why, in Scotland, as soon as a baby is born, it is the practice to give it a little drop of mountain dew. It is impossible to get reliable information upon a question of this sort. The Honorary Minister has said that underlying it is a desire to ascertain the social condition of the people and the progress of the forward movement - in other words, to determine whether our citizens are temperate or intemperate. What has this question to do with temperance or intemperance? As a matter of fact, the word &#34;temperance&#34; implies a moderate use of anything, not total abstinence from it. Is a man, merely because he swallows a glass of good Australian wine with his Sunday dinner, to be classed as intemperate? </para>

                        <para>- There are many points connected with this matter which require consideration. If we are to ask persons what they drink, why should we refrain from asking what they eat?  A  great many persons, indeed some of the highest scientific authorities in the world, hold that there are more evils from overeating than from over-drinking. If it  is  reasonable to start a crusade against drinking at all, because certain evils accrue from drinking to excess, would it not be just as reasonable to start a crusade against eating, because certain evils accrue from eating to excess ? </para>

                        <para>- There is a marked difference, especially in the tone of voice in which the question is asked. There are certain very good persons in the world who claim that it is a piece of cannibalism, and that it is positively injurious, to eat animal food of any kind. They argue that in order to do so life has to be sacrificed, and that all life should be held sacred. Why not ask persons whether they are vegetarian, carnivorous, or omnivorous ? The only reason why we have not a question regarding vegetarianism is simply because the vegetarians so far have not been so clamorous as have the total abstainers. I have no objection to persons advocating any of these things to the fullest extent of their power. I have no objection to them trying to do their level best to induce moderation or total abstinence. They are probably doing what they think is right, but why in the name of goodness should we take up their cause, and invade the private life of every individual in Australia in order to placate their clamour? Is there any reason for it? If reliable statistics are required, we have undoubtedly a better means of obtaining reliable information through the general conduct of the Government Departments than we have by asking questions of this sort. We know how much alcoholic liquor is introduced into Australia every year, how much is made here, and how much is exported. We have every available figure for finding out the consumption of alcoholic liquor per head of the population without putting this question at all. If we have that information in regard to the population in general, why should you pry into the private habits of persons? </para>

                        <para>- Of course they are. We know whether Australians drink to excess or not. As a matter of fact, every one knows from our statistics that Australians are a comparatively sober people, and that, instead of increasing, the consumption of alcoholic liquor is tending to decrease year by year. Nobody will answer this question in a reliable way. </para>

They can ask me the question as long as they please, but they will receive no answer, because the inquiry is a mere impertinence.

                        <para>- Everybody knows that 75 per cent, of the patent medicines are alcoholic, because alcohol is the only thing which will preserve medicine for all time. That is why patent medicines are so popular. Even the &#34; wowsers &#34; are very partial to them occasionally. Of course, I do not insinuate that it is because patent medicine is largely composed of alcohol. Possibly, they think that it is like that blessed word Mesopotamia, it brings comfort to their souls. </para>

                        <para>- When I was a boy, I knew a clergyman of the Church of England - the Reverend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gaunson</inline> - who was a most excellent man in every way, but a real crank on the question of total abstinence. He would preach it by the mile on every possible occasion. But at a banquet where there was a plum pudding he would want a soup plate to put his portion in, and he would cover it with brandy. That is not an overdrawn picture in any way. It is a case within my own experience. In Australia, that gentleman would be put down in the census returns as a total abstainer, while a man who occasionally had a modest drop of Australian light wine, in which there is very little alcohol, would have to be classed as a non-abstainer, and therefore intemperate. The whole thing is ridiculous, and I am&#39; astonished at the Government yielding to the clamour of a noisy section of busybodies who, no doubt, mean very well, but who are continually interfering with the private affairs of other persons, which should be no concern of theirs, and no concern of the Government either. I do not intend to say any more regarding that particular question, because I think that the absurdity of it is patent to every honorable senator, and,. I believe, will be patent to every person in the community, with the exception of those well-meaning people who think that they have a right to order the personal affairs of their fellow-citizens. The other questions in the census-paper savour largely of mere impertinence. I want to know why one particular class has been singled out. </para>

                        <para>- I shall name some of them directly. We have means of getting reliable information from the workers to a very large extent, owing to the operation of Arbitration Courts, Wages Boards, and other things of that kind. The information which these questions are likely to elicit from the workers will not be nearly so reliable as the general information which could be got from the sources I have mentioned. Let me remind the Minister of a case in point, and which must be within his own knowledge. The workers will not always, of their own free will, disclose the conditions under which they are working, because they are afraid to do so. It must be within the Minister&#39;s knowledge that when it was proposed to put the employes in a certain industry in Victoria under a Wages Board, or to bring them under the Commonwealth Arbitration Act, they gathered together, and signed a petition saying that they were perfectly satisfied with their position, and did not want any alteration or change. I need not name the instance, but I can do so if the Minister so desires. </para>

                        <para>- I quoted that instance to show that you cannot always rely on the information which is got over the signature of a worker, because very often he is in a cleft stick. I ask the honorable senator if it is not a fact that information regarding the rates of interest on the capital employed in industries, and the profits which accrue to the retailer and the wholesaler, is not as important to the people of this community, as what a worker earns is ? Why is not the usurer asked the rate of interest which he charges? Why is not the wholesaler asked the rate of profit which he expects to get on goods passing through his hands? Why is not the retailer asked a similar question? It is well known that for one article which is made both here and in Sydney the manufacturer gets about 4s. 6d., the wholesaler 6s. 6d., and the retailer 10s. 6d. That shows the way in which consumers are fleeced generally. Yet in the census-paper not a single question is proposed to be asked of these persons. But the workers - a class, who, as a rule, cannot help themselves very much -are singled out to be asked various questions of that kind. Workers generally do not keep a diary or an account. If at the end of a year, you were to ask a workman how many days he had lost, or how much he was out through loss of time during the year, the probability is . that he would be able only to give you a mere guess estimate. Under question ii., persons are asked to give an accurate account of matters which it must be evident that not five per cent. of the workers will be able to give. What is the use of information if it is not reliable? A man in regular and steady employment might be able to answer question iii., as to the number of hours worked per week or per day, but there are hundreds of other instances in which men would not be able to give the information. Take the case of a member of Parliament. How could he state how many hours a day he worked? Many a member of Parliament, when walking about, and supposed to be taking recreation, is really cudgelling his brains to the fullest extent with regard to public problems. Work of that kind is as wearying as any other work. It is also impossible to give accurate information in answer to question iv. , which requires an account to be given of the amount of money in coin or notes in the possession of every person recorded at the census. Take the case of the Grand Hotel, in which there may be 200 guests on census night. The manager is supposed to give, not only details regarding the coin and notes in his own possession, but also similar data regarding every person in his hotel on that particular night. Suppose I was staying there, and the manager came to me, and asked how much money I had in my pockets. I should regard the question as an impertinence, and should be very likely to give a rather uncivil answer. But if this question were insisted upon the manager of the hotel would be compelled to be guilty of that impertinence. Then, take the case of an individual who has three or four women working for him, and residing in his house. There are thousands of such cases all over Australia. Is the head of the household to go to a girl or to a gardener, and say, &#34; How much money have you in your possession tonight?&#34; Such a question could only be regarded as impertinent, and I do not think that it would lead to the obtaining of any reliable information. It is also well known that in some parts of the world there are many people who have a passion for hoarding. The habit is particularly prevalent in India, where the people seem to have little use for banks, and are fond of hoarding coin and precious stones in order that they may be in possession of wealth in its most compact and portable shape. That habit exists also in a more limited degree in every part of the world. A case occurred recently in Melbourne, where a poor woman who was supposed to be an object of pity on account of her poverty died, and was found to be in possession of a very large sum. Within my own experience I have known of a case in which an old man lived alone, in absolute want and misery, and continually on the verge of starvation. He lived in a frightful state of filth, simply because he would not allow any one to come near him. But when he died it was found that he had . &#163;1,170 in cash in his possession. There are scores of other cases of the kind. If a man or a woman will endure hardships, and live in a condition of actual starvation and misery while being possessed of large sums of money, it is quite evident that such persons will not give accurate information to the Government. In addition to the questions being objectionable, on their own account, they will fail to elicit information of a reliable character, and I would emphasize the fact that absolute ignorance is less liable to lead one astray than unreliable information. For these reasons, I trust that the motion will be carried. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to hear from the Minister what is the object of selecting the salaried and wage-earning classes as those which should be required to furnish returns of salaries and wages? If we wish to ascertain the wealth of the people and its proportionate distribution, why should not all incomes be included? There are thousands of people in Australia who are in receipt of large incomes, but who do not earn wages or salaries. </para>

                        <para>- The information that might be obtained under this heading would be very valuable, but it must be incomplete unless we have information regarding incomes as well as salaries and wages. I should like to see the first question amended in the direction I have indicated. What we want to get is reliable information. I entirely disagree with question iv., for the reasons which have been very well advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> - that we are not likely to obtain reliable information under that heading. But with the concluding questions on the paper I am in entire agreement. It has been claimed that the temperance cause has progressed very rapidly in recent years. </para>

                    <para>. - Some time ago there were circulated amongst honorable senators copies of the cards proposed to be issued to our householders, to be filled in on census night. One of the questions on the cards required persons to fill in particulars as to the amount of money on their persons at the time the census was taken. Now the question has been altered, and the individual is required to give particulars of the amount of money on his person at the moment of midnight. It appears to me that that question will only apply to night owls and politicians. </para>

                        <para>- It is proposed that a man shall be asked to say what amount of money he holds in notes, gold, silver, and copper at the moment of midnight preceding the census day. On the card which was circulated to honorable senators as a sample of the cards which would be distributed for the collection of the census return, there appears these words  - &#34; Notes and coin in circulation - State here amount of money held by <inline font-style="italic">you,</inline> that is on your person, &#38;c.&#34; I direct attention to the absurdity of inviting people to say how much money they hold on their persons at the moment of midnight. A large number of people will have to sit up late that night in order to be able to answer this question, and be sure that they would not make a mistake about it. One might not object so much to these questions if it were not for the fact that a serious penalty will attach to those who neglect to answer them, or answer them incorrectly. In section 14 of the Census and Statistics Act of 1905 it is provided that- </para>

                        <para>- I am; but that is the business of the State, and not of the Commonwealth, and the Federal Government cannot compel the State authorities to disclose the contents of my income-tax return. A man is to be asked to state what salary or wages he receives per day, per week, or per month, and the Minister of Defence, speaking on this motion, stated that what is desired is to learn, not what a man earns per day, per week, or per month, but what he earns within the whole year. It is expected that it will be shown that men who receive in wages 10s., 12s., or it may be 14s., a day are often very lucky if they secure nine or ten months&#39; work in a year. But that information cannot be obtained from the answer to this question. The Government will be unable to get the very information they are looking for if the question is to be submitted in this form. It will, of course, be possible for men engaged in certain trades to state the average number of hours they work per day, but I point out that that is regulated by&#39; Wages Boards, and we shall not gain anything by putting to the people &#39; a question the answer to which is already known. How will Ministers answer this question? Will they be able to put down how many hours per day they work? &#39; If they answered the question correctly, they would probably say that they are always working, except when they are asleep. I take my average working day to be represented by the difference between twenty-four hours and my average sleeping time at night. If the answers to these questions will not supply us with information that is worth having, it is not worth while including them in the census-papers, especially when the neglect to answer them may involve a person in a penalty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10.</inline> We have no justification for these questions in any reports from Departments, or from any one consulted on the subject. I remind honorable senators that in 1900 there was a Conference of all the Statisticians of the States and of New Zealand in connexion with the census taken in 1901. The recommendations of that Conference may be found in Volume VI. of the <inline font-style="italic">Votes and Proceedings</inline> of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales for 1900. The report of the Conference is signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> A.Coghlan, the present Agent-General of New South Wales, who was  president  of the Conference; James J. Fenton, J. Hughes, L. H. Sholl, Malcolm A. C. Fraser, R. M. Johnston, and E. J. Von Dadelszen. No honorable senator will question <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan</inline> as an authority- on statistical returns. All the members of the Conference were men experienced in such matters, and they drew up a schedule, which honorable senators can see for themselves, for the taking of the census in Australia and New Zealand. The Census and Statistics Act makes provision for a householder&#39;s schedule, and the schedule drawn up by the Conference makes provision for obtaining all information asked for in these regulations, with the exception of the personal and absurd questions to which we object. Any one might fill up that&#39; schedule with comparative ease. The Government propose that personal cards shall be filled up by the householder, in addition to the householder&#39;s schedule, and, instead of making it as easy as possible for people to give information necessary for statistical purposes, the scheme proposed will make it difficult and inconvenient. So far as I can see, an hotel proprietor may be called upon to fill up  200  or  300  of these bits of paper. If the Government could show that any one who knows anything about the subject has recommended this departure from the householder&#39;s schedule recommended by the Conference of Statisticians, well and good ; but I venture to say that they cannot prove that any one with a knowledge of the subject has recommended this proposal. This thing is a fad of a man who, as we all know, is very prone to working off bad and indifferent jokes upon the public. This is an additional joke which he is trying to work off upon them. 1 hope that honorable senators will knock out the faddy part of the regulation if the Government do not see fit to withdraw it altogether, and fall back upon the householder&#39;s schedule recommended in  1900  by the statisticians of Australia and New Zealand. </para>

                            GOULD (New South Wales)  &#91;2.43&#93;.-  I understand that it is proposed that the answers to these questions as to the amount of salary or wages, hours worked, money held, and whether a person is a total abstainer or not, are to be included in the householder&#39;s schedule. It has been suggested that these personal particulars will be given under seal ; but if they are to be included in the householder&#39;s schedule, it means that he must make an inquiry of all persons on his premises on the night when the census is taken to secure the information, and they will be liable to a serious penalty if they do not give it. How can&#34; there be any secrecy preserved in the circumstances? I assume, for the sake of argument, that there are a dozen people in my house on the night of the census, including the members of the family, persons employed, and, possibly, a visitor. These people will have to give me their answers to all of these questions, in order that I may fill up the householder&#39;s schedule. They will have to tell me what salary or wages they are earning, the money they have in hand, and whether they are total abstainers or not. What secrecy will there be in that? I think it has been pointed out that the question which it is proposed to put to householders in reference to salary or wages will apply only to one section of the community. Let me take the case of a member of this Senate. The question at once arises, &#34; Does he receive a salary, or does he not?&#34; Assuming that he does receive a salary of  &#163;600  a year, of what value is that information when it has been supplied? He may have money invested in shares, houses, and land, from which he may derive an income. Yet he will not be asked to give information in regard to these matters. But the wage-earner must supply full information, in the first instance to his employer, and afterwards to the Government.

We know that one tradesman will receive  12s.  per day, and so much per hour overtime, whilst another tradesman will receive  15s.  per day. But of what use is it to ascertain that a carpenter is employed  100  days, or  200  days in the year? Of what value is it from a statistical stand-point? </para>

                        <para>- If I earn  , &#163;200  a year, and the honorable senator receives&#163;100, of what value will that information be from a statistical point of view? Such particulars will merely enable the Government to strike an average, and to say that men earn so much a year. But are we going to publish to the world information that Australia is a place in which one can, or cannot, obtain good wages ? The real truth is that one man may be a waster, whilst another may be a grafter. To average their earnings in these circumstances will be to absolutely mislead people. Somebody has suggested that domestic servants work fifteen or eighteen hours per day. What is the real position? They have to work hard, probably, for a couple of hours in the morning, and for a similar period in the afternoon, and in the evening. But for the remainder of the time they practically do nothing, if we except an occasional call upon their services. The Honorary Minister has defended these questions merely because they have been framed under a regulation which has been issued by the Minis  try. I come now to the question of whether or not a man is a total abstainer from alcoholic beverages. This Parliament is regarded as one of the most abstemious Legislatures in the world. A very small amount indeed is expended in our parliamentary refreshment-room on intoxicants. But, after all, how many honorable senators can say that they are total abstainers? Because they cannot say that, are we to brand them as a body of men who are addicted to drink? </para>

                        <para>- Let me assume that a man takes a glass of wine, perhaps, once a month. Can he call himself a total abstainer? Certainly not. I have always understood that a temperance reformer is a man who wishes to make people sober, but who does not really object to persons taking drink in moderation. The evil of which he complains is drinking to excess. Consequently, he says to this individual or that, &#34; Possibly drink does not injuriously affect you, but, for the sake of example to others, you should become a total abstainer.&#34; That may be a very good principle to lay down, but it does not appeal to everybody. The replies which will be given to this question will be absolutely valueless, and the information thus obtained is not information which is required under any other Census Act in the world.

                <para>These are the particulars which the Act requires to be supplied, and, no doubt, they are all capable of being defended. In regard to the question of a person&#39;s religion, it is optional whether he furnishes the desired information. Under the section which I have just quoted, the words, &#34; any other prescribed matters &#34; are held to open the door to the supply of the widest information. But my opinion is that they relate to prescribed matters of a like character. There is a maxim of law known as <inline font-style="italic">ejusdem generis</inline> which applies in matters of this kind. Many persons object even to the provisions of our Census and Statistics Act, on the ground that they are unnecessarily inquisitorial. I hold that to ask a man whether or not he is a total abstainer is an impertinence. Further, any such information is not worth the snap of one&#39;s fingers from a statistical point of view. There are many persons who have just as great a detestation of tobacco and narcotics as they have of drink. Drinking and smoking are both habits which grow upon one gradually. Neither tobacco nor drink are necessaries, unless a man has become so habituated to their use that he would experience a period of depression if he attempted to forego them. My idea is that in seeking statistical information we should carefully abstain from inquiring into a man&#39;s private avocation and methods of living. Many of the test men in the world would resent such inquiries, although they could answer them with the clearest conscience. We judge of a man&#39;s character from our knowledge of him. But we do not blazon it forth to the world that he is a secret drinker, or is addicted to some other secret vice. It is true that we may have an idea that he has such vices, and that that suspicion may influence our treatment of him. But we should never ask questions of a man which cannot be justified from a public stand- point. Under what authority do the Government intend to ask a householder to fill up two schedules? It is true that the Department may put any question to an individual. </para>

If a person is in a railway train, I presume that the conductor or guard would have to obtain the information necessary; but if that is not his duty, the traveller would have to give it. I fail to see where the Government are authorized to ask for other information. It may be that I have overlooked some provision, and I shall be very pleased if the Minister will explain how they are justified in asking for double information - from the householder and also from the individual. I do not know that a precedent for it can be found anywhere. I certainly cannot find a justification for it in the Census and Statistics Act. If it can be shown that it is justifiable, I shall be glad to have the authority pointed out to me, but if it is not legal, it will be a serious mistake, I think, for the Government to ask persons for information which they are not bound to give. I hope that the Minister will take the whole of these matters into his consideration. I trust that if he cannot give the Senate an explanation to-day, he will ask the Attorney-General by what authority questions of this sort can be put. I know that very often in a Department there is an idea that certain information can be obtained. While I have due regard for the ability of the officers therein, still I do not look upon them as infallible guides as to what the law is, even with regard to many matters with* which they have to deal. </para>

                        <para>- No; but once the Government have accepted a recommendation from an officer, and placed it before the Senate, it is their policy, and not an individual&#39;s. I do not believe in a Minister saying at any time, &#34; This recommendation is made to us by our officer, and, therefore, we place it before the Senate. The only justification is that it is recommended by an officer. We consider that it is a wise one, and, therefore, we accept the whole responsibility for it.&#34; In this case, however, zeal has been allowed to outrun the discretion of the Department for the purpose of giving information to some persons who are very earnest in certain matters which they have taken in hand. No one can do other than recognise the energy and the conscientiousness with which our temperance friends advocate what they believe to be best in the interests of the community at large. But that does not justify the inclusion in the census-paper of a question as to whether a man is a total . abstainer from alcoholic beverages. Again, it may be that, from a particular stand-point, one wants to show to the world how much or how little wages are earned in Australia, or how many or how few hours are worked. But what is the value of the information? We have laws providing that men shall only work for a certain number of hours, and shall receive certain wages. Some persons say that there is too much employment, and others that there is not enough. I believe that many honorable senators on the other side say that in several trades in the cities today there are more men than there are billets offering. On the other hand, I hold that in the great cities, particularly in the building trades, there is employment available for four times as many men as are engaged on the works which are in hand. </para>

                        <para>-  I hope that it may be so, and I shall congratulate the honorable senator  when I see evidence of the prosperity. If there has been a check put to private enterprise of late, it has been because of changes which have taken place during the last few months. I hope that this motion will commend itself to honorable senators, and that it will be recognised by the Government that it is undesirable to make the inquiries to which I have drawn their attention. After all, we have to bear in mind that the motion deals with the subject-matter of regulations, on which every honorable senator can afford to have his own opinion, whether he be a supporter or an opponent of the Administration under whose authority the regulations were made. </para>

                    <para>. - I take a certain amount of interest in the census-paper, not only from the point of view of a senator, but because I did a little work in connexion with the taking of the last census in Victoria. I quite agree with the idea which apparently is in the mind of the Minister of Home Affairs when he seeks to obtain the most complete, concise, and accurate information on certain points for the compilation of statistics and the use of taxpayers. But there is such a thing as carrying an idea to an absurdity. In my view, one or two of the census questions are absurd in the extreme, and should not be asked by any responsible Government. I consider that questions iv. and v., for instance - especially the latter - only play into the hands of a small but noisy section. To carry these inquiries to their logical conclusion, I do not see why these questions should not be addressed to the taxpayers-&#39; &#39; Do you indulge in gambling?&#34; &#34; Do you smoke tobacco ?&#34; &#34;Do you send for tickets&#39; in Tattersalls ?&#34; &#34;Do you play two-up?&#34; They might be asked whether they do a dozen-and-one other things to which the &#34;wowsers&#34; say people are addicted? I hope that the questions will be dealt with seriatim, because there are one or two which I think will elicit information useful to members of Parliament and the taxpayers generally. It was very difficult for the ordinary man in the street to answer the questions which were put at the last census. One enumerator in Victoria assured me that he had to fill in the religion of between 100 and 200 or 300 persons, who had not supplied the desired information. He explained the method by which he arrived at a man&#39;s religion. If a person had signed his name as Michael Rafferty, he did no&#39;t put him down as a </para>

                <para class="block">Wesleyan. Even though we may try to get as accurate information as possible, if we overload the census-paper we shall obtain a number of hypocritical answers, and, in many cases, answers which will be inaccurate. I cannot understand why the Minister did not go even further, and include the question - &#34; Which one of the Ten Commandments have you broken?&#34; or &#34; Have you carried out all the Commandments ?&#34; I object to questions iv. and v. being included in the census-paper, especially in view of the fact that it is provided, in section 26 of the Census and Statistics Act, that the replies to all questions must be exact - and the word &#34; exact &#34; is underlined on the envelope which is given with the householder&#39;s census-form 6 - and the penalty for giving an inaccurate reply is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;50.</inline> I should be very sorry indeed to see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> mulcted in that sum for refusing to give an accurate answer to question v. He has informed the Senate that he will not answer it, and, therefore, I presume that he will become liable to the penalty. I think that the&#39; questions included in this regulation savour very much of absurdity. Indeed, they are almost as absurd as a question which a deputation of which I was a member asked the Minister to include, and that was the size of an individual&#39;s backyard. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree that, for hygienic and sanitary reasons, it would be well for the members of this Parliament to know the conditions of the toilers in the slums of the great cities; but I say, without fear of contradiction, that in many cases it is impossible for a person to ascertain the superficial area of his backyard. A man would need to be a qualified surveyor to give the information. To ask a question which it is impossible for a person to answer with any degree of accuracy is only to load up the census-paper and to elicit answers which will be totally inaccurate. I hope that the Government will listen to reason, and see the wisdom of eliminating some of the silly questions from the census-paper. </para>

                        <para>- I always treat the Minister in charge of the business before the Senate with a certain amount of deference, because I know that very often he has to bring down a measure in which, perhaps, he does not believe. The Cabinet may have decided on the terms of this regulation. Possibly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> may disagree with the questions, but, as a member of the Cabinet, he has to come here and put the best face on them he can. I think that the questions are unnecessary. The first question is, I think, inquisitive, because it applies to only a certain class, and that is persons who have to earn their living. If I had had to draft the question, it would have applied to all persons, and it would have taken this form, &#34; The amount of income, salary, or wages per day, or per week, or per month, at the time of the Census.&#34; That would have elicited the amount of income of a number of persons who do not do any work. But, &#34;by their question, the Government only seek to ascertain the amount of salary or wages which is earned. I think it would be better to get the amount of income of persons who do not do any work. On that ground, I oppose the question included in the regulation. </para>

                        <para>- The second question ought, I think, to have taken this form, &#34; The total amount during the year ending 31st December preceding the Census.&#34; So that if a man had received so much as salary or wages, and so much as income, we should elicit exactly the amount of his earnings and his income respectively, as is done under the Income Tax Act. That would have been a far better form in which to make the inquiry, but I do not think that it is necessary at all. As to question iv., do the Government really think that they are likely to obtain accurate replies ? Hundreds of people in this country will simply say, &#34; This question is impertinent.&#34; They will simply empty their pockets, and say, &#34; Nothing in them.&#34; The Government may depend upon it that if people take exception to a question they will always find a way of avoiding an answer to it. I really cannot understand why such inquisitive questions should be included in the paper. What has it to do with the Government of the Commonwealth whether I have in my pocket id. or &#163;1 ? </para>

                        <para>- I have seen a few censuses taken, and hope to see a few more ; and I am convinced that the simpler the questions are, and the closer they adhere to usual lines, the more reliable the information obtained is. If a number of useless questions are included, people treat them with utter contempt, and either refuse to answer or give misleading answers. As to question v., I have not the slightest doubt that the persons who induced the Minister of Home Affairs to include it in the paper did so with the best intentions. But, nevertheless, I am convinced that they will not obtain reliable information in answer to it. I do not blame them, but I am sure they have been misled. Suppose a man has in his house a groom, or a gardener, and three or four female servants. He will have to ask each of them for information to enable him to fill up the census-paper. </para>

The householder is the only person who can be held responsible, unless the Government send round a whole army of people to obtain answers. The householder, therefore, will call in John, the gardener, and ask him whether he is a total abstainer. If the master of the house is inclined that way; John will, perhaps, say &#34; Yes.&#34; All the maids in the house will do the same. But in reality they may not be total abstainers. What will be the use of information of that kind? I wish it to be understood that I do not object to such information being obtained if it is reliable. The questions are somewhat inquisitorial, but my chief objection is not on that ground. I am perfectly satisfied that the information obtained will be totally unreliable. So many thousands of people declare that they are total abstainers, but they may be nothing of the kind. </para>

                        <para>- Excepting the honorable senator, I believe David. The Vice-President of the Executive Council never told a lie in his life - and God forgive me for saying so ! I do not believe that the Government want to obtain inaccurate information. They want to get facts which can be depended upon. A man may have been a total abstainer twelve months ago, and may be so again next year, but he may be indulging in a little alcohol at the time the census is taken. There must be tens of thousands of instances of that kind, all of which will  go to  render the information obtained fallacious. </para>

A man who had no liquor on census-day might truthfully state that he had been an abstainer on that day, but, at the same time, he might be found drunk in the gutter next week. Do the Government really think that they are going to get these questions answered in the way we want them answered ? </para>

                        <para>- Human nature is so constituted that people do not like their private affairs to be inquired into by a Government. Already there is an outcry against these questions. Hundreds of people say that they are ridiculous. When public opinion is against a project of this kind, people will find some way of evading the questions. I have known people who objected to stating on the census-paper whether they were members of the Church of England, Roman Catholics, Wesleyans, or members of any other religion. I have known people to give the answer, &#34; No religion,&#34; simply as a matter of bravado. They cannot be punished for doing so. </para>

                        <para>- These questions almost invite untrue answers. I am satisfied that thousands of wrong replies will be given. No doubt the people who influenced the Minister of Home Affairs to place on the census-paper the question regarding total abstinence are serious and honest, but I beg leave to tell them that the information which they will obtain will be totally worthless. I hope, even at this stage, that the Government will see their way to leave these extra questions off the paper. </para>

                    <para>. - I feel inclined to support the Government in respect to the questions they have placed upon the census-paper, because I believe it is essential in the interests, not only of the Legislature, but of the public generally, that we should obtain authentic information on such subjects. How can we obtain the information unless we put questions to the people in a straightforward fashion? In our public discussions in the past we have had to rely too much on vague generalities. We want to know accurately how particular sections of our people live and work. What reasonable objection can there be to that? No one ought to have the slightest hesitation about answering the questions. I cannot see why a man should object to stating whether he is a total abstainer or not. He ought to know that it is in the public interest that we should ascertain how many total abstainers there are in the country, and people should be inclined to suppress their inclinations somewhat for the purpose of obtaining information which will be for the public good. In this case the public good is represented by the desirableness of gaining as much reliable information as we possibly can about the habits of the people. We have been told that a man may be a total abstainer one day and a hard drinker the next. But the census-papers will, at all events, enable us to ascertain what proportion of total abstainers and drinkers there may be in any particular grade in the community. We shall be able to say that the drinking element is proportionately large or small in any particular social grade. If we obtain that authentic information it will be a powerful argument in the hands of those who represent any special interest in this Parliament, which they can use at any future period when an attempt is made to represent - as is often done - that certain elements in the community are constantly in dependent circumstances because of their drinking habits. It is very necessary to remove the stigma so often attached to the wage-earning com- &#39;munity &#39; when it is alleged that their ragged and wretched condition is due to their over-indulgence in strong drink. If we can secure information as to the quan.tity of strong drink consumed in the different grades of society, a big step forward will be made. We might, from the answers to this question, be able to remove a stigma attaching to the reputation of Australia from certain particulars which I ,&#39; find noted iri <inline font-style="italic">Mulhall&#39;s Dictionary of Statistics.</inline> This is a well-known and celebrated publication ; and at page  58  of the edition I have here, I find that Australia is shown to be a very hard-drinking country. It is, in this respect, placed alongside the United States, and far ahead of Canada. Yet, I find, from an article published in <inline font-style="italic">Lone Hand,</inline> that Australia is not only not a hard-drinking country, but is one of the soberest countries in the world. In this article, the statement is . made that the consumption of spirits per head of population in Australia is only three-quarters of a gallon. In the United States, it is  1  gallon ; in Germany,  1 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> gallons ; Austria-Hungary,  2,  gallons ; and Denmark, <inline font-style="italic">t.\</inline> gallons. The consumption of beer per head of population in Australia is given at  11  gallons ; in the United States,  15  gallons; Denmark,  20  gallons; Germany,  26  gallons; the United Kingdom, 29 gallons ; Belgium,  48  gallons ; and Bavaria,  54  gallons. On the authority of the writer of this article, Australia is shown to be a remarkably sober country. </para>

The questions as to the character of the buildings in which people are living, the spaces by which they are surrounded, and the other matters upon which information is to be sought, should supply particulars of great value to the students of sociology, the legislator, and all called upon to frame laws for the improvement of hygienic conditions.- I see no objection, either, .to asking a man what is his religion. If I have sufficient courage to profess a religion, I am prepared openly to avow it, and to tell any person, without hesitation, what religion I profess. It is the practice, in all civilized countries in the world, to ascertain the religions professed by their people; and we are in this matter following a well-beaten track. I am prepared to support the Government in asking this question, and particularly in asking the questions framed to enable us to ascertain, as nearly as possible, the social condition of the people. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not wish to exercise the right of reply on my motion ; but I wish to make a suggestion for the convenience of honorable senators. I suggest that it would be an advantage if honorable senators were given an opportunity to vote on each of these questions. If that&#39; opportunity is afforded, I shall vote against each of them, but I think it would be well that honorable senators should be given an opportunity to exercise their discretion in the matter. </para>

I point out that if the amendment is put and negatived, the Senate will have affirmed that questions i., ii., and iii. should stand ; and the motion then cannot be separated to that extent. If, however, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> desires to withdraw his amendment, and has the leave of the Senate to do so, I can treat the question as a complicated one, and put each sub-section separately. </para>

                    <para>.- Will the Vice-President of the Executive Council state whether he has any objection, upon the call of the Senate of which notice has been given being taken on Tuesday, to adjourn the matter in connexion with which the call is made until the Wednesday following? Certain honorable senators will not be able to be present on Tuesday, and it is desirable that there should be a full response to the call. </para>

                    <para>. - I am prepared to do whatever will suit the convenience of honorable senators next week. When the call is made, I propose, if the Senate is agreeable, to- postpone the call, so that it may apply to Wednesday, if that can be done, in order to give every honorable senator an opportunity of responding to the call, and also of voting on the third reading of the constitutional measures in question. The Leader of the Opposition also asked earlier in the day for an indication, of the probable date of the prorogation of Parliament. I had a consultation with the Acting Prime Minister, who said that, as far as he could see, the possibility was that we should be able to conclude the work of the session by this day fortnight. He added that there was a possibility of concluding the session earlier, but that that would depend entirely upon honorable members themselves. If we can finish before this day fortnight, the Government, will be very well satisfied. </para>
