                <para class="block">I wish to repeat my objection to legislating by regulation, particularly in a matter of this kind, where such a radical departure is proposed to be -made. The Minister has already declared that the Government desire that the way shall be open to a person occupying the humblest position in the stokehold of a vessel, to rise by gradations ro the top of the engineering profession. That being so, we should place the position beyond all doubt by specifying our intention in the Bill. We are all anxious to remove obstacles from the path of those who desire to qualify themselves as engineers. Why, then, should we not express our intention in the Bill in clear and unmistakable language? Why should we leave it open to any Minister, by means of a regulation, to defeat the will of Parliament? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> has referred to the great danger which would result from allowing incompetent persons to take charge of machinery at sea. I quite agree with him in his contention. But I would point put that breakdowns frequently occur at sea with which engineering skill is powerless to cope. For instance, none of the steamers of less than  8,000  tons, trading to Australia, carry a lathe aboard, so that all repairs which may have to be effected upon them while at sea must be effected by the use of the hammer, chisel, and file. If the propeller shaft of one of these steamers be broken it cannot be repaired. That is what happened to the <inline font-style="italic">Monowai</inline> the other day, and we all know that she had to be towed into Sydney Harbor. </para>

                        <para>- No. Yet the regulations may do so. Of course, it has been urged that these cases can be met by regulation. But I recognise that we may have in power a Minister who is a strong believer in craft unionism - that is, of making one particular branch of trade a close preserve for the persons who follow it. Seeing that the Committee wish to provide means of promotion to persons who choose to qualify themselves as engineers, we ought not to leave this matter to a regulation which may be altered at the whim of a Government, or of a Minister. We should be courageous enough to plainly declare our intention in the Bill. Under this measure the sphere of employment of a third-class engineer will be circumscribed. He will not be able to take charge of any steam vessel of more than fifty nominal horsepower. </para>

My object is to safeguard the interests of those persons who are endeavouring to obtain a third-class engineer's certificate. My proposal is a very simple one, and will merely express in plain words the intention of this Committee. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> amendment, if adopted, will impose a distinct bar upon the man who has become qualified by being indentured to the engineering trade. Why should we say that a man who has sacrificed time in order to learn that trade shall be subject to a disability? The idea of the Government is that there shall be two methods of securing a third-class engineer's certificate. In the case of a man who has sacrificed time and money to learn the engineering trade we will dispense with an examination so far as engineering knowledge is concerned. But if he has not served a term of apprenticeship to that trade we shall subject him to an elementary examination of a practical character. I am in a position to indicate, roughly, what that examination will be. He will have to be able to weld a piece of bar or round iron, to file a key way, or fit a key, to screw a bolt and cap a nut, and also to turn a pin or a small shaft. That is the examination which the Government have in draft in the form of a regulation under this provision. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> may say that the Ministry are not in earnest. </para>

                        <para>- By examination. It has been generally admitted that under the proviso to this clause, . once a man becomes a third engineer he will, subject to regulations to be framed, be enabled to go right on. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> amendment really proposes a prohibition, and casts a slur upon what ought to be regarded as a very desirable qualification. It might reasonably be admitted that it would be an advantage to an engineer to have served an apprenticeship as such. Why should we discourage indentures or refuse to recognise an apprenticeship as a qualification? The Government propose by regulation, in the way I have indicated, to secure that a person who has no certificate of indenture or apprenticeship to present shall be possessed of a certain amount of engineering knowledge. </para>

                        <para>- This Bill will neither raise nor lower their existing qualifications, but it will be possible for them under the proviso to this clause to obtain a third-class engineer's certificate for the Commonwealth, which will be a better certificate than they hold at present. I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will not press his amendment. I have given him an assurance as to what the Government propose to do. I remind the honorable senator that if carried his amendment would take the matter no further, whilst it would impose a. limitation which would not otherwise be imposed. The honorable senator proposes that indentures of apprenticeship shall not be imperatively required, but it would be open to the Government by regulation, even though his amendment were carried, to require a thousand and one other things. They might require proof of four years' shop experience, which would be the equivalent of a certificate of apprenticeship. I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to trust the Government in the matter, now that he has their assurance that they will do what is right. </para>

                        <para>- No ; but they should be supplied with the material and tools necessary to repair damages at sea. I may give the Committee a little personal experience in this connexion. On one voyage I made in the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> to Tasmania, something went wrong with one of the turbines just as the vessel got outside Port Phillip Heads, and, if we had not had men on board with shop experience, the damage could not have been repaired. One of the turbines was disconnected, and the ves'sel resumed her voyage at a slow speed. The second turbine was taken out, the necessary repairs effected, the turbine replaced, and the ship was back in Melbourne within her contract time. If we had had on board men who had only had sea-going experience, they would never have seen such work done, and would have been unable to effect the necessary repairs. </para>

                        <para>- I have told the Committee what actually took place. Some honorable senators would appear to think that men should receive certificates as engineers who would be unable to effect such' repairs. In my opinion we cannot put men through too strict a test when the lives of crew and passengers may depend upon their qualifications for the positions they fill. The test which the Minister of Defence has explained men seeking a third-class engineer's certificate would be required to go through if they had no certificate of apprenticeship, is a very simple one indeed. </para>

                        <para>- It is not a difficult operation. I have known men who did not claim to be engineers to cut a key- way in a shaft with a drum and it remained sound for years. We have no reason to believe that the Government are deceiving the Committee, and the Minister of Defence has plainly stated the test which a man applying for a third-class engineer's certificate would be expected to pass if he had had no shop experience. I like to see men rise if they possess the necessary qualifications, but I do not wish to see men foisted into positions for which they are not qualified. I cannot support the amendment. </para>

I have here the regulations relating to the examinations for engineers in South Australia. With respect to engineers of vessels trading on the River Murray within the limits of a port or between the ports of St. Vincent and Spencer Gulfs, a candidate for a third-class engineer's certificate must be twenty-one years of age. He must have served at least one year at sea in the foreign-going or intercolonial service in the capacity of fireman, stoker, greaser, or donkeyman. He must have served at least eighteen months at sea in the coast trade as a fireman or as a fireman or assistant engineer on the River Murray or within the limits of a port. He must have had at least eighteen months' experience in a factory or other works as an engine-driver, or as the driver or stoker of a locomotive. These are alternative qualifications required. </para>

                        <para>- I heard no such assurance. The only thing I had to guide me was a test to be passed by a man who wished to rise from the third class to the second class - a test which, as I said yesterday, not  50  per cent, of the Board of Trade chief engineers sailing on our coast could pass. I want to show the reason why men should not be debarred from qualifying. In every State the possession of a third-class engineer's certificate enables the holder to take charge of a vessel within certain limits, but service in such capacity does not in any way qualify a man for a certificate of a higher grade, the qualifications for which are laid down in clause  22. </para>

                        <para>- We are revising the conditions and bringing into existence three classes of engineers who have not existed previously. The whole point with me is, How are men who have qualified as third-class engineers to rise to the second class, and afterwards to the first class? Certainly the proviso says that every man shall be given an opportunity to rise, but I do not know how it is to be done, because, if we compare the clause with the manning scale, it will be seen that there is no possibility, especially if we adopt the regulations of the Board of Trade for second-class and first-class Board of Trade certificates. </para>

                        <para>- In my opinion, he is wiped out under the Bill. There are hundreds of such persons in this State. A third class engineer is recognised by the Bill; but how is he to rise to the second class, and afterwards to the first class, and, after he has received a first class coastal certificate, how will it be possible for him to get a Board of Trade certificate ? The manning scale shows that he will never be in charge of a ship with horse-power sufficient to enable him to go up for a second class certificate. That is the position which we have to face. I am sorry that the last amendment was not passed. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> remarks would have been very interesting and appropriate on the second reading of the Bill; but I fail to see that they have any bearing on this amendment limiting the conditions which are to be prescribed when a person who holds no certificate seeks an initial certificate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> wandered away to deal with the hard fate of a man who, having one certificate, wants to get a certificate of a higher grade. We are not dealing with that class of man at present.  His  interests are covered by another clause. I believe that last night w'e gave to him all the consideration which he could reasonably expect, in smoothing his path to the second class, and afterwards to the first class. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has raised an entirely different point, and that is practically the position of a lad who is seeking for the first time to enter the profession of engineering. He may be leaving a school or a shop ; he may have been at sea for a little time, but he goes for the first time to the authorities and says, " I wish to present myself for examination in order that I may obtain an initial certificate." The whole point is whether or not we ought to adopt the amendment, and so proclaim to the world that we attach no value to the systematic training of our tradesmen. Of late years, in Australia, there has been a general lament that many  employers have not thoroughly taught their lads and younger hands, but have turned them . on to the market as half-finished workmen. The difficulty of obtaining thoroughly-trained mechanics and workmen has been a general complaint on the part of many leading trade unionists and employers. If we adopt the amendment, we shall say that we do not believe that there is any advantage in having a boy thoroughly trained to his work. I do not think that we ought to adopt that standard. The Minister has indicated the character of the examination which will.. have to be passed by a person who desires to get a certificate. To my mind, it is ridiculously liberal. I could find, throughout the bush, dozens of men who could . pass it. I undertake to pass it myself, if that is all that is necessary to enable a man to obtain a third class certificate. If the examination is to rest at that, it is ridiculously incomplete. </para>

                        <para>- While I am glad to have the honorable senator's assurance I should feel more confident if a statement were made by the Minister. Then, again, I wish to know whether, if the Vic torians will have to go up for examination, the engineers from the other States will have to do the same? It is unfortunate that one State named a particular class or men in a certain way whilst another State gave a different designation to men doing the same work. I have a great deal of sympathy with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> object. A statement has been made in regard to apprenticeships. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said was not quite clear. He stated that applicants for the third-class certificates will have to weld a bar of iron, screw up a bolt, and do various other things. It seems to me that a man who has served years driving an engine on a ship might fail in an examination of that sort, whilst a boy who had worked twelve months in a blacksmith's shop would be able to pass  the examination because he could comply with the practical test. There may be third-class engineers who may have been driving engines on vessels for twenty or thirty years, but who have never served any term of apprenticeship. Nevertheless, such men may have had plenty of every-day experience in actually meeting difficulties. No qualification of this description is required of men who drive locomotives on our railways. The usual practice is that a man entering the Railway Department starts as a cleaner. He learns the various parts of an engine, and after a few years' service becomes a fireman. In this way he acquires experience on the road. It is not an uncommon thing when an engine-driver becomes ill for his fireman to take charge of the locomotive and become responsible for the lives of several hundreds of passengers. He runs all the risks and takes all the responsibility attached to this duty, although he has had no shop experience. Why it should not be the same in regard to the qualifications of an engineer on board a ship I do not know. The question arises whether we require men whose duty it is to drive engines to know also how to build them. Undoubtedly the man who can do both is a better man than he who can only do one or the other. But, at the same time, we may make the standard too high, so that it will be impossible for the average man, or -even for a thoroughly qualified man, to obtain the certificate. I do not speak as an expert, but I am anxious to have a statement from the Minister with regard to the Victorian marine engine-drivers. I want to insure that they shall  not be overlooked, and that the qualifications which they already have will not be ignored. </para>

But the question arises as to whether they are or are not officers under the Victorian Mercantile Shipping Act.

                    <para>. - I am sorry that the Minister is not favorably inclined towards my amendment, and am also surprised at the inference that he draws from it. He states that it would debar a person having shop experience from presenting himself for examination for a third-class certificate. I do not see how that could occur. We are now recasting the whole method whereby . marine engineers can qualify on our coasts. The proviso at the end of clause 12 is ample for those engineers who are already possessed of third-class engineers' certificates. I am only concerned at present with the case of persons who may apply for the third-class engineer's certificate; and I still contend that the clause, as it stands, gives no safeguard whatever to such applicants against the condition that has always been insisted upon in respect to shop experience. In the past the possession of a third-class certificate debarred a man from progressing any further. Take my own case. I have had a little experience in this line. I hold a third-class engineer's certificate, issued under the Marine Board of New South Wales. As the law of that State stands, it tells me in plain language that I cannot apply for a first or second-class engineer's certificate, for the reason that I have not served the scheduled time in an engineer's shop. Any person holding a third-class engineer's certificate, even if he had the inventive skill of a James Watt, or the ingenuity to make a watch, could not present himself to obtain a certificate in the higher grades of the engineer's profession. It is in order to remove that traditional bar that has been placed in the way of every person holding a third-class engineer's certificate that I am pressing this very simple amendment. My proposal will not have the effect of reflecting in any way upon the ability of any person who has served his time in the engineering trade, nor would it debar him from presenting himself for examination. My complaint is that the law hitherto has looked upon me as being incapable of presenting myself for an examination for a second-class certificate because of my not having had shop experience. </para>

The Minister has declared that the effect of my proposal would be to . debar persons who have been indentured to the engineering trade from presenting themselves for examination for a third-class engineer's certificate. It would do nothing of the kind. It would cast no reflection upon those who have served their time to the engineering trade. But it would allow the person who in the past has not had shop experience to offer himself for examination.

                    <para>-I have read section' 63 of the Marine Act of Victoria, and I find that it absolutely justifies the declaration of the Minister of Defence that the status of third-class engineers in this State is amply safeguarded. That section makes it abundantly clear that they are officers under this Bill. There can be no doubt about that. </para>

                        <para>- In t'.iat case, he will be able to prove his competency, and to secure a higher certificate without any trouble. We all know that the third-class engineer in Victoria is not allowed to take a ship as far as is a third-class engineer in New South Wales. I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that this Committee owes a duty to those who have served their time to the engineering trade as well as to those who have not. Why should we cast a stigma upon engineers who have been apprentices and who have learnt their trade in the usual way ? I fail to see how any man can obtain a first-class engineer's certificate unless he be a thoroughly skilled mechanic, and how can he become a thoroughly skilled mechanic without shop experience? Certainly he cannot get the necessary experience on board ship. We- have no right to place obstacles in the way of men who have served their time in an engineering shop. </para>

                        <para>- I will answer that question presently. For a lad to qualify himself to pass the examination which has been outlined by the Minister of Defence, he will require to possess shop experience, and I know that one of the largest engineering works in Queensland demands a premium of . £200 before it will take a lad into its employ. The examination for a third-class engineer's certificate ought not to consist of blacksmithing or turning operations. The idea of asking a man engaged upon a steam launch to turn a pin or a small shaft, when there may be no turnery within 100 miles of him, is ridiculous. What he should be asked is to pack a valve, or pull a pump to pieces, or to secure a steam joint. Such an examination as the Minister has foreshadowed may be necessary in the case of a third-class engineer in New South Wales, who is empowered to take vessels under a certain nominal horse-power from one end of its coast-line to another. But it is certainly not necessary in other cases. In the future candidates for a third-class engineer's certificate will be subjected to an examination in the use of tools. To enable the holder of a first-class coastal engineer's certificate to secure the second-class engineer's certificate of the Board of Trade, we must comply with the Board of Trade regulations. The examination which has been suggested by the Minister in the case of candidates for a third-class engineer's certificate is not such as would be recommended by experts. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is perfectly right in contending that a lad should not be asked whether he has served an apprenticeship in an engineering shop before he is allowed to take charge of a launch on Lake Wendouree," or it may be on the Albert Park. Lagoon. The honorable senator is asking that sea service shall he regarded as an equivalent for shop service. It is possible for a man employed in the engine-room of one of our big steamers to-day to acquire all the knowledge which might be acquired in any engineering workshop in Australia. On one of our modern steamers there is not one. but twenty or thirty engines, almost every one of which is overhauled at every port, and the men in the engine-room of the steamer assist in the work. I repeat that, for a third-class engineer's certificate, no shop experience should be insisted upon. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, in quoting from the Victorian Act, referred to the marine engine-drivers of Victoria as third-class engineers, but the Victorian Act provides only for first and second class engineers, and engine-drivers. I should like to point out that this Bill, in the definition clause, defines engineers as officers, and it makes provision for the issue of certificates to masters or officers. It is important to remember that a marine engine-driver in Victoria is not an officer. Under the Board of Trade and the Imperial Act, a chief engineer is not an officer, nor are engineers regarded as officers under any of the Australian Acts. They are so regarded under the New Zealand Act, as the result of the insertion of a special section, section 30 of the Act of 1903, which provides that - </para>

                        <para>- Is that parliamentary? I was not aware that I was growling. The Minister's colleague compared me the other day to a flea, a fly, and a bee, and now the honorable senator is comparing me to a bear. Between them they will shortly have exhausted the animal and insect creation. We know very well how and by whom regulations are framed. We know that Ministers are largely in the hands of the permanent heads of their Departments. In such cases as this, these men are saturated with professionalism, and raise all kinds of artificial barriers -against any one encroaching upon their preserves. It should be remembered that regulations made under Acts of Parliament are being so continually altered that I defy any man to keep in touch with the regulations issued weekly, and almost daily, from every one of the Government Departments. Acts of Parliament are altered in this way and in that by means of regulations until it is impossible, I believe, for the departmental officers themselves to know just what the law is at any given period. While I agree that it is not possible to dp away entirely with regulations, they should be reduced to a minimum. We are here given an Act of Parliament in skeleton, and we are asked to cover it by means of regulations. I do not know what to suggest here. I have not given the matter very much consideration, but I find that clause after clause provides that such-and-such shall be done, as prescribed by regulation. There is too much of that sort of thing. </para>

                <para class="block">Does the honorable senator want to set forth in the measure the places and the dates for holding the examinations? What ridiculous nonsense he has talked. The fact is that he is looking for faults, and if he cannot find them, he will manufacture them.  His  last criticism was nothing more nor less than factious opposition. There was neither point nor sense in his objections to the clause. If he is a practical man, he ought to know that it is absolutely ridiculous to put in the measure the places and dates for holding an examination. Obviously, the idea of leaving the matter to be dealt with by regulation is to fix places and dates which will suit the convenience of candidates. The honorable senator talked about putting the regulations in the Bill. The book of regulations which I hold in my hand contains over 200 questions to be put to a candidate. For what purpose? Simply to test his qualifications for an engineer's certificate. Will the honorable senator say that we ought to embody those questions in the Bill ? He talked about a measure containing 419 clauses being a skeleton. I venture to say that this is the most substantial skeleton which the Senate has ever had to deal with. I hope that in future we shall deal with practical questions. </para>

                        <para>- It is very difficult to understand whether the insolence or the stupidity of an answer like that was the more marked. It is possible that the administration of this measure may pass into the hands of men who are -either insolent or stupid, or who do not understand what the Act may mean. I submit this amendment so that there shall be no mistake made. Neither in the New Zealand Act, nor in the Canadian Act, does such a provision find a place. But it is right that we should see that officers and seamen know the English language. The object of my amendment is not to prevent a test of their knowledge, but, whilst not going too far, to give reasonable elasticity. I hope that it will be accepted, because there may be a very grave distinction as to who does or who does not speak the English language "fluently." And, after all, what does it mean? The word "intelligibly" is capable of being easily understood; but we may all differ - and examiners too - as to the meaning of the word " fluently." It will meet the intention of the Bill, and of . the Government, to substitute the word " intelligibly " for a word which is most indefinite. </para>

                        <para>- Occasionally you want orators. When it is a question of giving a signal or an order, a man needs to be able to speak with all the clearness, of an orator, especially in a time of danger. I think that the word "fluently" is sufficient, and I propose to stand by it. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment. There is a very strong distinction between the words. I need not go farther back than an experience I had within the walls of this Parliament. On one occasion, I had the opportunity of introducing some ladies to certain gentlemen who occupy the floor of a House. With regard to one of them I said to a lady, " Do you know so-and-so?" and she replied, "Yes, fluently." Whether she would have been prepared to add the word " intelligibly " I cannot say, but there is certainly a very strong distinction between the words. I do not think that it matters to the serious portion of the Bill whether one word or the other is used, but we all desire that every measure should leave the Senate in the best possible foim. I think that the word " fluently " is incorrectly applied in the clause, and that the other word might be very well accepted by the Minister. </para>

Men who go up for examination as officers or engineers are not usually so ignorant that they cannot speak the English language, unless, of course, they happen to be Scotchmen, and very often their English is of a most defective kind. </para>

                        <para>- A man may need to be fluent in the use of slang or forcible words, but here we are asked to say what a candidate ought to be able to do with the English language. If he can make himself understood that ought to be sufficient. We do not expect a man to be voluble. We ought to use language which is easily understood. What we really require is that a' man should have an intelligent understanding of the English language, and not the ability to speak it fluently. </para>

                    <para>. - Surely the Minister in charge of the Bill will not force the Committee to a division on a little matter ? I do not think it can be disputed for a moment that the sense of the Committee is against the use of the word "fluently." According to Webster's dictionary it means " smooth speech." Is a candidate who aspires to take command of a vessel required to be a man of smooth speech before he can obtain a certificate? The idea is too absurd. I venture to say that no honorable senator would more readily detect its absurdity than would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in one of his humorous moments. In the circumstances I suggest that in order to make a little progress he should accept the amendment which unquestionably has been moved to improve the language of the measure. </para>

                        <para>. - In this clause there is an error of draftsmanship, which probably has occurred in this way : Clause  14  has been taken from the New Zealand Act ; but clause  15  has been taken from the Merchant Shipping Act j and there is an overlapping. Clause  14  states that no person shall be admitted to examination for a certificate unless he is a British subject and " possesses the prescribed qualifications." He cannot go up for examination at all unless he does possess the prescribed qualifications. Then clause  15  goes on to say that, having passed his examination, and proved that he possesses the qualifications, he is to give " satisfactory evidence that he possesses the qualifications prescribed." That is to say, having demonstrated that he possesses the " prescribed qualifications " under clause  14,  the moment the examination is over, and he goes up for his certificate, clause  15  says to him, "You are now entitled to your certificate provided that you show that you possess the prescribed qualifications. " His answer would naturally be, "I have already shown that I possess the prescribed qualifications." The reason for the overlapping is that, under the New Zealand Act, from which clause  14  was taken, the qualifications have to be demonstrated before the examination ; but under the Merchant Shipping Act, from which clause  15  was taken, a man is allowed to be examined first, and to prove the possession of the qualifications afterwards. We do not want a man to prove the possession of the qualifications both before and after the examination. </para>

That is to say, there are stages of examination for various grades. For instance, we lay down certain conditions in regard to the granting' of a third engineer's certificate, and the regulations may not prescribe any particular conditions as to shop service. But there may be conditions laid down in regard to the second engineer's certificate. Therefore, at each stage, the applicant has to show that he possesses the necessary qualifications. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister's contention is that clause  14  deals only with the initial certificate, and that clause  15  deals with subsequent stages. But clause  14  says that no person shall be admitted to examination " for a certificate." That means any certificate, and not merely the first one. The candidate cannot enter for an examination at all until he has demonstrated that he possesses the necessary qualifications. Having demonstrated before examination that he possesses them, it is ridiculous after the examination to ask him to demonstrate it again. The fact is that this Bill shows all the faults of a measure that has not been originally drafted. It is a paste-and-scissors Bill. It contains pieces chopped out of one Act joined to pieces chopped out of another, and there has been no attempt to digest the purpose of various Acts so as to produce an original measure. Here we have an instance in which a clause has been chopped out of the New Zealand Act, and placed next to a clause chopped out of the Merchant Shipping Act, without any attempt being made to remedy the overlapping.

He has to prove that he is a British subject, that he can speak the English language, and that he has sufficient money to pay the examiners' fees. He has to produce evidence of his service if he is going for a second mate's certificate. These things have to be proved prior to the examination. After the examination he has to show the possession of certain other qualifications which are necessary before he can be recommended for a certificate. After the examination, he has to prove sobriety, experience, ability, physical fitness, and general good conduct. That is exactly the procedure of the Board of Trade. </para>

After he has passed his examination, he may be called upon to produce his second and' third class engineer's certificates. </para>

I may tell the Committee of a similar case in connexion with the university examination of candidates for civil engineering degrees. After a candidate has passed his examination, and before the degree is conferred, he may be required to produce his books to show what work he has clone. I repeat that clause 14 deals with an applicant for a certificate prior to his examination, whereas . the provision under discussion provides that, after he has passed that examination, he may be called upon to produce his antecedent certificates. If a candidate for a first class certificate cannot produce his second class certificate he will be granted only a second class certificate. If he cannot produce his second class certificate he will be granted only a third class certificate. </para>

He will know that he may be called upon to show that he possesses the necessary qualifications. After an applicant has passed his examination he may be kicked out if he cannot produce evidence that he possesses the prescribed qualifications. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) [4.55]. - I do not know whether I am getting more obtuse than I used to be, but the explanation of the Minister has quite confused me. Clause 14 prevents any candidate from submitting himself to examination unless he is a British subject, who speaks English fluently, and possesses the prescribed qualifications. Those qualifications may cover anything. They ought to include the necessary evidence that a candidate for a first class engineer's certificate already holds a second class engineer's certificate, and that a candidate for a second class engineer's certificate already holds a third class engineer's certificate.

                        <para>- Exactly. The words 10 which exception has been taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> are identical with those which are contained in clause 14. I think that the amendment which he has moved is a very proper one. The Minister of Defence says that, after a candidate has passed an examination which entitles him to a certificate, he ought to be called upon to produce his antecedent certificates. The position which he takes up is based upon the assumption that the prescribed qualifications under clause 14 have not been complied with. If a candidate has satisfied the examiners that he possesses all the prescribed qualifications I cannot see what more should be required of him. The Minister has instanced the case of a university examination in this connexion. He has pointed out that a student, after examination, may be required to produce the books in regard to which he has been examined. I happen to know that that is often clone. But the production of the books does not evidence a qualification. It is merely an element in the examination. As a part of the examination the student has to satisfy the examiners that he has read a certain course of books, and their production is merely intended to show the extent of his reading. The Minister must recognise that the words to which attention has been directed are superfluous. Even his great skill has proved unequal to the task of showing that their retention is desirable. </para>

It may happen that an engineer who is engaged upon a vessel trading between Western Australia and New South Wales may find it convenient to present himself for examination in Adelaide. He may not be able to prove all that is necessary at the time, but he may say to the examiners, " I possess the necessary qualifications. Here is my fee. Will you examine me ? " </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. That is what  1  take the regulation to mean. If a man makes an application for examination, he has to pay a prescribed fee. There is nothing then to prevent him going up for examination at any convenient time, but if he is successful at the examination he must give proof of other things required under the Bill. If he is unsuccessful, it will be unnecessary for him to write to his previous employers for a reference, or to get a discharge from the master of his ship in order to prove his service. </para>

                        <para>- If the applicant were required to produce his certificate before the examination, he could not be asked to give it up, because the examination might not take place for a considerable time after he put in his application to be examined. I suppose that even in Sydney and Melbourne examinations of this kind will not take place more often than once a month", and it may be a month after a man has put in his application before he can be examined for the new certificate. When we are prepared to give him the new certificate, it will be time enough to call upon him to produce his old certificate. I think it would be a mistake to alter these provisions. </para>

                <para>That is quite in conformity with the provisions of this Bill. It bears out what I have said, and what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has confirmed from practical experience, that officers must undergo these examinations whenever they can, and it would very often be inconvenient for them at the time of the examination to produce the necessary proof of qualifications. We provide that ari officer may undergo the examination in the meantime, but under clause 15 he will be called upon before the new certificate is handed to him to produce whatever evidence is required. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> will agree that there might be something more than the old certificate required.

                    SYMON (South Australia)  [5.13].  - I agree that it would not do to prevent a man going up for an examination at some port because he might not have the necessary documents with him, and so delay his advance in his profession. But I venture to think that what the Minister has just quoted from the Victorian regulations is opposed to what is provided for in this Bill. Under clause  14,  the applicant for examination is required to show that he possesses the prescribed qualifications. It will be perfectly competent in the regulation to prescribe the qualifications, but some such regulation as the Minister has quoted under the Victorian Act is necessary, as it might later be shown that the applicant's services were insufficient to qualify him, or there might be some other defect in his application, or in his qualifications, for which the new certificate ought to be withheld. In fact, the regulation would be incomplete unless it had what lawyers call a defeasance. A man, for instance, might believe that he had filled up all the time of service required, but he might be mistaken. But that can all be provided for by regulation.

As discharges and testimonials may have to be forwarded to the Registrar-General of Seamen for verification, it is desirable that they should be handed in, together with the form of application, as many days as possible before the date of the examination which the candidate desires to attend.

                        <para>- Yes ; as to the discharges. Probably the head-office of our Mercantile Marine Department will be in Melbourne or the Federal Capital ; and, unless the amendment is made, the discharges of a man who wants to go up for examination at Fremantle will have to be sent to the central office. Surely honorable senators will see the necessity of regulations being made before the examination as well as afterwards. Why should a man be put more than once to the trouble of getting references as to conduct and ability ? </para>

                <para>In our provision the words " and give satisfactory evidence that he possesses the qualifications prescribed for the holder of the certificate" have been interpolated, but in clause 14 we have provided that he must possess the prescribed qualifications before he is admitted to examination, just as the Board of Trade require a man to show that he possesses satisfactory vision and length of service. Having done that before he goes up for examination, surely there is no necessity to require him to do it again? Our measure may be wrong in requiring a man to show that he possesses the required qualifications before he is admitted to examination, but the provision has been made, and then we require him to show that he has had his period of service before he goes up to bc examined for his second class certificate. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. \ dare say that it might come hard upon me if my lot happened to be cast at sea, but there is a greater purpose to be served, and that is to insure the safety of the travelling public. When it- is remembered that a ship is in charge of a captain or  .1  mate, or an engineer/ that its safety depends entirely upon the ability with which an officer discharges his duties, and that the ability of the average man declines as he advances in years, I think it will be recognised" that it is proper and safe to fix  1  limit when we have the opportunity to do so. If it can count for anything in th,: discussion we have the precedent of the pilots who are employed in Port Phillip. Those who are licensed under the Act of  1904  are retired compulsorily when they reach the age of sixty years, whilst those who hold licences issued prior to that year are allowed to continue in service until they are sixty-five years old. </para>

                        <para>- There is no necessity to mention the names of persons who have been responsible for unfortunate occurrences, but we are all aware that one or two notable maritime calamities were distinctly traceable to the employment of men who had long passed the ordinary period of active service. When a person reaches the age of sixty years, it is about time that he gave place to a younger and more capable man. It has to be remembered that a seafaring life makes severe demands upon the nervous system, and when the nervous system of a person becomes impaired, it is certainly time for him, in the public interest, to make way for a younger man. The Defence Department makes no delicate distinctions in this matter. It compulsorily retires officers at ages varying from forty-eight to sixty-two, according to the rank they hold. There is always a delicacy about casting a duty of this kind upon a public department. People are actuated by the venerable superstition which prompts them to say, "Oh, he is an old man, let him go on for a little bit longer." An officer in charge of. a ship is responsible, not only for a valuable piece of property, but for hundreds of human lives. He needs to be alert in every respect. No sentimental consideration should stand in the way of retiring a man whose physical condition is highly impaired by reason of advanced age. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that the amendment would operate arbitrarily in many cases, but, nevertheless, I am of opinion that a man following a seafaring life when he reaches the age of sixty has attained a period when his usefulness is impaired. If we allow him to continue indefinitely, we do not act fairly by the travelling public. I have been told that two nautical calamities have occurred in Australian waters owing directly to the employment of men who ought long before to have been retired. In the Defence Department a captain who reaches the age of forty-eight is compelled to retire, even though he may still be an excellent captain. </para>

                    <para>. - There are two points to be considered in connexion with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> amendment. One is that, in the service in question, there is fierce competition. Officers occupying positions on steam-ships generally hold certificates of a grade higher than the rank they are filling, and the companies have no difficulty in filling their positions. The second fact is that the steam-ship companies themselves are naturally anxious to protect their own property. They take care to safeguard their interests by employing active men in full possession of their faculties. There would be a danger in fixing an arbitrary age. Some men are in a condition of senile decay at fifty, whilst others are comparatively useful at sixty-five. The Commonwealth has fixed- the age at which an old-age pension can be obtained at sixty-five. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> amendment would say to seafaring men, " We will turn you out of your employment at sixty, knowing that you will have to wait five years before you can get a pension of 10s. a week." </para>

                    <para>. - I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that this clause deals, not with any wrong-doing on the part of the holder of a certificate, but with failings in the nature of infirmities. But sub-clauses 4 and 5 speak of " the charge."  1  admit that there is not very much in the point, but it is not usual to " charge " a man simply because his eyesight is failing. Incompetency might arise from any mental or physical failing, but that would not constitute anything in the nature of what we usually call " a charge." When a charge is made against a person, he is usually accused of having done something wrong. The clause itself recognises the desirableness of avoiding that term in the first part, where the word " unfitness " is used. It would be more in accordance with the spirit of the Bill to use the word " unfitness " throughout. </para>

                    <para>. - I promise that I will have this clause considered with a view to seeing whether it can be altered in the way that has been suggested. At the same time, I do not feel prepared to accept any amendment to it at the present juncture. When the question of a man's unfitness comes before the Minister the latter has to make a "charge" before it can be investigated by a Court. He prefers a charge and calls upon the person whose fitness is in question to deliver up his certificate. The charge which is usually laid against him is that he is incompetent because of some physical infirmity. When the matter has been inquired into his certificate is either returned to him or is permanently withheld. </para>

                    <para>The limitation of the operation of this clause would, it is submitted, bc manifestly inequitable. For example, " A " (an Australian shipowner) could register his ship in New Zealand (a very easy and inexpensive proceeding), and so escape the requirements of our Acts, while " B," who retained his ship on an Australian register, would be subject thereto. To allow one ship to go to China, load there, and come back to Australia with her cargo and passengers, having an uncertificated officer, and to require an Australian ship doing exactly the same thing to have a certificated officer, would be a distinction which could hardly be defended. </para>

                <para>I submit that that memorandum does not meet the position. What the Board Of Trade really desired was that we should treat British ships holding Board of Trade certificates, during the time that they are trading along our coast, as that body itself would treat them. In effect, it said, " As we think that our ships comply with all our requirements, surely you will do the same." We must recollect that the Board of Trade has just as much regard for </para>
                <para>British ships as we have for our own vessels. When, therefore, they reach our coast, we ought to assume that, from the stand-point of their seaworthiness, they are fully equipped. But under this clause we could stop a British vessel which had uncertificated officers on board while she was on her way, say, from Adelaide to Melbourne. In other words, while she was trading along our coast we could practically wipe out the Board of Trade certificates, and say, " You shall man your ships according to the conditions which we lay down." That is what the Imperial authorities apprehended.  1  notice in a marginal note the reply of the Government to the statement of the Board of Trade which I have already quoted.

The question which concerned them, and which must concern us to a great extent, is whether under this clause, and its administration, we shall not be imposing an unfair disability on British shipping. Under this clause, a British ship trading from port to port on the Australian coast might be prevented from going to sea by reason of the fact that she had not on board the number of certificated officers required by our legislation. We know that for a reason, arising from circumstances of which we are all aware, the Government propose, if they can do so constitutionally, to give at least one, or it may be two, ports of the Commonwealth an advantage, under this Bill. If a British ship, leaving Albany, is not, in the opinion of our Department, officered up to the standard required under the Bill, she may be detained. </para>

                        <para>- Not by this clause. I fail to see how it can be said that we place British ships in unfair competition with foreign ships. A foreign ship cannot take part in our coasting trade under this Bill. In order to" do so, the foreign ship-owner must register in Australia, and if he does so his ship becomes an Australian ship, liable to all the provisions of this measure. The only competition between the foreign and the British ship is a competition over which we have no control. We cannot control a foreign ship coming from a foreign country to Australia and taking goods from Australia to that foreign country. Surely we are not to be told by Great Britain that, because we cannot control that trading, we must not control the operations of our own trade and ships of our own Empire 7 . I ask the Committee to consider what would happen if we were to give way and accept the Board of Trade's suggestion. The owner of a British ship would need only to register his ship in New Zealand, and he might then evade these provisions altogether. We would apply these provisions to foreign ships if we could, and when we apply them to our own ships we ought, in common fairness, to apply them also to British ships.. The competition referred to could only arise in the case of foreign-going trade, and not in the case of Australian trade. It may be unfair as between the foreign and British ship-owners, but it is a matter over which we have no control, and to attempt to remedy it by exempting the British ship, while making the Australian owner subject to these provisions, would place the British ship-owner in a better position as compared to his foreign competitor, but would place the Australian owner in a very unfair position as compared to both. </para>

                        <para>- I am quoting from . the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, under which a ship engaged in the foreign-going trade may have four or five mates if she carries a certificated master and first and second mate. The difficulty is that under this Bill such a ship would be unable, out here, to replace any of the extra mates except by a certificated officer. Under this measure, such a ship, employing a mate who is not duly certificated, would be liable to£100 penalty, and a man who is not duly certificated engaging as an officer would be liable to a similar penalty. If the Minister could discover some way in which to overcome that difficulty it would materially smooth the way to assent being given to the Bill. We must bear in mind that this Bill must have the sanction of the Imperial authorities before it becomes law. </para>

This provision would apply to a British ship engaged in the foreign-going trade ; and we say that such a ship, equally with an Australian registered ship engaged in the same trade, should not carry an officer who is not duly certificated. </para>

                    <para>. - It ought to be emphasized that, according to the Minister's admission, what we are doing is to impose upon the tolerance and good nature of the Mother Country. He has said, not once, but twice, that the reason why the Government do not propose to apply this and similar clauses to foreign vessels is that we have not the power to do so. We have the power to pass the legislation, just as we have the power to legislate against British ships; but the Government know that, if we did that, complications would arise, which would mean that, willingly or unwillingly, we should have to rescind that portion of our legislation. We have no greater power to legislate against Great Britain than we have to legislate against France or Germany. Why, then, do the Government seek to legislate against British ships when they dare not do so against foreign vessels ? The answer is clear. The Government know that, whilst foreign countries would not put up with such legislation at our hands, they can rely upon the good nature and tolerance of the Mother Country not to object. </para>

Although their manning might be superior to that of a foreign ship, still it would not be up to our standard, and, in the absence of this provision, a preference would be given to those British ships as against our own ships. </para>

                        <para>- If there is anything in the statement of the honorable senator, who apparently is familiar with this Bill, the Committee ought to know what is intended to be done before this measure passes. It is rather" desirable to ascertain what it means. As the Bill stands, it is admitted, on all hands, that it places a disability on British and Australian ships as compared with foreign ships. Does anybody want to do that? Will any one here say that if a preference is to <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> given, he would prefer to give it to foreign vessels? </para>

                    <para>. - It is pleasant to know that the opposition of the Board of Trade has weakened almost to vanishing point, but the Government are now faced with another opposition, which is endeavouring to ascertain the true purport of this proposed legislation. The Minister has stated that the clause would not apply to British ships having on board uncertificated officers. But to my mind it would apply. The clause says that no person shall take into his employment as an officer any person who is not duly certificated. When a British ship enters our waters she is under our jurisdiction. </para>

                    <para>. - The Leader of the Opposition is endeavouring to make a great deal out of very little. In the first place, there is  . a  very small probability of any British ship coming to Australia with uncertificated officers on board. Why raise a bogy that is never likely to materialize? But even if such a case should arise, I am informed on the best authority that this Bill would not apply. If, however, officers were engaged in Australia the penalties imposed under our law might be inflicted if a person were engaged as an officer who was not certificated. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales)  [8.6].-  Under the Merchant Shipping Act it is not necessary that all officers should be ceilificaf-ed. It is only necessary that a certain proportion of them should be. A British ship might come out to Australia having officers, some of whom were certi-nea ted, while others were not. The ques-lion raised by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline>
                    is whether the continuance of the uncertificated officers on board that ship would be regarded as an offence, although the ship was fully manned as required by the Merchant Shipping Act. The point is important.

                        <para>- A vessel would be allowed to leave the United Kingdom if she had the proper number of certificated officers' on board. There might be four mates and a master on a ship. Two of the mates might be uncertificated. Under our law, that ship could not go to sea, although a master and two certificated mates might be all that she was required to carry under the Merchant Shipping Act. We are' here making a difference between ships registered in Australia and those registered in Great Britain. Suppose that the two uncertificated mates were to leave the vessel at an Australian port, or were to be discharged. It might be necessary to engage two others. Then, although the vessel, under the Merchant Shipping Act, was not required to have more than two certificated mates, her owners would be liable to a heavy penalty if they engaged two uncertificated officers here. Whatever we may do with our own ships, we should not attempt to increase the requirements of the Merchant Shipping Act in respect, of ships registered in England. It has been pointed out that, in the first place, the Board of Trade protested strongly against this provision, which subsequently was altered to meet the requirements of that authority. Why should we not make the clause inapplicable to foreign-going ships seeking to engage officers in Australia ? </para>

                        <para>- I do not agree with the honorable senator. The proper course is to respect the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act as far as British ships are concerned, while they are not engaged in our coastal trade. As a matter of fact, we have no right to exercise jurisdiction over them in the way contemplated. Why put an embargo upon a British ship wishing to engage officers in Australia by making her endure a disadvantage that she would not suffer if she engaged her officers in Great Britain? We might just as well say that if a ship comes from Great Britain with a master and three mates, whilst our law provides that a ship of her tonnage shall carry a master and five mates, we will compel her to engage two additional certificated mates. </para>

                        <para>- The volubility of some honorable senators is almost beyond endurance. It has already been stated, on the best of authority, that a vessel coming out to Australia with her proper complement of officers, as required by the Board of Trade, would not be interfered with. But if she loses one or two of her officers and requires to engage others in Australia, the principle applying is this : In the Commonwealth we have no uncertificated officers, to be engaged on British or any other ships. We do not make uncertificated officers. If vessels have to obtain officers here, they must accept Australian officers who are certificated. That is the point. The honorable senator might just as well argue that if a British ship comes to Australia, and in passing round our coast bumps against a rock, which necessitates repairs being effected, those repairs ought not to be made in Port Melbourne, or in Mort's Dock, Sydney, because they could be made cheaper in Great Britain, where men work longer hours, and for less wages than do our own artisans. </para>

                    <para>.- Since the sitting was suspended I have made inquiries as to what this clause really means, and I find that it is intended to apply to ships coming to Australia with uncertificated officers. The concession proposed by the late Government in 1908 was that they would not interfere with uncertificated officers on board these vessels, but that they would compel them to accept certificated officers if they engaged them here. In the circumstances, would it not be well to make the position perfectly clear? </para>

                    <para>.- I think that this clause must be considered quite independently of the schedule to the Bill which lays down the manning scale. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has said that a vessel leaving England is required to carry a certificated master and two certificated officers. As a matter of fact, most vessels carry more than that number of certificated officers. It is very rarely that a man out of the forecastle is to be found acting as an officer on a ship at sea. But it used to be a regular practice. The man from the forecastle would not do any navigating work, but would perform duties which Would relieve the mates of a portion of their duties. He would not possess a certificate, because the ship would be complying with the law by carrying the number of certificated officers that she was obliged to carry. Exactly the same thing applies here in connexion with the manning scale. The first schedule to the Bill provides that foreign going ships and Australian trade ships not exceeding 300 tons net register, shall carry a mate holding a first mate's certificate, and that sailing ships exceeding 300 tons net register, shall carry one first and one second mate, the latter holding a certificate not lower than that of second mate. But if after a vessel is at sea the master chooses to pay a man to do a portion of the work of an officer, he will be at liberty to do so, so long as he is complying with the law. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. A large ship trading from the Old Country will probably carry about five mates. Most likely she is compelled to carry a certificated master and three certificated officers. But probably four out of the five officers which she carries will hold masters' certificates. So that even if one or two of these officers were to die on the voyage, she would still be complying with the law, and, if necessary, a man could be procured from the forecastle to do a portion of the work of one of the mates. </para>

That is a myth, because the ships trading to Australia are chiefly governed by Part III. of the Merchant Shipping Act. These vessels are not manned in accordance with their tonnage. Under Part III. of the Merchant Shipping Act a vessel of 600 nominal horse power is obliged to carry seven engineers, or six engineers and a boilermaker. She is also required to carry a fireman for every 18 square feet of fire-grate surface in her boilers. The vessels of the Orient Company and the White Star Company are chiefly governed by the provisions of the Passenger Act. Here are the latest instructions to emigration officers in regard to manning.

                    <para>Section 305 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 requires generally that emigrant ships shall be manned with " an efficient crew," but it docs not prescribe any ratio of men to tonnage. </para>
                    <para>The emigration officer will, of course, understand that there is no statutory power enabling him to interfere with the manning of " short ships " unless they are so undermanned as to be " unsafe " under the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act 1897. As regards 'steamships, the following scale has been prepared of the basis of the minimum cubic contents of the boats and rafts which are required to be carried by such vessels under the provisions of the rules relating to life-saving appliances. In the case of vessels having such a number of passengers as to necessitate the carrying of the maximum cubic capacity of boats and rafts required under division (a), class <inline font-style="italic">1,</inline> of the rules  according to the <inline font-style="italic">gross</inline> tonnage, the scale will show at a glance the number of deck hands to be carried. In the case of vessels carrying only a limited number of passengers, and being entitled to a reduced boat capacity, sufficient only for the number of persons carried on that particular voyage, allowing ten cubic feet for each statute adult, the number of deck hands shall bc ascertained by the following method :  - </para>
                    <para>Add to the number of passengers to be carried the total number of crew, calculating the deck-hands at a minimum of twenty-five men. Then allow ten cubic feet of boat capacity for each statute adult and apply the scale accordingly. </para>
                    <para>Thus, if the number of passengers to be carried be three hundred, and the total crew, including twenty-five deck-hands, be ninety, this will give a total of three hundred and ninety, which, allowing ten cubic feet for each statute adult, gives 3,900 cubic feet of boat capacity. The number of deck-hands due to 3,900 cubic feet in the scale is twenty-eight, the minimum number to be carried. The following, and no others, shall be counted as efficient deck-hands, viz., the master and four mates; all others to be <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> A.B.'s, except that of the total number of deck-hands carried, one in five may be an O.S., and, if boys be carried, two boys may be taken in place of each O.S. so allowed. Any additional mates, the boatswain, quartermasters, and other petty officers who have served or are fit to serve, in the capacity of A.B., may also be counted as such. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Then the scale of manning for steam-ships provides that a vessel of under  2,500  cubic feet of boat capacity shall carry twenty-four deck hands, including the master, mates, and petty officers, and that a vessel of  9,300  cubic feet of boat capacity but of less than  9,700  cubic feet - which would be equivalent to a vessel of about  10,000  tons - shall carry forty-eight deck hands, including master, mates, and petty officers. The instructions continue - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>In applying this scale the emigration officer is to bear in mind that the number of hands proposed therein must be insisted 011 in the case of all new ships, and as far as possible in ail other cases. </para>

                        <para>- I will not swear to it, because I do not know. The regulations are silent on the point. They do not say how many mates must be certificated, but we can, I think, fairly assume that the emigration officers would insist that all the officers on these vessels should hold certificates. In case of fire, a leak, or the breaking down of the engines, it may be necessary that the boats should be manned, and the reason why such a number of officers are required for these ships is that each boat must be in the charge of a person able to navigate it. That is why the boat capacity is taken as the basis of the manning scale for these vessels. We are only following the example of the Board of Trade in this matter in making provision for additional officers. I am aware that the old " tramp " may, and does, come to Australia with only two mates. But, is that something to be desired ? Is it in the interests of the safety of the ship and crew that two men should have the responsibility of keeping watch and navigating a ship twelve hours on and twelve hours off in every twenty-four hours? We are all agreed here that no man should be asked to work more than eight hours a' day, and the least we can ask is that a ship shall carry three navigating officers as well as a master. That is in accordance with a principle laid down in Australia for years, not only as affecting the officers on deck, but the engineers also. So far, the only men in the Australian shipping trade who have not received the benefit of the eight-hours day are the sailors, and they are getting nearer to it every year. No shipowner who has any respect for his property or the men who work for him will ask navigating officers to keep watch at sea four hours on and four hours off day after day, in addition to the work which they have to do when the vessel is in port. </para>

                        <para>- No. An Orient boat may be coming into the outer harbor at Adelaide, and an hour before she arrives all hands are called and kept on deck until she leaves the port again. The same thing may happen when she arrives in Melbourne. Men and officers who have been working and keeping watch during the night before the arrival of the vessel in port are called upon to work throughout the following day, and the officers may have to take their watch again the following night. It is true that the Merchant Shipping Act makes provision for only two certificated officers in addition to a master, but under the provisions which I have quoted, the Board of Trade require a vessel carrying third class passengers to carry many more officers than she would be required to carry under the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act. </para>

                    has referred to the provisions enforced on ships carrying third class passengers, but those provisions are given effect by virtue of the powers given to the emigration officer, whose duty it is to see that a ship leaving the Old Country with passengers shall be sufficiently manned and properly equipped before she gets her clearance. While I am in entire sympathy with* much that the honorable senator has said, I cannot overlook the fact that we are not legislating in the Parliament of Great Britain for the British mercantile marine, but in Australia for our own mercantile marine. It is perfectly true that passenger ships carrying third class passengers have to comply with provisions which do not apply in the case of all British ships under the Merchant Shipping Act, but, in this Bill, we deal with all classes of ships. I take the case to which

                        <para>- I am not so sure of that. They protested against it, and did not give way. We promised an amendment which would meet their objection, but no such amendment has been proposed. If we intend to deal with the matter fairly, we shall carry a provision which will not operate to the detriment of ships registered in Great Britain and trading here. A ship may come from Great Britain to Australia on a round voyage to China and back to Great Britain. She may lose one or two of her officers, and may require to engage others here. Why should we demand that she should engage certificated men because she happened to be in Australian waters when she required their services, when, if she had been in Great Britain when she required extra officers, it would not be necessary that they should be certificated ? </para>

                    <para>. - A good deal of light has been thrown on the clause, and I confess that it seems to me to somewhat clear up the. difficulty. The confusion has arisen out of clause 8, which applies the provisions of this part to ''British ships only. It is no wonder that when British ship-owners saw that clause, and turned to clause  22,  they said, "If that is so, the Australian Act is going to control our officers ' ' ; but further consideration will show that in clause  22  we are dealing with only our own officers. Therefore, in  99  per cent, of the cases of </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">British ships which come to the Commonwealth and depart, the provision cannot apply. For all practical purposes it will apply to Australian registered ships. Suppose that a British ship comes out here with a complement of officers which is more than up to the Board of Trade regulation, and suppose that some of the officers are disabled or get away from the ship, and that she requires a complement of officers to leave Australia on the return voyage. No doubt the men will be engaged, but they will not be engaged as officers within the meaning of this measure. That is, I think, the probable construction and application of the clause. If that is the position, it will come very nearly within the. remark applied by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> that it will be' almost inoperative. After the explanation which has been given I think that that remark is very nearly correct. But it should be remembered that it is always the unexpected case which crops up and causes trouble. </para>

                        <para>- If we have power to enact that if a foreign ship engages an officer in an Australian port he shall be a certificated officer, I see no objection to a provision of that kind. But if we cannot do that, I very much doubt whether we can make a special provision for British ships any more than we can for foreign ships. I do not think that we have power to legislate with regard to the former if we cannot deal with the latter. </para>

                        <para>- The Constitution does not give us any such power except whilst they are in our waters. When this question was discussed on a previous occasion it was admitted that we had not the power to control British shipping, but honorable senators now appear to' think that we can. Whether they are afraid to deal with foreign ships, or they think that Great Britain will overlook our faults, as those of naughty children, I do not know. But such a provision appears very invidious to me, as I think it will do to a great many persons. Ever since we re-assembled after dinner the phrase " British ships " has been used, and it seems that we are to have a law specially directed against them, but not against ships from any other country. That is, I think, a very invidious position to take up. The British Parliament is quite competent to deal with British shipping. If an attempt were made in the Old Country to interfere with our manning scale, to say that it was not sufficient from the British point of view, and to penalize an Australian ship on that ground, we should be the very first to raise a storm, and justly so, too. I cannot understand why the Government adhere to this clause,, and specially mention British ships. I hope that they will consent to waive the point and leave the Parliament of Great Britain to decide what is sufficient manning for British ships, without any interference on cur part. If we cannot compel foreign ships to comply with our law, surely we cannot compel British ships to do so.I listened to this discussion until I began to think that this Parliament had a specific idea of legislating against British ships; in fact, of helping to throw the trade of Australia into the hands of foreign competitors. That is not fair or right, and, therefore, I hope that the Minister will reconsider the matter. </para>

The necessity for applying this division of the Bill to foreign and British ships must be very apparent when we recall the notorious state of affairs which obtained at Newcastle. The Navigation Commission discovered there what very few persons would imagine could be permitted to exist. The extent of this evil was very fully debated on a previous occasion, and I feel sure that every honorable senator thought that stringent steps should be taken to put it clown. It had become a scandal which, I think, no one could justify, and if it is to be put down we must have an effective law. </para>

                    <para>- - I might resent the appeal that has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> to the natural inclination of honorable senators to do nothing to encourage crimping. No one would be stronger than I, who have some knowledge of what has taken place at Newcastle, in putting a stop to such objectionable practices. But that is not the point. We are now dealing with officers who are to be permitted to engage seamen for ships. 1 again point out that one clause provides that a certain officer only shall have authority to engage seamen, whilst the next clause says that other persons shall have that authority. In clause  26  there is an absolute prohibition against any one other than a superintendent or the owner, master, mate, or engineer of a ship engaging seamen, but the next clause provides that some one else may engage them. There is a flat contradiction. Here, again, I point out that this Bill manifests the weakness of its paste and scissors construction. Its authors have taken one idea from one source, and, being desirous of amplifying that idea, have put another into the borrowed clause without making any attempt to regard the proposal as a whole. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think that there is any real difficulty about this matter. The clause commences by providing that no person other than a superintendent, apart from the owner, master, mate, or engineer of a ship, shall engage or supply a seaman. In the definition clause " superintendent " is defined to mean, first, the superintendent at a mercantile marine office, and, where not otherwise provided, the superintendent for the port where the ship in reference to which he is acting is; and, secondly -  a deputy of such superintendent in respect of any acts or duties which such deputy is authorized to perform. </para>

                <para class="block">The  deputy  is generally a Customs officer. Then we come to the seamen's inspector. What are his duties? They are altogether different from those of a superintendent or a  deputy  superintendent. Probably there would be a superintendent and seamen's inspector only in the larger ports. There would be only a  deputy  in a small place like Cooktown. </para>

                    <para>- - The position of seamen under this measure will be very different from that which they have hitherto occupied under the different State Acts. Seamen and officers will be so hedged about by provisions in this Bill for their protection, and the protection of the shipping of the country, that offences of this kind are not at all as likely to be committed as they have been under the imperfect Acts that have been in existence up to the present. For this reason, and in view of all the restrictions imposed by this measure, a penalty of £50 under this Bill has been considered as equivalent to a much higher penalty under the State Acts. If the Government thought it necessary they would not hesitate to propose a penalty of , £500 or . £1,000 for this offence. </para>

A man named Draco went in for legislation at one time, and killed a place with this kind of thing, as a warning to all the world afterwards, though I should, perhaps, make an exception in the case of some people, who will never learn anything. There is included in this clause a penalty of imprisonment, which should prove a very powerful deterrent. If later, by experience, the penalties here proposed are found to be insufficient to prevent crimping, it will be possible for us to increase them.

                        <para>- I believe it will be. In order to make it effective, an inspector may be appointed in some ports; but in other ports it would not pay to appoint an inspector, and the enforcement of the law will depend upon a superintendent. The difficulty is that under this Bill a master is, in certain circumstances, allowed to sign on men on board ship. That is where the trouble will arise. We had a case of the kind in Melbourne not long ago. A ship wanting men was lying outside, and an attempt was made to take men out of a foreign ship lying in the river. In that case, the men were not put on board, and the attempt was not successful. There is a danger that men may be taken out of boarding-houses and taken off in a tug to where a vessel is lying ready to put to sea. There will be no time to take them to the shipping office; blood money will be demanded and paid, and we shall know very little about it. I want to put the fear of the law into people who engage in crimping by providing for a penalty which will make it worth their while to give up this work altogether. They would be able to meet the penalty of <inline font-style="italic">£50</inline> with the money received for supplying one crew. I may be told that the men may be proceeded against for receiving the money. But from whom are we to recover the penalty? If the reply is that we may recover from the captain, the answer is that the ship will have cleared out. </para>

A foreign ship may leave no agent behind, and, though it might be said that we could recover from her when she came into Australian waters again, she might never come here again. I ask the Minister to provide a stringent penalty for this offence. I should be prepared to strike out the money penalty, and make the penalty six months' imprisonment. If we are in earnest in our professed desire to put down crimping, we should make the penalty for the offence a very severe one. </para>

We should not countenance the charging of premiums in such cases. It is an old custom, but one which should be abolished.

                        <para>- The clause states that it will apply to apprentices. It will give a ship-owner the right to charge a premium for every apprentice who goes on board his ship. The custom is a bad one and ought not to be encouraged in any way. I need not thresh the matter out, as honorable senators know as much about apprenticeship as I do, and are aware that apprentices seldom get any value for the premiums they pay for being allowed to go to sea. I leave the matter in the hands of the Committee. </para>

                    <para>. - There are some old customs which, because of the good which may be derived from them, ought not to be unnecessarily set aside. We know that any employer in Melbourne can demand a premium from an apprentice, but would he always get it? Honorable senators must see that the parents or guardians of a lad must believe that some reasonable inducement is held out to them before they will agree to pay a premium for his apprenticeship on board a ship. If a lad desires to go to sea and learn navigation, and a ship-owner or a shipmaster is prepared to take him as an apprentice with a premium, it may be to his interest to pay such a premium. Honorable senators need be under no apprehension that premiums will be charged indiscriminately without any return being made for them. A lad would not pay a premium to go to set in order to learn to be an A.B., because it would not be worth his while. But if a youth were given an opportunity to become a navigator, and rise to be a mate or master of a vessel, it might be a great advantage to him if he were able to secure an education in navigation by the payment of a premium. </para>

                    <para>. - Under this clause, a boy can be indentured either to a ship-owner or to a ship-master, but the lad is liable to be discharged at any time during the term of the indentures. I think that a youth ought to be apprenticed to a ship-owner, because if the latter ceases to have an interest in a vessel he has to provide for the former in some other ship, or to do something else. On the other hand, if the master of a ship is suddenly discharged, the apprentice will be left to the mercy of somebody else. </para>

                        <para>- In Australia, we have not many big lines of steamers. We have some owners who are masters of comparatively small steam or sailing ships. It might be quite proper to allow a person of that class to have a lad apprenticed to him if the authorities should think proper. The clause will allow a great deal of liberty to the superintendent; but why should it be limited in the way suggested? I think that it ought to remain as it is. </para>

                    (South Australia) when a ship is acquired by a person, his name may, with the consent of the apprentice and of the superintendent, be inserted in the indentures in place of the previous owner. I take it that, under tie proviso, the superintendent is to act as the youth's guardian. But the change of ownership may take place at a port distant from his home, and, therefore, it is desirable that the words " parent or guardian " should be inserted after the word "apprentice." I think that the parent or guardian of an apprentice ought to be afforded an opportunity to say whether he consents to the indentures being continued with . the new owner in lieu of the last owner, - who is either dead or has turned insolvent. Therefore, I move -

                        <para>- The boy may be quite willing to continue his apprenticeship with the new owner. He has taken an interest in seafaring. He may see that there is a future before him; but in the meantime his parent or guardian may have changed his mind, and wish the boy to be employed nearer home at something else, and against his wishes. If the amendment is made, a boy can be prevented from continuing in a profession to which he has taken earnestly. I think that whenever a parent or guardian has given his consent to a boy being apprenticed to the sea,' and the boy has displayed an interest in his work, the apprentice and ' the superintendent should be the only parties whose consent should be really necessary for his continuance in the profession under the new owner. </para>
