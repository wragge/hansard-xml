                        <para>PERTH, Tuesday. - A statement signed by twenty-one warders of the Fremantle prison controverts the assertion made by the Colonial Secretary <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Connolly)</inline> in the Legislative Council last week in regard to the dismissal of Warder Wise for refusal to resign from the Military Forces. The warders state that Warder Wise&#39;s military duties did not in any way interfere with his duties as a warder. and also whether the Minister has yet received any reply from the Commandant of Western Australia in regard to the dismissal of Warder Wise for refusing to resign either from his official position or from the Military Forces? </para>

                        <para>In this file Wise made several misstatements, and also stated that he &#34;could not be discharged from the militia until the expiration of his term&#34;; this is the statement that the Premier asked me if it were correct. I told the Premier that I could, under regulation 184, discharge a man free at any time, and having perused the file and seen how the man&#39;s attendance at drill had interfered with his prison duties, said that I would do so in this case if the man applied. </para>
                        <para>Later on I had an interview with the Comptroller-General of Prisons, and he asked me to put this in writing ; this I did (see copy attached), and also referred the Colonial Secretary to a telegraphic report published in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> on the 18th August,1910, giving a <inline font-style="italic">resume</inline> of the contents of the Defence Bill 1903-10, which gave the list of persons exempt, but did not state that same were &#34; in time of war.&#34; </para>

Whenever the question of taking over the State debts is under consideration by the Government, the question of the transferred properties will also be considered. Surely that is definite enough. I cannot say whether the matter will be considered tomorrow, or next week, or the week after. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;2.53&#93;.- The time appointed within which the land tax is to be payable appears to be altogether too short. It is &#34; not less than one month &#34; after the publication of the notice. In view of the enormous territory that has to be encompassed, and the fact that a longer period is usually allowed for State taxation purposes, would it not be reasonable to make the period sixty days ? Surely that would not be more than sufficient time in the case of a Commonwealth tax, inasmuch as the New South Wales Government allows sixty days. It must be remembered that a notice published in the Commonwealth
                        <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline>
                        would not reach the people immediately.

                    <para>. - It will be observed that the tax has to be paid for the financial year. As will be seen by a reference to clause 48, when the month&#39;s notice given in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> has expired a further thirty days have to elapse before any penalty is incurred for non-payment. So that practically the period for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> asks is given. It would be going too far to give sixty days&#39; notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> and to allow a period of thirty days thereafter. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) &#91;2.55&#93;. - It is quite true that the tax has to be paid for the purposes of the financial year. But, of course, it is paid for the next financial year. The tax is levied at the beginning of the year, and the assessment is made on valuations at the 30th June. But the tax collected is for the succeeding year. Consequently a period of twelve months is available for the Government to get in the tax imposed. No harm can possibly happen to the revenue, and no impediment can be offered to the collection of the tax by the extension of the time. It has to be remembered that this tax has to be collected throughout the whole Commonwealth. I am sure that the departmental officer will come to the conclusion that a month is quite an inadequate period to allow.

                        <para>- Because, owing to the size of the Common wealth, many people will not know of the date appointed. It is a mere matter of administration. Within the limited area of a State, perhaps a month&#39;s notice might be sufficient, but having regard to the fact that New South Wales allows sixty days, the Commonwealth might fairly make this period a minimum of sixty days. Indeed, I should think that three months would not be too much to allow. The tax has to be collected within a year, and if the Government were to allow three months they would still have nine months ahead of them for getting in the tax. The penalty of 10 per cent, is automatic. Every person who fails to pay the amount due before the expiration of the thirty days will have to pay 10 per cent, on the amount of the tax. </para>

                        <para>. - Honorable senators who read the clause will see that the period named is a minimum, and that the Commissioner may allow three months if he thinks it necessary. Power is simply taken to allow not less than one month. In some years one month may be sufficient. In other years two or three months may be required. Some latitude ought to be left to the Commissioner. Seeing that one month is merely a minimum, and that under the next clause thirty days additional are allowed, honorable senators might be satisfied. </para>

                        <para>- Admitting that it i? barely possible to get a reply to a communication sent to Western Australia within a month, are not the Government proposing to cut matters very fine in proposing a minimum period which will be sufficient only on the assumption that everything will run like clockwork, and that no person notified will miss a mail. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has himself admitted the force of the contention of this  side  in saying that if necessary the Land Tax Commissioner can allow a longer period. In the circumstances I trust that the Government will agree to make the minimum period one which it will be possible to adhere to when the Bill comes into operation. </para>

State notifications of this kind are published in the daily newspapers, and people are thus given some opportunity to learn of matters of this character. If this notice is to be confined to the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> that is an additional reason why a longer period than one month should be given. </para>

They seem to have followed blindly everything in the New Zealand Act. Does the Vice-President of the Executive Council know how long it would take for a notice of an assessment for land tax to reach Cooktown from the Commissioner&#39;s office, and a reply to be received ? I can tell him that it would take about twenty-nine days. </para>

                        <para>- I presume that as, in the case of income tax notices,, this notice will be sent direct from the office of the Commissioner of Land Tax. I have said that to communicate from the Seat of Government with Cooktown, and receive a reply, would take twenty-nine days, and, of course, it would take longer in the case of Normanton, Croydon, and Port Darwin. It will be quite impossible for land-own erS in remote portions of Australia to avoid the penalty under this provision. The person to whom the demand is sent is not to be given a moment to look up his books, or, should he think it necessary, to take legal or other advice in the matter. The errors throughout this Bill arise from the fact that a large number of legislators down here know little or nothing of any place beyond the banks of the Yarra, and it is necessary to drive it into their heads that there are other places to be considered. Some were living alongside a ditch or creek until they came here, and they have no idea of the size and importance of the rest of Australia, and very little of the geography of the Commonwealth. This provision is absolutely impossible of compliance. When that is pointed out, the Vice-President of the Executive Council tells us that a longer period may be allowed ; but the Government should come forward &#34; wi,th a proposal which will give the taxpayers of the Commonwealth a reasonable opportunity to comply with the provisions of the law. </para>

                    <para>. - While I like to listen to the accusations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger against the Government, I ask honorable senators opposite to be a little reasonable in dealing with our imperfections and the imperfections of the measures we submit to the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger knows that to meet the exigencies of the Treasury this tax will have to be levied during the current financial year. Other honorable senators are also aware of the fact, and yet they waste time in endeavouring to make some amendment or another which may appear to them to be reasonable. They forget that the whole system has to be organized, and all the assessments made within this year. I should like to ask honorable senators opposite what position the Commissioner of Land Tax would be in if he had to give the sixty days&#39; notice suggested in this first year of levying the tax. If he can give more than thirty days&#39; notice he will give it when the Department is sufficiently organized. In future years I have no doubt the Commissioner of Land Tax will be able to give two or three months&#39; notice, but honorable senators must recognise the position confronting us at the present time. To listen to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger one would think that Cooktown is in the next world and not in this world at all. A wire can be sent to Cooktown as easily as to any other place.

                        <para>- That is one of the things which I thought my honorable friend would like to unsay. He has unsaid it, and therefore we can drop it. Another thing the honorable senator said was a little amusing. He told us that as the Government needs the money the Commissioner of Land Tax will take ample care this year that every taxpayer shall be given an opportunity to pay the tax. That is just what the Government are not providing for in this clause. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger was mistaken when he seemed to imply that some notice would be issued in the nature of a demand. There is to be no demand issued to the taxpayer. This notice is to appear in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> a publication which it is the solemn duty of every citizen to read and study. I am afraid that the duty is one which, like many other of the obligations of a citizen, the average citizen does not perform. This notice is to appear in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> and within thirty days after the date named in it this provision is to be applied to the taxpayer, and he cannot help himself. The money may not come in, but it will remain as a first charge upon his land, and after the expiration of the thirty days the taxpayer will be liable to an additional tax of  10  per cent., whether he knows anything about this notice or not. My desire is that as we are going to shear the lamb we should temper the wind to the lamb when shorn. The sole object of honorable senators on this side is to give the taxpayer the time which the Vice-President of the Executive Council thinks he should have to pay up. I agree that now that we have decided to impose a land tax we should take every possible means of seeing that it is paid by every citizen who is liable. I am appealing to the Government to take into consideration the question whether it is not a reasonable thing to make some provision for appeals? We do not know at present what time is to be allowed to a taxpayer to appeal against the assessment of the tax. </para>

                        <para>- AYe fancy we have an example of it in this clause. If the time is enlarged, there will be no harm in prescribing by regulation that a man shall put in his appeal within sixty days, if that will be a reasonable time to adopt, and, in the meantime, he will have to pay the tax. It will not stay for a moment the collection of the tax, but only give a reasonable chance to the taxpayer to understand what he is doing, and the obligation which he is incurring. That answers what my honorable friend said in regard to the collection of the tax within this financial year. I quite recognise that in this year there will not be the same time available as there will be in normal years. If my suggestion be adopted, it will give a reasonable opportunity for a taxpayer to know what he has to pay, and when he has to make the payment, before the fine of 10 per cent, automatically comes into operation. On that ground, I think that the Minister might very fairly enlarge the minimum in the clause. </para>

                    There is nevertheless a period of sixty days afterwards, in which a man has to pay up before he becomes liable to a penalty. It is only reasonable, that the Minister should extend the period to sixty days, and then the tax would have to be paid within three months from the date of the notice in the

                    If the Bill becomes law by the end of this month, there will still be seven months of the financial year to run, so that within the financial year there will be ample time for the notice to be given in the

                    and time for the payment to be concluded. I do not want to propose an amendment. I prefer that the Minister should adopt our suggestion.

                    <para>. - The two answers which the Minister has given are contradictory. His% first assurance was that the clause only provides for a minimum of one month, and that the Commissioner, being a reasonable man, would take into account the physical difficulties in the despatch of the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice, and so on, and would extend the period to such time as he thought necessary, so as to give to every taxpayer a reasonable opportunity. His second answer was something which cut right across that. He said that the necessities of the Government might compel them to shorten the period, and that that is why he is adhering to the term of one month. </para>

First, he says that nobody can say whether a month will be sufficient or not, and then he says that the Government have taken a month as a reasonable time. I do not propose to argue whether it is or not, because I can safely leave that to the consideration of those who are acquainted with the conditions prevailing in the far-distant portions of Australia. The Minister now says that he is not considering the convenience or the fairness to the taxpayer, but only the necessity of the Treasury. He will not expedite the payment of the tax by adhering to the term of one month, but he may put the taxpayer to the necessity of being fined. </para>

The honorable senator knows that there are parts of Australia to which it is practically impossible within one month to get a <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice sent out and a reply in the shape of a remittance. The notices to be posted at post-offices will not reach the eye of many landowners, and consequently the Government will throw upon such persons the necessity of appointing a paid agent in Melbourne to be on the lookout for the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> and to advise them and act for them. Does the Minister want to do that? Surely it will be enough to ask them to pay the tax without throwing upon them the additional burden of having to take the extraordinary step of ascertaining when the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice appears? If the Minister cannot see that, in fair play to the taxpayer, and with a view to making the Act work more smoothly, an extension of the period is desirable, I shall not press for an amendment. </para>

The period which is mentioned in this and the succeeding clause will practically amount to two months. The Commissioner must give not less than one month&#39;s notice, and then the taxpayer will have thirty days therefrom in which to make the payment. Honorable senators on the other side have spoken of the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> not being read by any one, but they know that the newspapers, both daily and weekly, extract and publish any information it contains which is likely to interest their readers. Surely it is known on the other side that that is done all over the Commonwealth in regard to much more trivial matters than the payment of a land tax? I have no doubt that the taxpayers will soon get to know when this tax is payable to the Treasury. </para>

                        <para>- I suspect the Minister when he indicates the slightest desire to be even fair to the payers of the land tax. If a man has incurred the liability to pay the fine of 10 per cent., he will naturally say, &#34; Instead of paying tomorrow, I shall wait two, or three, or four months before I pay, because the penalty will be no greater then than now.&#34; What I am advocating has been demonstrated by experience in New South Wales. In regard to the payment of rents and other payments to the Crown, we started with this penalty of a percentage, and it was invariably found that once a man had exceeded the time allowed he would withhold the payment until the last possible moment. When it was altered to a percentage per annum fine, however, a man was fairly prompt in paying up in order to save the accumulation of interest. Unless my suggestion be adopted, business men and others will have an inducement to defer the payment of the land tax until the last moment. If the words &#34; per annum &#34; are inserted, the penalty will grow day by day, as the laggard taxpayer refrains from paying. Otherwise, he will hang&#34; on to the last moment, unless he has exhausted the patience of the Department. </para>

                    <para>. - It is very strange that amendments of such a subtle character should be moved without a true explanation being given of their import. I do not say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> or any other honorable senator opposite would submit a proposal with a view to getting at the Land Tax Commissioner. But I wish to point out to the Committee the effect of the amendment which has been suggested. In its present form the clause provides that the taxpayer who is a defaulter shall pay a 10 per cent, fine upon the amount of his tax. Next year he will have to pay another 10 per cent, if his payment be not made within the prescribed period. Further, at any time after that period has elapsed, he can be sued for the amount which is owing. But what would be the position under the suggested amendment? If he did not pay the tax for three months after it was due he would be penalized only to the extent of per cent., if he continued a defaulter for six months he would be penalized to the extent of only 5 per cent., and if he did not pay the tax for nine months, he would be- required to pay only an additional 7 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> per cent. Thus the proposal outlined by the Leader of the Opposition would work entirely in favour of the taxpayers. </para>

If the Committee accept the suggestion which has been so wittingly put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> it will fall into a trap. He has told us that if we adopt it we shall impose an additional penalty upon the taxpayer. When I hear honorable senators opposite advocating the imposition of additional penalties upon the taxpayer, I view any suggestion made by them in that connexion with suspicion. </para>

If we follow the example of the State which has most recently imposed the land tax, I am sure that nobody will suffer. </para>

                    <para>- - I thank the Vice-President of the Executive Council for having so fully demonstrated the soundness of the view which I have endeavoured to impress on the Committee. I argued that the clause offers no inducement to a defaulting taxpayer to make good his default in payment. The honorable gentleman himself has admitted that. He has said that the Government propose to levy the same penalty upon a land-owner who is one week in arrear with his payment, as they intend to exact from the land-owner who is nine months in arrear. Such a course of procedure is not only bad business, but it is absolutely unfair. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has conclusively demonstrated the fairness of my view that the penalty should accumulate as time goes on. He drew a picture of the taxpayer who was three months in arrear, another of the land-owner who was six months in arrear, and still another of the defaulter who was nine months in arrear. As the object of the clause is to insure the prompt payment of the tax, it can only achieve its object by making the penalty a cumulative one. In its present form it will defeat the object which it has in view. Any taxpayer who has incurred a fine of io per cent, because he is in default one day, will scarcely hurry round to the Treasury to make his payment the next day. </para>

                        <para>- As soon as the land-owners forward their returns, those returns must be revised by the Commissioner. Subsequently, notices of the assessments have to be inserted in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette, .</inline> and those notices have to be circulated throughout Australia. Surely, for the purposes of the first assessment, we should afford every citizen an ample opportunity of knowing the price at which his land has been valued. I ask honorable senators to recollect that those who assess their own lands will probably pay the tax promptly, in view of the penalty which the Bill imposes for failure to do so. Those who do not pay promptly will doubtless wait for some time. When the returns have been forwarded by the land-owners the assessments will be made, so that the revenue will be flowing in all the time. But in the case of the distant States we ought, I think, to allow sixty days as the maximum period of grace. </para>

                    <para>.- The land tax will be due thirty days after the publication of the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice. There are many people in Australia, however, who may not get information on the subject for a week or a fortnight. Some may be away from home, or in other cases there may be a delay in the delivery of letters. I cannot conceive why the Government should have any objection to make the period two months instead of thirty days, but I can assure the Minister that if he does not agree to the amendment there will be great disappointment. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales)  &#91;3.46&#93;.-  I am sorry that the Minister will not consent to an amendment of this character. It is questionable whether every taxpayer will get his notice within thirty days. Surely sixty days would be a reasonable time within which the taxpayer might be allowed to pay the amount of his assessment. In view of the fact that a  10  per cent. penalty is imposed, many a man who finds that he has accidentally overstepped the time will, realizing that, no matter how long he forbears to pay, the penalty will be no greater, allow the tax to remain unpaid for a much longer period. The object of the Government must be to get the tax into the Treasury. They should not encourage people to say, &#34; As I have exceeded the thirty days allowed by the Act, it does not matter whether I pay now or next month, and I will wait until I get a final intimation from the Commissioner.&#34;

                    <para>. - Some difficulties that have been mentioned by the Opposition in connexion with previous clauses might be met if the Government adopted a principle which is embodied in the New Zealand and New South Wales Acts, both of which are mentioned in the marginal note, but which are not followed in this clause as it stands. The New South Wales Act says that the tax shall be paid at the &#34;places&#34; prescribed, and the New Zealand Act says that the tax shall be paid at the &#34; place or places prescribed.&#34; If the Government would agree to make the word used in this clause &#34;places&#34; instead of &#34;place,&#34; an opportunity would be afforded to persons to pay the tax in various parts of Australia instead of at one particular place. Under an income tax which was imposed in Queensland some years ago, provision was  made for payment to clerks of petty sessions. That was found to be a convenient practice. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - I direct attention to sub-clause 2, and suggest that the authority to register should not be optional. The clause gives the Commissioner power to register the default of one landowner in regard to land tax, but not of another. The discretion is rather invidious. If it be desirable to register any land-owner as being in default, the condition should apply to all. There does not seem to be any justification for picking any one man out, and for saying that the Commissioner may register that John Smith is in default, whilst he does not register that William Brown is. also in default. </para>

                    <para>. - An important constitutional question may arise in connexion with this clause. It is to be presumed that the Vice-President of the Executive Council is in constant touch with the Attorney-General, and he should be furnished with information when any constitutional questions arise. The Vice-President of the Executive Council should give some explanation of the way in which this clause will operate. I should like him to say what will happen where, under a State law, the Crown has a first lien upon the land? Such cases occur over and over again. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator&#39;s mind is either so narrow that he cannot realize the importance of the point, or so gigantic that he is able to grasp it without any explanation whatever. I am assuming that he possesses an ordinary mind, and I should like to know whether he contends that the Crown, as represented&#39; by the Commonwealth authority, can make a claim which will be superior to a claim made by the Crown as represented by a State authority. If he does, I should like to know when and where such a doctrine was laid down in any of the British Dominions? The Crown is expressly mentioned as having certain rights and privileges under the Constitutions of all of the States of Australia, and I should like to know by what interpretation of the State and Commonwealth Constitutions it is claimed that the Crown as represented by the Commonwealth authority shall have priority over the Crown as represented by a State authority in a matter in connexion with which, under the Constitution of the State, the Crown is given a prior claim? </para>

                        <para>- We have again a startling assertion made by a constitutional authority on the other side, that if the Commonwealth makes a claim against the roads of a State it can enforce that claim as against the State authority. The question I have raised was discussed in another place for hours, but the Vice-President of the Executive Council submits this clause without any explanation, and without any warning to the Committee of the possible conflict which may arise under it between the Crown as represented by the Commonwealth and the Crown as represented by the States authorities. The cases decided so far, though I do not say they are identical or analogous with cases which might arise under this clause, show that the Crown as represented by a State authority has all its rights unimpaired. </para>

                            should know that municipal and shire councils exercise only such powers as the Crown confers upon them, and the powers of the Crown as such are never delegated to a local authority. The honorable senator has never heard of a municipality claiming as the Crown, but he must often have heard of a State as the Crown asserting a claim against individuals. The titles of numberless cases show that the powers of the Crown, as represented by the authority of a State, are recognised. Every one familiar with land legislation in the States must know that there are many provisions giving the Crown, as represented by the State authority, priority over every encumbrance to inforce Crown claims against Crown lessees. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has given the Committee 110 indication that the difficulty I mentioned can be constitutionally overcome.

                        <para>- Squeezing blood out of a stone is an easy operation compared to the difficulty of getting any explanation from the honorable senator. The Government apparently contend that every time the Crown, as represented by the Commonwealth authority, asserts a claim, it will be recognised as superior to any claim asserted by the Crown under any other form of authority. </para>

                    <para>.- I know the fondness of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger for constitutional discussions. They are like the bread of life to him. I do not blame the honorable senator, because he must make a reputation somehow, and he might as well make it in this way as in any other. No such doubt as the honorable senator has raised exists in my mind, because, on reading the Constitution, I find that, under section 109, where the laws of a State come into conflict with the laws of the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth laws are to prevail. If the Commonwealth has the power to impose a land tax, and a State Parliament has the power to impose a similar tax, or to deal with the land in any other way, and State laws affecting land come into conflict with the Commonwealth law imposing a land tax, which is to prevail? Does not the Constitution say that the Commonwealth law shall prevail? If there is a doubt on the question, who is to settle it? Not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, thank God, but the High Court. I am satisfied that the High Court will settle the doubt raised in this connexion in accordance with section 109 of the Constitution. I cannot see how it could be settled in any other way. Every one must acknowledge that where the sovereignty of the Commonwealth and of the States come into conflict, one must prevail. Under the Constitution, it is the sovereignty of the Commonwealth that must prevail, and I am quite prepared to leave the decision of the matter to the High Court. </para>

                <para class="block">I hope the Vice-President of the Executive Council will agree that this is a very reasonable provision to introduce here. Clause 14 provides that the taxpayer shall make his return. Clause 47 provides for the notice, and clause 48 for a penalty in case payment is not made in due time. If this Bill is passed, and it probably will be, notwithstanding any opposition from this side, the Government will have the right to demand the tax whatever it may be. The Commissioner of Land Tax will say to a taxpayer, &#34; You have stated the unimproved value of your -land,&#34; and he has to state both the unimproved and the improved value of the land. The Commissioner will say, &#34; If I form the opinion that you have undervalued your land I shall appeal to the High Court and subject you to all sorts of pains and penalties.&#34; It must be remembered that if a man undervalues his land he is liable to a fine of &#163;500 and to treble the amount of the tax, or to the forfeiture of the land. After all, a difference as to value is merely a question of one man&#39;s opinion against another&#39;s, and it may be an honest opinion on each side. The other day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> quoted valuations of land which had been given by different authorities, and which ranged from <inline font-style="italic">-&#163;40</inline> up <inline font-style="italic">to &#163;100.</inline> If opinions can vary, and honestly vary, in this way, and a taxpayer feels that he has an honest opinion as to the value of his land, and it does not accord with the speculative value of some outside person, ought he not to have the opportunity of getting the difference settled in a fair and reasonable manner? It is admitted both elsewhere and here that sooner or later Government valuations will have to be made. I believe it will be found that opinions differ so greatly, and honestly differ, with regard to the value of land that the Government will be forced to make their own independent valuations for the purpose of carrying out the Act. There is no standard of valuation to be found anywhere in the Bill; there is no rule laid down by which a man can value his land. A man may say, &#34; This land is of a certain value to me,&#34; and if somebody else chooses to say, &#34; It is of a much higher value to me,&#34; it will simply be a matter of opinion between the men. Although the owner may be quite honest about his valuation, yet, if the Commissioner forms the opinion that there has been undervaluation on his part he can subject him to all these inconveniences and roundabout proceedings. It may be said that if the amendment were made every taxpayer might apply to have his land taxed. But I do not think that that is likely to happen. I imagine that in the bulk of cases there will be some rule by which the owner can fix fairly well the value of his land. Take the case of a man who lives in a State which imposes a land tax. At present the Bill does not allow a taxpayer to say to the Commissioner, &#34; Here is the value of my land as fixed by, say, the State of South Australia.&#34; He cannot plead that as being the fair value of his land if the Commissioner holds a contrary opinion. No matter what valuation may be made, the Commissioner can still take proceedings against the owner under this provision. The Government ought not to object to a man who has an honest doubt as to the fair commercial value of his land asking the Commissioner to make a valuation. I would not object if the Government would accept my proposal with an amendment that thereupon, or within a reasonable time thereafter, the Commissioner should cause such valuation to be made at the expense of the taxpayer. I hope that the amendment will be accepted so as to remove the terror which otherwise will be in the minds of a good many persons. If it be inserted it will not do any harm to the measure or the Commonwealth, but it will do a service to the taxpayers. After all, there is an ethical side of the question. I do not think that the Government ought to want to penalize a man because he is honestly of the opinion that his land is not worth so much as the Commissioner estimates. I certainly think that the provision ought to be inserted in order to prevent persons from giving an extraordinarily high value to their land merely out of fear of the terrible consequences which are apprehended from the measure. </para>

                    <para>. - There are one or two reasons why I cannot accept an amendment of this sort. At the commencement of the Bill, &#34; the unimproved value &#34; is defined as what the owner would take for land if he received a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> offer. There is no owner who can have any doubt as to what he would take for his land. That is the simplest basis of valuation which could be adopted anywhere. Surely if I own a piece of land .1 should know what I am prepared to take for it. </para>

                        <para>- No. When the Commissioner is satisfied that an undervaluation has been made with intent to defraud the revenue, he goes to the High Court, and the owner has to prove that he had no such intent. That is a very fair position in which to put a land-owner who attempts to evade his share of taxation. The object of this amendment is to nullify all the penalties which have been provided for the purpose of arriving at a fair and legitimate value of the land and improvements. </para>

                    <para>. - The last sentence of the Minister&#39;s speech struck me as being most extraordinary. The proposition put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> is not to undermine, nor does it come in conflict in any way with, the provisions of the Bill. What it does offer to a land-owner is an alternative ; that is, a means by which, at his own expense, he can put himself on a good footing with the Commissioner &#39;without incurring the pains and penalties of the Act. The landowners who support this proposition will practically come forward to say, &#34; We are prepared to pay blackmail rather than incur the liabilities under your Act.&#34; There ought to be no necessity for making this provision. </para>

But they are prepared to submit to this blackmail rather than to pay experts to value their land, knowing that they will afterwards be haled before the High Court. The Vice-President of the Executive Council spoke just now as if members of the Opposition desire; to assist taxpayers to evade their obligations to the Crown. I resent any such suggestion. There has been nothing said by honorable senators upon this side of the Chamber to warrant it. Their only aim has been to obviate the infliction of unnecessary hardship and injustice upon those who will be called upon to pay this tax. </para>

                        <para>- The clause deals with the unimproved value of land, and all sorts of opinions may be held in that connexion. Only last week I quoted a case in which a man valued his land at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per foot, whilst his neighbour, who possessed exactly similar land, valued it at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4.</inline> per foot. Probably the former valued it at the price which he had paid for it, whilst the latter valued it at the price at which he was willing to sell. If the Commissioner formed the opinion that that land was worth  ,&#163;4  per foot, he would,&#34; under this Bill, be able to subject the taxpayer who valued it at only <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per foot to all the inconveniences and disabilities which are imposed by clause  46.  My amendment merely provides that the taxpayer may request the Commissioner to supply him with a valuation of his land. It does not contemplate that he shall escape any penalty whatever. If the Government are not prepared to accept such an eminently reasonable proposition, it is evident that they are not ready to do a fair thing by the taxpayers. </para>

It would merely afford the taxpayer an opportunity to pay upon a proper valuation of his land after a full investigation has been made by the Commissioner. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has said that any man can value his own land. He can, but he cannot be certain that his valuation is correct, especially if he has held the land for any considerable time. Only the other day I cited the case of a property in Sydney which was valued by two first-class valuators who were not antagonistic to each other, and whose valuations, which were made in the interests of the owners at Home, were, respectively, ^10,000 and ^6,000. The margin between these amounts represented an honest difference of opinion, and when their attention was called to it, both valuators declined to alter their valuations. The adoption of the amendment of

                        <para>- Not at all. Clause 46 provides that the land-owner must satisfy the Court that he has not made an undervaluation for the purpose of defrauding the revenue. In other words, he has thrown upon him the obligation of proving a negative. He has to establish his innocence. Such a course of procedure is in direct antagonism to the cardinal principle of British jurisprudence. The least that the Government can do is to accept the amendment, instead of brushing it aside as if it were unworthy of consideration. </para>

I have always understood that it was courteous for Ministerial supporters to remain in the Chamber for the purpose of hearing the arguments which are adduced in opposition to the measures submitted by the Government. But all the arguments which have been advanced from this side of the Chamber have not had the slightest effect upon honorable senators opposite. I can only conclude that they have received their instructions elsewhere. An excellent proposal has been submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> and yet it has been treated in the most contumelious fashion. </para>

                    <para>. - The Vice-President of the Executive Council was very insistent in his affirmation that no one was so competent to judge the value of land as the owner himself. But the Minister seems to overlook the fact that the pitfall which this Bill places in the way of the owner is in making a division between the total value of his estate and the value of the improvements upon it. A land-owner may say, &#34; I value my property at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> an acre, and am willing to sell at that price.&#34; But he is not allowed to remain there. He may put in the total value of his estate at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> per acre, and that may be the honest value. But then he has to divide the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> between the value of the land itself and the value of the improvements ; and that is where the trouble is going to occur. The owner may say, &#34; I value the land itself at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> per acre, and the improvements at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2.&#34;</inline> But when the matter goes before the Commissioner, he may say, &#34; I divide that value into <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4.</inline> for the land, and <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> for the improvements &#34; ; and that being a difference of more than 25 per cent, the Commissioner may proceed to put clause 46 into operation. It is idle to say that the landowner, because he is the best judge of the value of his property, ought to be penalized if some other valuator differs from him in the extent to which the total value of the estate should be divided as between the land and the improvements. What would the Government lose by adopting this amendment ? </para>

                        <para>- This amendment does not destroy the value of those clauses. It simply offers an alternative to a landowner who is unable to determine the value of the improvements on his own estate. A land-owner who hesitated to take the risk of determining under which portion of the definition part of the Bill he would separate the value of the improvements and the value of the land on his estate would, under the amendment, be able to say to the Commissioner, &#34; Call in a valuator of your own, and I will pay him rather than take the risk of deciding how much of my estate is represented by land, and how much by improvements.&#34; If the purpose of this Bill be merely to collect a tax, and to break up big estates, there is no reason on earth why the amendment should not be accepted. I can only adduce one reason why it should be objected to, and that is because it offers a fair and honest means of enabling a land-owner to demonstrate the value of his estate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has told us frankly that he is going to return his land at higher than he believes to be the true value in order to escape the pitfalls of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, I am sure that he will when he sees his remark in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I was very glad to hear him make such a statement. I am glad to have it admitted that this legislation is proposed in a spirit of absolute vindictiveness and not with a desire to secure justice. Mark the contrast between this Bill and the system which prevailed in Queensland. The lands held by lessees in that State are amongst the most valuable in Australia for settlement purposes. There has been a constant conflict as to valuations between the Crown and the Crown lessees for the last twenty or thirty years. We have had no fewer than seven or eight amending Land Acts, the main purpose of which has been to secure justice as between the Crown as the owner of the land, and the lessees who have taken it up. The Government established a mode of procedure by which the lessee could obtain justice in case of a difference of opinion as to valuations. A perfectly independent Board was established, with a  chairman  having powers almost equal to those of a Judge of the Full Court. The members of the Board could not be removed from their offices except under some such conditions as pertain to the removal of a Judge of the High Court. While Parliament gave those strong and independent powers to the Land Board, they also gave a power of appeal to a Court presided over by a Judge, and they allowed a further appeal from a single Judge to the Full Court. At the same time, it was provided that if the decision were given against the land-owner he should pay the costs, which in many cases amounted to thousands of pounds. The strongest powers and the widest discretion were given to the Land Board in assessing from time to time the values of the rents due to the Queensland Government. No party ever objected to the right of appeal. But throughout this Bill not a single provision is made for correcting the values of the Land Commissioner, or for making him pay costs on account of any mistake that may occur while he is acting in the interests of the revenue. I do not know that any legislation in New Zealand or in any of the States of the Commonwealth is framed on these lines. </para>

                        <para>- Apparently, the honorable senator regards the perpetration of gross injustice in a spirit of revengeful retaliation as being up-to-date. The Commissioner of Land Tax will be human, and, therefore, liable to make mistakes. Usually where the Administration makes a mistake, it must carefully consider its position or abide the consequences, but under this Bill no provision is made for correcting a mistake made by the Commissioner of Land Tax. Suppose, in the case of an appeal to the High Court in the case of forfeiture under this Bill, and the valuation of the Commissioner of Land Tax is not sustained, he will be in a position to snap his fingers at the taxpayer who brings him into Court. He will have to pay nothing, and will be able to smile all round. There is no precedent for such legislation as this anywhere in the world. </para>

The honorable senator must be aware that where, under State laws, the Government are responsible for mistakes made by their officials, they take very good care that their officers shall not make mistakes. But this Bill does not contain any of the valuable safeguards to be found in other legislation against the blunders, wilful or otherwise, of servants of the Crown. The Vice-President of the Executive Council relies upon, his majority. As soon as we resume our seats, all he has to do is to send round the Whip, and the thing is settled.

                        <para>- That is so, but the Vice-President of the Executive Council knows that he can call them up when they are wanted. I suppose there is not another legislative chamber in any part of the world in which a measure so largely affecting the future development of the country would be regarded with such absolute indifference by the supporters of the Government, and in connexion with which the Opposition would be met with so many flippant and haughty remarks from the Minister in charge of it The word has gone forth that every letter of this Bill must stand. I am acquainted with the details of a case which arose in Queensland in which an important municipal council greatly overvalued a city property. The valuation put upon it by the officers of the council was from 75 to 100 per cent, in excess of the value at which it stood in the books of the company, representing the owner. An appeal was made, the ground of which was that the value put upon the property by the company was 50 per cent, higher than the rental value capitalized. When the appeal came on for hearing, the counsel for the company said, &#34;I am out for fight; this valuation of yours is monstrous.&#34; The counsel for the municipality replied, &#34;What do you want?&#34; The answer was, &#34;I am not here to auction; I am out for fight,&#34; and before the briefs were opened the counsel for the municipality made an offer to reduce the municipal valuation by 50 per cent. Counsel for the property said that that was not enough, and still talked fight, and then a further &#39; offer was made to reduce the municipal valuation by another 15 per cent. Counsel for the property then said, &#34; I will accept that.&#34; Here, upon an appeal, the valuation of an important municipality was reduced by 65 per cent., but if the Queensland Statute had been framed on the lines of this Bill the company and owner of the property in question would have had to submit -to the blackmail. </para>

                        <para>- He paid on the overvaluation for a time rather than undertake litigation, but he got tired of it at last, and fought the municipal authorities, and others whose property was overvalued followed his example. In this measure the Government include drastic provisions involving even the forfeiture of the land, and give the taxpayer no protection such as he is given under State legislation, in having the right to appeal if he believes that his property has been materially overvalued. The State officials under such legislation are faced with certain risks, and they are in consequence scrupulously careful not to overvalue. Notwithstanding this, there are cases in which they&#39; do overvalue. Under this Bill, though a taxpayer, because he is unable to differentiate between the value of the improvements and unimproved value, honestly returns what is regarded by the Commisisoner of Land Tax as an undervaluation, he is made liable to all these penalties, and there is no provision in the Bill under which he can refer his valuation to an impartial tribunal, and say, &#34;Value the property for me, and I shall abide by your decision.&#34; That is the kind of provision for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> is asking. He does not propose to interfere with any of the clauses providing for the collection qf revenue from this tax upon fair valuations, but he asks that the taxpayer shall be allowed to refer the valuation of his property to an impartial tribunal. The Vice-President of the Executive Council will inflict a gross and manifest injustice upon taxpayers under this Bill if he does not accept the amendment. I have noticed a great contrast between the way in which this Bill was dealt with in another place and the way in which it is being dealt with here. When in another place questions were raised and suggestions offered by the Opposition, the Government &#39;time and again agreed to the postponement of the clause objected to, the representations of the </para>

                    <para>.- I think it would have been more in accordance with fair play if some men of independent position had been put on the Board instead of three public servants. I believe it would have given much greater satisfaction if outside men had been chosen, because we cannot possibly expect that the Commissioners will be absolutely free from the spirit of the Government of the day. I urge the Minister to meet this view, in order that the public may have more confidence in the Board. Of course, the whole proposition is objectionable. It is bringing a man down very low to compel him to submit his affairs, not only to the Board, but to Parliament itself. That is a very humiliating position, into which I think no fair and honorable man ought to be put. </para>

                        <para>- Even if it were brought before an outsider, the incident would have to be reported to Parliament, together with so many particulars as might be deemed necessary. But why is it necessary that it should be referred to Parliament at all? It is to prevent the thing which honorable senators on the opposite side wish to avoid, and that is collusion between a taxpayer who would desire to be fraudulent and the Board. We do not want anything of that kind to occur, and therefore provision is made for the presentation of a report to Parliament so that it may keep its eye on its officers, and see that everything is done in a straightforward and honest manner. With respect to the question of humiliation, there are many men who have become insolvent, and have been placed in very difficult positions, through circumstances over which they had no control. It is only in such cases that the Board can act, and it will be no disgrace to a man if he has been unfortunate in such circumstances. It will be the right of a taxpayer who finds himself in difficulties, caused by misfortune over which he had no control, to appeal to the Board for the purpose of getting a release from the whole or part of his tax. There is nothing wrong in the provision. I am sure that I should have far more faith in a Board composed of three public servants than in any outside persons who might be appointed. </para>

                        <para>- What is the use of the Minister trying to put on a halo and wings before us? We know that they do not suit him. We know that over and over again when we are in a warm mood we do not stand upon nice distinctions.- Sometimes we take the gloves off, subject to the ruling of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> or the  Chairman  of Committees. I repeat that, under this clause, every member of Parliament will be able to &#34; take it out &#34; of a land-owner who has been released from payment of the tax. We are all human, and it is just as well te- recognise it. I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council to postpone the consideration of the clause, with a view to affording us time to frame a provision which will insure that the decisions of this independent Board shall be guarded with secrecy. From the Income Tax Acts of the various States, we can easily shape a provision, by means of which our object may be attained. The clause evidences ait intention to extend mercy to the taxpayer in case of hardship. I trust that that mercy will he extended to him without exposing him to humiliation if ever he should come into conflict with any representative of the people in either branch of the Legislature. Will the Government postpone the clause? </para>

I indorse the honorable senator&#39;s statement that the position of the land-owner will be just as good if the clause be eliminated from the Bill, as it will be if it be retained. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has said that he can see no injustice in it. Neither can I. But the clause is, nevertheless, an affirmation that there is injustice in the remainder of the Bill. It is a clumsy attempt to right the wrong. It provides that if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the exaction of the tax from a land-owner will entail serious hardship upon him, the Commissioner .may refer his case to a Board of which the Commissioner himself will be the dominating factor. In other words, he may refer it from himself, as Commissioner, to himself/ as  Chairman  of the Board. Surely he ought not to be a member of the Board ! </para>

                        <para>- I wish to place upon record the rank absurdity of this clause. It is absurd to provide that the taxpayer must first satisfy the Commissioner that the clause will inflict injustice upon him, and that the Commissioner shall afterwards be appointed the judge of his own actions. If the clause is to work equitably, any land-owner ought to have a right to go before the Board. But he has no such right. He has first to convince the Commissioner - the individual whose assessment is probably the cause of his ruin-- </para>

Unless the Commissioner is convinced that an injustice is being done to the taxpayer, he will not send the case on to the Board. </para>

                        <para>- That a man has suffered loss is a matter of fact, but it is a matter of opinion whether the exaction of the full amount of the tax would ruin him. A land-owner need not be grateful to this Government for saying, &#34; We will relieve you of your debt after you have become insolvent.&#34; The Bill does not give the man a right to place his case before a Board. The Commissioner can block him from securing that appeal - block him from appealing for mercy. On the contrary, however, if the Commissioner chooses to allow the man to appeal, then he, being  chairman  of the Board, becomes an advocate for the land-owner; because, having expressed an opinion that hardship was inflicted, the Commissioner, when the matter came before the Board, would have to be favorable to the appellant. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MColl</inline> has expressed the opinion that the Board ought to be composed differently. It is absurd to say that the Commissioner, who has the right to veto an appeal, if he likes, is then to be not only a member, but the most important member of the Board of Appeal. Another point is that this clause only operates where a loss has been incurred. It does not act in any way as a preventative. </para>

                <para class="block">What is the good of saying to a man who has already suffered a heavy loss, &#34; If you cannot pay we will not insist&#34;? The clause ought to operate so as to avoid placing a man in that position. If a man says, &#34; I am not bankrupt, but if you levy this tax upon me I shall be,&#34; the Bill does nothing for him. He must have suffered an actual loss of a serious character before he can be helped. Would it not be better to prevent that unfortunate result from occurring ? That is the very thing that I ask for in this clause, but it is the very thing that honorable senators opposite will not approve. They are not out to assist any land-owner in this country, or any man who owns any wealth, from being wronged. As long as a man has a penny left or a feather to fly with, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> and those on whom he relies would be after him. If there were any possibility of carrying an amendment I would move to strike out the words &#34;has suffered such a loss.&#34; But I realize that there is not the slightest hope. It is not competent under this clause for any man to show the Commissioner that the imposition of&#39; the tax will seriously hurt him. The Bill will not help him until he has suffered so serious a loss that the tax would make him bankrupt. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad that the appeal has brought a few members of the Ministerial party into the Chamber; though I observe that they are drifting but again as soon as they find that they were not called to a division. At any rate, while they are present, we have an opportunity of directing their attention to the clause, and of showing whether any great advantage really pertains to it. My colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> has pointed out that the taxation Commissioner is the only man who can put the clause into operation. He has to be satisfied, first of all, that the taxpayer has suffered loss, and that the exactions of the full amount of land tax will entail serious hardship upon him. Then he has power to call in two members of the Civil Service to assist him in determining whether any relief should be given. The clause is very unsatisfactory ; because, before it can be put into operation, the Commissioner has to be satisfied that the individual has suffered loss. Let us see how it will operate : In the first place, a debt due to the Crown cannot be released except by payment.. Bankruptcy or insolvency will not relieve any man from liability for a debt due to the Crown. When he hands over the whole of his assets to an official assignee, and the creditors are paid so much in the &#163;1, the Crown can still step in and claim 20s. in the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> after the debtor has entered into business again ; and perhaps, by his energy and assiduity, is endeavouring to get himself into a fairly sound position. I should say that if a man becomes bankrupt, the Crown ought to prove its claim, and take the same position as any other creditor. The bankrupt, on obtaining his certificate of discharge, should be absolutely free from debt to the Crown, as well as from any other debt. The position of the Crown under the law is akin to that of a character in one of Shakespeare&#39;s plays, who insisted upon the satisfaction of the full amount of his bond. It is time that a principle of that character Was treated as a fiction, and that the Crown should not occupy any better position than an ordinary creditor. I would allow the Crown, in the event of a land-owner&#39;s insolvency, to make a claim which should be just as valid as the claim of any other creditor, and no more. Once he received a certificate of discharge his earnings should be free from any liability for debts incurred before the date of his bankruptcy. It should be noted that this clause goes a step further. It deals not only with a case in which the taxpayer satisfies the Commissioner that he has become bankrupt or insolvent, but with a case in which it is shown that the taxpayer has suffered such a loss that the exaction of the full amount of the tax would entail serious hardship. I should like the Minister to define what sort of loss is contemplated in this provision. </para>

                        <para>- The Government propose that the liability for the tax shall attach to the land, and to relieve the &#62;owner only of personal liability, which would probably be worthless, since he would have become insolvent, or be in a position in which he was unable to pay his debts. The Crown will still hold its claim against the land, and this must reduce its value if an attempt is made to dispose of it to meet the owner&#39;s debts. I can cite the case of a company that has constructed a railway upon the land-grant system. Large sums of money have been expended in the construction of the line. Suppose it is shown that the railway has not for years past paid expenses, and will not pay expenses for years to come, will that be regarded as a case in which the taxation imposed upon the lands held by the company may be remitted ? </para>

                        <para>- 1 ask whether the case I have cited would be regarded as one in which serious hardship would be involved in the exaction of the full amount of the land tax. If we wish people to assist us in developing the country, we must give them a fair show, and treat them at least no worse than other individuals in the community. If this company went into liquidation, it would escape the liability to this taxation, because there would be no personal liability, and if a company goes into liquidation, it is wiped out as if it had never existed. If we introduce legislation of this character, we shall find ourselves confronted with all sorts of difficult cases. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has said that there may be a remission of taxation, because of losses from drought, flood, ticks, or fire, but I think it will be curious to note in how many cases there will be any remission of taxation for any of these reasons. This clause should be entirely eliminated. It should not be a matter of grace and favour to permit an individual who has become insolvent to be relieved of a liability which may be brought against him at some future time, when he has overcome his financial difficulties, and is in a position to do a little for himself and those dependent upon him. </para>

                        <para>- Have the present Government attempted to get rid of the bad inheritance? It is necessary that the authorities should be satisfied that people claiming old-age pensions are entitled to receive them. This clause provides that where a remission of taxation is granted, a full statement of all cases in which, and the grounds on which, remissions of taxation have been granted, shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament. Surely we may trust the Commissioner of Land Tax, the Secretary to the Treasury, and the Comptroller- General of Customs to grant these remissions only in cases in which it would be reasonable to do so without requiring that all particulars connected with the cases shall be laid before Parliament. We do not call upon our Judges for a report of the particulars of the cases which come before them. It is possible that much mischief might be caused by the publication of the particulars in cases to which this clause is applied. </para>

                    <para>. - I have directed the attention of the Vice-President of the Executive Council to consequences which may possibly arise from the operation of this measure. I have referred to the conflict which might arise under a previous clause between the Crown as represented by the Commonwealth authorities and the Crown as represented by a State authority in enforcing claims upon land. There is no doubt that, as soon as State officials learn that a land-owner is likely to become insolvent, or has suffered serious financial hardships, the Crown, represented by the State authority, will step in at once, and assert its claim, and where will the Crown, as represented by the Commonwealth authority, be then ? This clause really offers an inducement to State Governments to take action at once to secure any lien they may have upon land. They will not wait for the Commonwealth Government to take action. Every suggestion that is made from this side to secure some mitigation of the conditions to be imposed upon taxpayers under this Bill is laughed to scorn. I object to this clause, and am unable to understand why it has been introduced. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that it is one of the most ridiculous things in legislation to give the officials intrusted with the collection of the tax under this measure a seat on this Board, which is to be appointed to release taxpayers in certain circumstances from their liability to pay the tax. Unless it is to be an appeal from the &#34; Commissioner drunk &#34; to the &#34; Commissioner sober,&#34; it is absolutely stupid. </para>

I ask any honorable senator on the other side to cite an Act which empowers subordinate officials to say whether a man shall or shall not pay the full amount of his tax. It is only with certain reservations that such a power is granted to Courts. Is there any precedent, I ask, for any administration of the kind which is contemplated by this clause?1 It delegates the administration of the power of taxation and the power of remitting the tax. </para>

                        <para>- I would not delegate the power at all. I cannot understand how the clause came to find a place in the measure. It is extremely dangerous for Parliament to delegate its power to impose or to remit taxation. At one time the Crown in England thought that through its servants it could with impunity screw money from the people, but it had to be taught a very bitter lesson on that point. </para>

                        <para>- That is a clear confession that the Government anticipate an appeal on behalf of some large land-owners. Evidently they contemplate the existence of conditions under which the imposition of this land tax will cause such hardship to some persons that they may have to part with their estates. Therefore, they say, in order to pretend to be merciful, &#34; If the case is extremely hard we shall appoint a Board of public officials to determine whether any remission of the tax should be granted.&#34; If the Commissioner is intrusted with the power to levy the tax he ought to be allowed to deal with a hard case on his own responsibility, always being amenable to Parliament for an improper exercise of his discretion. A great parliamentary principle is involved in the clause, which was strongly objected to in another place , but, of course, unavailingly. In this way the Government are seeking to set up an extraordinary despotic bureaucracy. I feel sure that the officials themselves will revolt at the exercise of this power. Suppose that the Commissioner of Land Tax should say in a deserving case that the tax ought to be remitted.  His  colleagues on the Board will have to decide whether or not they shall overrule him. But suppose they are at loggerheads with one another. They will have to sit <inline font-style="italic">in camera</inline> and fight it out, but how they came to their conclusions the Lord only will know. Under the measure we can keep some hold upon the Commissioner, but we can have no knowledge as to <inline font-style="italic">in camera</inline> meetings of the Board until cases are reported and possibly some things are exposed which ought not to be revealed. Of course, there will not be the slightest attempt made on the other side to answer our objections to this provision. But I hope that the discussion, both elsewhere and here, will deter any other Government from bringing down a provision of this kind. lt is one of the hollowest attempts at mercy which I have ever seen attempted. A man would almost prefer  10  ask for mercy from a&#39; sort of inquisition than to avail himself of the opportunity granted by this clause. He would rather go under than submit to laying his misfortunes and hardships bare before two or three public officials who might bandy them if they liked over a bottle of champagne at the club. </para>

                    <para>. - The objection has already been urged to the clause that a land-owner cannot approach the Board appointed to investigate his case until he has satisfied the Commissioner that it is one of hardship. If he is to receive fair play at the hands of the Board, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger&#39;s suggestion should be adopted. Certainly its adoption would have the effect of making the Board more or less independent of the Commissioner. We all know that the  chairman  of any body wields great influence. If the Commissioner be a.i officer who is noted for his fairness, the other members of the Board will doubtless be willing to elect him as their  chairman.  But I do not think it is desirable to compel a land-owner to approach the Commissioner in the first place, and subsequently to force him to come before a Board of which the Commissioner is  chairman. </para>

                    <para>.- As a matter of strict justice, I do not think tr,at the Commissioner should be a member of the Board at all, because he will practically sway it. But under this clause it is also proposed to appoint to the Board two of the hardest-worked officials in the Commonwealth service - men who cannot be expected to devote the time and attention that will be required of them to thoroughly investigate the intricacies ot these cases of hardship. To my mind, we ought to have outsiders on the Board. </para>

He cannot expect those who, because they are unable to obtain justice, wish to secure mercy for a hard-pressed taxpayer, to assist him in striking out the clause? I will undertake to say that there is not one honorable senator who will seriously urge that it squares with our idea of fair play to provide, first, that the Commissioner must be satisfied that a case of hardship has been made out, and, secondly, that that officer shall afterwards act as one of the judges on the case. But we cannot now amend that portion of the clause which places the Commissioner in a position of authority. </para>

                        <para>- I see no reason why the Crown should not take its share of the dividend of an estate, in common with other creditors. It could then declare that the unpaid portion of the debt should be regarded as extinguished. But before a land-owner can plead for a little mercy at the hands of the Board appointed to investigate his case, he has to run the gauntlet of the Commissioner, and the Commissioner has to determine whether the benefits of this clause shall be extended to him. However, by accepting the amendment of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, we have passed the point at which we can consider a proposal for the removal of the Commissioner from the Board. Consequently, no amendment which can be submitted now will achieve the object which honorable senators upon this side of the Chamber have in view. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause is rather curiously constructed, and it impinges upon the practice affecting the relations existing between solicitor and client. When a jury has gone so far as to determine that an undervaluation equals  25  per cent., in the absence of evidence to the contrary it is provided that a <inline font-style="italic">-prima facie</inline> case of fraud shall be held to exist. It is probable that many land-owners will make their valuations with the aid of their solicitors, as is frequently done in the case of income tax returns. But under the Income Tax Acts of the States the privilege affecting the relationship of solicitor and client is respected. It is feared in this case, however, that that privilege will be taken away. The subject has exercised tha minds of members of the profession.. I have advised the Vice-President of the Executive Council, through his secretary, and he knows the quarters from which representations have been made to me. I addressed a telegram on the subject ti a solicitor, whose name I shall not mention, though I have supplied it in confidence to the Vice-President of the Executive Council. This gentleman had previously directed my attention to the subject, and I drew his attention to another aspect of it. The gentleman to whom I refer is one of the most eminent lawyers in my own State, and one who, as a constitutional authority, is equal to the very best in Australia. I asked him to consider certain points of view, and the following is the answer which I received from him - </para>

                        your telegram on the Land Tax Bill I much fear that in any proceedings for forfeiture the privilege of solicitor and client would fail. The evasion or attempted evasion would be a criminal action, and I rather think that - assuming the competence of the Federal Parliament to pass this measure - all communications between solicitor and client leading up to and connected with the offence would be available to the Crown, but not any subsequent communications between solicitor and client with reference to the defence of the person accused of the offence.

                <para class="block">I&#39;-it anticipation. I suggest that communications <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> and honestly made between solicitor and client as to the valuation of land for the purpose of this measure ought to be protected. At present there is only this protection - that the proceedings have to reach the stage of going to a jury before an intent to commit fraud can be declared. I am inclined, on further consideration of the matter, to agree with my friend, whom I have consulted, that once that point has been reached all privilege is gone. The intent to defraud having been established by the verdict of a jury, the common law rule would prevail that the privilege attaching to communications between solicitor and client had entirely gone. The only hope one might have in such a case is that possibly the Courts might construe the ordinary meaning of the word &#34; fraud &#34; or &#34; conspiracy &#34; as not being the same as the meaning of the term &#34; fraud &#34; used in this clause. But, nevertheless, it may be that solicitors, when they consider this subject, will refuse to advise their clients, because, if they give advice, and their clients, acting on it, submit their valuations to the Land Tax Commissioner, the client, standing on the advice of the solicitor, may find himself, by reason of the land having been held to have been undervalued 25 per cent., brought before a jury, where a case may be found against him. In such a case the plea of privilege would not prevail. I have very eminent authority - one that I respect very much indeed - in support of my view. I am sure that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will also respect the authority to whom I allude. The only safeguards that the profession could have would be that the proceedings must go through various stages before they can reach a jury ; and, secondly, that possibly &#34; fraud,&#34; as used in this clause, is not the kind of offence which the Court must construe as identical with &#34; fraud &#34; as ordinarily understood. Some solicitors, however, wish to know how they stand in this matter. Some have gone so far as to say that they will have to consider the position gravely before they will advise in matters arising under this Bill. I hope that their fears are unfounded. The Vice-President of the Executive Council might, at any rate, give some assurance as to what will be the effect of the clause in a case of the kind. </para>

                    <para>. - I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger that no honest lawyer need be afraid of anything that can happen under this Bill. A client can go to his solicitor, and ask for his assistance in carrying out his obligations, and the solicitor will be able to assist him to the full. I am sure, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger would be just as earnest as any one could possibly be in desiring to prevent anything in the nature of fraudulent collusion between a solicitor and his client. Whenever the transactions of a solicitor and client are perfectly legitimate, and the client is honestly seeking to fulfil his obligations, and his legal adviser assists him to do so, if an error is made by either or both, no Commissioner of Taxes who will ever be in the service of the Commonwealth would decline to give fair play to the parties. It is admitted that mistakes may be made, and when it can be shown that there has been no collusion between the solicitor and the client to do a wrong, no one would desire to treat them harshly. I am certain that no honest lawyer need be afraid to take on the business of an honest client, and assist him in filling in his returns. The confidence which should exist between solicitor and client will be inviolable unless guilt is proved before a jury against either or both. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline>
                    Ledger has drawn attention to a difficulty that might arise in connexion with the position of a solicitor and his client in connexion with a prosecution under clause 67. The matter is one upon which the Vice-President of the Executive Council can hardly be expected to furnish the Committee with a legal opinion. I think that we need more particularly to direct our attention to the peculiarity of the clause in its general application. I offer no opinion in regard to the relations between solicitor and client. I have my own opinion as to what the position would be; and it does not give me any great apprehension. But, apart from that aspect, I wish to point to a matter that has been raised by the Law Institute of New South Wales. When this Bill was first introduced, correspondence took place between the representatives of the Law Institute and the Attorney-General. Very strong protests were made as to the action taken by the Government in regard to the burden of proof. It was pointed out most strongly to the Attorney-General that in this Bill the Government were abandoning accepted principles of British jurisprudence and legal practice. The Attorney-General, in reply, briefly defended himself by saying that there were other instances in which a similar practice had prevailed. He pointed to what had been done under the Customs Act. In reply, it was pointed out that the provisions of this Bill go very much further than does anything contained in the Customs Act, and the argument was again pressed upon the Attorney-General with great force. But all to no purpose. I have read the whole of the correspondence which passed. The question as to whether the practice proposed to be pursued is unEnglish, or contrary to our usual practice, has been in debate between
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline>
                    and, I suppose, a score of legal men, who have given this matter very particular attention. There was a strongly-marked difference of opinion. On the one side there was the opinion of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline>
                    and on the other side there was the opinion of the men who represented the Law Institute - some of whom have had a lengthy experience as practising members of the legal profession, and who, by the reason of the knowledge acquired during their professional career, were assuredly as competent as any one in Australia to give an opinion as to the effect of the proposed law, and as to how it corresponds and compares with the law generally known to British subjects. Here we are proposing to create what is termed an indictable offence, for which a man may oe put upon his trial before a jury. Certainly, the penalty provided is a pecuniary one; but if the penalty be inflicted upon any individual, and he is not able to pay the sum prescribed, there is a method of &#34;taking it out&#34; which is not much better for him than would be the case if he were sent to gaol for misdemeanour in the first instance. The one principle that has been ground into the mind of every one who has studied British law has been that every man is to be held to be innocent until he l.as been proved to be guilty. Of course, that principle developed from a system that was pursued in less merciful clays, when suspected persons were tortured until they confessed. Fortunately, the days of endeavouring to extort a confession from an accused person have gone, as far as British jurisprudence is concerned. A more humane law has been allowed to come into being, under which a man is presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty. But under this Bill, a man is to be presumed to be guilty until he proves himself innocent. In speaking earlier this afternoon, I pointed out that, in the days when we were learning logic, we were told that it is impossible to prove a negative. Under this Bill the Government call upon a taxpayer to prove a negative wherever it is possible to launch a prosecution against him. A man against whom the evidence may appear to be very black indeed may be charged with murder, but he will not be convicted unless a jury is satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that he is guilty of the offence with which he is charged. He is not called upon to prove that he is innocent. It is for the Crown to prove his guilt beyond all reasonable doubt. That is a practice adopted as the result of centuries of experience in the administration of the law in Great Britain. But while a man who is charged with murder or any other serious crime is given the benefit of the doubt, a man who undervalues his property is to be presumed under this Bill to be guilty of having done so with intent to defraud &#34;the revenue.

                        <para>- Nobody knows better than the man charged with having committed a murder whether he is guilty or not, but he is not called upon to prove his innocence. If, in the opinion of a jury, a taxpayer has undervalued his property to the extent of 25 per cent, or more, it is presumed under this clause that he did so with intent to defraud, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Is this a reasonable provision? Is this legislation which this Parliament, representing an enlightened people, should in the twentieth century be called upon to pass? Is this fair play or British justice, and can honorable senators opposite defend it for a moment? The Government under this Bill do not accept the responsibility of proving their case when haling a man on a charge of this character. We should bear in mind that every law we pass may be regarded as a precedent, and may later on be quoted to justify a similar law or a law of even a more stringent character. We have been referred to the Customs Act for an instance of a similar provision. </para>

I should like to know where we are to find a precedent for this clause. We are referred in clause after clause to similar provisions in the New Zealand or New South Wales Acts. There is no marginal note to this clause to show where it is taken from. Perhaps it emanates from the fertile brain of the Attorney-General. He has probably said, &#34; We shall make this Bill so drastic and shall provide in it for all sorts of pains and penalties so that wicked men who have made money may be sent to gaol if we can manage to send them there.&#34; </para>

Under clause  46,  for the protection of the revenue against the undervaluation of land, certain steps may be taken if it is considered that a taxpayer has undervalued his land to the extent of  25  per cent, or more, and unless the taxpayer satisfies a Justice of the High Court that he has not undervalued his property with intent to defraud, the land may be acquired by the Commonwealth at the owner&#39;s valuation, plus  10  per cent. </para>

                        <para>- It is true that if a man has stolen property in his possession for which he can give no account, he is liable to punishment under some of our Police Acts, but that is a very different thing. I say that the vicious principle which is contained in this clause is also contained in clause  46.  Under that clause the taxpayer&#39;s land may be resumed at the valuation he has put upon it, plus  10  per cent. In this clause the Government go a step further, and for a similar offence propose that a man may be haled before a Court, and charged with an indictable offence. Clause  46  is introduced to protect the revenue, and it would appear that this clause is introduced to enable the Government to fine an unfortunate taxpayer  &#163;500  or send him to gaol. In clause  69,  referring to clauses  67  and  68,  it is provided that - </para>

Not satisfied with the penalty which might be imposed under clause  46  for the protection of the revenue, the Government, under this clause, propose to hale the unfortunate taxpayer before a Criminal Court, and have his land forfeited to the Commonwealth. It is honest, indeed, for the Government to put a provision of this sort in the Bill ! It is fair, indeed, to the taxpayers, and to the community at large ! </para>

                        <para>- If you had proposed no exemption at all, what would have been the position of the community in regard to such legislation? It would take a braver party than the Labour party to attempt to run it through Parliament. I cannot forbear pointing out that in clause  68  we shall find that a very similar provision is made so that there shall be no loop-hole of escape from the punitive provisions of a law which may be administered honestly or dishonestly. A nation&#39;s character can be estimated very frequently by a study of its legislation. If legislation is enacted which is unfair to however small a portion of the community, people will regard that nation as one not standing in the front rank for generosity and honesty. A section of the community, whether it be a large or a small one, is entitled to an equal measure of justice. Whether a man be rich or poor, he should stand equal with his fellowmen in the eyes of the law. Honorable senators on the other side should not try to hedge this tax round with all sorts of pains and penalties. </para>

                        <para>- It is remarkable that the courage to enact such a measure should have been reserved to this Federal Parliament under the leadership of the Labour Government. I heartily congratulate them upon their courage. I also congratulate the country and the Parliament upon having exhibited such courage. The Vice-President of the Executive Council stated that the Australian Industries Preservation Act contains a like provision in regard to a similar matter. Section  7  contains a provision in regard to unfair concessions by persons, and a man is rendered liable to a penalty of  &#163;500.  Sub-section  3  reads - </para>

                <para>How any honorable senator can rely upon that provision as a precedent for charging a man who has undervalued his land with an indictable offence, I am at a loss to know. It is probably the product of that great wisdom and courage which is supposed to exist in the breasts of the authors of this measure. Under that section, it is a question of whether what a man has done has been to the detriment of the public or constituted unfair competition. That is entirely different from an offence which renders a man liable to be sent to gaol. It certainly provides for a penalty of &#163;500, but it does not deal with the question of an indictable offence, or of putting a man in the dock, and charging him with having wickedly and falsely, and with intent to defraud, committed a particular offence. On the contrary, it deals with that which is almost a civil offence, with the case of a man who has done something which our artificial law says is either to the detriment of the public, or competition which is unfair. </para>

The other day, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> cited cases in which there was a difference of from 100 to 140 per cent, in the valuations which Government valuers had placed on land which the Crown was going to acquire, and the valuations on the other side showed almost equal disparity. I assume that the Government selected men who they believed were competent valuers, and yet they found such great differences in the valuations. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. On several occasions, I have quoted a case in Sydney in which two well-known firms valued a city property for the owner at ,&#163;6,000 and ,&#163;10,000 respectively. Under this measure, a difference of that kind would be enough to get a man into trouble. I hope that before honorable senators disgrace the Parliament and the statute-book by enacting legislation of this character, they will pause and see if they cannot adduce some argument that will reconcile it to consciences which are not absolutely seared and so hardened as to be quite impossible of being reached by any means. </para>

                        <para>- The provision applies only to -men who, in the opinion of, not the Commissioner of Land Tax or anybody else, but a jury, deliberately make an undervaluation. The honorable gentlemen on the other side are defending persons who attempt to evade taxation, who commit fraud, and are not prepared to meet their obligations to the country. They are aggrieved because there is no side-note indicating where clause 67 is taken from. I innocently said that it was taken from the Acts of the Apostles; and I am prepared to maintain that position. Honorable senators will recollect that there was a decision arrived at that all Christians were to make an inventory of their goods and chattels and send it into the church. Ananias and Sapphira made an inventory such as some of the individuals whom honorable senators are defending would attempt to make. The schedule of Ananias and Sapphira was found to be fraudulent. The Government are not so cruel to the taxpayers of Australia as to exhibit to them the mercy which was shown to Ananias and Sapphira. They were struck dead for their fraudulent conduct. I am sure the Commonwealth Government and Courts will fall far short of forfeiting the lives of persons who undervalue their properties with intent to defraud the Commonwealth, and who are prepared to do anything they possibly can to undervalue their estate for the purpose of evading taxation. That is what honorable senators opposite are standing up for. They may deny it as much as they like, but&#34; the object of these three clauses is to prevent that sort of evasion ; and they are no more drastic than the law set forth in the Acts of the Apostles. </para>

I should have thought, after the accusation lie launched against this side, that the historical characters lie would have thought fit to blot out from his memory were the two unfortunates to whom he referred. I should imagine that the honorable senator, in this particular case, would have so profited by that incident, that he would have hesitated to make the accusation which he did to try to mislead the Committee - he cannot hope to mislead himself, because he knows better - that we on this side are seeking to say a single word for those who commit a fraud. </para>

What would be said by honorable senators on the other side if, in an industrial measure prohibiting strikes, a proposal had been made to insert a provision that any strike leader was to be held guilty of fomenting and organizing a strike until be proved his innocence? </para>

                        <para>- Of course, there is not in the honorable senator&#39;s mind. He wants one law to deal with one class and another law to deal with another class. Under this clause, you hold a man whose judgment is so far astray that his value of his land varies 6y 25 per cent, from that of anybody else guilty of a certain offence until he proves his innocence. It deals with what is termed in the Bill an indictable offence. Even at the risk of being guilty of repetition, I want to remind honorable senators of some figures which I gave the other day, than which no stronger evidence can Be sought or wished for. I refer to the case in which the Lands Department of New South Wales sent out one set of its own officials to value land which it was then selling, and a few months later sent out another set of officials to value the same land when it required to re-purchase it under the Closer Settlement Act. The valuations of these two sets of officials varied from 40s. to 60s. per acre, a difference of 50 per cent&#39;. </para>

                        <para>- If they be free from bias, what can be said of the discrepancy between the valuations of the officers of the New South Wales Government, to which I have already referred ? Ought those officials to be held guilty of a criminal offence unless they can prove their innocence? If an attempt were made to introduce this principle into any Bill save this one, which has been specially marked down and designed for the persecution of land-owners, it would be universally condemned. It is all very well to say that Government valuators are free from bias, but that circumstance did not prevent the New South Wales officials from arriving at vastly different valuations. I believe that Government officials are free from conscious bias, but I entirely dispute the assertion that they are free from bias. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> knows perfectly well in connexion with Land Court work in New South Wales, it may be taken for granted that the Government officials run along the one track. It is marvellous to note the unanimity with which they deal with cases. </para>

                        <para>- There is no need to caucus on this question. If by caucus, the honorable senator refers to party conferences, nobody will dispute that every political party holds conferences between its members. The difference between the Labour caucus and that of our political party is that under our system every member of the party is free to act as he chooses. He is not pledged to follow the dictates of the majority. The Labour caucus binds the conscience and votes of the minority, whereas our caucus does not. I say that the Vice-President of the Executive Council cannot find, even in&#39; the Biblical historical incident to which reference has been made, anything to justify the theory that a man should be deemed to be guilty until he has established his innocence. </para>

But if I were looking for instruction in the Bible, I should not go to the honorable senator for it. I am quite prepared to set my utterances and attitude upon this clause in contrast with the utterances and attitude of the honorable senator for the purpose of showing who has profited most by the teachings of the Bible. The provision comes into conflict with every line of that teaching. </para>

                        <para>- I wait for my honorable friend to show me where the right of appeal is provided. To what Court can a land-owner appeal? The clause unmistakably declares that if the jury find that a land-owner has undervalued his land to the extent of  25  per cent., that circumstance shall establish his guilt, unless evidence to the contrary be forthcoming. I venture to say that if we attempted to apply the same principle to a case of petty larceny, no party would oppose the proposal more strongly than would my honorable friends opposite. Then why should they adopt, in this Bill, a different principle from that to which they would adhere so tenaciously in dealing with other offences? </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the Leader of the Opposition has seldom been so vehement in an attempt to convince himself as he has been upon the present occasion, and with such little success. If any honorable senator were convinced by his remarks, certainly it was not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> From his very repetitions it was plain that he was trying hard to convince himself that the sophistries to which he was giving utterance were really argument. What is the charge made against the Government in connexion with this clause? It is that we are taking an unparalleled course in laying upon the land-owner the onus of proving that his valuation is not one which was made with intent to defraud. It has been said that this is a new principle in legislation. But both the Leader of the Opposition and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> know that it is by no means new. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> in an endeavour to throw us off the scent, quoted a section from the Australian Industries Preservation Act. But he did not quote the right section. If he will look at section  15A  of the Act of  1906-1909,  he will find the following :  - </para>

                <para class="block">That is one case which proves that the principle which the honorable senator condemns so vehemently is not a new one in legislation. When he says that we cannot point to a similar provision in State legislation he knows perfectly well that the States possess what the Commonwealth does not, namely, a criminal code. Whenever a person is found guilty of an indictable offence against a State Land Act, the State does not need a provision in that Act to enable it to sheet home the offence, because it can have resort to its criminal code. So much for the attempt which has been made to induce the Committee to believe that there is something novel in this principle. Honorable senators also know that a somewhat similar provision to that which we are now discussing is to be found in our Customs Act. Let me come now to the attempt to make it appear that the mere proof of undervaluation of land by a land-owner to the extent of  25  per cent. will convict him of intent to defraud. That was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> argument. Anybody who urges that, is either guilty of speaking without having read the clause, or of deliberately refusing to attach to it the only meaning which can attach to it. Sub-clause  2  reads - </para>

                <para class="block">Two things have to be established before the defendant can be convicted of intent to defraud ; not merely one thing, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> tried to make out. There is not only the opinion of the jury as to the value of the land, but also the finding of the jury on the evidence before it. The jury will be composed of men who know something about the value of the land. They will have evidence laid before them on which to form an opinion of that value. The prosecutor will have to bring evidence to establish his view of the value, and the defendant will likewise bring his evidence. Moreover, the jury will know when they give their verdict that if their finding is that the value given by the defendant was  25  per cent. below the value established by the prosecutor, then, unless the defendant can bring evidence to establish his innocence of intent to defraud, their finding will be equivalent to a conviction of intent to defraud. I say that any jury knowing that will be careful to come to what they believe to be a just decision as to the value. Furthermore, the Judge has not merely to take the decision of the jury. He will have something more than that before him. He will have on the one side the evidence of the prosecutor, who will endeavour to establish a case of intent to defraud. On the other hand, he will have the evidence of the defendant, who will endeavour to establish his innocence and to Show that his valuation was <inline font-style="italic">bond fide.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> have been guilty of trying to mislead this Committee and of endeavouring by sophistical arguments to make it appear that this clause has one effect only, and that the mere fact of undervaluation will completely establish the guilt of a man who has had no opportunity of defending himself or of establishing his innocence. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, it does. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> well knows that the clear meaning of the clause is that, notwithstanding that the true value was 25 per cent, more than that represented by the defendant, nevertheless, if there is evidence that he made it <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> he will not be guilty of intent to defraud. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> denies that, he is not so intelligent as I have always given him credit for being. One has only to read the clause to see that die meaning is clear. After the inadequacy of the value has been proved, then the evidence of the absence of intent to defraud has to be declared to be inadequate before there can be a conviction ; and I say that if you establish those two things - if you first of all establish before a jury that the value is more than 25 per cent, below the real value ; and, secondly, that the valuation was not a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> one - there is no justification for defending men who have been guilty of a valuation so far below what, in the opinion of the jury of the defendant&#39;s countrymen, is a just and true one. If to defend men of that character is in accordance with what honorable senators opposite regard as the true mission of an Opposition in Parliament, I can only reply that the Government are prepared not only to stand by this clause, but to justify it on any platform in the country. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> knows perfectly well that if the evidence disclosed that there had been a greater undervaluation than 25 per cent., the Judge could not possibly keep the case from the jury. My honorable friend has asked us to believe that a jury in a case of this kind, knowing the penalty attaching to an offence, would not do their duty. In other words, he stated that a jury, knowing the penalty imposed for the undervaluation of land, would wilfully fail to do their duty, and would bring in a verdict in favour of the taxpayer. I have a better opinion of the jurymen of this country than to believe that if the evidence was clear they would not bring in a verdict in accordance with it. I refuse to believe that a jury would be influenced and swayed by the severity of the penalty to find an accused person innocent when they believed him to be guilty. </para>

                        <para>- But the clause itself says that where the value stated is less by 25 per cent, or more than the value as found by the jury, intent to defraud is to be presumed. Let us assume that a man returns his land as being worth &#163;100, and that the jury concludes that it is worth ^125. The moment that is done this follows -  the value shall be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have been understated with intent to defraud. </para>

The only amendment of this clause that I seek is to throw upon the Crown the responsibility of proving a man charged with fraud guilty of the offence, a responsibility which is accepted by the Crown in the case of every other person charged with an offence. Why should a person accused of an offence under this Bill be placed in a class apart from all. other accused persons? Why not put him in the same class as every other person against whom the Crown launches a charge, and who is entitled to an acquittal if the Crown fails to sheet home to him the charge launched against him? </para>

                        <para>- I have been saying that all the evening. The mere fact that his valuation is 25 per cent, less than the valuation of the jury, under this clause, leaves the jury and the Judge no option but to place the taxpayer in the position of having to answer a charge of fraud, and to prove his innocence. 1 do not mind his being called upon to answer a charge of fraud, but he should have to answer it as a ,person accused of any other offence would. He should be placed in the dock, the charge should be read over to him, and the Crown should accept the responsibility of sheeting home the charge. The Government are not prepared to extend to a man who owns land in this country the treatment ordinarily extended even to criminals, tie is to be put in a special class, and told, &#34; We do not undertake to prove your guilt. The obligation rests with you to prove your innocence.&#34; </para>

But I do desire to place it on record that, to the best of our ability, we on this side have made a protest against introducing into this Bill a provision which says that a man, merely because his valuation differs from that of another to the extent of 25 per cent., or more, shall be called upon to prove his innocence of a charge of intent to defraud. We protest against the establishment in this Bill of a special method of procedure for those charged with an offence under it. In the case ot other accused persons the Crown accepts the responsibility of proving their guilt ; but, under this Bill, in order to carry out their land-tax ideas, the Government propose to make a special criminal of the land-owner, and if his valuation of his property is 25 per cent, less than that put upon it by some other persons, to call upon him to prove his innocence of any intent lo defraud the revenue. </para>

                    <para>; - When, in dealing with these penal provisions, we have asked for precedents for this drastic legislation, we have been referred to the Customs Act. We have been told that the precedent for the forfeiture of land, under clause 46, is to be found in the Customs Act. But the provision in the Customs Act is absolutely opposed to this. Section 254 provides that -  (i.) In every Customs prosecution the defendant shall be competent to give evidence. </para>

                <para>That is a protection for the defendant if he wishes to avail himself of it. I ask honorable senators to mark the limitation in subsection 2 of the same clause, which reads - </para>

                <para>We are dealing in this clause with an indictable offence, and the section I have quoted from the Customs Act makes definite provision that a person charged with such an offence under that Act shall not be compelled by the Crown to give evidence. Every lawyer knows the advantage of such a provision to an accused person. In prosecutions where husband and wife are concerned neither is a compellable witness against the other. There may be <inline font-style="italic">pri.ua facie</inline> evidence that they have been together guilty of the grossest crime, but neither party can be used by the Crown to give evidence against the other. We have seen how this provision is availed of in some instances. Where- a man and a woman have been charged with an offence, and have been allowed out on bail, they have married in order to take advantage of this provision of the law. A case of the kind occurred in Melbourne. A man and a woman were charged with a diabolical offence, and the evidence produced by the police was very strong. It seemed that the man was in &#34;Queer-street,&#34; but he married the woman. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so. It is infamous to say that, because we point to a departure in this clause which denies to a land-owner privileges granted to the lowest criminal in the land, we are doing all that we can to stand by criminals in attempts to evade land taxation. That is utterly absurd. We have no sympathy with criminals, or with any person who may seek to evade the payment of land tax once this Bill becomes law. It is to the greatest discredit of the Government, and shows how hard driven honorable senators opposite must be, that they should make such a charge against us for directing attention to departures in this measure from the ordinary criminal procedure. </para>

                        <para>- I have quoted from the Customs Act, to which we were referred for a precedent to this legislation, and that reference has been blown to pieces. I have no doubt that a similar distinction might be drawn between this provision and the provision of the Australian Industries Preservation Act and the Immigration Restriction Act, to which we have been referred. Supposing a man is charged with the larceny of a pair of boots, and these facts are found : First of all, that the boots were not his own, and, second, that he took them. Suppose that the jury found those two facts, and asked the Judge, &#34;Is he guilty of larceny, because we found the two facts?&#34; The Judge would be bound, in law, to say, &#34; No, you cannot find the man guilty,&#34; and if he did not so instruct the jury, and the man was found guilty, the conviction would be quashed on appeal. In the case I put, the Judge would be bound to say to the jury, &#34; Unless you are satisfied that the prisoner intended to deprive the owner of the ownership of the boots, you cannot return a verdict of guilty.&#34; But, under this clause, the jury are to find the one fact, and intent to defraud is to be presumed. We ask the Government to follow the criminal procedure as it is laid down in a simple case of larceny. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. In the case I put, the jury have to find on three points, and if they are not satisfied on the third point the Judge is bound to instruct them that all the facts must be proved affirmatively, and the prisoner is not called upon to give evidence. Under this clause, if the value is understated by  25  per cent. or more, and the jury find that fact, the owner has to prove that there is no intent to defraud, just as in a case of larceny the Crown is called upon to prove an intent to deprive the owner of the ownership of goods. In a criminal case, the intention is the gravamen of the offence. The mere fact of a man killing another is not proof of murder, because in every case the Crown has to prove malice, and if the jury are not satisfied as to any one of three elements, the prisoner must be acquitted. But as regards intent to defraud under this clause, you transfer the onus of proof, and call upon the owner to prove the absence of such intent. The jury will not be allowed to say to the Judge, &#34; We are not satisfied that the evidence on behalf of the Crown shows an intent of malice.&#34; If in the case of the killing of a man a jury gives that finding, the Judge is bound to say, &#34; The prisoner is not called upon to prove anything. The Crown must give such evidence of intent that you can have no doubt on the subject, and, until it does so, you must discharge the man.&#34; It is at this point where honorable senators opposite differ in dealing with land-owners. They ask the jury to find one fact only, and the important element in the offence - the intent to defraud - comes in. The onus is thrown on the accused owner, and he must prove his innocence. Seeing that that is not required in the gravest case under the criminal code, why should it be required under this Bill ? We ask honorable senators to put landowners, at least, on a level with the greatest criminals in the land. That is the main reason of our objection. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know how the Crown would bring the charge, or what kind of ass it would be; but I can quite imagine the honorable senator coming innocently into possession of a bad sovereign at Flemington, and innocently trying to pass it, and being caught in the act. To my mind, he would certainly have to prove his innocence ; but the chance is that he would not be arrested unless the authorities were satisfied that there was an intent to defraud. Suppose that a man who was found in possession of 25 per cent, of bad coin appeared before a jury. I venture to say that in Victoria, where we get British justice as unpolluted as in any other part of the British Empire, he would have to prove to the satisfaction of both Judge and jury that he had the sovereigns in his possession without any intent to defraud, before he would be acquitted. Under this clause, the jury will have first to decide that the owner has really under-valued his land by 25 per cent. ; and it may not be a very easy thing to do that. I can quite understand a man who is accustomed to value land in one locality going to another locality and making a mistake. If a man has not been in possession of his land for a considerable time, but has recently purchased it, he knows its value to a farthing. But if he has been in possession for a considerable time, what better person can there be to value it than the man who knows every pennyworth of the improvements on it, and every pennyworth of the value which it possesses? I venture to say that honest land-owners will not thank the Opposition for the fight which they have been putting up, because, if there is one privilege which they will value more than another, it is the right of being trusted to value their own land. It is all very well for honorable senators opposite to arrogantly assume that they alone represent the land-owners in the Senate. I venture to say that they do nothing of the kind. They represent one section of the land-owners, and that is the section on whose behalf they are trying to create loopholes, so that they may fraudulently under-value their lands. I simply look upon honorable senators, judging them by their arguments, as part of that .section of the land-owning community who want loopholes so that they may be able to fraudulently undervalue their lands and escape scot-free. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not intend to follow the legal intricacies as&#39; to whether the undervaluer should be asked to prove his case or not; because I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has effectively replied to the arguments brought forward by the other side. I am in a difficulty with regard to the clause. It provides that any person who undervalues with intent to defraud, or understates the unimproved value, shall be guilty of an indictable offence which, as in every other case, shall be tried before a jury. lt goes on to provide that where the value stated in a return is less by 25 per cent., or more than the value as found by the jury, the value shall be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have been understated with intent to defraud. Now, when a man is guilty of an indictable offence, the degree of his guilt is not a question for the jury to decide. He is either guilty or not guilty ; and the only duty with which a jury will be charged in the case of an offence under this clause, will be the duty of stating whether the owner was guilty of understating the value of his land or not, and not as to whether he understated it by 25 per cent, or more. In my opinion, sub-clause 2 is altogether out of place. I should like an explanation from the Minister on this point; because he cannot point to a single case under our law of where a jury is charged with the duty of saying what the particular value or non-value or the particular percentage of value of the indictable offence is. In every case, the jury is charged with the duty of saying whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty. That is the only duty with which a jury will be charged under this clause.  1  want the Minister to explain how he is going to find out whether an under-estimate of value was 25 per cent, or more, seeing that no jury can possibly be charged with that duty? </para>

                        <para>- Then the honorable senator embraced a very opportune time to move it. An hour is a very long time to consider the propriety of submitting an amendment. The honorable senator waited till a supporter of the Government questioned the advisableness of including certain words in the clause before he took action. It seems to me, therefore, that he is guilty of fraudulent intent to deprive this side of the Chamber of a vote. But I wish to point out that the legislation which we are now enacting differs in many respects from all other legislation that we have placed upon the statute-book. Under this clause an undervaluation by a landowner to the extent of 25 per cent, or more must be proved before any intent to defraud can be established. If it cannot be proved that the undervaluation was made with intent to defraud, there can be no case against the land-owner. The Commissioner has first to prove that there has been an undervaluation to the extent of 25 per cent, or more, and the onus is then thrown upon the taxpayer to establish the fact that that undervaluation was not made with intent to defraud. If an undervaluation of 30 per cent, were made by a land-owner, in the absence of intent to defraud, he would not be adjudged to be guilty. </para>

                        <para>- The jury have to be satisfied first that there has been an undervaluation to the extent of 25 per cent, or more, and secondly, that that undervaluation was made with intent to defraud. If a person were accused of stealing a pair of boots, it would only be necessary to prove that he had stolen them to secure his conviction. Similarly, if a man were accused of killing another, the fact that he had killed him would of itself be sufficient to prove his guilt. It would not be necessary to prove that he had killed him with intent to cremate him. The clause is perfectly clear as it stands, and I hope that it will be carried. </para>

                    <para>.- Ministers have charged honorable senators upon this side of the Chamber with a desire to stand up for those who wish to defraud the revenue. They must be utterly destitute of argument when they make such a charge. They know perfectly well that no member of the Opposition would dream for a moment of defending fraud. I am no apologist or defender of , any person who attempts to defraud the revenue) but I object to this clause, because I believe that under it there is very grave danger that innocent persons will be placed in the dock and subjected to severe penalties. The powers conferred upon the Commissioner under the Bill will be enormous  -  so enormous that any conscientious man may well be pardoned for hesitating to undertake the duties imposed upon that officer. The clause says that any land-owner who undervalues his land with intent to defraud shall be liable to exceedingly heavy penalties. Who can determine whether there was any such intent save the land-owner himself? Instances have been cited in which there has been an honest difference between the valuations made by competent valuers of too per cent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has stated that the land-owner himself is the best judge of the value of his land. I utterly deny that. I know of men who have sold land for 50 per cent, less than its value because they did not know any better. This is a very peculiar Bill. If a definition had been given to the term &#34; improvements,&#34; the position would have been much clearer. But as the measure stands, we do not know whether ring-barking, grubbing, or draining will be regarded as improvements. Under the clause an innocent man may be haled before the Court, and placed in the dock as a criminal merely because he has endeavoured to comply with the provisions of the Bill. The penalty imposed is a very severe one for what may be an innocent offence. A land-owner can only follow his judgment, and we cannot tell whether or not in his heart he is endeavouring to defraud the revenue. Further, the clause contemplates the forfeiture of land if its owner should undervalue it to the extent of 25 per cent, or more. Thus, not only the land-owner may suffer, but also his wife and children. For an offence which may not have been intended, they may be deprived of a home. That is the iniquity of the clause. </para>

Personally, I cannot understand how any Government can introduce legislation of this description. Some method should be devised bv which we can detect an offender, and punish fraud without resort to such a provision as this, which may sweep into the net innocent persons who may not only find themselves in gaol, but absolutely deprived of their land. However, I recognise that it is idle to argue with honorable senators opposite, and, therefore, I shall content myself with entering my protest against legislation of this description, which I am sure will not tend to elevate the public opinion of this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I assume that those who are responsible for the drafting of the Bill have considered all these matters. Therefore, I do not attempt to judge of the legal phraseology of the clause. But, speaking as to its effect, it appears to me that what the Opposition are demanding will practically be effected by the working of the clause. I do not think that a great number of land-owners will be haled before the Court on a criminal charge. But I do believe the clause will act as a valuable deterrent against undervaluation. It is not class vindictiveness, as alleged by honorable senators opposite, which actuates me to say that in regard to land there is a considerable temptation to undervaluation and fraudulent practices. That is no charge against the majority of land-owners. The statement that some land-owners may be guilty of fraud no more casts an imputation on the great body of them than the statement that some persons steal implies that every one is a potential thief. The clause will tend to prevent fraud, and will restrict inclinations in that direction. Its practical operation will be as follows : A land-owner will be suspected by the Commissioner of considerably undervaluing his land. After making due inquiries, the Commissioner will find that there is a very good case against the suspected individual. He will proceed to put the law in motion. A jury will have to be impanelled, and will necessarily consider ali the evidence that can be adduced b&#34; the Commissioner and by the landowner. The question as to how the valuations have been arrived at will be prominently brought before the jury. That is the crucial factor in the whole matter. The question that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has covered up with a cloud of verbiage, as to persons being compelled to give evidence, does not affect this clause at all. A landowner will say. &#34; I engaged so-and-so to make this valuation, believing him to be a reliable man.&#34; The means followed for arriving at the valuation will be explained to the jury, which will look into the facts in a calm, rational, and business-like way. In that way the clause will operate as a valuable deterrent, checking those who might otherwise be careless or neglectful of their duty in furnishing valuations. There has. been a great deal of carelessness in the past in connexion with State and municipal Valuations. The desire to avoid trouble will induce some land-owners to err on the right side - that is, in favour of the Commonwealth - rather than submit themselves to possible expense and indignity by making a wrong valuation. </para>

                        <para>- It is not blackmail. The hostility of honorable senators opposite to this proposed legislation is inducing them to leave possible loop-holes for individuals who may wish to commit fraud. It has been argued that under British law a man is not deemed to be guilty unless he has been proved to be so. But, in the event of a person being found with goods in his possession that do not belong to him, and which are suspected of being stolen, the person would be <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> liable to be charged with being in possession of stolen property, and would have to prove his innocence. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has humorously illustrated the case of a person found unlawfully in possession of goods, and being required to prove that he came by them honestly. This Bill imposes no penalty upon an honest man. The safeguard for an honest man is the jury, and if the Commissioner cannot make out a good case to the satisfaction of the jury, the charge will fall to the ground. </para>

                    <para>. - I see no reason why honorable senators opposite should allege that this clause indicates a cruel tendency on the part of the Government. Most of us have noticed an unfortunate tendency on the part of a number of people, who are perfectly honest when dealing with individuals, to act upon quite other principles when they have to pay a tax levied by a Government. I believe that this clause is sufficiently drastic to shut down on any attempts of that kind. The remedy proposed is very simple. Where fraud is alleged, a case has to be made out to the satisfaction of the jury. Surely even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> cannot maintain that a person is likely to be found guilty of fraudulent practices by a jury of his countrymen unless the evidence of his guilt is clear. It is unthinkable that under this clause an innocent person can be found guilty of fraud. First, a jury has to be satisfied of undervaluation to the extent of 25 per cent, or more; and, secondly, that the undervaluation has been made with a view to defrauding the revenue. I cannot see how any hardship is placed upon landowners by reason of the provision. It is alleged by the Opposition that the principle of the clause is bad, because it calls upon the accused to prove his innocence. In the first place, however, a case has to be made out to the satisfaction of the jury; and. in the next place, the accused has ample opportunities of giving evidence on his own behalf. I may point out for the benefit of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger that section 211 of the Queensland Mines Act provides that - </para>

                <para class="block">So that when an accident happens in a Queensland mine the law presumes guilt on the part of the owner or manager unless he can prove his innocence. Consequently, there is nothing novel in this clause. Nor does it go quite so far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger alleges. In the interests of protecting the revenue against fraud, a drastic provision of the kind is required, and I think that the clause is admirably adapted for the purpose in view. </para>

                    (Western Australia &#91;10.28&#93;. - It appears to me that honorable senators opposite have overlooked the controlling words of the clause. They are these - &#34; with intent to defraud.&#34; I contend that any person owning land who purposely makes an undervaluation with intent to defraud the revenue ought to be held guilty of an indictable offence.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline>
                    has tried to make out that a person who unconsciously made a false return would be penalized and haled before  a  Judge and jury. But the undervaluation must have been made with intent to defraud before that can be done.

I do not wish to mention the name of a gentleman who undervalued his estate, and was penalized by a fine. This clause gives every taxpayer liable to taxation under this Bill all the ordinary privileges afforded to citizens by British law and justice. There is no intention here to penalize any honest citizen called upon to give a return of the unimproved value of his estate, but if any taxpayer returns an undervaluation with intent to defraud he will be haled before a Judge and jury of his peers. There is nothing novel or unjust about that. </para>

                    <para>. - I am in hearty accord with the intention of this clause, but I do not approve of its construction. I hope the Government <inline font-style="italic">will not</inline> take up the attitude that the Bill as introduced must necessarily be perfect. The whole of our experience in legislation proves that Bills as introduced are ordinarily very imperfect. Three-fourths of the time of Parliament is taken up in remedying the defects cf previous legislation. That being so, it will hardly be contended that the construction of this Bill is absolutely beyond cavil. In this clause the Government are striving to do something which they will be unable to do as the clause is drafted. They wish to make the undervaluation of land an indictable offence. They propose that the taxpayer shall be called upon to prove his innocence of an intent to defraud if he has undervalued his estate to the extent of 25 per cent, or more. If he has so far undervalued his estate the presumption under this clause is that he is guilty of an intent to defraud. The difficulty is that the Government are presuming something after the case is closed, and the taxpayer is given no chance of refuting the charge made against him. There are very many cases in English law in which the onus of proof is thrown on the defendant, but it is thrown on him at the beginning of the case, and he is given an opportunity to prove his innocence. Under this clause a certain- thing is presumed after the jury have found it, and the taxpayer is given no chance at all. </para>

                        <para>- I have no objection to that. The taxpayer is guilty or rot guilty of an indictable offence, but under this clause we place upon the jury a further duty. We ask the jury, after til the evidence is closed, to decide whether the taxpayer has undervalued his estate. If they decide that he has done so he is presumed to be guilty of an intent to defraud. I&#39; say that if we are going to presume an intent to defraud on the part of a taxpayer we should do so at the beginning, and not at the end of the &#60; ase. </para>

                        <para>- A man is not presumed to be guilty merely because he is charged with an offence. Under the British law, with some important exceptions, a man is presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty. The honorable senator&#39;s statement is unadulterated bunkum, because it means that all that is necessary in order to presume that a man is guilty is to arrest him and charge him with an offence. Some of the most innocent of men have been arrested and charged with offences. Even in cases where the onus of proof is thrown on the accused person, he is not presumed to be guilty. A man is not presumed- </para>

We shall then deal with the report of the Committee on the Land Tax Assessment Bill. We propose to recommit the Bill, in order to make two small amendments, and then to pass the measure through its remaining stages. After that the Senate will be invited to consider the Naval Defence Bill and the measures to provide for amendments of the Constitution, in the order in which they&#39; appear on the business-paper, as well as the Navigation Bill, </para>
