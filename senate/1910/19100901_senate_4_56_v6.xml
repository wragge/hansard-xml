                <para class="block">Honorable senators will be aware .that there are some important measures on the notice-paper which it is desirable that we should dispose of as early as possible. An earnest wish has been expressed from many quarters that the Navigation Bill should be proceeded with expeditiously, so that it may be passed by both branches of the Legislature this session. In view of the fact that there are 419 clauses in that Bill, it is obvious that we shall require ample time for its consideration. The Australian Notes Bill may also be expected to occupy a fair amount of time. If our work is to be disposed of in an expeditious manner, it is necessary to bring honorable senators from their homes four days in the week instead of three. Every consideration, however, will be given to them, and, of course, the Government will do whatever is within their power to suit the convenience of the majority. But it is considered that in view of the voluminous mass of business that has to be done, we should make the most of the time available. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) [2.37].- The Vice-President of the Executive Council was quite right in saying that the Opposition desire to see the business of the Senate proceeded with speedily. Neither in the Senate, nor in another place, has there been any evidence of a desire not to get through the work that has been laid before Parliament.

                        <para>- Yes; I will come to that point presently. There is no desire on the part of the Opposition to obstruct or delay unnecessarily the transaction of public business. It has, however, been generally recognised that as there are only thirty-six members of the Senate and twice as many members of another place we ought not to be expected to devote so much time to our work as the House of Representatives has to do. </para>

                        <para>- The most debatable measures initiated by the Government come before the other Chamber in the first instance. They are there debated thoroughly, and at considerable length. When they reach the Senate the ground has been to a large extent worked over, and often provisions that have been regarded as objectionable have been altered. Consequently a lesser amount of work is involved in dealing with them here. </para>

                            GOULD. - Necessarily the rough work takes a good deal longer to do than does the polishing. A considerable amount of time is required to rub off the rough edges of projects submitted by the Government. It is true that another place is now sitting three mornings per week, and that practically places at the disposal of the Government six hours of extra time. I do not dispute that the Government require more time from the members of the Senate. But I put it whether that necessary time could not be obtained by honorable senators continuing to sit on Friday nights and taking advantage of the Saturday trains to go to their homes in other States. By that means we should not be required to attend on Tuesdays. In other words, we should sit on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, and Friday nights, instead of on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays. This method would not, so far as I can judge, occasion the slightest degree of inconvenience. Those who at present leave Melbourne on Friday afternoon reach Sydney or Adelaide on Saturday morning. Practically Saturday is of no value to them so far as the transaction of their private business is concerned.

                        <para>- The plan that I recommend would give honorable senators an opportunity of going fresh to their work on Monday morning. At present those who have business to transact have an opportunity of doing it on Mondays and Tuesdays, leaving for Melbourne again on Tuesday afternoon. I am quite sure that if this plan were tried, and the Government still found that the time at their disposal was not sufficient, honorable senators would be quite willing to give them a morning sitting on Saturdays. The Government would really be obtaining more time than they will under their own proposal; whilst they would also be affording a great convenience to many who reside in adjoining States. Those who reside in Melbourne, of course, do not feel the inconvenience. It is immaterial to them whether the Senate sits on Tuesdays or on Friday nights. But it is of immense advantage to those who can reach their homes" at a week end to be afforded an opportunity of transacting private business while they are there. I can understand the desire of the Government to get through their parliamentary work as quickly as possible, but it is rather early in the session to have such a motion submitted. I am sure that honorable senators are pleased to know that the Commonwealth of Australia will be represented at the important celebration which is to take place in South Africa in the month of November, by the Prime Minister of this country. </para>

                        <para>- What I intended to suggest was that the visit of the Prime Minister to South Africa should not be regarded as a sufficient reason for sending the members of this Parliament into recess before the work of the session had been completed in the usual way. We should be told why the Senate is asked to sit four days in the week, whilst the House of Representatives, with a very much larger membership, sits only four days, and has two additional morning sittings. I recognise the desire of the Government to expedite their business, but I should like to know whether they wish to close the session as soon as the Prime Minister leaves the country for South Africa. </para>

                        <para>- Then why are we asked to take this course so early in the session? On the business-paper to-day, there is one third reading, two second readings, and the consideration of a private Bill in Committee set down for the evening. For tomorrow, the only other business on the paper is the Navigation Bill. I recognise that that is a very important measure, and that it will take a considerable time to deal with it. What have we to look forward <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> in the way of additional business at an early date? We shall have to deal with the Land Tax Bill, and perhaps one or two other measures. Then, I suppose that when the Treasurer makes his financial statement, the Senate will be given an opportunity similar to that provided last session of debating the finances of the Commonwealth . But I still think it strange that we should be asked to undertake additional work so early in the session. If the Government think that we should have additional sittings, I suggest that we should continue the Friday sitting into the evening, and, if necessary, sit on Saturday morning. I should have no objection, if the Government believed it to be absolutely necessary, to sit on Thursday mornings as well. The suggestion I have made would convenience a large number of the members of the Senate who come here from the adjoining States, and would tend to make their duties less onerous than they would otherwise be. lt is not unreasonable that we should ask the Government and those supporting them to facilitate the convenience of honorable senators who have no desire whatever to shirk their responsibilities or their work in this Chamber. </para>

                    <para> - I should like to ask the representatives of the Government in the Senate -whether they think it is imperative at this stage of the session to pass this motion. On the subject of consulting the convenience of honorable senators, I may say that I have always met with the greatest courtesy from representatives of the Government in this Chamber, in the arrangement of the business. During this session, the work of the Senate has been proceeded with in a record way. That has been commented upon outside, and the Government are entitled to the credit of it. On this side, we may entertain a different view of the business which the Government have considered important, but the way in which it has been pushed on says a great deal for the zeal and energy of the representatives of the Government in this Chamber. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has really given no reason why we should pass this motion at the present stage of the session. No one will dispute for a moment that it will be for the benefit of the Commonwealth to be represented at the South African celebration by the foremost Minister in this country. Apart from that, those of us who have been members of Governments know quite well that it is for the Government of the day to define the time they require and the business they propose to submit in that time. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has referred us to the Navigation Bill, trie adjourned debate on the second reading of which is down for to-morrow. It is, of -course, a very important measure, but many of us entertain a doubt as to whether it will reach the statute-book this session. I say that as one who desires to see a Commonwealth Navigation Act upon the statute-book. But, although measures in some respects identical with that now before the Senate have been debated here in previous sessions, no great harm will follow  if its passage is somewhat further delayed. Although it contains 419 clauses, the bulk of them are likely to be passed as matters of course, and there are very few that will require lengthened debate.</para>

                        <para>- I believe that is so. I know that the  Speaker,  as  Chairman  of the Library Committee, called the members of that Committee together at half-past nine o'clock this morning. It seemed like getting up in the middle of the night, but we had to be here, and members of the House of Representatives, after their duties on the Committee were over, went to their own Chamber. There is no reason why members of the Senate should not do the same. It has been suggested also that it would convenience some honorable senators if the Senate sat on Friday evening and on Saturday morning. That" would necessitate honorable senators living in the adjoining States going home on the Sunday. I can see no objection, but we might add a proviso that any honorable senator having a conscientious objection to going home on the Sunday might remain here until the Monday. I like to have these conscience clauses. We have agreed to one in the Defence Bill, and there is no reason why we should not attach one to a motion providing for additional sittings. I think that the Government might wait for a few weeks until we see how the business progresses before submitting such a motion, and, if they cannot do so, they might agree to modify the motion in the way I have proposed. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know what my honorable friend is " yapping " about. My opinion is that the Government wish to meet the convenience of honorable senators, but he seems to object to that statement. However, I think it is a fair statement to make. I ask the Ministry to recollect that, during the parliamentary session, there are a large number of honorable senators who reside in and around Melbourne, and to whom it is a matter of small importance whether the Senate meets on an additional day early or late in the week. Those honorable senators whose convenience ought to be consulted are the representatives of South Australia, New South Wales, and Tasmania. Before the debate closes we ought to have a statement from the Government as to whether they are prepared to adopt the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> or the amendment outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould.</inline> I ask them whether it would not be better for the Senate to sit the additional hours required for the transaction of public business, either late in the week or in the middle of the week, rather than at its beginning. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Government will not yield to the persuasive eloquence of Senators Gould and Symon by consenting to an  alteration of the motion which is now under consideration. The Ministry have a programme of work to get through, and if that work is to be accomplished without any factious opposition, we shall require to sit on Tuesday as well as on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday in each week, until the end of November. I submit that it is far better for us to meet upon an extra day each week, with a view to terminating the session by the end of November or the beginning of December, .than it is to sit long hours, and occasionally all night, till nearly the end of the year, so that some honorable senators will scarcely have time to reach their homes before Christmas. I hope that the Government will adhere to the motion in its present form, and thus afford honorable senators ample time to consider the important measures with which we have to deal this session. </para>

                        <para>- The adoption of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould's</inline> proposal would afford more time for the transaction of the business which tile Government intend to bring forward than will the motion which is now under consideration, lt would also enable those honorable senators who are accustomed to return home each week-end to have the whole of Monday, and a portion of Tuesday, to devote to other business before they would be required to leave their respective States for Melbourne. That would be a great advantage to them, and I contend that their convenience ought to be considered. I have no objection to sitting as long as may be necessary for the transaction of public business, but I think that the convenience of honorable senators ought to be studied as far as possible. When we rise on Friday afternoon - as is our present custom - honorable senators who usually return to their own States at the week-end reach home on Saturday too late for the day to be of any use to them from a business stand-point, and they have to leave again on Monday afternoon ; whereas, if the Senate meet on Wednesday morning, and also on Saturday morning, they would have a clear day to themselves. I do not know that it is necessary to make any alteration in our sitting days at present, but if it is, I am prepared to do what I have suggested. So far the Senate has devoted a great deal of attention to the transaction of the public business, and the work which has already been performed constitutes a record. Therefore, there is no reason why the remaining business should not be got through expeditiously. Personally, I would rather sit on Saturday mornings, and have Monday to myself, than accept the proposal of the Government. </para>

                    <para>.- To my mind, there is a serious objection to the Senate meeting on Saturday morning in each week. Honorable senators who have suggested the adoption of that course have not, perhaps, considered thai there is a large number of parliamentary officials who, if we meet on Saturday morning, will be required to work during the greater portion of that day. We all know that Saturday afternoon is generally recognised as a half-holiday for officials in all Government offices. In addition, we should be faced with this anomaly : that the Senate would be sitting on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, whilst the other Chamber would be meeting on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Personally, I think it is preferable that the two branches of the Legislature should meet on the same days if that course be possible. At the same time, the Government are in charge of the business of this Chamber. They know exactly what measures they intend to bring forward during the current session, and they ought to be the best judges as to how long a period will be occupied in disposing of those measures. I would remind honorable senators who object to the Senate meeting on the extra day proposed that we are already half way through the session. We have been sitting for two months, and the general impression is that the session will not extend beyond the end of November. Some honorable senators appear to be very particular about the time they spend in this Chamber, but are, apparently, forgetful of the fact that members in another place cheerfully give up four days a week to the discharge of their parliamentary duties. I do not think there is very much weight in the contention that the convenience of certain honorable senators ought to be consulted. We are elected to devote the whole of our time to the public business. </para>

                        <para>- I have never suggested that we should do so, if it be necessary to continue the session till the end of the year. But the general impression is that the session will terminate about the end of November. The Government say that, to enable them to close it then will necessitate the Senate meeting upon an extra day. I submit that honorable senators who have put in earnest pleas that their convenience should be studied, ought to study the interests of the general public. If we do not sit upon the additional day proposed by the Government, the session will probably be prolonged by two or three weeks. </para>

                        <para>- There are eighteen honorable senators who reside in Melbourne, and eighteen who, at the week end, are accustomed to return to their homes in the several States. Surely if it makes no difference to the eighteen senators who are always here, and a great difference to the other eighteen, it is not unreasonable to ask the former te consider the latter. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I disagree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe's</inline> statement in regard to the convenience of using Tuesday rather than Saturday for a sitting day. I hope that honorable senators will acquit me of taking a personal or selfish view. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> knows as well as I do that at present it is only possible for Tasmanian senators to leave Melbourne on Saturday. The Senate sits on Friday until 4 o'clock, and then we have to waste twenty-four hours in Melbourne before we can leave by Saturday's boat. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot get home in time to return by taking a boat on Saturday this week. I ask honorable* senators to support any proposition to sit on Saturday morning. I regret to say that some Victorian senators have, in the past, been the strongest opponents to sitting on Saturday. Without realizing the fact that they have not been put to the smallest degree of inconvenience, they have not met the convenience of senators from other States. The position may be totally different now, but those who represent Victoria should realize that the senators from other States are entitled to have their convenience consulted. The best plan is to consult the convenience of the majority, and so order the sittings that honorable senators can discharge their public duties, and at the same time attend to their home responsibilities. At present, we cannot get over to Melbourne from Tasmania until Wednesday morning, and so Tuesday is cut out. We have to cool our heels in Melbourne from Friday afternoon' until Saturday afternoon, because there is no boat to return by. As one who has not missed a sitting during this session, and has returned to his home practically every week, I regret to see that the Government do not realize their duty to honorable senators. I trust that they will consult the convenience of the general body. Of course, I can quite understand that a Minister with considerable administrative work to do, and who necessarily must remain here, may, for a moment, overlook the fact that other senators want to get home occasionally, if not weekly. I hope that the Government will see their way to accept the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould.</inline></para>

                    <para>.  - If the Government wanted the Senate to sit six days a week, I should be inclined to support them, because our first duty is to consider the business of the country regardless <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> our own convenience. Some honorable senators live so far away from Melbourne that they cannot get away until the session is finished, and therefore it is an advantage to them to get the business done as soon as possible. That is the position in which I am, and for that reason I cordially support any proposal by the Government for an extra sitting ; but at the same time the convenience of honorable senators ought to be consulted as much as possible, and no one should be asked to suffer an inconvenience in order to convenience another. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has to cool his heels in Melbourne from Friday  afternoon until Saturday afternoon, then those who could get away equally easily on Saturday should have some consideration for those who are situated as he is. If we can gain as much time in that way as in another, I do not see any reason why the Government should not accept what appears to me to be a reasonable request. At present, we only sit on Friday from 10.30 a.m. to 4 p.m. We could get a considerable addition to our time, equivalent to almost a day's sitting, by continuing the sitting until 10.30 p.m., and we could have a morning sitting on Saturday. That arrangement would give the Government quite as much time as they will get under their own proposal. If it would meet the convenience of everybody, why should it not be adopted? Some honorable senators say that they wish to get away on Friday, but why should they take a selfish view when they deprive honorable senators of a day which they might reasonably spend at home? I suggest that that reasonable view be taken so that other honorable senators mav have their convenience studied. </para>

                    <para>. - It is true that the Government Whip asked me which day would suit me best as an additional sitting day. I said that at present it did not make much difference to me, as I have to reside in Melbourne for the whole of the session. Previously my position has been different. If the Senate were to meet on Thursday at 10.30 a.m., and sit on Friday from 10.30 a.m. to 10.30 p.m., it" would give the Government ten additional hours a week. That, I think, ought to suit the convenience of all sections of the Senate, lt would not be necessary then to sit on Saturday morning. The Government would obtain more than an ordinary working day without inconveniencing any one.  1  know that a Tuesday sitting will be very inconvenient to Tasmanian senators. If they go home at the week end they must miss that sitting, because they cannot return until Wednesday morning. I am willing to meet the convenience of all parties. I should be quite willing to sit on Thursdays at half-past 10 o'clock in the morning, and also on Friday nights and Saturday mornings. The Government would thus obtain many additional hours for the transaction of business. None of us who come from Queensland can get home at the week-end. Neither can the Western Australian senators. But those who come from the other States can. We should consider the convenience of honorable senators who, by a reasonable arrangement of our business, can be enabled to return to their homes each week-end. I am anxious to see the work of the session concluded as speedily as possible, because I wish to visit Queensland; but I think that the Government can obtain all the time that they require, and still meet the convenience of the majority. </para>

I mentioned the subject in the Senate at the beginning of last week, and the Government Whip went round asking all honorable senators whom he could find what their views were, with the result that it was ascertained that the overwhelming majority were in favour of a Tuesday sitting. </para>

                        <para>- I do not agree with' that view. Consideration should also be extended to those who desire to visit other States at the week-ends, but they, I admit, are not the only honorable senators who should be consulted. It is also somewhat singular that this  sudden protest should have been raised to-day. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> who has so vehemently protested, was a member of a Government that secured Tuesday sittings, and never suggested that the Senate should sit late on Fridays or on Saturday mornings. Last session, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> brought forward a motion securing Tuesday for the consideration of Government business, the question was put, and passed without debate. </para>

                        <para>- But the honorable senator was not a Minister last session, and he raised no protest then. There has been no alteration in the running of trains or steamers. Why, then, this sudden protest ? The attitude assumed has been unfair to the Government, and the fact that honorable senators were carefully consulted has been left out of consideration. The Government Whip, after making inquiries, informed me that the overwhelming majority were in favour of Tuesday sittings. Look at the converse proposition. Are we to say that the wishes of the minority are to be consulted, and not those of the majority? Ascertaining what the opinion of the majority was, there was no other course open to us than that which we have taken. I begin to think that there is some motive behind these loud protests. </para>

                    <para>. - It is quite true that the Government, through the Minister of Defence, gave notice some time ago that action of this kind was to be taken. It is equally true that the Government Whip consulted various members of the Opposition. He very courteously asked my view. I think I said that, so far as I was personally concerned, if I had to choose between being hanged on Tuesday and shot on Friday, I should prefer the Tuesday operation. Of course, I was speaking metaphorically. But the preference of honorable senators has now been publicly expressed. It has been explained that the method proposed by the Government will inconvenience many. What is the alternative? It is not that we should refuse to give the Government all the time required for the business of the country. I- understand that every honorable senator is in accord with their desire that more time should be taken. It is simply a matter of what is the best time to take. But the Government ought to consider the clearly expressed wishes of the members of the Opposition. It might expedite business if the request preferred by the Opposition were more courteously attended to. It is unfair- to suggest that we do not wish to grant the extra time because we support those who wish to have a little more time for attending to their private business. In order that the view of the Senate may be clearly, ascertained, I now move, by way of amendment - </para>

We ought to consult the convenience of honorable senators who have to travel every week-end. Those who reside in Melbourne can attend at any time. 1 hope that the Government will recognise that those who are entitled to chief consideration are the senators who, to the detriment of their health, travel backwards and forwards every week-end. </para>

                        <para>- I ask whether it is not high time that members of the Senate should be allowed to speak, if they desire to do so, without being subjected to impertinent interruptions, insinuating that they are not honest in what they are proposing. It is most insulting to an honorable senator who is honestly endeavouring to persuade his fellow senators to adopt a course which he thinks right that he should be met with such expressions as " win, tie, or wrangle." Every member of the Senate has a right to express his opinion. If honorable senators opposite were on this side, they would insist upon their right to speak so long as they did so in an orderly manner, and Ministers need not imagine that because they have a big majority behind them they can bully and brow-beat honorable senators on this side. I think it right to point out that ten out of, perhaps, a dozen honorable senators who have spoken on the motion have expressed the opinion that it would only be fair for the Government to consult the convenience of those who come here from adjoining States. Honorable senators are aware that the Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> has onerous and important duties to discharge, and it is but right that his convenience should be considered in a matter of this kind. </para>

                        <para>- It may be that one or two honorable senators would prefer to address meetings of electors or political gatherings on the Saturday afternoon, instead of attending to their duties here; but it is not too much to ask that they should consider the convenience of other honorable senators as well as their own. I know I am speaking for the Leader of the Opposition when I say that he would like to have an opportunity of having the Monday and Tuesday to himself in Sydney. Although he does not occupy the position of a Minister of the Crown, his duties are perhaps more arduous, because he must make himself acquainted with the various measures submitted from time to time by the Government. I think the Government may reasonably be asked to give favorable consideration to the amendment, and to accede to the wishes expressed by honorable senators who take a prominent part in debates in the Senate. </para>

                    <para>. - I should not have risen to speak to the amendment did I not wish to make a personal explanation. When speaking just now, I came into conflict with some of my fellow senators from Tasmania as to the sailing dates of the boats plying between Tasmania and the mainland. I have since consulted the shipping company's advertisement, and I find that I was absolutely correct in my contention - that Tasmanian senators must lose one day, whether the Senate sits on Tuesday or on Saturday. The Tasmanian boats are advertised to leave Melbourne on Friday, at 4 o'clock. </para>

                        <para>- But they submitted the motion at the close of the session - I believe in November. An ordinary sitting of the Senate lasts for eight hours, and the suggestion we make, if adopted, would give the Government ten hours additional in which to transact their business, -md would suit the convenience of honorable senators generally. The Government are strong and can carry their measures, but harshness to the Opposition is not calculated to expedite the business of the Senate. </para>

                    CAMERON (Tasmania) [3.56]. - I do not like to obtrude my personal affairs on the Senate. I can quite understand the desire of honorable senators who live so far from the Seat of Government that they must reside permanently in Melbourne during the session, to have as long a time as they can get before Sunday for purposes of relaxation. If I were living in Melbourne I should probably like to adopt the same course. I wish to refer to the matter as it affects myself. The steamer by which I arrive in Melbourne from Tasmania leaves Launceston on the Tuesday. That enables me to get here on the Wednesday.

It is a great convenience to every Tasmanian senator, no matter in what part of the island he may reside. But if the Senate sits on the Tuesday I cannot possibly be here on that day, because I have no hesitation in saying, and make no "bones" about it at all, that I have other things to attend to besides public affairs. I have my private business to attend to, and I should be unable to attend to it if I had to be here on the Tuesday. </para>

We are not here to fight one another  -  to make this Chamber a bear garden - but to expedite the transaction of public business, and to treat each other as kindly and civilly as we can. With these few remarks, I am content to leave the decision of this matter to the Senate. After all, it is merely a question of kindliness one to another. </para>

                    <para>.- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> has very truly remarked, we are here to expedite the transaction of public business. I understand that the Government have control of that business, and that, with a view to ascertaining upon which day an additional sitting would best suit the convenience of honorable senators the Government Whip canvassed their opinions. A majority expressed a decided preference for the Senate meeting on Tuesday in each week. Yet we now find that a minority wishes to overrule the majority, to take (lie ' business out of the hands of the Government, and to dictate to them the extra day upon which we shall meet. Because honorable senators upon this side of the Chamber do not speak upon every question which claims our attention, it has been said that we have nothing to say upon those questions. That is not so. We consider that it is sometimes necessary to remain silent, in order to expedite the transaction of public business. The Government, having consulted the wishes of a majority of honorable senators, what more can be done? </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that it is quite fair that honorable senators should drag up - as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker</inline> did - matters which have been discussed amongst the party to which they belong. There may be a minority of honorable senators opposite who think with us upon this question, and we have a perfect right to press the proposal of the Government to a division, and thus afford those honorable senators an opportunity of voting with us. After all, the matter fs one of the personal convenience of honorable senators, and upon any future occasion of this sort, I do not think we  should have the fact trotted out that the Government Whip has been round endeavouring to ascertain the opinions of members of the Opposition. I am not prepared to say what the Government Whip has done, or what the result of his canvass has been. But, .if fifteen honorable senators opposite are of one opinion, and eight are of a different opinion, I am prepared to think that the eight will vote whichever way they may think fit. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> was approached by the Government Whip upon this question, but I say that a majority of the Opposition were not consulted in the ordinary formal fashion. We are not endeavouring to take the business out of the hands of the Government, as has been alleged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker.</inline> We merely say that, ' instead of the Senate sitting a certain number of additional hours at the beginning of the week, it should sit for those additional hours at the end of the week. </para>

                    <para>. - But for the fact that an absolutely incorrect statement has been  made - and I should use a stronger term if the forms of the Senate permitted me to do so - I should not occupy any time in discussing this proposal. I am sure that the Government have treated the Opposition as fairly as any Opposition could have been treated. Certainly, it has been treated quite differently from the way in which its members treated the members of our party when they were in power. Upon that occasion they altered the sittings of the Senate at their own sweet will, without consulting anybody. Last week, when the Minister of Defence asked me to ascertain the wishes of honorable senators in regard to the Senate sitting for additional hours, I went round and consulted all those who were in the parliamentary buildings at the time. </para>

When the views of honorable senators had been ascertained, I informed the Minister that an overwhelming majority was in favour of the Tuesday sitting in preference to an extension of our sitting on any other day. Then, why has all the afternoon been occupied in debating a question which had been previously settled, and settled not upon party lines? Some honorable senators who expressed a preference for Tuesday sittings, have, to-day, gone back upon that preference. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> has said that the Opposition were not acquainted by the Government Whip with what had been done. I say that that statement is absolutely incorrect. </para>

                    <para>. - The time which has been occupied in debating a small matter of this kind evidences the necessity which exists for lengthening the sittings of the Senate. As has been already indicated, everything possible was done by the Government to ascertain the opinions of honorable senators before the proposal now under consideration was formulated- That is conclusive testimony that the Government desired to study the convenience of honorable senators. I have been a member of this Chamber for nearly ten years, and, upon every previous occasion that a motion of this kind has been submitted, it has been agreed to almost unanimously. </para>

                        <para>- How does the honorable senator know that we are not near the end of the session now? The Government came to the conclusion a short time ago that it would be better for the two branches of the Legislature to sit longer hours in the day time than to have recourse to all-night sittings. I am very much obliged to Senators Gould, Symon, Keating, and St. Ledger for the valuable suggestions which they have made to the Ministry. In the proposal which is now before us, the Government seek to give effect to the wishes of a majority of the Senate. But, should business become congested and the necessity arise for all-night sittings, the honorable senators whom I have mentioned have themselves suggested a remedy - a remedy which we should not hesitate to adopt. Should occasion arise for it, the Government will not hesitate to take <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> at his word, and to propose that the Senate shall sit on Friday evenings, and meet also on Saturday mornings at half-past 10 o'clock. We shall do everything that we can to meet the convenience of those honorable senators. No Government can do more than that. In the proposal which is now under consideration we seek to give effect to the express wish of a majority of honorable senators, and, in the future, we shall, if necessary, study the wishes of the professed friends of the Government upon the opposite side of the Chamber. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not desire to delay 'the measure, but wish to mention a matter which, I hope, the Minister of Defence will reconsider. In the pre- Federal days a uniform was found to be a powerful incentive to boys, especially to those between twelve and fourteen years of age, to join a cadet corps, take marches, attend parades, and begin that physical training which is so necessary for taking up military training at a comparatively early age afterwards. I think that I am historically correct in saying that the cadet movement may be said to have originated in Queensland. It was attended with remarkable success so far as it went, and was expected to lead to great things. It was only in recent years that the movement spread throughout the Commonwealth. In his introductory speech the Minister of Defence explained, I think, that it would cost about  £100,000  per annum to provide uniforms for the junior cadets. I hope that that is not a final or confirmed estimate. In the Education Department of Queensland many teachers have taken a great interest in the cadet corps, and received a training which qualified them to become most efficient military officers. Some time ago a Minister of Defence refused to recommend a uniform anything like that which the cadets in Queensland used to have. The Queensland uniform may have been too expensive, but if some simple kind of uniform, with a little attractiveness about it, were allowed to the cadets, and some provision made, if necessary, to recoup to some extent the expense to parents, I do not think that there would be a single youth in the  primary schools between twelve and fourteen years of age who would not welcome it. At that early age the minds of boys are very receptive, and under intelligent instructors much good can be done. Certainly a great deal of good will be done  to the cadets through the teachers, especially in primary schools. If a simple uniform is supplied to cadets it will suggest that which every man and woman in the community ought to honor - the King's uniform. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) [4.30]. - I also can speak as to the way in which the cadets have always appreciated the privilege of wearing uniforms. Now that we are introducing a system by means of which juniors will be called upon to undergo a certain amount of training, we ought to do our utmost to encourage them. Under this Bill the Citizen Forces are to be supplied with uniforms. The senior cadets will also have them. But they are to be denied to the junior cadets, on the score of expense. As, however, we are calling upon them to perform certain services, we ought to do our utmost to induce them to take a pride in their work. It seems to me that the estimate of cost, £100,000 per annum, must be erroneous. The uni-  forms themselves are not expensive. A uniform for a cadet can be obtained at a very small price, and might be made to last a youth during the two years' period of service before he is transferred to the senior cadets. I urge the Minister to have the matter inquired into further, and to see whether it will not be possible to make provision of a reasonable and moderate character to supply these youngsters with uniforms that will tend to inculcate' that spirit with which we desire to see them imbued. I am glad that the Minister of Defence has agreed to insert in the Bill a definition of " horses," so as to include mules. It might also be well to include the other useful animal referred to by

                        by way of interjection, last night. When speaking on this measure at the second-reading stage, I pointed out briefly how desirable it was from a defence point of view to adopt such an immigration policy as would enable large numbers of people to be brought to Australia. I mentioned that hundreds of thousands of people were going to Canada. But it was suggested that nevertheless the population of Canada was not increasing, at any rate, by .leaps and bounds. I have been induced to look up the subject since then. I find, taking the statistics for the years 1905 to 1908, that they include what are called declared settlers ; that is to say, men who on entering Canada make declarations that they intended to remain, and thus became entitled to acquire land and other privileges. In 1905 there were no less than 146.266 declared settlers: In 1906 _ there were 189,004 ; in 1907 there were 252&gt;°38j and in 1908 there were 204,071. Amongst those were many who came from the United States, as well as from Great Britain. In fact, in some years, the numbers from the United States and Great  Britain closely approximated: Those figures show that Canada has received an enormous number of declared settlers. In addition, a' large number of persons entering Canada we're not so enumerated. The arrivals as distinguished from the declared settlers in 1907 were. 277,373, making a total immigration in that year, of 529,000 persons. In 1908 the arrivals as distinguished from the declared settlers were 148,000, making a total immigration of 352,771. The total population of Canada for the year' 1908 is given at 7, 184,000, showing an increase over the year 1901 of something like 1,812,000: I also turned up the statistics with regard to the Argentine. I find that in the year 1895 the population of that country was 3,954,911. It had increased' by the year 1909 to 6,805,684. In Australia, between 1901 and 1908 our population increased from 3,828,286 to 4,275,306, showing an increase, in round numbers, of 450,000 during a period of seven years. ' The argument that I base upon those figures is that there are people to be had for Australia as there are for other portions 'of the world, if a vigorous and determined effort were made by the Government to bring them here.

                            <para>.- The land tax, I make bold to say, will not effect what the honorable senator expects. I wish honorable senators to realize that the first essential for Australian defence is increased population. Population means men for defence purposes ; it means increased security from attack. With a larger population we shall be able to make it clear that we intend to defend this country from inroads by people who might desire to settle on our sparsely - populated areas. With an increased population we shall be better able to realize our determination to keep our country intact and white. We cannot keep it white unless we make up our minds resolutely to do all we can to fill up our empty spaces. We shall then have not -an army of 120,000 men, but a very much larger and' mors effective  fighting force at an earlier date than is contemplated at present by the Government. It cannot be too strongly impressed upon honorable senators that we are living in perilous times. We cannot afford to be supine and to neglect our defences. There are nations which are seeking more scope for their people, and are prepared to take what they want if an opportunity is presented to them. At present our safety is being maintained by the alliance between Great Britain and a great nation whose citizens are not allowed to enter our country and fraternize with us. The! safety of Australia at the present moment is dependent on the alliance between those two countries. </para>

                            <para>- We know perfectly well that Great Britain at present has a very small naval force in the Pacific. She is relying to a great extent upon a militant power situated within a comparatively few days' sail of Australia. The nation to which I refer has proved her ability on the field of battle. She has an abundance of people to man her ships. If that nation should quarrel with Great Britain, and see fit to make a raid on our coasts, we should be in a very weak and miserable position. We ought to bend our efforts in every way to strengthen our defences. We should not wait for ten. years before establishing an effective defence force. We should insure our safety at as early a date as possible. We should endeavour to repair the serious mistake that has been made by the Commonwealth ever since its initiation. Until recently no serious effort has been made to put the defence of this country into the position it ought to occupy. If we are to maintain our supremacy in this island-continent of ours we should push this matter forward to the utmost of our power. We have commenced to realize our responsibilities in regard to naval defence. But no man can say that we have realized it to the fullest extent. We must be prepared, not only to increase our expenditure on the land force, but also on the naval force. We know that any attack upon Australia must be made from the sea, and we must be prepared to take our part in defending the country at sea. I commend most earnestly to honorable senators the necessity of adequately providing for naval defence. I feel that, so far as our land defence is concerned, we are adopting a scheme which will eventually insure a good force to main tain the independence of the country. If the members of our Citizen Forces are imbued with the feeling that Parliament regards them favorably, and will do what is possible to enable them to discharge their duties, they will carry them out, not merely because they are bound to do so under the law, but from patriotic motives. They will consider it a privilege to defend their country. No country can be great whose citizens are not prepared to sacrifice themselves in its defence. Australians are interested in Australia, whether as the land of their birth or as the birthplace of their children, and I am sure they will be willing to receive people from Great Britain, the Continent of Europe, and elsewhere, who will be able to assist them to more adequately defend the Commonwealth than they are in a position to do at present. </para>

Perhaps no one places a greater value upon military education than I do, but, when we look into history, we find that some of the finest soldiers who ever lived were men who had very little military education, as it is now understood. The question arises whether it is education after all which is chiefly required in the art of war. No doubt education is very desirable, but other qualifications very often prove themselves much superior to education when action has to be taken in the field. We know that under the old British system the promotion was by purchase, and that meant that the rich man's son became an officer of the British Army, whether qualified or not, and that the common soldier, however good a man he might be, had only the remotest chance of ever becoming a commissioned officer. That system was done away with, and promotion by examination was substituted for it. Yet we found, I think, in the late Boer war, that the class of officers in the British Army had not been very much improved. They were still the sons of rich people. In fact, the officers of the British Army are a select section of the upper class. No one, unless he has a private income in addition to his pay, can be an officer of the British Army. If he does happen, by some strange accident, to stray into the sacred  preserves, he very speedily discovers that he is not wanted, and, in the popular phrase, he is usually "sent to Coventry." Any one who has read much in connexion with wars, ancient and modern, as I used to do before 1 had much sense, must know that many of the greatest battles recorded in history were what are known as " soldiers' battles," the conduct of which, by some chance or other, was taken from the commanders altogether and which were fought out by the soldiers. I do not say that it is desirable that that should happen. I think that the control of a battle should always, be in the hands of the General, but I think, also, that we should try, by every possible means, to secure the best man for that -position. Napoleon was admittedly one of the greatest military geniuses who ever lived. He was, 1 believe, the product of the Academy, but, notwithstanding that, he, as he said himself, created his marshals out of mud. That is to say, he went down to the ranks of the common soldiers for them. Wherever he saw aptitude for war, bravery, and those characteristics which stamp the soldier, there he found his officer, and that man had his chance. Under the system we are laying down for the Commonwealth that could not occur at all. </para>

                            <para>- That is very much better than I anticipated. I had not looked very closely into the matter, and the Minister's explanation removes the objection I had.- My idea was that every opportunity should be afforded to men in the lower ranks of the service to rise to the top if they possessed the necessary qualifications. I am %'ery glad that the provision as explained by the Minister is included in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- - I am rather pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> raised the point he did, because there is some misconception existing, even in the minds of those who have followed the Bill closely, as to die position of officers. First of all, it must be remembered that we are not proposing to establish a standing army of permanent soldiers. The men who will command our troops will not be permanent officers. The only permanent officers we shall have will be the members of the </para>

                    <para class="block">Instructional Staff. Obviously, as war is a science, those who are to teach it should be scientifically trained. To give instructions in any branch of science highly scientific men are required. If a man is to become competent in the science of war as in the science of chemistry, or any other branch of science, he must start young, be educated in it, and make it his profession. Therefore, we lay it down in this Bill that the instructional officers who will not have command of regiments, companies, brigades, or divisions, but will be the instructors of those who will command, shall be scientifically trained from youth onwards. They must make this science the profession of their lives. But this does not necessarily conflict in any way with the idea suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> and, as under Napoleon, every man in the ranks may have in his knapsack the baton of a field marshal. The Bill specially provides that before any man can obtain a commission, he must have served in the ranks. There will, under this Bill, be no promotion as there has been in the past of men straight from civil life to a commission in the forces of the Commonwealth. The officers who will actually command the troops will have first of all to serve in the ranks. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> will understand that when the Bill provides that after five years no officer shall be appointed who has not been through the Military College, the reference is to officers of the Instructional Staff, whose duty it will be to teach the officers who will command the troops. </para>

                            <para>- With reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger's remarks about the junior cadets, it is not necessary that I should go over what I said on the second reading of the Bill. First of all, we provide, at considerable expense, for a staff of instructors in physical drill and exercises. They will be permanent men, distributed throughout the States. They will attend at suitable times and places to instruct the teachers of our primary and State schools in physical exercises, and those teachers, in turn, will instruct the junior cadets. We are going to provide all junior cadets with miniature rifles, and all schools with miniature rifle ranges. This work will involve a very considerable expenditure. We also intend to provide that existing cadet officers shall be continued, in order to instruct our junior cadets in elementary exercises and drill. But, at the present time, we do not consider that we have sufficient money to spare to enable us to provide those cadets with uniforms ; and we do not regard the payment of a partial subsidy towards supplying them with uniforms as a satisfactory proposal. It must also be recollected that under the old cadet system service by the lads was voluntary; whereas we now compel them to join the Cadet Forces. In former times, if a parent could not afford to purchase a uniform for his son, the lad simply did not join the Cadet Forces. But now we say that he must join them. Therefore, whilst in the past we have given only a grant in aid of the uniforms, in the future we shall have to provide the whole of the uniforms. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The expenditure that will be incurred under this Bill will aggregate nearly £2,000,000 annually. When the Budget papers are available, honorable senators will see that we have incurred a huge expenditure. If we had  £100,000  to spare, there are a dozen different things upon which it might well be expended. But when I am given the choice between spending money in supplying junior cadets with uniforms and spending it on some of the things which are necessary to make our Defence Force more efficient, I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> will not suggest that I should spend it upon the uniforms. It is like asking one to choose whether he will have windows in his house, or whether he will paint it. When the honorable senator comes to peruse the Budget papers, he will see that our defence expenditure has increased enormously, and he will also realize that we could have very well spent a good deal more in that direction. I would further point out that, in two years' time, none of these lads will be without uniforms, because, when they reach fourteen years of age, the Government will provide them with uniforms. I do not intend to discuss the question of immigration, because a very effective Bill will shortly be submitted to honorable senators, which will disclose the reasons for the stagnation of settlement in Australia. </para>

                    <para>My colleague and myself are of opinion that two small Bills which have been standing on the business-paper for some time ought to be pushed forward, " if possible, before honorable senators are called upon to deal with larger measures. This Bill is one of them. It is a measure which can scarcely be described as a party one in any sense of the word. Some considerable time ago, the attention of the then Prime Minister, the  President  of the Senate, and the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives was called to a collection which was in the possession of the gentleman who is referred to in the agreement which is attached to this Bill. With the assistance and concurrence of the Library Committee, they arrived at the conclusion that, in the best interests of Australia, the Library of the Commonwealth should be supplemented by that collection, which in future  will  be found to be of considerable value. I have been informed that, if the collection had been allowed to become dispersed - that is to say, if no action had been taken at the time - it would, at no very distant date, have cost nearly £30,000 to purchase it. The matter having been considered from that point of view, it was deemed advisable that the collection should be secured for the Commonwealth, and accordingly action was taken, which is embodied in the two short agreements attached to the Bill. As there are honorable senators present who in the past were members of the Library Committee, they will doubtless be able to afford the Senate such information as will be required to enable it to arrive at a speedy decision in regard to this matter. </para>

                    <para>It is a small measure, to which I hope honorable senators will be prepared to give their serious consideration, with a view to advancing it to the report stage this afternoon. It does not involve any question of policy, but is of a purely administrative character. The Minister of External Affairs, with whose Department the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act rests, has for some time past experienced certain difficulties in the administration of that Act. It is for the purpose of removing those difficulties that a few short amendments to the principal Act are proposed in this Bill. In the principal Act, it is provided that immigrants entering Australia under certain conditions may remain here for twelve months. The Act also limits the time for taking action against a prohibited immigrant to twelve months. Consequently, if an immigrant who is subsequently found to be an undesirable person fulfils the conditions set forth in the Statute for that period, the time has passed when he can be deported, or when the educational test can be applied to him. The amendment which is proposed in clause 2 is to strike, out the period of twelve months within which action must be taken, with a view to making it two years.' I do not think that any honorable senator can object to that. Clause 3 of the Bill is intended to amend section 9A of the principal Act, by omitting the words " for the purposes of this section." Its effect will simply be to broaden the scope of the Statute. Clause 4 seeks to amend section  9D  of the principal Act. Under the existing law there is no adequate provision requiring the captains of vessels, upon their arrival in Australia, to report whether or not they have prohibited immigrants aboard. This clause will make it necessary for them, immediately on their arrival in port, to report to the proper authorities whether or not they have any such immigrants aboard. Clause 5 introduces a proposed new section,  i2A,  to deal with the introduction and concealment of prohibited immigrants. At present nothing can be done with aiders and abettors, and the Minister desires power to deal with persons on board a ship who have had some connexion with the introduction of prohibited immigrants, and have assisted in concealing them on the ship, or keeping them away from justice after they have succeeded in landing them. I believe that it is the desire of honorable senators to make the principal Act- really effective, and, as the proposed amendments have been found necessary for its proper administration, there should be no objection offered to them. Clause 5 also introduces a proposed new section,  12B,  to enable the Department to effectively deal with the case of false naturalization papers. I am sure that many honorable senators will admit that some of the very innocent-looking Orientals who have come here would almost deceive Satan himself with their urbanity and their smiles. Very often a man, fifty or sixty years old, who has had a birth certificate, or a certificate of some description, given to him in some of the States, has left Australia and died abroad. But, by-and-by, a young man, nineteen or twenty years of age, has arrived, and presented a birth certificate which ought to belong to a man sixty or seventy years of- age. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; these men have gone a long distance on their innocence. This clause introduces a proposed new section for the purpose of dealing with all those who come here with false certificates of any description, stopping the leaks in the Act, and preventing fraud being perpetrated on the -Department. Clause 6 amends section 14 of the Act by omitting the words, ' ' every member of the police force of any State, and." This is done because the words " every officer " are sufficient. Clause 7 embodies a consequential amendment, while the next and last clause introduces a new section, empowering " any officer " to search a vessel or vehicle for prohibited immigrants. In the administration of the Act some difficulties have arisen with respect to the power of officers to make a search in certain circumstances. In regard to a boat or a cab or a house their action has been, to some extent, circumscribed. The proposed new section extends the power of search to any officer, so that there may be no difficulties placed in the way of the Department in the detection of prohibited immigrants and the effective administration of the Act. These are the amendments which are embodied in this short Bill. I know that every honorable senator desires the laws of the Commonwealth to be made so perfect that evasion of them will be almost impossible, and, therefore, I feel sure that the Senate will give the Minister of External Affairs every assistance in an honest attempt to caulk up the leaks in the existing legislation, and make it really effective. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) [5.20]. - I do not know that honorable senators could do otherwise than continue the consideration of this Bill, as I presume the Minister is anxious that it should be passed as early as possible. It deals, as he pointed out, with matters of administration only. Our policy with regard to prohibited immigrants was debated years ago and settled. I agree with
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline>
                        that when any leaks in an Act are discovered, steps should be. taken by Parliament to get rid of the leaks, and so enable the law to be carried out as was originally intended. We may settle a policy here, but if we do not make the necessary provisions we may find that the Act was so weakly framed that it will not enable any breaches to be discovered and dealt with in such a way as to deter other persons from committing similar breaches. On that ground, I concur in
                        <inline font-style="italic">the</inline>
                        desirability of passing this Bill. There are, however, one or two matters which rail for some consideration. Clause  2  amends section 5 of the principal Act by increasing the period within which a prosecution may take place thereunder from one year to two years, and by introducing a new subsection. The period of one year was allowed to stand when the Act was recently amended, and the .proposed enlargement of it calls 'for some justification. We all want a period to be fixed within which it will not be possible for the Government to take proceedings against an individual', perhaps without any justification, or under a mistaken idea. Of course, I freely admit that it is necessary to have some provision to enable the Government if they believe that a person has got into the Commonwealth in fraud of the Act, to take proceedings against him within a reasonable period.

                            <para>- Why should the lapse of a period abolish the right of a man to recover a debt which is due to him? It is simply to quieten things, and not to keep persons in a perpetual state of turmoil. Only the other day a woman was charged with being a prohibited immigrant on the ground that she was a person of colour, and the defence was that she was not a person of colour within the meaning of the Act, but a European who, in consequence of having gone to a tropical country, had got rather brown. Unless cases in fraud of the Immigration Restriction Act can be cited, I do not think that honorable senators should be called upon to alter the period within which a prosecution may be instituted from one year to two years. If a person fails to comply with the requirements of the Act he ought to be prosecuted. We recognised years ago that there must be a period within which to vindicate the law, and we decided that one year was enough. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator will refer to the law he will see that during the term of the bond the man is not a prohibited immigrant; but the moment it expires he becomes a prohibited immigrant, and unquestionably the other period of twelve months runs from that event, and does not cover the period during which the bond was in existence. It naturally and properly should be so. If a person arrives in Australia and is permitted under the authority of the Government to remain here for six months, he is not a prohibited immigrant during that period. But if, at the end of that period, he has not left the country, he becomes a prohibited immigrant from the date at which his authority to remain expires ; and the period of twelve months would probably be reckoned from that date, and not from the day when he arrived. There are several clauses that appear to me to be necessary and reasonable in order to make the existing Act work more effectually. But I take exception to others. Clause  6  proposes to amend section 14 of the principal Act by omitting the words ' ' every member of the police force of any State." The Vice-President of the Executive Council did not appear to me to explain sufficiently why those words should be eliminated. </para>

                            <para>- If every member of a police force has been created an officer under the Act the objection that I was going to take is obviated. The only advantage of the amendment is that it gets rid of certain unnecessary words. But clause  8  proposes to introduce new principles. The first part of it would enable any officer to stop and search any vessel or vehicle in which he had reason to suspect any prohibited immigrant to be. That provision leaves it open to any officer or constable, without a warrant, at his own sweet will, to stop and search any vessel without having, in the first instance, to go before a magistrate and satisfy him that a warrant should be issued. It may be said that it is necessary in emergencies for the officers to act immediately. That may be an excuse for placing this wide power in the hands of police officers. While we must recognise that, as a rule, the police are vigilant and desirous of performing their duty reasonably and fairly, still there are times when police officers have, through ignorance, or it may be from dislike of individuals, transgressed the bounds of fairness. That is serious enough; but it would be still more serious for a police officer to prevent a vessel from leaving an Australian port on the alleged ground that he suspected that she had &amp; prohibited immigrant on board. Such action might do serious injury to a shipowner, whose only remedy would be to bring an action against an individual who might not pecuniarily be worth a snap of the finger. </para>

                            <para>- That applies with regard to a man who commits a crime in London. Suppose he commits burglary, robbery, or murder. He has the same opportunity of getting away as a Chinaman would have in Sydney. What I particularly urge is that a policeman, or Customs officer, exercising authority under this measure should carry a document signed by a superior officer, authorizing »him to carry out his functions. The draftsman of this Bill has recognised that there are times when a person ought not to enter the house of another.; He has, therefore, inserted the words " at any reasonable hour in the day time." </para>

                            <para>- It is going too far to leave Lt in the power of any understrapper to exercise this power of search. It is a recognised principle of British law that a man's house is  his  castle, and that he is entitled to remain unmolested in it, except it be invaded by due process of law. The exercise of this power should be surrounded' by certain safeguards, to prevent injustice to individuals. I do not make this criticism from captious motives. The matter is worthy of serious consideration. Our law is, in many respects, being put upon a different basis from that of thirty years ago. In some cases that  is  being done with great advantage. Under our Customs Act  an  averment can be made which is to be regarded  as  true, unless the contrary is proved. There is always a. danger of abuse in such cases. In the history of the operation of the CommonwealthCustoms Act, there have been  Gases  which have not been creditable to the administration, and people have in consequence been placed in false positions. This is why I say we should be very careful when proposing a departure from lines laid down with very great care and after years of experience. I am not one of those who, because a practice is old, believe that it should always be continued. I believe that we are progressing as the years go by, and in the more advanced legislation of the present day we have left old land-marks and established new ones. But when a departure is proposed from an established principle, it should be fully justified, and we should be very careful that it will not lead to injustice. If the Minister could see his way to accept an amendment of the clause providing that the authority of a senior officer of the Customs Department, or a magistrate should be required, my objection to it would be removed. </para>

I have always protested against the suggestion that a man should be considered guilty until he has proved that he is innocent.

                    <para>I object to the principle of that provision. There may be cases in which its application would be permissible, but, as a rule, it is a bad principle. With regard to the provision to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> referred, I think it is necessary that there should be a definition of the words " reasonable cause."

                        <para>. - Although we are in entire sympathy with the policy of this Bill, I think the Minister should give some reason why the Government propose to make the administration of the law more drastic. He may have information from the Department, and may know of concrete instances which justify the proposal, but I think the information should be given to honorable senators. I direct attention to the use of the words, " who is directly or indirectly concerned," in the proposed new section  1  2  a.  I take it that it is upon the advice of the Crown Law officers that these words were inserted, but I think it would be much better if the words " directly or indirectly " were omitted. There are stupid officers in the Customs Department as in every other Government Department, and more injury is done by the acts of stupid officers than by those of deliberately malicious officers. A man comes into this country in violation of the Immigration Restriction Act, and proceeds to some country place. Some person may give him food or shelter, or show him on his way without any knowledge that he is a prohibited immigrant, and that person might, by a stupid 01 malicious officer of the Department, be brought up and grave injustice might be done him. If the words " directly or indirectly " were left out, the Department would still- have ample power to deal with the matter without injustice to any person. It is a virtue in the drafting of a Statute not to make it too extensive. Qualifying words should be used with great care in drafting, as well as in the construction of a law. In sub-section  2  of the proposed new section  14b  it is provided that - </para>

                            <para>- It may be advisable to permit an officer to make an arrest without a warrant. If a man is arrested wrongfully without a warrant he has a remedy against the Government, who are responsible for the acts of their officers. But to permit an officer of the Department to enter a house without a warrant is quite a different thing. We are not suggesting that the hands of the Department should be tied, but we cannot disregard the dictates of elementary justice. When an officer of the Department! .enters a house, he should be armed with a warrant, or at least with a written authority, guaranteeing his <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> and his relation to the Department. I hope that Ministers will not object if we suggest in Committee an amendment of this provision requiring that the officer concerned shall at least carry with him a written authority from a superior officer to execute the powers proposed. In other respects there can be no objection to the Bill, which seeks to carry out a policy already adopted. </para>

                        <para>- I have said that he must be a sergeant or above that rank, but men of that rank and' above it are not incapable of making blunders, or beyond being actuated by malice. Under the law to which I have referred a man's house may be burst open or entered with any force considered necessary, and without a warrant, if a constable believes that persons are meeting there for the purpose of instigating a strike. They may be engaged in a prayer meeting, or a mother's meeting, but if the constable believes that they are meeting in order to instigate a strike, he is at liberty, without a warrant, to use whatever means he pleases to secure an entrance, and to make arrests.

                    <para> Parliament when this coercive and reactionary measure was passed. It is a pity that such benighted legislation as was passed recently in the Parliament of New South Wales should be due to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has left the State for the Federal arena in politics. It appear* to me that the object of the Bill now before us is to secure the apprehension of prohibited immigrants who are trying t&lt;&gt; evade the law. These are usually coloured' aliens, and they go at once to the haunts of their fellow countrymen, who so much resemble one another that it is very difficult to trace them. I do not wish to see Australia a police-ridden country, by any  means, but if the authority suggested by honorable members opposite were necessary the prohibited immigrant might make good his escape while the officer went to a superior to get it. The object of this provision is to insure promptitude, so as to enable arrests to be made of those who desire to escape. For that reason, and as- the measure is a mere machinery one, I think it is unnecessary to do what the honorable senator suggests. At the same time, the Bill is not merely intended to stop leaks. It is more particularly designed to stop Chinks. Consequently, the more promptitude is displayed by our officers the less likely are we to allow these child-like and bland heathens to get the better of us. We ought to give the widest possible powers to our officials, and I do not suppose that any of them will desire to turn anybody's house upside down for the sake of mere fun. It is all very well to compare smuggled goods with prohibited immigrants. But there is this difference : that the prohibited immigrant, being a man with conscious intelligence, may escape, whereas 150 tins of opium cannot be so easily smuggled away. I regret that the honorable senator did not use his great influence to prevent the members of his party from putting upon the New South Wales statute-book what is known as Wade's Coercion Act. </para>

                            <para>- A man may be a prohibited immigrant by reason of being diseased, or of being a criminal. Let honorable senators imagine the case of a ship lying in Sydney Harbor with a criminal on board who wishes to land in that city. I have seen hundreds of men escape from their ships by dropping over the bow at night into a boat, and being rowed ashore. Ought not our Customs officers to have power to search vessels under such circumstances ? But if we first require them to consult the Collector of Customs or an officer of police, or a justice of the peace, a prohibited immigrant will be able to get ashore, without any prospect of being afterwards discovered. The only way to prevent him doing so would be to make every Customs officer a justice of the peace. </para>

I would further point out that under the Customs Act a Customs officer has the right to do all that is proposed in this Bill, not only in the day time, but at night. He may board any vessel, and search every part of her, even the private accommodation of. the crew or passengers, and by an order of the Collector he may be stationed on board, when the ship is required to feed him. </para>

                        <para>. - I have listened very attentively to all that has been urged both for and against this little Bill. Honorable senators must admit that if we are going to  administer a law which is already in existence, we must extend its provisions in any direction which experience may suggest is desirable. A great deal of attention has been devoted to the last clause of the Bill, which relates to the searching of vessels. But I would point out that under a preceding provision an officer has power to arrest without warrant. That being so, would not a very nice position arise if an officer suspected that a prohibited immigrant was aboard a vessel, or in a cab, or in a house, and he had not authority to make a search for him in order to exercise the power of arrest without warrant, which he possesses? I would point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger in particular, that under British law it was a grand old principle of the old days that a man should always be . presumed to be innocent until he was proved to be guilty. But nowadays the custom is to regard every person as guilty until he has established his innocence. I need scarcely remind honorable senator that the facilities for evading the law which exist now, did not exist in the old days. There were not then the fast steamers, launches, and taxi-cabs of modern times. In those days when a British Fleet came within range of an enemy's port at night it was customary not to open fire upon it, but to wait until morning, and then to forward an intimation of its intentions. But I venture to say that Great Britain would be in a very queer position to-day if she attempted to give effect to that grand old policy. It is just the same with every piece of legislation that we enact at the present time. If we do not adopt precautions to close every loophole for evasion, we shall find that people have become so much more active, energetic, and cunning in the matter of doing wrong that our legislation will be ineffective. Therefore, I say that when an officer has reason to suspect that a prohibited immigrant is in a vehicle, vessel, or house, he should be empowered to arrest him straight away. If he has first to go to some other person for authority to arrest him, the sheen of his buttons will scarcely be out of sight before the immigrant will be transported to another place where the officer will have no suspicion of his existence. The Bill represents an honest attempt to make existing legislation effective without doing anything which will outrage the best interests of the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

Those Acts give a certain amount of protection, which is not given so fully in this measure. The principal Act does not give any protection, and only a limited protection is given in the Bill. It is clear from the Customs Act and the Excise Act. who are the officers referred to therein, but it is not clear on the face of it that any police officer can take such action as is indicated in proposed new section  14b.

                            <para>- I admit at once that many drastic powers were given, and properly given, in the Customs Act and the Excise Act ; but I would remind the Committee that they have been abused. I have a clear recollection of the discussion which took place here when they were asked for. The then representative of the Government - ex-Senator O'Connor - said that he could not imagine that any man would exercise the powers in other than a reasonable manner and in justifiable circumstances. With that assurance, the powers were granted, but they have been abused by men occupying important positions under the Commonwealth Government. When I find that Ministers will not listen to my suggestion, and will adhere to the provision in their Bill, I give them credit for sincerity of purpose, but I decline to assume the responsibility which properly belongs to them. I consider that I have done my duty in directing their attention to the terms of the proposed new section. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly they will be removable. A subsidiary corporation will have to be formed, and there will be a clause in its articles providing for the removal of trustees. There will be a trust deed, of which the shareholders must approve. I cannot understand any subsidiary corporation being formed without a provision for the appointment and removal of trustees. The corporation will .  have to receive the approval of three-fourths of the shareholders at a special meeting called for the purpose. Each bank will arrange its own conditions. </para>

                <para class="block">That purpose, as frankly set forth, not only in the preamble to the Bill, but in the clause itself, is to safeguard the interests of the shareholders. But the trustees will be of absolutely no use if they are to be removable at the beck and call of the company. Suppose that a banking company in time of stress wanted to get at this trust fund. They could get at it if they had power to get at the trustees ; and they could get at the trustees if they were removable. The fund should be absolutely outside the control of the directors. </para>

                        <para>- I am not in charge of the Bill. I look upon this, rightly or wrongly, as the most dangerous measure that has ever been introduced in the Commonwealth Parliament. The only strong reason that has been put forward in favour of it is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> is " such a nice man. " None of us denies that. But every innocent girl who has lost her virtue has had to mourn for it because the tempter was " such a nice man .  " That kind of reasoning does not weigh with me. We have to regard this Bill on its merits or demerits, as the case may be. No trust fund can be of any service in the event of an emergency arising if the trustees can be got at ; and most certainly they can be got at if they are removable. </para>

                        <para>- But the question is who has the right to remove them? What is the object for which this trust fund is to be created? According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> it is to safeguard the interests of shareholders. He alleges that there is also the subsidiary object of safeguarding the interests of the public. That being so, I maintain that the fund should be vested in a public official, appointed by the public officers of the country - that is to say, by the Government. The directors of the company should have no power to remove them. A trust fund is useless unless it can be guaranteed to be there if wanted for the purposes for which it was created. That is an axiom which cannot be disputed. The only way to safeguard the trust fund is to provide that the trustees appointed to safeguard it shall not be removable by the men whose interest it may be to rob the trust fund at any time when it may suit them. It is quite conceivable that in a time of stress the directors of a bank might say, " Unless we can get some resource from outside, we must go under. If we could only lay our hands upon half-a-million of money, we should be able to pull through. Here is this trust fund. It is our money. We should like to use it. But how are we to get at it? It is in the hands of trustees, and they will not give it to us unless we exercise pressure." If the directors were able to exercise pressure, undoubtedly they would do so, and this Bill gives them the power. </para>

                        <para>- They are private companies, and not Government officials. They are appointed by legislation, to act as trustees in the various States, and their powers are defined. But even in public trustee companies there are boards of directors who, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> might bulldoze their shareholders. The suggestion he makes would not help us forward one bit. The clause provides that trustees of the proposed fund may be appointed by a three-fifths majority of a meeting of shareholders. We should require special legislation to enable a public trustee who was a Government officer to undertake the duties of trustees under this Bill. The clause provides that, instead of intrusting the proposed reserve fund to a trustee company it shall be placed in the hands of three trustees to be selected at a meeting of the shareholders. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens'</inline> principal objection to the clause is that the trustees would be removable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> made a pertinent interjection when he asked whether, if it were found that any of the trustees were not acting properly, it would not be better to have the power to remove them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> said that the directors of a bank wishing to secure the money in the fund might appoint new trustees who would be their pliant tools and give them control of a fund established for a specific purpose under this Bill. My reply to. that is that the new trustees would be just as much bound by the provisions of the Bill as the original trustees. They would have no more right than the former will have to divert the moneys of the fund from the specific purpose for which it was established. We have been told that the directors of a bank might bull-doze the shareholders at a meeting, and, by the way, there are often very many more shareholders at these meetings than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> imagines, and they take a very keen interest in the business of the bank. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly, but the other one-tenth would know a good deal. If we assume for the sake of argument that directors and shareholders in a bank wish to perpetrate a fraud, for which they might be prosecuted, and in order to do so appoint new trustees, the fact remains that the new trustees cannot divert the fund from the purposes for which it is established. If any attempt were made to do so, one shareholder would have the right to bring it under the notice of the Court, and the Court would restrain those who desired to misappropriate the moneys of the fund. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> argues that trustees have made away with funds intrusted to them I admit the fact. </para>

We may have to consider later the question of their removal. They are to be appointed for a specific purpose, and that is to carry out the provisions of this Bill which has been affirmed by the Senate on the second reading and by the Committee in agreeing to the substantive provision for the proposed reservefund. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> seems to forget that even if such a thing as he supposes were to occur, the shareholders of the bank would still be liable for the reserve liability on their shares. The reserve liability fund would be placed in the hands of the trustees for a specific purpose, and if it were misappropriated it would have to be replaced by the bank, so that the shareholders and not the public would be at a disadvantage if the moneys of the fund were stolen. I am obliged to Senator Gould for what he has told us. He is a good lawyer, and I bow to his superior knowledge of law. The trustees under this Bill will form a corporation, and cannot be done away with without an Act of" Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- But if a public trustee is false to his trust the Government of the country are responsible, and the money is safe. If the trustees under this ' Bill -were false to their trust the money would be gone- and no one would be safe. There is a radical difference between the two positions. Under this clause three trustees may be appointed by a three-fifths majority of the shareholders of a bank. We know what that means. The directors, who have laid down the law for the shareholders, in running the institution will recommend three trustees for appointment, and the unfortunate shareholders, who do not know anything about anybody, will accept their recommendation ; and let me remind honorable senators that one of the trustees may be a director of the bank. If the other directors and shareholders wish to collar the trust fund they have only to bulldoze one of the other trustees, and they can do what they please. We should not create trust funds with which any one may play ducks, and drakes. We should legislate -in a serious fashion. This Bill is either a good or a bad one. The objects for which it has been introduced are good or bad, and if it is desirable that what is proposed should be done it ought to be done in a proper way. It is the duty of the Committee to see that it is not done improperly. Under this clause it is done in a very improper way. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator wishes to relieve the shareholders of certain banks of a certain reserve liability, notwithstanding that their capital may have entirely disappeared from those banks, and we have known it to disappear previously. We all know that in 1893 some institutions had not enough money to enable them to meet their fixed or current deposits, let alone their note issues. In my judgment, this is the most rotten clause in the Bill. The trustees are to be removable by a vote of three-fifths of the shareholders. I contend that such trustees can be " got at." As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has remarked, I am opposed to the Bill root and branch. 1 hold that if we remove the penal clause which has been inserted in the Bill, and which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> wishes to remove- </para>

                        <para>- No. Under this Bill the shareholders and directors of these institutions will have power, not only to look after their own interests, but also after the interests of other people. They will be able to safeguard their own interests, and to let the interests of the public go hang. That being so, I say that if any fund is to be created, it should be created only under such safeguards as will make it  absolutely secure. It should be invested in a public trustee appointed by the Government - an officer who is absolutely independent of the shareholders. _ That is a -perfectly reasonable proposition to lay down, and unless the clause be so amended I shall oppose it. </para>

                    <para>. - Upon this occasion I find myself in a very peculiar position. For the rest of my natural life I feel disposed never to have anything in a banking institution except an overdraft, because, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> such institutions are merely dens of thieves, which are going to do everything possible, even in the matter of the appointment of trustees, to cheat the public and to ruin themselves. What are these trustees to be appointed for? Whose money are they to be appointed to look after? Is it public money, State money, or Commonwealth money? It is money which is to be taken out of the profits of the shareholders, and placed to the credit of a fund to meet their liabilities. But, whilst the fund is intended to meet the liabilities of the shareholders, its creation will not relieve them of one penny of their obligations, either to the depositors or note-holders in any banking institution. </para>

Is it not very nearly time that he gave credit for good intentions, even in a small degree, to such humble individuals as other honorable senators, instead of arrogating to himself all the knowledge, all the integrity, and all the foresight? He arrogates to himself, in a legislative capacity, everything which, if he were liberal-minded, he would be prepared to share with others. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has truly pointed out, under this Bill it will not matter whether the shareholders appointed Judas Iscariot, Pontius Pilate, and Ananias as trustees, because they would still be responsible for their reserve liability. What are the trustees to be appointed for? To look after a fund which is to be established, and which is intended to grow, so that, if a ci.L-is arose, that reserve liability might be met in another way. </para>

                        <para>- They may be; but that fact does not affect the question so far as the note-holders and depositors are concerned. The shareholders propose to establish this fund to meet their own liabilities. If I had  £10,000  worth of notes in a bank, should I not be in a better position if a fund equal to my reserve liability had been built up than if no such fund had been established? I may be a shareholder in a bank to-day, and my reserve liability may be £5,000 or £10,000 At the time, I may be worth  £20,000.  But next year a crisis may occur, depositors may come rushing for their funds, and, as far as my share of the reserve liability is concerned, I may not have a £5 note. Will it not be better for the public if such a fund be created, even if trustees of a doubtful character be appointed to take charge of it, than if no such fund exists? Further, are all the shareholders and directors of banking institutions either rogues or foo.'s ? </para>

                        <para>- It is all very well for the honorable senator to talk like that. He, apparently, thinks that everything good is to be found in a public trustee. But I have known a public trustee to rob trust funds, and to get away to one of the South American Republics with a young woman and spend them there. That officer even left a bill for the Government to pay in respect of information regarding the extradition laws of America. I say that the honest intention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> is to enable banking institutions to conduct their business in an honest way. There is no intention to be dishonest in the appointment of' these trustees. If, after a few years, they turn out to be disreputable characters, and levant. with the money, that will be the look out of the shareholders, and not of the note-holders or depositors. Will it not be better for a reserve fund of this description to be established than for no such fund to be in existence? </para>

                        <para>- If they were,, the trustees would scarcely take the shareholders with them, although they might take some of the shareholders' daughters. Consequently, I say that the Bill . represents an honest attempt to give a double security to various sections of the public. Wl en <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> stated to-night that the trustees will be elected by a three-fifths majority of the shareholders, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> interjected that they were also removable by a majority of the shareholders. That circumstance, I submit, is not affected by this clause. Even assuming that they can be removed by a three-fifths majority of the shareholders, what then? If they are not discharging their duties satisfactorily, the shareholders ought to have the power to remove them. But, if they w'ere removed, and new trustees were appointed, would not the latter occupy an exactly similar position ? What benefit would it be to the shareholders- to remove the trustees unless the latter were administering the fund in a dishonest way? I hold that we ought to support this clause, because it contains nothing to the detriment of the public. </para>

                        <para>- At the same time, I experience a little difficulty in understanding the measure, and, perhaps, in the course of my remarks, I may be assisted by the interjections which will come from its author.' Every person who was in Australia during the financial crisis of the early nineties will recollect how many of our banking institutions, with brass plates upon their front doors, toppled over like so many houses of cards. Where, then, was the liability of the shareholders of those institutions? The law provided that note-holders should have an unlimited liability. In the Old Country the shareholders of banks are liable to the extent of their private fortunes. I believe that in the crisis which occurred in Australia in 1893 the shareholders of some banking institutions were placed in the dock. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that it is the earnest intention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> to safeguard the interests of note-holders and depositors. It would seem that it is intended out of the profits, the premiums derived from shares, and recovered bad debts, to form a fund to protect the shareholders in regard to their reserve liability. Suppose, for example, that a bank had a legitimate liability of ,£100,000, and the amount in the trust fund came to only £50,000. Would the shareholders escape the reserve liability? </para>

                        <para>-  No ; the other £50,000 would still be payable. In place of calling on the shareholders to pay the reserve liability, the trustees would, if the bank went into liquidation, say, " We have £50,000 towards that, but you will have to get the other ,£50,000 from the shareholders." Under this Bill, the trustees could not part with any money, except the bank failed, until they had the whole of the reserve liability in hand. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt, it is a laudable effort to provide an additional safeguard. I feel that there is something to commend the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> because, after all, banks stand in a wholly different relation to the public from any other trading concern. Banks must have the confidence of the public The latter reciprocate that feeling by accepting the notes of the banks at face value and depositing money with them, and expect to be paid on demand. If there is no safeguard provided in the shape of a public trustee who will see that the trust fund is devoted to the proper purpose, both the note-holders and depositors will stand in a very awkward position. As regards banking institutions, we have plenty of evidence to the effect that Governments have had to step in and appoint trustees to administer their affairs. The majority of the directors of the Bank of New Zealand are appointed by the Government of New Zealand. </para>

                        <para>- I recognise that fact, but it is undoubted that the Government of New Zealand have a paramount interest in the control of the institution. They also appoint the auditors, who, I believe, are authorized to-be present at the deliberations whenever it is proposed to increase the capital, or to make any other important departure. In the case of the Imperial Bank of Germany, the Kaiser appoints the manager. Even in the case of the Bank of Japan, the Mikado appoints the manager. For what purpose? To safeguard the interests of those who have dealings with the bank. </para>

The best sense of Japan recognises that it is highly desirable that the interests of the vast majority of the residents should be safeguarded in some way ; and the best way, in the judgment of German public opinion, is to see that the bank manager is appointed by the Government, and by no one else. The proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is a mild departure from that. He does not require all the trustees of a trust fund to be appointed by the Government. What he demands is that they shall have a say in the appointment of those who are to stand between a Board of directors perhaps clamouring to misappropriate the trust fund and the depositors and note-holders, who look to that fund for the purpose of meeting their obligations. I believe that, at least, a third of the trustees should have the approval of the Government, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> will adopt that view, I do not think that there will be any further cause to delay the passage of the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I am extremely astonished to find the Vice-President of the Executive Council - the Leader of the Labour party in the Senate - taking up the stand that a public trustee is not wanted for a fund of this sort, and that it does not matter whether a public trustee is appointed or not, as private trustees are just as good. He even went further, and said that his friends, Pontius Pilate, Judas Iscariot, and Annanias, are quite trustworthy in this regard. </para>

                        <para>- Is this Parliament to be seriously asked to authorize the creation of a trust fund of which it does not matter whether those three persons are to be trustees or not? If so, it is a mere farce to ask us to deal with the matter at all. If that is the way in which the Government ask us to deal with serious business, I, for one, am not in accord with them. There is another point which seems to be overlooked, and that is that, not merely the interests of the shareholders, but the interests of the general public have to be protected. It is stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> and admitted in the Bill, that it has been brought in for the express purpose of safeguarding the interests of shareholders. But this Parliament has a right to see that men who invest their money in banks get a fair deal, just as it had a right to see that the customers of, and depositors in, banks also get a fair deal. I do not doubt the honesty of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> intentions, but I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that the road to a certain very warm place is paved with good intentions. </para>

                        <para>- That is not sufficient. We must have, at least, a modicum of common sense, otherwise we might be led astray very much. Common sense should satisfy the Committee that the Trust Fund should be safeguarded in such a way that the money would be available for the purpose for which it . was put aside whenever the need arose. In this clause we have no such safeguard, because if the trustees were removable, then undoubtedly they would be at the beck and call of the directors, and might be made under that duress to do whatever was required of them. </para>

                        <para>- Not by the Government, but by a vote of each House of Parliament, exactly in the same way as a Judge is removable, and in no other way. There is no one who will say that our Judges do not possess the full confidence of every person in the community. A public trustee would occupy a similar position. He would be the repository of a public trust, would possess the confidence of the public, and would only be removable for the same cause as a Judge, namely, for grave misconduct. So far, we have never had an instance of a public trustee having betrayed his public trust, but we have had scores of instances of private trustees having betrayed their trust. It is very strange indeed to hear the Leader of the Labour party here put forward the idea that a public trustee is no better than a private trustee. That view is not in accord with the tenets of our political faith, and I, for one, refuse to subscribe to it. Let me point out how a grave situation might arise. Only three trustees might be appointed. </para>

                        <para>- I am not going to do that. The clause is vitiated by the fact that the trustees would be removable, no matter what their number might be. It is possible that one of the trustees might be a director of the bank. Undoubtedly, he would have immense influence with his fellow trustees. When a time of great stress arose, he might say, " Here is £1,900,000 or £1,500,000 invested in the Trust Fund. If we had that money at our disposal, we could tide over this difficulty, and return it without anybody being the wiser." </para>

Under that pretence, they might sell out the Government bonds and put the proceeds In the funds of the bank for a day or two, and there would be a very good "get-out" for them. They could say, " We were only waiting' until we could invest the money in some other Government security." </para>

Is it not our business to safeguard the interests of shareholders who take advantage of this measure? The Bill expressly asks us to do a certain thing. Now we are told that it does not matter about the shareholders, because if the Trust Fund were misused, they would be the persons to suffer. That kind of reasoning is absolutely ridiculous. </para>

Suppose that the directors were impressed with the idea that if they could only get hold of that money for a day or two, they would be all right. Under this clause they would have power to sell out a million pounds of debentures, with the ostensible purpose of re-investing the money in other stock. But in the meantime they could put the money into the funds of the bank, and leave it there tor a week, or a month. </para>

                        <para>- But why should we waste our time in creating a reserve fund unless it be safeguarded, so that it may be used for the purposes for which it is created ? The whole position is vitiated by this one provision - that we are to leave the fund in the hands of trustees, who are to be the mere creatures of the directors, instead of in the hands of a public trustee. Those who voted for placing the money in the hands of private trustees will be fortunate if they do not live to be pursued by the curses of unfortunate people who have lost their money owing to this action of ours. In the year  1890,  when we had prosperous seasons, every one looked upon the banking institutions of Australia as being as sound as it was possible for them to be. But in two and a-half years what happened ? Almost every bank had to close its doors. Were it not that the Governments of the various States came to the assistance of the banks, every one of them would have had to close. </para>

The same thing may happen again. I hope that it will not be so. I do not wish to be a Jeremiah, predicting bad times to come; but we are always face to face with that possibility. We are sacrificing the interests of millions of people who have money deposited in banks, or whose interests are bound up with those who have money deposited, and we are doing this to safeguard the interests of a few fat men who are shareholders in the big banks. </para>

I strongly disapprove of the three trustees being appointed by the bank. Of course, we have now dealt with clause  4,  but I also point out that there is a danger in this clause. The latter part of it provides that the investments " may from time to time be varied for others of the same nature." The trouble is that these trustees will be the mere creatures of the bank directors. </para>

                    <para>. -  Under this clause, the trustees are removable. What happens where trustees of any trust fund are removable? We know that they can exercise no independence whatever. They are the mere creatures of the people who have appointed them and have the power to remove them. No trustees should be placed, in any such position. Did any one ever hear of the trustees under a will being removable by the beneficiaries under the will ? Did any one ever hear of (he trustees of any fund being removable at the instance of people whose interests it may be to vitiate the trust and misappropriate the fund? That is what is proposed in this clause. Under clause 4 the trustees of the fund may be appointed by a three-fifths majority of the shareholders, and one of them may be a director. Under this clause they are to be removable at the sweet will of the directors whose interest it may be at some. time or another to collar the reserve fund and use it to tide the bank over a time of distress or grave emergency. We are enacting a farce in creating a trust fund which is placed under the control of mere men-of straw, who will be at the beck and call of those who appointed them, and may be removed unless they do the will o'f those who have appointed them. </para>

It is possible that half-a-dozen shareholders might represent three-fifths of those present at a meeting. If the directors of a banking company are anxious to get rid of a trustee who stands in the way of their carrying out a certain course of action with regard to the trust fund, all that they will require to do under this clause will be to have their action ratified by three-fifths of the shareholders present at a meeting called for the purpose.

Under the clause, as it stands, there is very great danger that the trustees of this fund might be removed by the action of a hole-and-corner meeting. If we are going to observe in our banking institutions the democratic principle which permeates all our legislation and every action of this Parliament, the amendment should be welcomed by the author of this Bill. It would be reprehensible, in my opinion, to provide that a few individuals, suddenly summoned, should have the arbitrary powers given under this clause. </para>

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> contends that the Constitution of the Commonwealth should not be amended except by the vote of a majority of all the people entitled to vote, which would be equivalent to all the shareholders of a bank, his argument on this clause might be considered sound. If that is his contention, I invite him to suggest a provision, the effect of which would make it almost impossible to secure any amendment of the Constitution. To justify the contention raised in this case, we must assume first of all that the directors of a bank will desire to act dishonestly in regard to the reserve liability fund. Honorable senators should remember that the men appointed to the position of directors of a bank are men upon whose integrity and common sense the shareholders can rely. They do not put men in such positions whose character may be doubtful, and who might be expected to be guilty of some smart or dishonest trick. When honorable senators talk about a hole-and-corner meeting, I remind them that meetings of the shareholders, of a bank are summoned in accordance with its articles of association.

                        <para>- As a general rule there is no doubt they are. The directors can make what use they like of them. If shareholders are keenly interested in any proposal, they do not rely upon a proxy vote, but make it their business to be present at the meeting at which it is considered. There may be some business to transact of vital importance to the institution, and it is always transacted in this particular way. A special meeting of the shareholders is summoned in accordance with the articles of association in order that a decision may be arrived at. I need scarcely remind honorable senators that not long ago a great battle was fought between the members of the Australian Mutual Provident Society upon the question of whether or not that society should open a branch in London. In that case notices of a special meeting were forwarded to the policy-holders in the usual way, and those who were fighting the proposal 'made it their business to be present in order that their views might be made known. Why should we take further steps than the members of that society took to protect the shareholders of banks from themselves? A bank may call a special meeting of its shareholders for the purpose of dealing with some matter of vital importance to it. If so, every shareholder has an opportunity of being present. What does this Bill propose? Merely that a three-fifths majority of the shareholders present at such meeting shall be necessary for the removal of the trustees. Of course, it may be urged that only twelve or fifteen or twenty-five shareholders may attend any meeting which may be called for the purpose. I admit that that is so. But if the shareholders, after having been apprised of the nature of the business to be dealt with, do not deem it worth while to attend, they cannot think that their interests are seriously in jeopardy. As the Vice-President of the Executive Council has already pointed out, it is the shareholders' money out of which the fund is to be established. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, we prefer to get the most honest trustees that we can. Let me assume that an honorable senator had property which he desired to settle on a certain trust, and in which he wished to maintain a certain interest during his life. It would be perfectly competent for him to remove the individuals whom he had appointed as trustees. If they played ducks and drakes with his property, he would be at liberty to approach the Court for the purpose of obtaining a remedy. But when the shareholders of banking institutions provide for the appointment of trustees, and when we know that they alone will be personally affected by any action of the trustees, why should we wish to place any obstacle in the way of their getting competent men to maintain the trust? Surely the individuals who are primarily interested are those who ought to be consulted. It ought not to be possible to remove a trustee without a great deal of difficulty and expense. The Bill is so manifestly just that I cannot understand why honorable senators have occupied so much time in picturing a dishonest number of directors who are intent upon playing hanky-panky with the reserve fund in order to benefit themselves and injure the shareholders. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has endeavoured to rebut my arguments in favour of providing that an absolute majority vote shall be necessary for the removal of a trustee. In his effort to achieve his object he quoted the method which has to be followed to effect an" amendment in our Constitution. Let me remind him that the Senate cannot assent to an amendment of the Constitution unless an absolute majority of its members be present. The clause in this Bill, which relates to the removal of trustees, practically deals with an alteration of the constitution of banks. Consequently, I hold that, before trustees can be removed, a majority of the shareholders should be present in meeting assembled, so as to prevent any hole-and-corner business. </para>

                        <para>- It is a very easy matter to advertise the object of a meeting. But every shareholder may not take the same keen interest in the matter to be decided that is evidenced by the directors. To my mind, the position is not at all analogous to that of a proposed amendment of our Federal Constitution. Every amendment of the Constitution that is proposed must be placed before the electors for ratification. Parliamentary candidates stand upon the public platform and discuss it. The press takes part in that discussion, and thus the elector is afforded an opportunity of appraising its exact merits. That is one reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> amendment ought to be carried. The word " present ' ' should be omitted so as to prevent anything in the nature of a surprise meeting being held, in order to secure the removal of some trustee who may have been discharging his duty well, not only to the shareholders of the banking institution, but also to the depositors. </para>

He proposes that proxy forms should be sent out to the shareholders. If proxies are sent out by the directors, a great many of the shareholders will say, " Oh, this is all right. I will send my proxy back to the  chairman  of the board of directors." But when a meeting of shareholders is called, the shareholders keep a keen eye upon the directors, and make it their business to attend. </para>

                        <para>- I am very pleased to hear that, but so far I have not heard the honorable senator suggest any such method. To my mind, it is safer to provide for the calling of a meeting of shareholders than to allow the directors an opportunity to pile up proxies which they may use in any way that they may think fit. If a trustee is faithfully discharging his duties,, is it likely that the directors will endeavour to have him removed? Would he not be able to raise such a storm amongst the shareholders that the directors would not dare to attempt such a thing? </para>

                        <para>- The directors would not dare to take action which would compel him to do that. We must always recollect that the directors of our banks hold their positions by virtue of the confidence of the shareholders themselves. It is the shareholders who are continually watching the affairs of those institutions, who are always upon the alert .to safeguard their own interests, and who, if this Bill becomes law, will see that the fund which it is proposed to establish is maintained intact. They are the people who attend the meetings of these institutions. I have been a director of companies, and I know that when everything has been going smoothly, no shareholder has presented himself at the meetings of those companies. It is only when something has gone wrong that shareholders have put in an appearance. Similarly I contend that, when it is proposed to remove a trustee of one of our banking institutions, the whole of the shareholders will immediately become alert, want to know the ins and the outs of the business, and to be satisfied as to the justice of the proceeding, before they will give their assent. I believe that the clause as it stands is safer than it would be if amended in the direction which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has indicated. </para>

                    <para>.' - After the Committee has agreed to clauses  3  and  4,  I cannot understand why those who, like myself, have been opposed to the principle of the Bill are very much concerned about the clauses affecting the trustees of the reserve fund. I frankly confess that* those clauses concern me very little. I do not regard them as being in any sense a protection to the depositors or to the bank itself, but purely and solely as a protection to the shareholders. Nor am I much concerned about the reserve fund, because, after all, it will not be a public fund for the public interests, but merely a private fund subscribed by the shareholders of a bank to protect their own interests. The question as to whether they shall attend and vote personally or vote by proxy is not to me a matter of public interest. It does not seem to be a matter about which the Parliament should concern itself. </para>

                        <para>- When honorable senators passed clauses  3  and  4,  they virtually approved of the Bill so far as it affects the public safety and the depositors' interests, because by so doing they relieved the shareholders of that liability which was the guarantee to the public. How the reserve fund shall be administered is after all a very secondary question, and I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> that it does not concern the public whether we allow only the shareholders who are present to vote. Even if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> proposal is carried, and we allow voting by proxy, the position will not be altered in that respect. </para>

                        <para>- There is no sense in the amendment unless <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> intends to provide for proxy voting. It is not possible to get three- fifths of the shareholders to attend any meeting. Unless the honorable senator intended to follow his amendment with a proposal to include proxy voting it should not have been moved. We must have either the voting system which is provided for in the clause, or proxy voting. If the former system is preferred, the most active shareholders will be those who are present at the meeting. And if we provide for proxy voting every active shareholder will increase his voting power. I suggest to those who, like myself, have opposed the principle of the Bill, that they should allow the clauses relating to trustees to pass, because that is merely a matter of concern to the shareholders. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable senator that we have done so to a large extent, but I would point out that if in this clause we give the directors of a bank the power to remove the trustees of the reserve fund, we shall thereby make the latter the mere .creatures of the former, and that, therefore, the fund will be worth nothing. It is a mere farce to waste time on the consideration of a Bill which can have no effect. I agree entirely with the view that a provision for proxy voting would be worth nothing. We all know how it has been used in connexion with hospitals and other public institutions. Instead of being a service to the subscribers, it has always been a great danger. I am not particularly concerned as to what may become of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> amendment, because I do not believe that anything very effective could be done thereunder. My original proposal was that this clause should be deleted with a view to insert after clause  it  a new clause providing that there shall be a Government audit of the funds, that on the application of the directors of a bank to a Judge of the Supreme Court or of the High Court the trustees may be removed for a misdemeanour of any kind, and that on the nomination of anybody whom the Committee may in its wisdom determine upon, the Judge, shall have the right of appointing a trustee in his place. That is my remedy for the whole thing. If the Bill is to pass we should see that it is made effective enough to accomplish the object for which it was avowedly introduced, if for no other object. For that reason I ask the Committee to negative this clause, and to insert at the end of the Bill the new clause which I have suggested. </para>

                    <para>.- I intend to support this clause for the simple reason that the previous clauses have been passed. It merely provides for the removal of the trustees of a reserve fund. If it is altered, that will vitiate the rest, of the Bill. I cannot understand why those who voted for the previous clauses which contained the crux of the Bill should want to defeat that decision by trying to eliminate from this clause something which certainly would not make it more perfect than it is. I trust that, inasmuch as we have accepted the clause which provides for the appointment of trustees, this clause will be allowed tq pass as it stands. It is in unison with what has been done, and cannot be improved by the amendment. </para>

I also desire to move the insertion of a new clause to provide for the Government audit of the fund proposed to  be  cteated. My request is a perfectly reasonable one, inasmuch as it is proper that we should provide that the fund should be placed upon a sound footing. </para>

                        <para>- If I made such a promise, I will ask. the honorable senator to excuse me from adhering to it. He can easily get his amendment proposed in another place if he wishes. I believe I did say to him that I had no objection to a recommittal, but it was understood that  he  would bring up his amendments to-night, not some weeks hence. I did not say that I was willing to wait an indefinite time. </para>
