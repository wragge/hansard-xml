                        <para>Owing to difficulties which had arisen and were delaying the progress of the work, it was found desirable to send an officer to the various States of the Commonwealth to explain exactly what was required and prevent any superfluous, work being done. This officer has completed his visits, and the map is now being proceeded with as expeditiously as possible ; but the nature of the work is at present such that it cannot be advanced very rapidly. Three draftsmen are now engaged. This number will be increased to four in the near future, and at a later date it will be possible to employ extra draftsmen on the work. </para>

                        <para>- It will be remembered that in Committee the Vice-President of the Executive Council moved to add to the clause the words relative to the exclusion of a counsel or solicitor from the Arbitration Court. The reason why he proposed the amendment was that there was a doubt in the minds of a number of members of Parliament, both here and elsewhere, as to whether, in endeavouring to exclude lawyers from arbitration cases, the other House had not gone a step further and excluded a class of persons whose presence is very desirable in the conduct of such cases. I refer to the paid secretaries and other officials of the unions. On further reflection, however, the Attorney-General and his Department have expressed the opinion . that the amendment which was made in the clause carried out the purpose of excluding lawyers from the Court, but did not exclude the secretaries and other officials of unions who might be paid agents and appear in that capacity before the Court. Accepting that view, the other House felt that our amendment was unnecessary, and consequently disagreed to it. </para>

                    I would point out that this proviso was not inserted at the instance of the Opposition or of a Government supporter, but was proposed by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and the Government now tell us very coolly that they have discovered that it was wrong to take that step. Of course, they have attempted to show that what they want has been provided for. I ask honorable senators to realize how carelessly our legislation is prepared, and to reflect upon the slipshod methods which are resorted to by the Government. The amendment which we are now asked not to insist upon was not suddenly proposed at the long sitting which we had on Thursday last, but was placed on the contingent notice-paper after having received much consideration and thought ; and with the approval of the Government, it was adopted. Two or three days later, however, the Minister of. Defence very coolly tells us that the Government have reconsidered the position, and do not think the proviso is necessary.

                        <para>- Very, often, and, apparently, the Minister of Defence thinks so in this case. At the instance of the other House, and without offering any cogent or sufficient reasons, the Government have asked honorable senators opposite to swallow all that they did two or three days ago. The other day we pointed out what the effect of the proviso would be. They said then that they would not allow counsel to appear on behalf of any organization, even with the leave of the  President  of the Court, but they now say that that was a little too stringent, and they will make provision so that any members of unions, although they may happen to be in the legal profession, shall be able to appear on their behalf before the Court. It was stated the other day that, unless a man was a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> member of a union, that is to say, a worker, he could not appear before the Court, but, I point out that the rules can allow any person to become a member of an organization. The Registrar has no power to disallow a rule of that character. He can only disallow a rule which is shown to be contrary to the law. I congratulate the Government upon the way in which they have dealt with the Senate in connexion with this Bill. In the first instance, they asked for one thing, and now they ask for another. I should like to know what reasons, if any, were advanced in the other House against our amendment? Did any section of that House propose an amendment, by means of which persons, who might take advantage of the proviso, would not be able to get special remuneration for their services ? Was such a proposal made as would have enabled a secretary of a union, as one did some little time ago, to charge ^5 5s. a day for time spent in attending the Arbitration Court during the hearing of a matter of interest to his union? Was it pointed out that secretaries of unions getting a salary of ^3 per week, as I understand is paid to the secretary of an important union in New South Wales for devoting the whole of his time to its interests, might receive additional remuneration for attendance at the Arbitration Court? </para>

                        <para>- I do not consider it a good proviso now; but I am directing attention to the way in which trie business of the Senate is being conducted. It is calculated to make us a laughing-stock to people outside. The Minister of Defence says that upon reconsideration the Government find that clause 7 and the original section will be all right without this proviso.

                <para class="block">In clause 7 of this Bill, the section was amended by the omission of the words &#39; &#39; or by leave of the President,&#34; and by the addition of the words &#34; paid agent.&#34; So that no organization could be represented by counsel, solicitor, or paid agent, except by consent of all the parties. We added the proviso to which the House of Representatives has disagreed, and we are now told that the clause will be all right without it.

I ask the Government whether this is the way in which legislation should be passed? We shall have other Bills presented to us during the session; amendments upon them submitted by the Government will be accepted in good faith by the phalanx behind them, and a few days later they will be told that they are unnecessary and undesirable, when no doubt they will say that they are quite satisfied. The Government will have given them a dose of physic, and a day or two later will administer an emetic to get rid of its possible effects. </para>

Honorable senators opposite were invited to swallow a dose of poison, and lest injury should be sustained by them, or the organizations they represent, the Government today administer an emetic. Are we to have in the position of Ministers of the Crown men who will give so little care and attention to the business of Parliament as to lead honorable senators into undesirable positions from which it becomes necessary to extricate them later? If this is the way in which legislation is to be carried on by a Labour Government, people may well say, &#34; God protect the country from this kind of administration and leadership !&#34; </para>

Notwithstanding that the Government determined to have it inserted in the Bill, in another place, the good sense of the Opposition in the Senate has been recognised, and honorable senators opposite are now asked to go back upon their previous action. I regard the motion as a compliment to the Opposition, and am glad that the Minister of Defence has moved that the Committee do not insist upon its amendment. </para>

                        <para>-I can, and I shall prove that it is a monopoly, which has existed for many years, in the supply of oversea news to Australia. It is a monopoly which, I venture to say, has been harmful in its effects and oppressive in its methods of operation. It has had the effect of preventing the free dissemination of news, and of rendering Australia absolutely dependent upon one source for its news of the outside world. The people of this country have had no guarantee that news was not coloured and seasoned to suit the political taste of those who sent it. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly they will ; but, if they do, the power of the monopoly will be gone. The conditions here proposed are very different from those imposed upon their subscribers by the existing Press Cable Service Association. Their subscribers are bound hand and foot. Not only are they placed in such a position  that if they wished to do so they could not form another association, but- if one were formed, they could not avail themselves of any news supplied by it, no matter how valuable or interesting. </para>

                        <para>- In private enterprise competition is certainly better than monopoly. No honorable senator on this side has ever contended otherwise. We have always contended, and still contend, that the only safe monopoly is a State monopoly. Under a State monopoly, the rights of the community are safeguarded, whereas under a private monopoly it is the interests of those who control it that are safeguarded, whilst the interests of the people are exploited. The Senate last year appointed a Select Committee to investigate this question. I had the honour to be  Chairman  of that Committee. We were regaled with some very interesting evidence, but we found that whenever an attempt is made to investigate the proceedings of a monopoly, a number of people who will give information in the privacy of one&#39;s office do not dare  to give the same information to a Select Committee or a Royal Commission. We were, however, fortunate enough to be able to examine some gentlemen who had been the victims of this cable monopoly, but who had gone out of the newspaper business. I am going to quote from the evidence of one of them, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Bell, who was, until lately, the proprietor of the <inline font-style="italic">Geelong Times.</inline> His evidence will be found on page 41 of the report. He stated that he was proprietor of the <inline font-style="italic">Geelong Times</inline> until June, 1909. The newspaper referred to is a daily morning journal. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> said - </para>

                <para>It has been stated before your Committee that the Association&#39;s service includes Inter-State items. That is perfectly correct ; but so paltry and insignificant were these items that a newspaper proprietor would hardly place value on them at all. In my own case I rarely used the matter supplied - </para>
                <para class="block">That is to say the monopoly brought forward as an excuse for their treatment of country newspapers that in addition to the cable service they were supplying InterState news, which this newspaper proprietor says he did not want at all - </para>
                <para>It my own case, I rarely used the matter supplied, and when I did so it was only done in order to fill up. Newspaper proprietors throughout the Commonwealth stand in the not very enviable position of being completely under the control of the- &#34; Combine,&#34; a capitalistic monopoly which has the power either to raise the price for the service to such an exorbitant extent, or refuse to sell the service ; and therefore it follows that the Association could crush out of existence any desired journal. It is no argument to say that the power has never been used. The fact still remains - it could be done. It exists. It puts a dangerous power in the hands of a monopoly such as the United Cable Service Company is. With such a possibility hanging over their heads it will be difficult for your Committee to get newspaper proprietors to give evidence for fear of reprisals. </para>
                <para>The witness was further examined as follows :  - </para>
                <para>Had you continued to be a newspaper proprietor should you have been willing to come forward ? - I should have hesitated. Perhaps I should have had to pay for it if I did. That is my opinion. </para>
                <para>You had personal knowledge of the matters to which you had been referring, while you were  proprietor of the newspaper? - I was owner, manager, and editor. The paper was under my own control for twenty-two years. </para>
                <para>One of the methods by which this monopoly exercises this power is contained ir. Article  9.  of its Articles of Association, which I will read - </para>

But, whilst the Association says, &#34; There shall be no competitors with us,&#34; they still reserve to themselves the right to bring in a few competitors to the <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> which is merely a subscriber to the service. I come to the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> that Article  9  has been repealed. That statement was made before the Select Committee by the  Chairman  of the Press Association. But, when I drew his attention, on his second appearance before tine Committee, to the fact that that agreement was still in existence, and was still a legal agreement, and to the further fact that, until that legal agreement was superseded by another legal agreement, Article  9  had the force of law, he could not deny that that was so. Whilst the Press Association&#39;s advocates say that they have waived this condition relating to the consent of all the parties, the fact remains that no other agreement has yet been reduced. I invite the honorable senator, if he knows of another agreement having been entered into, to let it see the light of day. As far as the Select Committee were aware, no other agreement had been brought into existence up to the time that the Committee presented its report. Vet the statement is made that the Association has waived the condition contained in Article  9.  There is no proof of that assertion; and when there is a legal agreement in existence, if I am a party to it, I shall want to see any alteration made in a legal way before I shall be satisfied. </para>

For instance, we publish every week the prices of the produce markets, sent by the State Agent-General. </para>
                <para>But you cannot go behind the back of the Association and obtain cables from another source? - No. When I was in South Africa during the war I had to rely entirely on letters.  1  could not send any cables. Similarly when I was in London during the last Imperial Conference - when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> represented the Commonwealth - I could not send cables.

                <para>And the newspapers which are the cause of this kind of thing are the journals that tell the public how anxious they are to strengthen the silken bonds of Empire, and to bring the outlying portions of it into close touch with each other. These are the gentlemen in whose leading articles one reads high-sounding phrases about &#34; the glorious Empire upon which the sun never sets.&#34; They have such a love for it that they will only permit news from one portion of the Empire to another to circulate through their own office ; and when a newspaper is so enterprising as to send a correspondent to a war, or to London during an important Conference, this company, composed largely of these platitudinarian Imperialists, say, &#34; No Imperialism unless we make a profit out of it.&#34; </para>

With him it was not a question of Imperialism, but purely a question of profit, and he made it plain that he was going to deal with it on strictly business lines. Of course, I am not dealing with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackinnon</inline> as an individual, but as manager of this Press Association. I could go on quoting case after case from the evidence given before the Select Committee - notwithstanding the difficulties that existed - showing that this Association, having the power, used it ; and the Committee reported to the Senate that, in their opinion, the condition of affairs was by no means satisfactory.

                        <para>- I am going to tell the honorable senator what there is to prevent them. First of all, you have the most powerful and most influential journals of Australia forming the Association itself. Secondly, those influential journals not in the Association are bound to the Association by contracts, all of which expire at different dates. The agreements do not expire together. By reason of that fact they are precluded from joining any other Association. The great bulk of the newspapers - so far as concerns the metropolitan cities - are precluded for the reason I have stated, and the others which might form the nucleus of a powerful organization, are precluded, because they are bound by contracts, the penalty for breaking which is upwards of &#163;1,000. </para>

                        <para>- The facts are, and the conditions set forth show, that any newspaper can enter an Association formed as the result of this subsidy ; there is no limit to any particular set of newspapers. The very newspapers constituting the old Association-the monopoly - can come into the new Association if they so desire. As the Labour newspapers are in a hopeless minority throughout Australia, the proposal cannot be for their benefit. There are some States in which there is no daily Labour newspaper; and daily newspapers are the only newspapers which use cables. &#39;I believe that the only States in which there are daily Labour newspapers are New South Wales, South Australia, and Tasmania. There is no daily Labour newspaper in Victoria, nor is there one in Queensland, nor in Western Australia. </para>

                        <para>- They have been trying to alter the conditions of affairs for the last fifteen years, but with very little success. Furthermore, I would point out that a large number of the newspapers that are outside the Association are bitterly opposed to the Labour party in politics. For instance, the witness from whose evidence I have quoted, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Bell, did not conduct a Labour newspaper. Nobody who has read the Geelong <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> will say that it is favorable <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the Labour party, lt has never been known as a Labour supporter. Take the Country Press Association of New South Wales, which serves the largest provincial newspapers in that State. Will honorable senators say that that Association is run by the Labour party? They know that the principal newspapers in the Provincial Press Association of New South Wales fought the Labour party bitterly at the last election, as they do at every election. Yet they have been very strenuously endeavouring to get some relief from the old Cable Association. Therefore, I say that this proposal is not intended by the Government for the purpose of subsidizing daily Labour newspapers. Secondly, I maintain that in this matter we are only doing what Canada has already done, and for a similar purpose. Canada found that its cabled news was coming from one source only, and that a tainted source. Its news came through New York, where it was coloured to suit American, and not British, ideas. Therefore, Canada, in order to assist in the development of its territory, and to secure more news of a better class, provided a subsidy almost on the lines which we now propose. </para>

                        <para>- They may have been. Now that the scale has been reduced the maximum of  &#163;200  could be charged. Surely Geelong is not going to be put down as a small provincial town. It is a matter of regret that this proposal is submitted in this form. The Senate is asked to carry a motion, and on a separate slip&#39; we find a number of conditions which we are. told will be embodied in any contract which may be made. I want to know whether, before it becomes effective, the contract will be submitted to Parliament for approval. If that course is not taken, it cannot be compared with the shipping subsidy contract to which the Minister alluded. There arc so many details in the motion, and in the conditions laid down on a separate paper, that I think, it would be very much better that the question should be discussed, if necessary, in the Parliament, instead of a secret contract being made between the Government and a Cable Association. I venture to say that the evidence which was collected by the Select Committee rather surprised the gentleman who moved for its appointment. I think it will be found that there is not sufficient evidence to show that the Government should take a new line of action, that we should go out of our way to subsidize a private trading concern, an association which will have the right to sell its goods, and, so far as I can see, is going to sell them in some cases under cost price, when the public will have to find the money to enable them to do so. </para>

                <para class="block">As regards the provincial press, evidence was given before the Select Committee that the Ballarat and Bendigo newspapers pay  &#163;200  a year. That is what is proposed in the new scheme. The smaller provincial newspapers are to be charged a maximum of  &#163;50  a year. The evidence given before the Select Committee, in half-a-dozen places, was that the usual charge to such newspapers was from  &#163;4  to  &#163;50,  according to the number of limes they published during the week. If the real desire is, as is stated in one document, to supply a greater amount of news to the city and provincial press, then I say that what we ought to do is first to render some assistance to the provincial press. A letter was addressed by the Select Committee to numerous newspapers throughout Australia, and a large number of replies were received. According to the replies, nine newspapers definitely complained of &#39;the transmission charges. A number of other newspapers complained of the cost of the cable service, and said it was necessary to have a reduction in the rates.

                        <para>- I took the fullest replies on the subject, and I hold that they are typical of the complaints made by a large number of newspapers. The honorable senator elicited evidence from one gentleman to the effect that the land charges were a very serious imposition on the country press. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shakespeare</inline> gave evidence that the land charges represented 65 per cent, of the cost of the cable and telegraphic service to the newspaper. Again, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Waddell,</inline> who is manager of the Victorian Country Press Co-operative Company, said, in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> - 899. Then I understand, from your point of view, the country press is not very keenly interested in the matter of cables, as first of all a great deal of the news cabled is not of interest to their readers. Is that so? - That is so. goo. Secondly, the cost of the cables <inline font-style="italic">per se</inline> is of less moment to the country press than the cost of transmission of the news in question over the land lines? - That is so. 901. Those are the two leading features that affect the wish for or against cable news in the country papers? - That is so. </para>

                        <para>- Surely these gentlemen knew their own business. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shakespeare,</inline> who is secretary of the New South Wales Country Press Association, gave this evidence in reply to myself - 1055. What proportion of the 1,000 provincial newspapers which you mentioned would be prepared to pay the land charges to get through cable <inline font-style="italic">messages</inline> from Sydney or wherever the news was landed in Australia? - They would all be prepared to have some look in at the service, some of them taking 100 and some 200 words; but very few would do so at present rates. . In New Zealand the charge is 6d. per 100 words. The result is that cable messages get into the smallest paper. It is 6d. for every twenty-five here, with is. 6d. for the first 100. That shows a vast difference. Our people have to take in a lot of State and Inter-State news, and the terminal charges is certainly a big handicap in the dissemination of information. </para>

                <para class="block">Previously 1 tried to ascertain from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shakespeare</inline> the proportion which the transmission charges bore to the agency charges - 102 1. Do you know of your own knowledge what provincial papers have to pay who take the cable news? - At the time I speak of I was conducting a newspaper at Condobolin, in this State, when Reuter sent along the letter to which I referred, asking me &#163;10 a year for a 200-words message once a week. Their present rate is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> to &#163;10 for a weekly service, up to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;52</inline> for a daily service to far inland papers. I have never known any paper in New South Wales to receive a separate cable service for <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> per annum. That may be the case in Victoria, but I do not think it is in New South Wales. Anyway, I could not get it. 1022. Does that service include Inter-State? - No. I make bold to say that no office receiving cables first hand with Inter-State charge, would supply the news for <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> a year. I think in the evidence they said they give them the published cables and Inter-State. That might be. No thanks to them. They are of no value. But I say I do not think any paper in Australasia receives cables first-hand at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> a year. 1023. What is your opinion of the charges from <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10</inline> to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;$2</inline> a year for the service they receive? - Our people do not grumble at them. At the present time I have a heap of letters from people in the country in reference to the questions submitted by the  Chairman  of this Committee. In every case they have asked me to attend to them. They did not care to answer the Committee&#39;s inquiry, through fear of being drawn into it. If they expressed any satisfaction whatever it might have the effect of increasing their charges. Their trouble is that two papers come out each morning with the same news. </para>
                <para class="block">The evidence which I propose to quote from other witnesses is to show that they complained not so much of the prices, for it is not seriously argued that the country press are complaining so much of the agency charges as of the heavy transmission charges. I pointed out just now that, under the proposed arrangement, the provincial press in small cities and towns, which, I take it, will include hamlets, are not to be charged more than &#163;50 a year, which is practically what they are now charged. Newspapers in large provincial cities are to be charged &#163;200 a year, and no Inter-State news is to be supplied for that sum. Before the Select Committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackinnon,</inline> manager of the Melbourne </para>
                <para>
                    <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline>
                    gave the following evidence in reply to the  Chairman  - 334. I notice that your Association charges the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Ballarat Courier</inline>
                    and the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Bendigo Independent &#163;200</inline>
                    per annum? - That is Reuter&#39;s arrangement.
                </para>
                <para class="block">In each State the principal agent of the Association supplies the daily press all over the State, and another body in Queensland, called the Provincial Press Agency, supplies all the smaller newspapers. Consequently, if the proprietor of a small provincial newspaper asks the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier</inline> to supply him with a cable and Inter-State service, he is told to go to the Provincial Press Agency. During the inquiry by the Select Committee, a case cropped up where a man stated that he- had been refused a cable  service by the Press Cable Association, and told to go to Reuter. He said that it was of no use for him to go there, because Reuter was only the agent of the Press Cable Association.  335. Under that agreement? - Yes. May I add, because it is important that this should be impressed upon the Committee, that that payment is not for the cable news only, but covers the whole of the Inter-State news supplied to those papers. 336. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins</inline> explained that? - But it is important to bring strongly before the Committee the fact thatReuter&#39;s are assisted to get those papers that information by having the whole of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> Inter-State news placed at their disposal. </para>
                <para class="block">Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> said that the InterState news was such rot that he did not feel inclined to publish it. That is, I think, very much a matter of opinion. </para>

As I have pointed out, so far as the actual charges proposed  are concerned, the provincial press and small newspapers will not get their news any cheaper under this proposal than they have been able to get it before, whilst the big citv dailies will be able to get something like 20 per cent, more news for 25 per cent, less money. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. We had a most interesting and amusing incident during the proceedings of the Select Committee; and this is one of the cases in connexion with which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shakespeare&#39;s</inline> evidence was not so valuable. He described how the Press Cable Association and big newspapers often missed news. He reminded us that there was a time when the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times</inline> of Sydney ran its own cable service. He told us perfectly seriously that cables upon most important events during the South African war appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times</inline> before they were published in any other newspaper in Australia. He mentioned the relief of Mafeking, the news of which he said appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times</inline> something like eight days before it appeared in any other Australian newspaper. He mentioned also the Boxer rising, and one or two other important events. From his statements it did appear that it was absolutely necessary to have a service a little faster than that supplied by the apparently effete and slow combination which is supposed to be a monopoly. </para>

For a number of years, and until I came here to attend this Parliament, I received regularly Canadian, Demerara, and South African papers, and I failed to find, with the exception of a large amount of news of only local interest, anything in the way of foreign news which could not be seen in the Australian newspapers.

                        <para>- It is-; but apparently it is going to cost us &#163;6,000. No serious evidence was given that , a new cable service, such as the Government propose to subsidize, would improve, to any appreciable extent, the quality of the news received in Australia. It has been said that, if nothing else would justify the proposed subsidy, it is the fact that we have a monopoly, and that it must be broken up. The allegation is made that the combine has blocked the establishment of newspapers. Hints were thrown out by members of the Select Committee, in the course of examination, that the establishment of additional newspapers was being blocked, but no direct evidence was given by any one to show that the establishment of a particular newspaper had been blocked by the combine. Some evidence, however, was given to show that the establishment of newspapers was blocked for quite other reasons than the operations of the combine. </para>

                <para class="block">I am merely expressing surprise to hear such a contention from him. I say, however, that there is no element of free bargaining in this proposal, because the Association, when it is formed - indeed, it i&#62; already- in existence - will not be compelled to give the subscribing newspapers more than one director. How much will one be able to do amongst so many on the controlling Board? The amount of &#34;voice&#34; which the provincial newspapers will have is not worth talking about. It is a farce to talk about restoring free bargaining. The conditions themselves are, in many respects, clumsy, and in so far as the subscribers are to have only one director, they are exceedingly illiberal. Amongst the conditions there is a provision that at least 6,000 words are to be transmitted in each week. No one who knows anything about a cable service will deny that, whilst during so important an event as the Coronation it may be necessary to cable many thousands of words, news may be slack in other weeks. But, under these conditions, the Association will be compelled to send out the 6.000 words per week, although they may have nothing but rubbish to send. During the Coronation week they may, however, want to send out  18,000  words, or more. I would urge the Government to give some elasticity to their conditions. &#39; The managers of the Association should not be tied down to send out so many words, week after week. I believe that the present combine gets out about  5,000  words per week. The average stated before the Select Committee was  4,950  words. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps they would not do so; but why tie the Association down to a particular route which may be less reliable and less speedy? A proposal was made before the Select Committee that the collection of news for this new Press Association should be made from Vancouver in order to avoid the use of the Atlantic cable. It was urged that from Vancouver we could collect news from Canada, United States, and Great Britain. Whether that proposal is in the mind of the independent Press Cable Association, I am not in a position to say; but I think the Government will be. wise if they make their contract a little more elastic in that respect. Why compel the Association to send their news over the Pacific cable, when the desire should be to enable them to work their system in the best manner possible? I do not want to see the new Association smashed up, and therefore I do not desire to have them hampered in their business. The argument has been used that the Pacific cable is a State-owned line, that the Commonwealth has subsidized it, and that therefore we ought to insist upon its use whenever we can. But when the profits or losses are divided amongst the contributing countries, it will be found that the  &#163;6.000&#39;  which we are to pay in three years will give back very little indeed to the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Why does the honorable senator say that? We know what proportion of the loss Australia has to bear, and we know that Canada and. the United Kingdom have to bear a larger share than we have. Consequently, they will receive the larger proportion of the subsidy which we pay to the new Press Cable Association. Another point about this proposal that has not been recognised is that relating to the regulation of the charges that are to be made to country newspapers. It is not recognised that if you have a central receiving office in Sydney, Western Australia and Queensland newspapers will have to pay additional land charges over and above those made to the New South Wales press. Unless the Association establishes agencies in the other States, that will occur ; and the moment it establishes such agencies, the possibility of difficulty arises. The objection that I have to the present cable system is that it leads to something like sub-letting in the various States. The <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Courier,</inline> I understand, acts for the present Cable Association in Queensland. The <inline font-style="italic">Courier</inline> lets out cable messages and Inter-State messages to the various Queensland newspapers. Whether there is a profit on this business. I do not know, but the probability is that the country newspapers would get their business done cheaper if they dealt directly with head-quarters. I, &#39;as a country newspaper proprietor, have had to deal with the combine through the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Courier.</inline> My only complaint has been - and it was a complaint mentioned by a gentleman who was my partner, though without my knowledge, and I first saw the statement when it came before the Press Cable Service Committee - that the enormous overland charges which had to be paid by country newspapers are most oppressive to them. Our experience has been that for every &#163;100 we paid in ordinary charges, we paid &#163;300 for overland transmission. Honorable senators can imagine how such charges hit small newspapers in the country districts. Personally, I do not -believe that the subsidy to be paid to the new Association will be enough to achieve the purpose in view. The amount is only  &#163;6,000,  spread over three years. Of course, I do not approve of the idea at all. Unlike Midshipman Easy&#39;s nurse, I do not believe in saying, &#34;lt is only a little one.&#34; If a raid is to be made on the Treasury, it might as well be a big raid as a little one. The size of the sin does not matter ; it is the fact of the sin itself which is objectionable. As far as I can see. the proposal of the Government has not been justified by any evidence collected by the Select Committee, which dealt with the question. The Committee itself did not collect evidence from all parts of Australia. They had no Western Australian, Queensland, South Australian, or Tasmanian evidence. </para>

                        <para>- I do not doubt that; but evidence from the newspapers in the other States was never obtained by the Committee. The proposal has been brought forward too hurriedly. The Government should have given more consideration to it. I am reminded that in 1906, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> McDonald, the member for Kennedy in Queensland, was asked on the election platform how he proposed to bring about the nationalization ot monopolies, and he said, &#34;The Government will start other industries which will run the monopolies out.&#34; Here we have evidence that the Government entertain the idea that by this proposal they are going to&#34; run out &#34; private enterprise in regard to newspapers. I venture to say that the people of the Commonwealth will not approve of such a proposal. </para>

                    <para>. - One can hardly understand why honorable senators opposite are objecting to this small expenditure of &#163;6,000. Surely they recognise the fact that Australia is already subsidizing private enterprise to a much larger degree. Wall it be contended for a moment that the amount which the Commonwealth receives for the transmission of newspaper messages over the land wires represents anything like the cost of sending those messages? Surely not. Therefore, the Australian taxpayer is already subsidizing newspapers which are receiving a large volume of telegraphic business from all parts of the country. Furthermore, some of the States subsidize newspapers to a greater or less extent in regard to the free carriage of the journals on the trains. A newspaper that gets a message of, say, 2,000 words from some other part of Australia gets that message at the rate of1s. per 100 words. Will any one contend that1s. per 100 represents the actual cost of sending a press message from one part of Australia to another? As a matter of fact, the taxpayers are contributing out of the revenue of every State a large amount of money in&#39; subsidizing newspapers. I am not objecting to that practice, but honorable senators opposite should object to it if they apply their own arguments. I say that it is a good thing to subsidize newspapers to this extent, if by so doing we can disseminate among the people of Australia the news they want, and which is useful to them. It has been contended that the existing Press Cable </para>

                <para class="block">Association is not a monopoly. But surely it must be admitted by candid people that it is. It may be a justifiable monopoly. No one has any right to say to the gentlemen forming the present Association, &#34; You are doing a very wrong thing.&#34; They have every right, as business men, to form a monopoly for such a purpose. It is a business arrangement. But it is a monopoly all the same, and as&#39; it is worked it prevents other newspapers from coming into existence. The effect of the agreement has been to prevent other newspapers from forming an association. A small monopoly has grown out of the bigger one. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> cited the evidence given by the manager, or the proprietor, of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> in Launceston - it seemed to be on the side of the present Association - in rebuttal of arguments used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> Probably he does not know that a small monopoly, called the Tasmanian Press Association, has grown out of the Press Cable Association. A certain number of newspaper proprietors there combined to form an association, and the effect of that small combination has been to prevent other newspapers from being started in the State, because they would not supply cable news to a new journal. So long as the Tasmanian Association was getting a certain quantity of news the original syndicate would not supply news to other newspapers. The direct effect of that arrangement was that, for a long time, a second daily newspaper, although the capital had been arranged for, was not started. Is there not a bigger question at issue than that of whether there is a monopoly in Australia, or whether that monopoly is doing something unfair? If we, in making this trifling grant of &#163;6,000, have only the semblance of a chance of getting a cable service, the people of Australia will have a service which will not be coloured, and which will give two sides of a question. Surely it will be money well spent. </para>

                        <para>- That is possible. I admit- that, apart from their political ideals, Australia has reason to be very proud of its magnificent journals. One has only to compare American and Australian newspapers to be satisfied on that point. I have heard visitors from America and Canada speak in the most glowing terms of Australian newspapers. Will any one seriously say that there is not a possibility of our getting a still better cable service than we have, if we grant this subsidy?&#39; I feel sure that honorable senators have often shaken their heads after they have read a large quantity of the cable news, and remarked, &#34; Why should we have to pay for this stuff? Of what interest is it to us to know that a duke&#39;s wife has run away with a coachman?&#34; Cable news of that description is frequently published.  The messages have been transmitted from the other side of the world, and the people have had to pay a share of the land charges.  </para>

Of what interest is it to Australian people? &#34; Seeing that we spend a large sum of public money in subsidizing the press in various parts of Australia, is it not advisable to grant this small subsidy of &#163;6,000, with a view to our obtaining a better cable service? I cannot understand the opposition which has been offered to the motion. I notice that honorable senators opposite have carefully refrained from acknowledging the fact that the general taxpayer now subsidizes newspapers, but when a straight-out proposal is made to subsidize an association to the tune of &#163;6,000, they immediately advance various objections, and the chief objection is that it is a proposal to use public money for the purpose of subsidizing private individuals, although that is admittedly being done. I think that some better reasons for their opposition to the motion should be advanced. </para>

                    <para>. - I am sorry to say that I cannot see my way to agree to the statements made from the other side. I deny that the Press Cable Association is a monopoly. If the public were suffering in any way, no doubt it could be called a monopoly, but, as a matter of fact, the public are very largely benefited by its existence. They get a far larger number of cablegrams in the press than they did formerly. Was it not absurd for a dozen or more newspapers to be continually obtaining from England practically identical cablegrams on their own account? The ridiculousness of that proceeding became apparent to the proprietors, and then they agreed to come to a sensible business understanding, with the result that the public get much more news from the Old Country then they used to receive. There is nothing to prevent any country newspapers that object to the Association, or feel aggrieved, from forming a syndicate, but it would have to pay exactly the same cable rates as does the present Association. In my opinion, the public have not suffered in consequence of the existence of the Press Cable Association. There is a large number of newspapers which could agree to combine. Some persons say that many of the cablegrams in the press are of no use or interest, but the newspapers are the best judges of that. I venture to think that if a new combination were started, the cablegrams would be no better. Perhaps they might be coloured in some other way. If a sensational murder occurred in England or elsewhere, or an elopement took place in high life, the fact would be cabled. The newspapers are keen judges of what the public read and like. I suppose that honorable senators are aware that without a cable service it is of little use to start a new paper. If press cablegrams from England cannot be obtained, a new paper has no chance of acquiring a circulation. When I was a director of a newspaper in Melbourne some years ago, we entered into an arrangement with one of the two associations. We had no trouble in making the arrangement, and I feel sure that at the present time no difficulty is experienced in that regard. </para>

I do not think that we are justified in throwing away &#163;6,000 in subsidizing a cable service. I believe that if a subsidy is granted I shall be able to rise in my place here, a year or two hence, if I am alive and well, and point out that the money has been absolutely wasted. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that every honorable senator is prepared to admit that the newspaper education of the people should be made as free as possible. We are brought face to face with the fact that persons who have attempted to establish newspapers in Australia have been refused a service of cable news obtained from England at rates which gave the Press Cable Association an advantage over the general public. I have some knowledge of this matter. I conducted negotiations with the syndicate to secure cables foc some newspapers which were to be established. Honorable senators are aware that the whole of the correspondence which passed between the newspapers for which I was negotiating and the syndicate has already appeared in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and it shows that there was an absolute refusal to supply the cables. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> told us that he was connected with a newspaper, and that there were two combines which came together. They came to an agreement, of which this was one of the provisions - </para>

                <para class="block">They could not exceed that amount. After the. Select Committee was appointed, the syndicate began to consider their position. They were then prepared to come to terms with those interested in newspapers that were being established in metropolitan areas. But although previous communications had been carried on with Mackinnon, Wilson, and Company, they were not manly enough to say that they would re-open those negotiations and come to terms with the persons interested. They took advantage of a subterfuge, induced Reuter to come into the matter, and say, &#34; We will let you come in at a price.&#34; The most powerful newspapers in the Commonwealth - the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline></para>

                    were contributing the  &#163;12,000  and farming out the service to newspapers in Western Australia, Tasmania, Queensland, and the country press all over the Commonwealth. Yet they had the impudence to ask a little struggling newspaper in Adelaide to pay  &#163;1,700  to come in. Is that not evidence of a monopoly ? Was not that a stand-and-deliver attitude, to take up? Thank God, those who were interested in that newspaper were independent of them.

                        <para>- During the last ten years I have seen many of the proprietors of country newspapers in connexion with this matter; but I was everywhere told that they dared not refuse to comply with the conditions which the syndicate&#39; laid down for them. Let me give an instance. The proprietors of a provincial newspaper in Victoria were sending one of their employes Home at a time when important cricket matches were being played in the Old Country. They made arrangements with him to wire results of the matches every night. They commenced the publication of this news, and then received a peremptory order &#34;from Melbourne to discontinue doing so, or all their other cable news would be stopped. Was not that a boycott? This, and many other cases, could be quoted to show that, if any country newspaper published information that was not supplied by the Wilson-Mackinnon syndicate their cable news, supplied by that body, would be stopped. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to say a word upon this matter, because of the persistent repetition of the statement that the proposed subsidy is intended to assist Labour journals, or proposed Labour journals. When the suggestion was made in the beginning of the debate I interjected that it was a malicious lie. I admit that the words I used are strong; but they are not too strong to properly stigmatize the statement to which I refer. The journals that have made this statement, as well as the politicians who have repeated it, know well the conditions on which the Government propose to grant this subsidy. They know that one of them 15 that any newspaper is to be entitled to avail itself of the news to be supplied, and, at the same time, to have the right to obtain news from any other source. That is of very great importance, because it is acknowledged that the combine, by its agreement, prevents subscribers from publishing news obtained from other sources. If one of the subscribers to the service published, from another source, news of the most important event possible, he would be fined. I am assured, on the best authority, that there is scarcely a newspaper subscribing to the combine that has not, at some time or. another, been carpeted and fined for the publication of important and interesting news from an outside source. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. They have to agree not to publish cable information from any other source. It is not a question of the cost or quality of news sent from the Old World ; but if they published the most valuable information from any other source, the subscribers to the service are liable to a severe penalty. I am informed that not long ago the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Courier</inline> was fined &#163;60 for inadvertently publishing a cable received from an outside source. The combine exists for the purpose of restricting the avenues through which news can be obtained, and that would be a sufficient reason to justify me in supporting legislation which would make it illegal for this body to have any such agreement or understanding with its subscribers. When it is asserted that it is proposed to establish one or more Labour newspapers, and that the proposed subsidy is intended for the express purpose of supplying them with news, I should like to say that only yesterday I obtained a statement from the independent Press Cable Association - and, by-the-bye, I should say that I have never seen one of the members of the Association, and have had only written communications with them- </para>

                        <para>- I am just going to give that information. This is the Association  which it has been said is to be subsidized in. order to assist the establishment of Labour newspapers. I wish to inform honorable senators that already the following newspapers, in addition to many others, receive their cable news through the independent Press Cable Association : - The Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun,</inline> Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Truth, Lismore Daily News, Grafton Argus, Grafton Examiner, Wagga Advertiser, Wagga Express,</inline> Albury <inline font-style="italic">Evening News, Bathurst Times, Orange Leader.</inline> These are all dailies, and, in addition to them, there are the following : - The <inline font-style="italic">Barrier Truth, Hobart Daily Post, Devonport Post,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide Herald.</inline> Of all these newspapers the <inline font-style="italic">Barrier Truth, Adelaide Herald,</inline> and, probably., the <inline font-style="italic">Hobart Daily Post,</inline> may be called Labour newspapers. Not one of the others can be so described ; and some are bitterly opposed to Labour politically. The <inline font-style="italic">Bathurst Times,</inline> which is a strongly anti-Labour newspaper, gets its cables from the independent Cable Association, whilst the <inline font-style="italic">Bathurst National Advocate,</inline> which is a Labour newspaper, gets its cables from the combine. This should show that the business of newspaper proprietors is not directed by political considerations only. In addition to the papers I have mentioned, over eighty small newspapers in New South Wales, bi-weeklies and tri-weeklies, get their cables from the independent Press Cable Association. </para>

                        <para>- I do not suppose that the party to which I belong, any more than myself, are much concerned about cruel statements ; but when deliberate lies are circulated, it is as well that an emphatic denial of them should be placed on record. I shall do my best to have Labour newspapers established wherever possible, and I say they should have the right to avail themselves of the news supplied by the independent Press Cable Association so long as they are not given special concessions I affirm that there is no attempt being made, direct or indirect, to give a preference in this matter to Labour newspapers. </para>

                        <para>- When the friends of honorable senators opposite make these statements, they should not squirm under the protest against them. We. are told that the subsidy proposed is too large, and Senator Chataway has said that it will not be sufficient for the purpose. I am not acquainted with the financial position of the independent Cable Association, if it is to be the body that will secure this money ; but I should like to point out that there is nothing to prevent the combine making an application for the subsidy, except that it would be obliged to abolish the rule under which its subscribers are prevented from publishing information obtained elsewhere. I cannot understand how any honorable senator can defend such a rule. It is perfectly fair that, by combination, men should make a greater profit than they could otherwise make, but no one can defend the special . provision in the syndicate&#39;s agreement to which I have referred as being in the interests of the country, nor can it be justified on commercial grounds. While, as individuals, we might be willing to become shareholders in an association of the kind, and reap all the profits possible from it, it  is  our duty, as senators, to regard it from the point of view of the interests of the people; and I say that it must be injurious to the community that any association should have a monopoly of the supply of news under such restrictive conditions. I am not competent to say whether the proposed subsidy of &#163;6,000 will be sufficient. </para>

                        <para>- It is proposed that on an average, 1,000 words a day shall be sent by the proposed new Association. It is suggested that about 800 words per day will come <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Vancouver, and 200 words from London. Assuming that 800 words a day come from Vancouver, the Pacific cable will receive a revenue of 3d.. per word, and on the 200 words per day from London it will receive 9d. per word. So that if a minimum of 1,000 words a day were sent there would be an income to the Pacific Cable Board of &#163;5,300, of which the Australian Government will get one-third, amounting roughly to &#163;1,770. It is, therefore, a very important point that this news service, carried across the Pacific cable, will really mean that the Australian Government will receive back with the one hand a large part of what it has paid away with the other. Under these circumstances, the amount that will actually be paid out of pocket by the Commonwealth Government will be very small indeed. This is, therefore, in my opinion, a very favorable opportunity for getting news from an independent:  source in the cheapest possible way. Since the independent cable service has been established, there have been occasions on which news has come from that source to the daily papers in Sydney hours sooner than the same news was transmitted by the rival service. </para>

                            GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;5.44&#93;.- I have listened with much attention to the debate, and must admit that I do not feel myself seized of the facts in connexion with the case at issue. I am aware that the Select Committee of the Senate, which sat last year, inquired into this matter al length. It was just as well that an opportunity should be presented of hearing what the members of that Committee had to say with reference to the subject, before the debate came to a conclusion. I am glad that
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline>
                            has spoken, and join in the regret that has been expressed that
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                            is not present. I am under the impression that he is well acquainted with the case, and could have assisted the Senate in arriving at a conclusion. We must have regard to the fact that a similar motion was carried in another place on the . voices. I am assured that the motion now under consideration will meet with similar treatment here. But, at the same time, we require to ascertain whether there is a real necessity for the course of action now proposed to be taken. I was not aware, until I listened to the debate this afternoon that an independent cable service had been established in the Commonwealth of the magnitude that appears to have been attained nor did I know that the new service had been so beneficial to the public . generally in relation to the supply of early news. But we have to ask ourselves whether it is necessary for the Government to subsidize any cable association whatever.

                            speech convinced me that there was no necessity for such action.

                        <para>- The question that suggests itself to my mind is whether the independent Association is able to make its enterprise pay. Is it carrying out its contracts in connexion with the supply of information in such a way as to justify us in subsidizing it? If the service is paying,&#34; and can be made to pay, there is surely no reason for granting a subsidy. It may be that the Association is not obtaining such information as the. Government consider should be supplied to the public. Perhaps it is not supplying such information as the Association known as the combine is giving. But, nevertheless, it has been made clear that it is possible to establish an independent service. It is alleged that the news supplied by the Australian Press Association is coloured, and that only a particular class of information is supplied. But when I turn to the report of the Select Committee of the Senate I find the following paragraph in the dissenting report signed by ex-Senator Pulsford - </para>

                <para class="block">It may be said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> was the only member of the Committee who signed that statement. But the majority report does not allege seriously that the information supplied by the Press Cable Association was garbled or inaccurate. We must recollect that ex-Senator Pulsford is a man of very strong independent views on a great number of questions. He is not inclined to depart from his opinions in the slightest degree. We can rely upon it that he would insist on saying what was in accordance with the evidence obtained. </para>

                        <para>- I do not suppose that any man would expect every item of information to beyond question. Newspapers have to publish items which they believe are acceptable to the majority of their readers. Any day I may see matter in the newspapers which I may not consider worth reading. But others may regard the same item as being of value. On the other hand, I may see items of news which I regard as . vital and important, whilst other people would not give a moment&#39;s attention to them. </para>

                        <para>- If the land line rates can be reduced, I shall be glad to see something done in that direction. That is one of the elements which cannot be eliminated by granting a subsidy to another independent Association. The contractor will, I presume, have to maintain a head office in one of the States, and from that place will be distributed the news which has been obtained by cable from England. Then the expense in connexion with the land lines will have to be met as at present, so that there can be no gain in that respect. According to the memorandum which has been circulated, the maximum annual charge to be made by the new Association in respect of metropolitan newspapers, &#34;is to range from &#163;300 up to &#163;1,000, in respect of newspapers in the chief provincial centres, &#163;200 ; and in respect of newspapers in minor cities and towns, . &#163;50. These charges are to be made in addition to the transmission charges incurred within the Commonwealth. That  is an expenditure which cannot be overlooked. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> alluded to the evidence given by a gentleman as to the expense to which he had been put in obtaining a cable service for a Geelong newspaper. He mentioned that the charge ran from &#163;128 when the cable rate was 3s. 6d. pei word, down to &#163;125 in 1900, when the rate had been reduced to is. 4d. a word ; but three years ago it was raised to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;J15&#62;</inline> when the cable rate was reduced to is. a word. Of course, that must have included the .charge on the land lines. It occurred to me at the time that the point to be ascertained was whether the information then given was greater than had been supplied previously. I find that in 1896 about 1,556 words were received per w&#39;eek, and in 1909 nearly 5,000 words. In 1.900, however, when the witness paid ^125, 2,920 words were supplied; but in 1906, the number had increased to 3,650 words. So that while the rate was increased in the last three years mentioned b; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> the amount of information furnished had been materially increased. That is a reply to the statement as to charging an increased amount to certain newspapers. We are also told that we should make the conditions easier, in order that other newspapers may be established. From the report of the Select Committee I find that, whereas the United Kingdom has 5.04 daily newspapers &#39; per 1,000,000 people, Australia has 15.82 daily newspapers. As regards weekly, bi-weekly, and ti i- weekly newspapers, I find that, whilst the United Kingdom has 59.95, Australia has 382.85. In other words, in each case Australia has more than three times as many newspapers as has the United Kingdom. </para>

                        <para>- I have not the information. There is no need to put the taxpayers to any expense in order to increase the number of newspapers, because we are already provided with a number of well-conducted newspapers representing all classes of opinion. Honorable senators must bear in mind that, without a subsidy from the State, existing newspapers established an independent cable service, finding the money themselves. That not only shows that the newspaper proprietors had some enterprise, but also that the people were prepared to support newspapers holding the views which were then expressed. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to take away any credit from the Labour party, who, I understand, are endeavouring to establish a daily newspaper in each metropolis. If they have the necessary enterprise and skill, and see a. probability of achieving success, no one can offer any objection; but I strongly object to particular newspapers being aided at the expense &#34;of the taxpayers. There are two independent sources from which cable news is obtained. If the motion be carried, it will bc for the Government to determine which Association they will subsidize. That is not, I contend, a position in which a Government should be placed. </para>

                        <para>- I dare say that it pays the Railways Commissioners to run those trains. I. have not a brief to defend the metropolitan dailies, or the country press, but I have a brief to defend the Treasury against improper raids. The small newspapers are charged exactly the same parcels rate ,as are the big newspapers. Instead of each providing a separate cable service, some years ago the established newspapers found it much cheaper to join together, and provide a common service. Nobody can possibly object to that as a business proposition. </para>

                        <para>- That was done under the agreement to which the parties had subscribed. . It should not be forgotten that newspapers are business propositions which are run not solely for the purpose of disseminating news, but also to earn money. When the newspapers entered into the combine, they were placed on an equal footing. Of course, the agreement provided that if any newspaper received special information, it was not to be confined to that newspaper, to the detriment of the others, but to be supplied to the various newspapers in the Association. I do not suppose that any business man would deny that that was an ordinary business precaution to take. Honorable senators have spoken of what has been done in Canada in regard to subsidizing the press. I understand that the chief reason for granting the subsidy there was that the major portion of the Canadian information came through American sources, and was tinged in such a way that it was unsatisfactory to Canadians, and misleading as to Great Britain. In our own case, we have no reason of that kind given to us. No such objection can be advanced against the information which is obtained through the Australian Press Association. It is not alleged that its cable information is so tainted that it is quite un-English, and misrepresents the actions and opinions of people at Home. We are all aware that the American press is not reliable, and that information which comes from foreign countries must be taken with a good many grains of salt. That objection is not, and cannot be, urged in our case. Honorable senators may say -that certain political information which is cabled to Australia is coloured ; that may, or may not, be true. <inline font-style="italic">But</inline> no honorable senator is in a position to say that information is supplied which absolutely misrepresents public opinion and public actions in Great Britain. </para>

There is no ground for complaining that the information which is sent to Australia misrepresents English opinion. That information is transmitted, I believe, by the Eastern cable. Is any provision to be made in the proposed arrangement with regard to the way in which information is to be collected at the other end of the world ? Is the English information which is to be obtained by the Pacific cable to be collated from New York newspapers or sources? It costs money to bring information from London to New York, and an enterprising syndicate might regard it as a bit of good business to save themselves that expense by supplying the information from New York, and then it might - become necessary to subsidize a service which would go in another direction in order that we should not be misled. </para>

He has to look to the same source as does the Australian Press Association, and although he may be doing well at present, I doubt very much whether he can command the same channels of information as can the longer established service. The information which is now cabled is that which the people of Australia as a whole want. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator could  get behind the scenes, he might find that there are Free Traders who are running Protectionist newspapers. Not long ago a man who had been running a rabid Free Trade newspaper told me that he was going on to a Protectionist newspaper. I remarked, &#34; How are you going to reconcile your opinions there?&#34; &#34;Oh,&#34; he said, &#34;it is a matter of business. If they will give me an engagement, I will accept it.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- The Attorney-General was one of the most rigid Free Traders in New South Wales in the old days when he was a member of the State Parliament, and he owed something to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid in that connexion. I say that there is a risk that the information supplied under this proposal may be tainted, but we are assured by honorable senators opposite that there is no fear of that. I ask what is the good of spending &#163;6,000 of the people&#39;s money to support a third organization when we have already two engaged in supplying news to the Commonwealth? It has been alleged that the establishment of the second has smartened up the people who are running the first. </para>

                <para class="block">I wish to ask whether it is proposed that the High Commissioner shall be under instructions as to the information he is to send. Is he to give information of a political character, or only information of a social or general character? Is this duty to be imposed upon him without any instructions at all ? I can well understand that if the High Commissioner, happening to be a Free Trader, were to send out information which honorable senators opposite would regard as telling in favour of Free Trade, there would at once be a howl that he was acting as a political partisan. If he sent out information of a Protectionist character, he woul.d probably be charged, as an old Free Trader, with having abandoned his principles. I say that would not be a fair position in which to put the High Commissioner. He should not be made a collector of information for the daily press of Australia. It is, of course, his duty to supply the Government with full information on matters of importance which will enable them to properly gauge public opinion in Great Britain. If he is to send out information for publication in the Australian press, we know that in the process of extension of the cable messages, that information may be coloured, and so the High Commissioner may be placed in a false position. Any gentleman who occupies the position in the future will, no doubt, have pronounced views upon public matters. They may not be in accord with the views of the Government of the day, and if the information he sends out to Australia under this proposal is given a political colour by the&#39; newspapers publishing it, he is liable to be charged with an intention to advance party political views. Very great care indeed should be observed in securing information in the way proposed Allowance must be made for the colouring of information according to one&#39;s views, and the views of the most honorable men may be unconsciously influenced by feeling and prejudice. All I can do in the circumstances is to protest against the proposal. It appears to me that no reason has been given for it, in view of the fact that there are already two press cable associations, and we have an opportunity of obtaining news from two independent stand-points. </para>

We are told that this proposal is not intended to subsidize Labour newspapers. I have my doubts about that. I rather think that we have here another example of &#34; the spoils to the victor.&#34; The Government have the numbers, and they mean to take advantage of the fact. When

Some reason had to be given for the appointment of a Committee to inquire into the doings of the Press Cable Association. The real reason for its appointment was that the Association would not let in a Labour daily newspaper proposed to be started in Adelaide. </para>

                        <para>- And others, if the honorable senator pleases. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> quoted correspondence that passed between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Opie.</inline> then, I think, connected with the <inline font-style="italic">Weekly Herald</inline> in Adelaide, and the proprietors of the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Register</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser,</inline> in which it was shown that the newspaper with which he was associated was practically refused admittance to the Association. That was the reason for the appointment of the Select Committee. It was never claimed that the Press Cable Association was a bad thing in itself, and if the Labour newspaper referred to had been admitted .to the Association; on what the proprietors considered favorable terms, we should never have heard a word about a Select Committee. The Association would not have been a monopoly, but a very good arrangement. I believe that the members of the Association made a tactical mistake, and blundered badly in not allowing the Labour newspaper in. Their mistake gave the parties applying an opportunity to pose as martyrs, and to gain a good deal of sympathy in connexion with the matter. I think they have admitted that it was a blunder, because they have since agreed to take in other newspapers. </para>

This proposal, I take it, is carrying that threat into effect. It is intended to break up the combine. I am a little doubtful that it has been proved that it is such an evil thing that it ought to be broken up.

                        <para>- Honorable senators on this side have a right to express their opinion. They are not gagged in any way. I do not know what the practice followed on the other side may be, but an expression of opinion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> for instance, does not bind me in any way. I want to discuss the question whether the evidence taken by the Select Committee justifies the objections stated in the report against the present system. The first witness called before the Committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> M. Collins, at that time general manager in Australasia of Reuter&#39;s Telegram Company, gave a good deal of evidence with regard to this matter. He stated that Reuter&#39;s, in London, receives cable messages from  261  principal agencies in all parts of the world. These , messages are made available to the representatives of the Australian Press Association in London, who select from them items of news which are transmitted by cable to Australia. In return, Reuter&#39;s receives Australian news, which is sent back to London. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins</inline> said that the Australian Press Association did not interfere in any way with the terms made by Reuter&#39;s, and that the net profit from the sale of cables to the country press was divided between Reuter&#39;s and the Association. </para>

                    <para>In fact, the interest taken by the country press in cable news, except on special occasions,  is  very small indeed. That will account for the extremely limited number of newspapers that we have on our roll. </para>

                <para class="block">Further on, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins</inline> told the Committee that out of 230 provincial newspapers in Victoria, only 41 contributed to the cable service. He showed that there was a reason for that, namely, the heavy wiring charges from Melbourne, which proved crushing to country newspapers. He- did not allege that the charges were unfair. But he stated that any country newspaper that took the full service would, unless it were within telephonic communication, be compelled to pay a very heavy sum indeed. In reply to the question, &#34; What is the daily average?&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins</inline> said - 1 had the number of inches occupied by a daily country newspaper here last week taken out, and dividing the year by fifty-two, we found that they paid for their cable and Inter-State service, embracing all parts of Australasia, 5s. per column. </para>

                    Chairman.  - That is, after the expander had been at work? - That is so, but let me say that it is legitimate expansion. The public at large are uninitiated, and you must have cables expanded in a proper and educative manner. You have frequently to refer to previous  incidents  in order to make the cables intelligible at  all.  The space I mentioned includes, not only the expanded telegrams, but also the Inter-State news. These figures were taken out haphazard during last week. You will find that a newspaper like the

                    <para>The operations of the association, as I have endeavoured to show, are simple and easily explainable. It has a London office, to which by well tested organization all the news of the Old World filters. Every available source of information is levied upon. Men whose special duty it is to know how to pack a column of news into a line, and whose sole object is to keep Australian readers properly abreast of the affairs of four continents, are employed to sift and strain this vast collection of interesting events and to bring them, free from all party bias, within a practicable compass for cable purposes. The messages, when they reach Australia, are distributed amongst the subscribing papers. The paper with a small circulation, and the paper with a large circulation, can alike present their readers every morning with the very latest authentic news regarding the principal events overseas at a minimum of cost and with a maximum of educational advantage to their readers. The association strives to provide its subscribers with the best possible cable service, and spares no justifiable expense in this respect. Witness the fact that the reporting of the matches played by the Australian Eleven this year alone cost &#163;2,500, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins</inline> pointed out. It has put an efficient cable service within the reach of every paper in Australia by combining to eliminate duplication of expense, in order that the money thus saved might be devoted to obtaining an ever-expanding service. When the cable rate was recently reduced, the association instantly increased its news and so gave the public the whole advantage of the lower charge. It is not a monopoly. It has no exclusive rights to anything save what it has fairly purchased. It is a commercial undertaking, run on business lines to cheapen cable news to Australian papers, and to give Australia a good cable service. </para>

He said that in the year 1896, the Press Cable Association received about 1,550 words per week, including cricket news, whilst in 1909, they received 4,950 words, including cricket news. Those figures seem to me to justify <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackinnon&#39;s</inline> statement that when the rates were reduced, the Association gave the public more news. They did not simply put the saving into their own pockets. They put the extra money into their newspapers by giving additional information to the public.

                    <para>But might not priority be arranged ? - I have never tried it on. I know we have none now. </para>

Was there any other method by which you could have got cables? - Absolutely none. 633. Did you make full inquiry? - I knew it before ; I knew very well there was only one cable agency in Australia. 634. Outside of that, you had no hope of getting cables? - No hope whatever; and in their contract they bound me not to publish any cablegrams from any other source. 635. What contract was that? - The contract I entered into under duress in the middle of 1S98. 636. Do you think you could get a copy of that contract? - This contract is amongst the documents for which I have sent to Menzies, and it may be in existence. 637. If you want a cable service, there is no question of competition? - Absolutely none. 63S. They can fix any terms they wish? - Yes, and the fact that they&#34; fixed &#163;150 a year for a little town in a remote part of Western Australia, and only ^200 for a paper like the <inline font-style="italic">Bendigo Advertiser,</inline> in a place with a population of 30,000 or 40,000, shows how they desired to take advantage of the unfortunate position in which i stood at the time. 639. How often was your paper published ? - livery day, but it was only a four-page paper, with a circulation of about 700 copies. 640. You found it impossible to pay the amount they asked? - Absolutely impossible, as shown in my letter, which I am glad <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackinnon</inline> read here. 658. <inline font-style="italic">By</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> - Is it not a fact that no newspaper in Australia could, under the conditions which prevail in Australia, afford to have a separate correspondent and service from England ? - It is absolutely impossible to compete with the Press Association. There are seven or eight newspapers in the combine, and it cost each a little over id. a word, whereas a single competitor would have to pay the full gd. 669. You think it is all nonsense to say that there is no combine or monopoly? - Not merely is there a monopoly, but absolutely the most dangerous monopoly in Australia. Other monopolies do not seek to get political power as this one does. 673. Is it not a fact that, owing to this Press Association, there is only one news-collecting agency in Australia for Great Britain? - Quite so. 674. Do you not think that we should have a better selection of news if there were a little competition? - I think that the public would profit by competition, and that the news would be more reliable ; one service would act as a check on the other. 675. Now we get only what the Association chooses to send? - What some individual in London chooses to send at the dictation of somebody at this end. 676. Is there any possibility that the messages may be coloured by party or partisan feeling? - I think it is a matter of common knowledge that they have been. 677. Whether that be so or not, they are absolutely dependent on this service? - Yes. 703. <inline font-style="italic">By</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> - Can you make any suggestion to the Committee whereby a larger supply of cables can be obtained, with a wider distribution throughout Australia? - Only after he manner <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sandford</inline> Fleming suggested ; that the matter should be taken up by the Imperial, the Australian, and the New Zealand </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>My own personal opinion is that in view of the high rates for press cable messages (gd. per word), plus considerable administration charges, no new cable service, likely to satisfy the reading public and national ideals, can be established without the aid of at least four metropolitan daily papers, in addition to the provincial press. The chance of obtaining this support is rendered difficult from the fact that contracts made by the present Press Cable Syndicate prohibit subscribers from publishing press cables from any other source on the one hand, while such contracts have been made with the papers for different periods and expire on different dates, thus precluding the possibility of several falling into line on a given date and supporting a rival service. The only hope of seeing a second service consummated lies in the Pacific Cable Board further reducing press rates, or in the Federal Government (1) following the precedent of the Canadian Government in subsidizing a second service until it becomes self-supporting, say for five years, or (2) of establishing a reciprocal service of its own between Great Britain and Australia, such as was suggested at the Melbourne conference of the Australasian Provincial Press Association last year, and of supplying the cables received here at a nominal cost to the press of Australasia. 970. <inline font-style="italic">By the</inline> Chairman.  - What is your opinion of the present methods of the Australian Press Association, which you describe as the &#34; syndicate &#34; ? - I think they are good business people, and are running their concern on business lines, and very satisfactorily. It is a commercial concern, and no one can fault it. 971. From what point of view is it satisfactory? - From their own point of view. It is necessary, while press cables are received as at present, that there should be an arrangement for a combination. I do not think any one newspaper could afford to pay gd. per word for cables and the heavy upkeep in London, and produce a service quite independent of any other service. It therefore means combination. The present syndicate have taken that in hand. Prior to the present arrangement, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackinnon</inline> pointed out in his evidence, there were two services, and in bringing it down to one they made their contracts so that no rival service could start against it. 972. And you consider that good from a commercial stand-point? - Yes; I consider it a sagacious arrangement.  1 think that most business men will agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shakespeare</inline> that it was a very sagacious arrangement, so far as those who were associated with the Press Cable Service were concerned. The following is a further quotation from this gentleman&#39;s evidence, the questioner being the  Chairman  - 1 02 1. Do you know of your own knowledge what provincial papers have to pay who take the cable news? - At the time I speak of I was conducting a newspaper at Condobolin, in this State, when Reuters sent along the letter to which I referred, asking me <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10</inline> a year for a 200-words message once a week. Their present rate is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> to &#163;10 for a weekly service, up to &#163;52 for a daily service to far inland papers. I have never known any paper in New South Wales to receive a separate cable service for &#163;4 per annum. That may be the case in Victoria, but I do not think it is in New South Wales. Anyway, I could not get it. 1022. Does that- service include Inter-State? - No. I make bold to say that no office receiving cables first hand with Inter-State charge, would supply the news for &#163;4 a year. I think in the evidence they said they give them the published cables and Inter-State. That might be. No thanks to them. They are of no value. But I say I do not think any paper in Australasia receives cables first-hand at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> a year. 1023. What is your opinion of the charges from &#163;10 to &#163;52 a year for the service they receive? - Our people do not grumble at them. 1063. <inline font-style="italic">By</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> - I understand tout real trouble is the quality of the news? - Yes. 1064. You think if a second agency were established you would get out a lot of news of quite a different character? - Yes, we know that we would. </para>

It has been said over and over again that the country press is altogether dissatisfied with the Press Cable Association.

There is proof that only twenty out of  800  country newspaper proprietors communicated with expressed any dissatisfaction with the service supplied by the Press Cable Association. That has not been contradicted in any way. With regard to the cost to country newspapers, it should be remembered that the cost of the cables is not their difficulty.  I  quoted the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins,</inline> to the effect that he offered the cables to the proprietor of one country newspaper for&#163;6 a year, and the man said that he could not take them at that ridiculous price because the wiring charges were so heavy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> in his dissent, makes a reference to this point.

                    <para>The most marked, and probably the most useful, point brought out by the inquiry, is that the cost of telegrams over Australian, wires is more burdensome to the country press, and probably to the metropolitan press as well, than the sum that would be charged for the supply of oversea cable messages. Evidence in this direction was given by representatives of both the Victorian and New South Wales Associations. Reuter&#39;s manager, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins,</inline> said - &#34; It is the heavy wiring charges which prove crushing to a country newspaper.&#34; He further said - &#34; Only yesterday I was waited upon by a gentleman from the country who has a bi-weekly newspaper. He was anxious to publish cables, which, so far, he has not been able to do. I quoted him the ridiculous sum of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> per year for the right of copying them, but he could not pay it on account of the wiring charges.&#34; </para>

                <para>That is the trouble with the country press. Tt is not the cost of the cables, but the cost of wiring them over the land lines.  I  do not say that the Commonwealth should charge less for this service, or is making a profit on the business; but  I  do say that we are already subsidizing the press with cheap telegrams, and are carrying their goods all over the country. Why should we not go a little further, and, instead of providing this subsidy of&#163;6,000, reduce the railway and telegraphic charges to the press, and thus give every newspaper throughout the Commonwealth the advantage? </para>

                        <para>- I have said that that is the object of the proposed subsidy. The information we have now shows that this business is open to competition. We have an independent cable service established that has already on its list three small metropolitan dailies, a number of outside dailies, and some eighty country newspapers. That is a very good start. I say, &#34; More power to the independent Association, and let them get more newspapers on their list.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- Let us have some little consistency on the other side. If this independent Press Cable Association has already made so good a beginning, and one or two daily newspapers have been started in the capital cities of the Commonwealth, and are doing business with them, there is no reason why they should not continue &#34; on their own.&#34; I suppose the motion will be carried notwithstanding all we can say, but when the Association is established and cables are being sent through it, I say that if the Commonwealth is going to pay part of the cost, we should have some voice as to the character of the news to be sent. Is the business of the Association that is to be subsidized to be carried out without control as to the character of the news to be supplied, and conducted in what we are led to believe is the unsatisfactory way in which the business of the Press Cable Association is conducted ? The only condition affecting the matter which the Government propose is that contained in the following paragraph </para>

                        <para>- There seems to be some silence on that point, but it would be very unfair that one Press Cable Association should be supplied with news by the High Commissioner, and another should not. We have before us a statement as to the charges to be made under the Government proposal. It is proposed that the maximum annual charge in respect of metropolitan newspapers shall be for Sydney and Melbourne, &#163;1,000; for Brisbane and Adelaide, &#163;750; for Perth, &#163;500; and for Hobart, &#163;300. Then the maximum annual charge in respect of newspapers in the chief provincial cities is to be &#163;200, and in respect of newspapers in minor cities and towns, &#163;50. If country newspaper proprietors cannot afford to pay as much as  &#163;6  per year for cable news, because of the heavy cost of wiring it over the land lines, how are they going to benefit under this proposal ? </para>

There is nothing in the evidence given before the Select Committee to show that the cable news published in the daily press of Australia is not of the first class. When press representatives of other countries were here on a recent occasion, I took advantage of the opportunity to ask several of them what they thought of the press of Australia. They were unanimously of opinion that it was of a very high order, that the news supplied was excellent, and the daily press a credit to the Commonwealth. </para>

I think that if fault were to be&#39; found with the Australian press, they would not have hesitated to say so. They were unanimous that the news supplied by the metropolitan newspapers of the Commonwealth was of a very high order, and they were conducted in a very creditable fashion indeed. Now we are asked to spend &#163;6,000 of the Commonwealth money on a Press Cable Association, without knowing what news it will supply, and, so far as the country press are concerned, they will not be one whit better off than they are under existing conditions. In all the circumstances, I do not feel inclined to vote for the motion. </para>

                        <para>- There is no monopoly in banking in Australia. What is a monopoly? A monopoly arises when one firm has the whole field in a particular business to itself, and no one else can enter it. One would imagine, from the remarks we have heard in this debate, that Reuter&#39;s Company is the only company that can send cablegrams. The speeches we have heard seem to me to prove only that the members of the Press Cable Association are persons who understand their business. Persons who make an agreement with them should keep it. They should find fault with the agreement before they become parties to it. </para>

                        <para>- I was dealing with the question of monopoly. When I was in England two years ago it was generally remarked that the news from Australia was very limited. I think that if the Government were to spend &#163;3,000 on cablegrams from Australia to Great Britain, it would be of more value than spending that sum on cablegrams from Home to this country. </para>

                        <para>- It is quite evident, from the information that has been placed before the House, that there are plenty of well-to-do newspapers which could afford Lo establish a second cable association if they chose. But they find it to be much better to work with the present Association, which is composed of men who understand their business. I am one of those who think that when an agreement has been made, it should be adhered to. I cannot, therefore, blame those newspapers which have joined the Press Cable Association for remaining loyal to it. We have evidence which goes to prove that the land charges are a great drawback to the country newspapers in respect to obtaining cable news. There is a great deal of force in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> has said in that respect. If we want to subsidize a cable service, let us reduce the land charges. I exceedingly regret that, through illness, my leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> is not present to give the benefit of his experience. He has been connected with newspaper enterprises for many years, and 1 am aware that he had to submit to a great deal of criticism from country journals in New South Wales on account of the stand he took up in the matter of telegrams. Of course, I recognise that the subsidy will be granted, because twenty-three senators can out-vote thirteen. I emphasize the point made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> that the new Association should not be restricted in the matter of sending out 6,000 words each week, lt should be permitted to send an average of 6,000 words per week throughout the year. There is much force in what has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> as to the information to be obtained from the High Commissioner&#39;s office. But is the High Commissioner to be expected to edit cablegrams? I trust that the Minister in charge will let us know what the intention of the Government is. </para>

                    <para>. - I regret to say that I differ entirely from the view which has been last expressed by my honorable friend who has just sat down, and also from those which have been enunciated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon.</inline> I have the most complete respect for both honorable senators, and I know that experience has dictated to them a course of policy which, in their opinion, will be conducive to the best interests of the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has just stated that Australia is already pretty well supplied with cable news, and that there is hardly any necessity for the establishment of a new organization. I totally differ from my honorable friend in respect to that point. On more than one occasion during the last eight or ten years, I have availed myself of opportunities to express my opinion on this subject. It is not a question of the present only. I am quite prepared to .take my part in voting upon the important proposal which has been submitted to us. But, at the same time, I dissent from the course adopted by the Government in bringing this subject before Parliament. In my opinion, it should not have been submitted in the form of a motion to be debated by both Houses; or, if there was a motion, it should have in terms signified the intention of the Government to follow it up with a legislative proposal. A Government could have attached to a Bill dealing with this subject rules and regulations relating to administration, which would receive the concurrence of both Houses of this Parliament. If the Go,vernment had been  Spared  to submit&#39;  a  project of this sort i&#34; the form of a Bill  they  would have bound, not merely the Go1vernment at present in power, but every Government that might succeed them. The measure would have had to be administered according to rules and regulations laid down  and  approved by Parliament. Such a Bill would, I venture to  say,  be accorded  the  cordial assent,  not  only of  the  Senate,  but  of the members of another place. But to ask us to adopt a motion for  a  resolution with regard to a subsidy operating for years is, in my view,  a  little too much. If I may, in the most friendly spirit, make a suggestion to my honorable friend, the Minister of Defence, I would ask him whether, having secured the adoption of this motion, he cannot see his way to ask his colleagues to bring down a Bill to give legislative sanction to what is intended. Such a course would, I believe, commend itself to honorable members in both Houses of the Legislature, and would, I think, command the support of every right-thinking man and woman in Australia. I do not ask my honorable friend to give an answer to me now, but I do ask him whether he will ask his colleagues to agree to the suggestion that I am now making. J desire that this project shall be embodied ir the statute-book, and that Parliament, and Parliament alone, as the representative of the people, shall express its will, which will be binding upon whatever Government may be in power. </para>

                        <para>- I think not. The proposed subsidy extends over a certain period, and it ls not at present proposed to give legislative sanction to it. I am not saying anything hostile to the Government ; I am simply speaking as one who knows the many difficulties that have confronted people who have endeavoured to establish newspapers, especially in the metropolitan centres. I am speaking from my own personal and professional knowledge of these difficulties. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. I do not go so far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> does.. I believe that they are not to be blamed! for being out for profit. Let me show how the cable service supplied to the Australian press strikes an intelligent foreigner. My honorable friends from New South Wales, may remember that a few years ago, there was in Sydney, representing the Republic of France, Monsieur Biard D&#39;Aunet. No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> knew him well. This gentleman, during the course of his residence in Australia, contributed many articles; of serious import and very great interest to the <inline font-style="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes.</inline> In the course of one of these articles, which have since been published in book form under the title <inline font-style="italic">L&#39;Aurore Australe,</inline> Monsieur D&#39;Aunet quoted an extract from <inline font-style="italic">Le Courrier Australian,</inline> which professed to represent the manner in which news was cabled to Australia. I will try to translate the passage, which I think will be amusing to the Senate - </para>

                    sometimes has singular ideas it is true. But still he understands the service. It is a tradition to send political news to Australia, and

It is said that they are  going to lay a cable across the Pacific for the express purpose of communicating with them direct. It is a magnificent idea. Ah ! gentlemen, they are a great people, whose inspirations are never anything but magnificent. And so this idea of being connected with the Philippines.

                        <para>- Nothing to speak of, I regret to say. I am quite with the honorable senator in that regard, and would vote a like sum to have authoritative information sent Home with regard to Australia, but, at present, we have no direct means of verifying the information which is supplied to us, or determining whether it can be relied upon. What is it ? Anybody who has been at Home will tell you that the bulk of the news sent to Australia is what is picked out of the morning newspapers. Two or three persons are employed day by day in a particular place in sending news, not only to Australia, but also to Shanghai, New York, indeed, all over the world, and professedly picking out the news that will suit the different localities to which it is sent. Can we expect to get anything like an adequate service in that way? When it is attempted on the part of any proprietary or any enterprising persons in Australia to establish the machinery which would secure something like adequate news for Australia, they are always faced with the difficulty of the cablegrams. It has been argued that it would be far better for us if we, as a partner in the Pacific Cable, were to take the responsibility of charging the persons who receive this news a much lower rate than they are now compelled to pay. I originally agreed with that idea, and I now want to tell honorable senators what my experience has been. About three or four years ago, the Senate, on my initiative as a Minister, abolished the super charge in connexion with cable news between Tasmania and the mainland, and placed that State, in the matter of telegraphy, in the same position as any of the mainland States amongst themselves. The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company&#39;s charge of Jd. per word was taken off. When I was addressing myself to that subject, amongst other matters T mentioned that it would conduce to a greater knowledge as between the States, and that Tasmania would be better known in Victoria and other States, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> What was the result ? I venture to say that to-day not 100 additional words are sent per week between press and press over the cable, if we are to judge by what we see in the newspapers. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> while here, picks up the Melbourne newspapers, morning after morning, as I do, lie might as well look for a needle in a haystack as for news from Tasmania. He will, I &#39; am sure, agree with me that we, on the other side of the Straits, do not appear to get a ha&#39;porth more news from the mainland. Who is getting the benefit of the reduction in the rate? Somebody is getting it, but it is not the public. Primarily and honorably, that proposition came before this Parliament, and was adopted, and the Commonwealth saddled itself with a responsibility to such an extent that it even went into the High Court and fought the company. The High Court decided against the Commonwealth, and made it pay the difference in charges up to the termination of the contract. I shall not say whether I think that the High Court decided the case rightly or wrongly, but I have my own opinion about the matter. Did the public get any benefit out of the reduction? I venture to say that, from a press point of view, they have not got a penny&#39;s value out of it. </para>

                        <para>- No. It only costs us  is.  minimum to telegraph to Tasmania., whereas previously it cost is. 8d. A private individual does get that benefit, and&#39; we are placed on a fair equality with the other States. But it was urged that by the abolition of that .charge Tasmania would hear more about the mainland States through its press, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> I venture to say that the prophecy has never been fulfilled. For that reason I cannot accede to the suggestion that a reduction of the rates over the Pacific cable, or even over the land lines, would bring about the results which we all wish to see achieved. Per head of population, Australia hasa larger number of newspapers than has, perhaps, any other country in the world. Our newspapers are naturally desirous of giving, not only the latest news of local significance and interest, but also the greatest amount of news which they can afford of what is taking place throughout the world. And everything that we- can reasonably and legitimately do which will conduce to that end I think we should do. The abolition, or a reduction, of the existing rates will not, I think, conduce to that end. I am prepared, therefore, to support any proposal which the Government may bring forward tor subsidizing any service which will supply to any and every class of newspaper a certain amount of news per week, or per month, or per quarter, or per half-year. At the same time, I would ask the Minister of Defence to impress upon his colleagues that, whatever may be done in that regard, should be done not on a resolution which simply gives <inline font-style="italic">carte blanche</inline> to the Government for the time being, but under legislative authority, supported, so far as the public are concerned, by proper rules and regulations made thereunder. </para>

                    <para>. - In this motion, we are asked to approve of a subsidy of .&#163;6,000 spread over a period of three years. I do not believe it is necessary to take that sum out of the Treasury for the purpose announced by the Minister of Defence. He said that we do not get the right sort of news. Now, who is to be the judge of that question - the Minister of Defence, or the members of the Senate, or those who pay to have the news sent here? It is all very well for honorable senators to say that it is not the right sort of news that we get. From their stand-point, it may not be the right sort of news, but I take it that it is the right sort in the opinion of those who have to pay for its transmission. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator only pays when he buys a newspaper. Under this agreement, the Commonwealth would have to pay whether the news was what we wanted or not. Already there is another combine in the field. The Press Cable Association cannot be very powerful. In Australia there are about  800  newspapers, and surely they can get news without going cap in hand to the proprietor of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline> That has been the gist of the cry raised here this evening. In various States I have asked the proprietors and the editors of newspapers why they did not give more news from the other States, and in several States I have asked why they did not give more Queensland news. &#34; The people of this State,&#34; I was told, &#34; are not interested in what takes place in another State. We give the news which we think our readers require. There is another newspaper next door, and if we are not giving the news which they require, they can subscribe to it, and perhaps get different news. But we find that the news which we get and pay for is that which the people require.&#34; In these circumstances, I think it is hardly fair to ask the public to subscribe &#163;6,000 to subsidize a cable news service. I do not intend to dwell too long on the subject, because it has been fairly threshed out. My attention was arrested by the following paragraph, on page  15  of the report : - </para>

                <para>The replies received from the country press of South Australia and Western Australia were too meagre to form an opinion upon them. On this information a report was drawn up by the majority of  the Select Committee. I speak subject to correction, but I believe that some members of the Committee resigned from it on the ground that the whole proceedings were a farce. Senators Chataway and Pulsford dissented from the report of the majority of the Committee. I do not blame <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> for submitting this motion, because when he moved for the Select Committee he was in favour of such a proposal, and now that he is in a position to do so he is justified in bringing it forward, and I suppose he will carry it. I do not know what other honorable senators propose to do, but I certainly object to putting money on the Estimates to give effect to this motion. I should object just as strongly if the proposal were submitted in the form of a Bill. I believe that we have a very fair cable service under existing conditions which supplies us with news from all parts of the world. There are two associations engaged in the business now, and no matter how many more were established we should not get better or more cable news. The people engaged in sending cable news to Australia are better judges of what is of interest to the people of Australia than are many honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>- When there are  800  newspapers in the Commonwealth, and half-a-dozen constitute the Press Cable Association, the rest ought to be able to keep it going without a Government subsidy. What I think is necessary is that we should have more and better information sent from this side to the people in the Old Land. We want the people of the Old Country to be informed as to the resources of Australia in order that they may be induced by every legitimate means to come here and help to populate this country. I should support the Government in spending money in that way. People at Home should be informed that Australia is a good country to come to. I believe it -is the best country under the sun to-day. If the Government came forward with a motion to give a subsidy for the transmission of accurate information about Australia to the Old Country and other countries of the world, they would meet with very little opposition from this side. But they are submitting a proposal which will not benefit Australia. I do not believe that the news sent to Australia from the Old Country under this proposal will advance the Commonwealth in any way. I do not wish to take up further time, because I know honorable senators opposite are tired of hearing this matter discussed. They have such a majority that they need not speak, and when the division bell rings they know that the whole thing will be over. It is impossible for half-a-dozen honorable senators on this side to convince them. We had experience the other day of the fact that they will not be convinced. I do not see why we should vote for a subsidy of &#163;6,000 to be expended over three years in supplying news to Australia. What we really require is to send Home news from Australia which will induce people to come here with capital. If the Government bring forward a motion to subsidize a service to that end I shall be prepared to support it, but I cannot support the motion now before the Senate. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall reply first of all to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> that this proposal should have been introduced in the form of a Bill. The honorable senator is aware that even if that course had been followed there are many things connected with the proposal which would have to be provided for by regulation, and the decision as to details would remain practically in the hands of the Government of the day. They could frame fresh regulations in which they might alter the basis on which the subsidy would be given. So that to all intents and purposes the carrying of this motion, accompanied as it is by a statement of the conditions upon which the offer will be advertised, will give all the safeguards which would have been provided if the course the honorable senator has suggested had been adopted. I am prepared to bring his representation under the notice nf my honorable colleague who introduced this proposal, although I may say that the desirability of submitting the proposal in the form of a Bill was considered. </para>

                        <para>- If, as the result of experience, it is found advisable to continue the subsidy, that might be a good argument for making statutory provision for it. I am rather afraid that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> in the company he is at present keeping, is becoming tainted with the Toryism for which the present Opposition are noted. We find him repeating some of the well-known Tory adages, to the effect that the way proposed is not the right way to do what is proposed, and that this is not the right time to do it. These are the usual Tory objections to every reform. </para>

They followed this course in connexion with the mail contract, as I mentioned in my opening remarks. I remind the honorable senator also that the mail contract dealt with a large number of subjects other than the carriage of mails ; such, for instance, as the regulation of the temperature in the refrigerating chambers of the mail steamers, the carriage and handling of produce, and the time the vessels should remain in different ports. We might then have urged the <inline font-style="italic">very</inline> objections which the honorable senator has urged against this motion. We might have said that because there were all those provisions in the contract, they should be embodied in a Statute. </para>

                        <para>- We have submitted conditions in this case in just the way in which the conditions of the temporary mail contract were submitted. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> that a similar course was followed in connexion with the proposed contract with Burns, Philp and Company to develop trade with the South Sea Islands. The Government of which the honorable senator was a member said it was desirable to develop trade with the South Sea Islands, and they asked Parliament to sanction their entering into an agreement to subsidize Burns, Philp and Company. That agreement provided -for all sorts of things, such as that the crews should be white crews, and that the vessels should call at certain places. </para>

                        <para>- This will represent a contract with a distinct party, when any agreement under it is entered into. The only difference in this case is that we state what the conditions will be before we accept otters from anybody. Having stated those conditions, and having obtained the sanction of Parliament to enter into a contract under this motion, if it is carried we shall be prepared to receive offers from all who are willing to comply with the conditions. If there is any difference between this proposal, and those submitted by the Government of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> was a member, it is a very slight one. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> and other honorable senators opposite have expressed themselves as being very anxious about the country press. The best reflex of the opinion of the country press is given by the fact that it was the country press of New South Wales that organized the independent Press Cable Association. It was the newspapers that, we were told, did not want a cable service, and were not prepared to pay for one, that took the leading part in establishing the independent Press Cable Association. </para>

                            attempted to make capital out of the fact that the maximum charge we propose for the provincial press is similar to the charge made bv the Press Cable Association. The honorable senator omitted to mention that what we propose is a maximum charge, and may be lowered according to the service supplied. But the chief complaint of the country press is this - and this is where the burden of the charge of the land lines comes in - that when a struggling country newspaper proprietor goes to the existing Association which is bringing out 5,000 words per week, he is told that he must take all their cables. They will not give him a selection. If the country newspaper proprietors say that they want only cables about the war, cricket cables, or special cables of any kind, they are told that they will not be given a selection of news, and that if they want a selection they must pay an agent in the office of the Association to make the selection, and telegraph the news to them. No country newspaper can afford to maintain as extensive a cable service as can a big metropolitan daily newspaper. The country press have complained of the land charges, because they have had to pay them on a lot of cable messages that are of not use to them, because they are of no interest to their readers.

That is the statement they made, but let us look at what it meant to the Commonwealth. I ask honorable senators to consider how much of the 9d. per word on press cable messages the Commonwealth, and the Pacific Cable Board receive. This is the way in which the amount is divided. Out of the gd. the Commonwealth receives id., the Pacific Cable Board 2d., the Canadian line id., and the Atlantic Fine. the private enterprise line, though not of the same length as the State-owned Pacific cable, and doing, I suppose, ten times the business, receives 5d. </para>

                        <para>- No, that is just what I am coming to. It is because it does not pay that the Commonwealth is called upon to subsidize it to the extent of &#163;19,000 per annum of the money of the taxpayers of Australia. The taxpayers of the Commonwealth are called upon to pay this subsidy in order to secure this reduction. In whose interests do honorable senators think? In the interests of the Mackinnon syndicate. The late Government carried their proposal, which meant a subsidy to the Mackinnon syndicate, and did honorable senators opposite r-aise any objection. We did not hear a word of protest from them. When it was a question of subsidizing that particular syndicate, and not of throwing the concession open to competition, honorable senators opposite were dumb, and they accepted the proposal to subsidize the Mackinnon syndicate to the extent of 3d. per word without the slightest protest. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator was sitting behind the Government which fixed the matter up. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick, then Postmaster-General, arranged it without making a single stipulation that the Cable Company, which made the reduction, was to get any of the business. He called on the Pacific Cable Board to make this present to the press - because it was only on press messages, and not on private business messages, that the reduction was made. Then the Eastern Extension Company duly followed suit. Consequently this concession to the press of Australia meant a present of 3d per word, not only on the business they sent across the Pacific Cable, but on every press message coming to Australia. Taking <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackinnon&#39;s</inline> own figures as given on page 83 of the Commission&#39;s report - but which do not tally with the Post Office figures - we find that before the reduction in the charge the Association was receiving 4,477 words per week, which, at 9d. per word - the old charge - works out at &#163;167 17s. per week. Since the reduction the Association has, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> says, increased the number of words cabled to Australia. They are now getting about one-third of their messages, or even less than that, over the Pacific cable, but the bulk of them still come over the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s cable. The Association is now receiving, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackinnon</inline> - or was receiving when he made this statement - 5,280 words per week, which cost, at fid. word, &#163;132 per week. That represents, a saving of , &#163;35 per week. But if we take into consideration that the Association has increased the number of words by 803 per week on an average, and multiply that figure by 6d. per word, it shows that the Association is paying &#163;20 per week for the additional number of words that it is now bringing to Australia. That means that the <inline font-style="italic">Association is now</inline> pocketing a clear profit of &#163;15 per week as the result of the reduction. And these are the generous people who tell us through the mouth of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> that they have passed on the whole benefit of the reduction to the people of Australia, and that they themselves have not benefited at all ! I point out to the Senate that the reduction in rates has benefited the Association, according to the figures of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackinnon</inline> himself, to the extent of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;15</inline> per week; whilst if we take <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Scott&#39;s figures, upon which the Committee based their statement, the profit works out at very much more than that. Personally, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Scott is a much safer guide to follow. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> says that the news cabled to Australia is thoroughly reliable. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackinnon</inline> was giving his evidence before the Select Committee, he was presented with a sample of garbled news, and asked for an explanation. I will read it to the Senate as it was published in two newspapers appearing in the same city.

                        <para>- I advise the honorable senator to look up the file of the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> at about the time of the last elections. He will then see whether it supported the Labour party. There are one or two other points upon which I had intended to comment, but 1 shall be brief. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator -</inline> Gould objects to the subsidy proposed, but says nothing about the subsidy granted by the Government of which he was an earnest supporter - a subsidy which, as I have pointed out, has enabled them to effect a great saving, and to secure increased profit to the extent of  &#163;15  per week. The honorable senator &#39; never made any objection to that subsidy - a subsidy of which no other Association was offered a share, and which it was not possible for any other Association to have a chance to share. The granting of it was, I say again, altogether wrong ; because it meant using the State cable merely as a lever to put money into private pockets, and, incidentally, to squeeze the Eastern Extension Company. I have before me various journals from which I intended to quote; but I shall forbear, the hour, being rather late. One &#39; is the <inline font-style="italic">Colonial Office Journal,</inline> edited by W. H. Mercer. I should like my honorable friends opposite to look at it. It contains an article on the question of press cables, and it is interesting to observe how our situation in this respect strikes a writer in what is certainly not a Labour journal. Indeed, this is rather a journal of a Conservative type. The writer speaks with some scorn of the fact that Australia is content to get its news from one source only. I also have before me the <inline font-style="italic">National Review,</inline> for May,  1910.  This is by no means a Labour organ. A writer in it sets out the facts regarding our cable service, and says - </para>

                        <para>. - I cannot see why we should adjourn at this hour. As there is still so much business to proceed with, we ought to sit a little longer. The Government have many notices on the business-paper. Why cannot we do something more to-night? </para>

                            <para>- I protest against coming from the other side of the continent to sit only a few hours. Of course, the Government must conduct the business in their own way ; but if we do not proceed with measures more expeditiously, the result will be that, at the tail end of the session, there will either be a slaughter of innocents, or Bills will be passed very hurriedly. </para>
