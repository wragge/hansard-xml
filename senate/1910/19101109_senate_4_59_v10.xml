                            drew attention to the recent visit of Portuguese officers from Timor to Port Darwin for the purpose of receiving information by cable from Lisbon, in connexion with the late revolution, and its effect upon Timor administration. As the Portuguese Government was prepared to install wireless'apparatus at Dilli, in Timor, with a view of getting communication between Timor and Port Darwin, would the Government place the matter before the Postmaster-General, with a view to the Commonwealth Government encouraging the Dilli authorities by establishing a station at Port Darwin to work in conjunction with them? Such a development would also become an important unit in the Australian system, which had already been suggested by the Commonwealth Government.

                    <para>. - I suggest to the Vice-President of the Executive Council that he should alter the date for which the call of the Senate is to lie fixed. I think I am correct in saying that it has been our practice that calls of the Senate should take place early in the sitting. There is just a possibility that if the call be fixed for Tuesday next, some honorable senators, by reason of accidents such as occasionally happen, may be prevented from arriving in time. It would make no difference to the ultimate passage of the Bills in question if the call were fixed for Thursday instead of Tuesday. I suggest to the Minister that he should try to meet what appear to be the necessities of the case by amending his motion. </para>

                        <para>. - I have had an opportunity since last evening of looking through this Bill, which appears to me to be one of the type that may be described as formal machinery measures. It is necessary to meet circumstances which arise in consequence of the transference of the Northern Territory to the control of the Commonwealth. There is only one clause in it which, so far as I can judge, requires " the attention of the Senate. For the rest the Bill seems to be on all-fours with similar measures that we have passed providing for the administration of Papua. It is an interim measure, and must be succeeded be- fore very long by a Bill providing, amongst other things, for the representation of the Northern Territory in the Federal Parliament. At present it does not appear to rae that the Bill needs any very close discussion. </para>

                        <para>. - I agree almost entirely with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> statement, that this is merely a machinery Bill, and its passing is necessarily precedent to the taking over of the Territory by the Commonwealth. I wish, however, to call attention to what strikes me as a very- peculiar provision in the Bill. There can be no question that whether the Northern Territory is or is not taken over from South Australia by the Commonwealth, it is part and parcel of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is included in the territory coming under our internal management. Yet in this Bill, deliberately and of malice aforethought one might say, the administration of the affairs of the Northern Territory are placel in the hands of the Minister of External Affairs. </para>

Is that honorable gentleman's Department not competent to take over the management of the affairs of the Northern Territory ? </para>

The principle on which this policy is based is a pernicious . one, and it should not be tolerated by the Senate. It is a distinct slur upon the Department of Home Affairs and upon the Northern Territory itself that its administration should be placed in the hands of the Minister of External Affairs. </para>

I repeat that the proposal contained in this Bill, that the Northern Territory should be administered by the Minister of External Affairs is a distinct slur upon the Department of Home Affairs and upon the Northern Territory itself, which is being treated as if it were outside the Commonwealth, and not to be regarded as it ought to be as part and parcel of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - 1  recognise that this is merely a machinery Bill, but' perhaps the Minister in charge of it will give us a little information in speaking in reply to the debate, with respect to a provision in the measure which we were promised would be brought forward when the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill was before the Senate. To make what I have to say quite- clear, I had better quote clause 9, containing the provision to which I refer. It reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">I recognise that it is essential to have such a clause in the Bill, but I have failed to notice any provision applying to lands held under leasehold, and I think the method of dealing with such lands is likely to be of far greater importance to the present generation of Australians than is the method proposed for dealing with freehold lands. I understand that the best portions of the Northern Territory, comprising about two-thirds of that part of it which is fit for settlement, are held under leaseholds with a tenure running up to forty-two years. </para>

I should like to ask the Minister in charge of the Bill whether the provision relating to Ordinances might not be liberalized. Could not a new departure be made. The Bill provides that Ordinances for the Northern Territory shall be laid before both Houses of this Parliament within a certain time, and either House may pass a motion disallowing them. Would it not be as well to give Parliament the power to amend any such Ordinances. </para>

Honorable senators who were strongly opposed to the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill feel that that measure was introduced and passed purely in the interests of South Australia. It may be only a coincidence that the Minister of External Affairs should be selected to administer the Northern Territory, but we might have expected that its administration would be left in the hands of the Minister of Home Affairs. </para>

                            <para>- Even before we take it over it is a part of the Commonwealth, held under exactly the same conditions as any other part of Australia. The administration of all matters within the Commonwealth is in the hands of the Minister of Home Affairs. We have been told that the Minister of External Affairs administers the affairs of Papua. Of course he does, because Papua is not a portion of the Commonwealth. Queensland at one time administered the affairs of Papua, but upon the establishment of Federation we took over its administration as a Territory outside of Australia, and it naturally came under the External Affairs Department. The Northern Territory is in an entirely different position, and will remain a portion of the Commonwealth whether it is taken over under the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill or not. There may be nothing in the proposal to place it under the administration of the Minister of External Affairs, but it looks decidedly suspicious, and as if the intention were that it should be administered for the benefit of South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- South Australia in the control of the Northern Territory had a burden to bear which she could not carry any longer. She has been trying for years to get rid of that burden. I do not intend now to debate matters which were debated when we were considering the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, but we know that the statements of responsible Ministers in South Australia were quoted to show that South Australia desired to be rid of this burden. This Parliament has by a majority decided that the Commonwealth, should take over the Northern Territory. But before we pass this Bill it is right that those who are objecting to the transfer of the Northern Territory under the conditions proposed should say what they think of the business. I am disposed to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> and I honestly and firmly believe that this is not a pure accident, but a premeditated affair, and that the Government have deliberately handed the administration of the Northern Territory to an honorable gentleman who is a representative of the State from which we are taking the Territory. It will be impossible for that honorable gentleman, in the administration of the Northern Territory, not to be influenced by his natural feeling of concern for the interests of his own State. </para>

                            <para>- South Australians are just as narrow-minded as are any other people, and this especially applies to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story,</inline> who has always voted for anything which he considered to be in the interests of South Australia, whether it was in the interests of the Commonwealth or not. But this is a matter which affects the whole of Australia, and I say that the administration of the Northern Territory ought to have been placed in the hands of the Minister of Home Affairs. Had that been done, I would not have uttered a word upon this Bill. Of course, I recognise that my objections will be disregarded. The Government have a majority behind them. Nevertheless, it is my duty to enter my protest against any action of theirs which I conceive to be wrong. I believe that their action in placing the Northern Territory under the control of the Minister of External Affairs is a wrong one, and I should divide the Senate upon it if there were any prospect of doing so with success. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators do not seem to like this criticism. I have read in history that when some tyrant wished to execute a rebel against his authority, and when that rebel endeavoured to justify his action at the place of execution, the drums were immediately ordered to be sounded. We are having a repetition of those tactics this afternoon. When honorable senators rise to protest against one of the provisions of this Bill, they are met  With.  angry interjections from various quarters of the chamber. I agree with Senators Givens and Sayers that something altogether wrong is being done in connexion with the measure,  lt  seeks to place the control of the Northern Territory, which is a portion of the Commonwealth, in the hands of the Minister of External Affairs. What does the word "external" mean? I would refer honorable senators to the definition given by the dictionary, and if they will not accept <inline font-style="italic">Webster</inline> as an authority upon the matter, perhaps they will accept <inline font-style="italic">Johnson.</inline> I find that the word " external " means " foreign." Now is the Northern Territory foreign to Australia? It also means "exterior, lying outside." Does the Northern Territory lie outside the Commonwealth? Is it exterior to Australia? The dictionary also defines "external " as " belonging to the world of outside things." Does the Northern Territory belong to the world of outside things? Certainly not. Therefore, one would naturally expect its control to be placed in the hands of the Minister of Home Affairs. What would honorable senators say if the control of the Postal. Department were placed in the hands of the Minister of Defence, or if the control of the Defence Department were placed in the hands of the Minister of Home Affairs ? We have a Minister specially to control the Defence Department, another to administer the Department of Home Affairs, another to control the Postal Department, and still another to deal with External Affairs. " External," I repeat, relates to things outside of the Commonwealth. Every interest outside the boundaries of the Commonwealth is properly placed in the hands of the Minister of External Affairs. But in this .Bill an exception has been made to the general rule, and I think that - honorable senators may be excused if they wish to discover the reason why that exception has been made. </para>

                            <para>- To talk like that is to talk the sheerest humbug. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council is so ignorant that he cannot perceive the mighty difference which exists between Tasmania and Papua, he ought not to occupy his present position. If he does perceive it, and endeavours to mislead others, he is unfit to hold his office. It seems to me that there is something behind this Bill which requires to be brought to the surface. The Minister of External Affairs happens to be a South Australian representative, and a gentleman who interested himself very keenly in pushing through the Shylock bargain which was made between that State and the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that he is not a good man for South Australia. But I doubt very much whether we shall get from him administration of the Northern Territory in the interests of the Commonwealth. We know that he is a very keen South Australian, and that he is much interested in giving effect to the policy of that State in regard to the Northern Territory. We know that he is anxious that the policy of development which is pursued in the Territory shall be in the interests principally of South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- In his absence? That is the purest " tommyrot " that I have heard uttered here. If honorable senators may only refer to persons when the latter are present in this chamber, they will not have a word to say about anybody. I am not talking of the Minister of External Affairs as an individual, but as a Minister. I say that the control of the Northern Territory has been wrongly placed in the hands of the Minister of External Affairs. As the present occupant of that office is a South Australian, who took an active part in pushing through the agreement for the transfer of the Territory to the Commonwealth, I hold that his administration of that Territory must be viewed by the Senate with a certain amount of suspicion. We require a man to control the Northern Territory who will administer it in the interests of the Commonwealth. But so far as we can judge from his past performances, the present Minister of External Affairs will take good care that anything which may be done there will be done primarily in the interests of South Australia. The Commonwealth will come in as a very bad second. </para>

We know that as much corruption has been carried on in political life in Australia as in any other circle, and what has occurred in the past may probably take place in the future. If those who believe in purity of government think that there is any fault or flaw in any proposed act of administration, they are quite right in pointing it out. </para>

                            <para>- That is all right. We know perfectly well what will happen if any acts of the Minister of External Affairs are brought up here. The honorable senator will be one to follow the Government and see the Minister through,, and more than a dozen will follow his example. There is not the remotest chance of carrying, anything against a Minister of the Crown whatever party is in power ; no matter whether it be the Labour party, the Conservative party, or the Liberal party. The majority of any party will see its Ministers through, no matter what they do, even if there is the grossest corruption. I have seen it myself, and I believe that I shall see more of it in the future. </para>

There is land leased for the period of forty-two years, which can only be resumed by the Crown on the payment of very swingeing compensation to the lessees, and it is leased for the price of a mere song. If the land were held in  freehold, the Commonwealth could immediately by land value taxation proceed to get the community-created increment, and deal in that way with monopoly. By means of taxation, it could compel the land to be placed to its best use. While I favour leasehold, my attitude depends on the kind of leasehold. This clause leaves it in the hands of the administrator to say what kind of leasehold there shall be - whether land shall be leased for forty-two years with revaluation at the end of every seven, ten, or twenty years. It is to be leasehold of some kind or other. If it is not leasehold of the right kind, then we shall give a monopoly of a much worse character than would be possible under a system of freehold. I think that the Government ought to explain clearly what sort of tenure it is intended shall prevail in the Northern Territory. </para></speech>

                        <para>. - As it seems quite probable that a vote may be taken on some of the provisions of the measure in Committee, I desire to make a few remarks so that the Minister may clear up some doubts in my mind when he is replying. I have a perfectly open mind on the only question which honorable senators are at variance, and that is as to whether the administration of the Northern Territory should be placed under the External Affairs Department or the Home Affairs Department. Although that is a matter of detail, still it involves a very big principle. It did seem to me peculiar that clause  3  should define " the Minister " to mean the Minister of External Affairs, seeing that geographically the Territory is within the boundaries of what is known as the Commonwealth. But, on consideration, it appears to me possible _ that the reason for this palpable anomaly is that, whereas the Home Affairs Department has quite enough work for one Ministerial head to look after, the External Affairs Department has not nearly so much work to do. In my view, the Minister of Home Affairs has just as much work as any Minister can reasonably be expected to control. At the same time, I think it must be palpable to everybody that the work attached to the Ministerial head of the External Affairs Department has not attained to anything like the same dimensions. The Home Affairs Department has to carry out all the arrangements in connexion with Federal elections. At a very early period it will be called on to carry out the works in connexion with the Federal Capital and the Federal Territory. It has also been indicated, although in a shadowy way, that in the very near future the Commonwealth will engage in the work of railway construction. I take it that the control of such work must be placed under the Home Affairs Department. </para>

                            <para>- As Commonwealth works they must be under the control of the Home Affairs Department, unless a railway department is created with a Ministerial head. All the works in connexion with the Postmaster-General's Department, defence buildings- in fact, all works required for the Commonwealth - are carried out by the Home Affairs Department. I think that honorable senators will admit that they have more to do with the Home Affairs Department than with other Departments, and that it is a very busy one compared with the External Affairs Department. It may be that, in his reply, the Vice-President of the Executive Council will enlighten the Senate on the point I have submitted. Another point was brought into the discussion when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> interjected, " After all, is the Northern Territory a portion of the Commonwealth in the same sense as are the six States?" Of course, anything in connexion with the States must necessarily be under the control of the Home Affairs Department. But just as Papua is a Territory taken over by the Commonwealth, so is the Northern Territory a Territory to be taken over by recent legislation, but not yet within the Commonwealth in the same sense as are the six component States. That consideration may have influenced Ministers in placing the administration of the Northern Territory under the control of the External Affairs Department, though on looking at the matter hurriedly, one would immediately say that it ought not to be under that control. I think that the discussion has clearly gone outside the real question at issue. I do not think that we ought to consider who is the Minister for the moment controlling the External Affairs Department. It does not seem right to assume that, because its present head happens to be a South Australian, he will administer its affairs in a manner which, will benefit South Australia to the detriment of other portions of the Commonwealth. It has been stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> and supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> that the underlying reason for placing what they called this obvious anomaly in the Bill is the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor</inline> has the interests of South Australia more at heart that those of any other portion of the Commonwealth, and that he will administer the Northern Territory, if it is possible to do so, in the interests of that State. </para>

                        <para>- - The difficulties that have arisen might be overcome by inserting in the definition clause of the Bill words making clear what we mean by " External Affairs." I take it that "External Affairs," as we use the term, means the affairs of any portion of Australia that is not directly represented in the Federal Parliament. In that sense, the Northern Territory is external. T quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'</inline> Keefe that too much responsibility has been thrust on the Minister of Home Affairs. But I differ from other honorable senators who have spoken in this respect. I am convinced that the present Minister of External Affairs is the best Minister in the Government to take charge of the Northern Territory. I have such a high regard for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor</inline> that I believe we could not have a more capable administrator within the ranks of the present Government. </para>

The point in the Bill to which I object is of a different character. I strongly object to the principle of disposing of Crown lands entirely on the leasehold system. If we wish the Northern Territory to go ahead, we must grant a freehold tenure to settlers. Otherwise we shall not induce any number or persons to go up to develop the Territory. There is a good deal of reason for putting the Territory under the control of the Department of External Affairs; but I repeat ti at we should insert a definition to the effect that " External Affairs," as here used, means a portion of the Commonwealth not at present represented directly in the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I withdraw the word " contemptible," and will say that the statements made in respect to the character of the Minister who will have charge of this Territory, because he happens to represent an electorate in an adjoining State are, to say the very least of it, statements that ought not to have been uttered by men of intelligence. What would be thought of any senator who rose in his place and said that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth was unfitted to handle the finances because he happened to represent Wide Bay, and. therefore, might handle- the national funds in such a way as to shovel out a surplus for the advantage of his own State in  preference to other States ? Surely we have not reached a stage in our national history when it is necessary to suspect a Minister of wishing to control affairs in the interest of his own electorate or State rather than in the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole. If that kind of thing is to be permitted, I am under the impression that our debates will soon drop to a very low and scandalous level. The three senators from Queensland who have spoken have endeavoured to show how logical it will be to place the Northern Territory under the control of the Minister of External Affairs. I, however, accept the position as laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe.</inline> The reasons that he gave appeal to me, as they must, I think, have appealed to other honorable senators who know anything about the Commonwealth Departments. If the arguments of the three Queensland senators are to have weight, the Government might take into consideration the advisableness of economizing by placing under the Minister o£ Home Affairs the control of all Departments affecting matters within the Commonwealth. That, indeed, would be the logical position for our Queensland friends to take up. If honorable senators contend that because the Northern Territory is a part of the Commonwealth it should be administered by the Minister of Home Affairs, and not by the Minister of External Affairs, they might just as reasonably contend that post-offices, defence matters, and Customs, which all deal with internal affairs, should be administered by the Home Affairs Department, and not by the Departments which at present have charge of them. To be logical, they should contend that all our Departments should be divided between two Ministers, the Minister of Home Affairs, and the Minister of External Affairs. The only reason why representatives of Queensland object to the administration of the Northern Territory being placed in the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor,</inline> or any other Minister of External Affairs, is that they are absolutely opposed, from a Queensland stand-point, to the Commonwealth having anything to do with the Northern Territory at all. </para>

                        <para>. - The debate, so far, has been practically confined to the provisions dealing with the Minister who is to administer the affairs of the Northern Territory. 1 wish, to say that I do not agree with the remarks which have been made by Senators' Stewart and Givens upon this point. First of all, as was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe,</inline> the Minister of External Affairs might be changed at any time. Tn fact, the honorable senator practically prophesied that we may look for a change before very long. We should remember that the Northern Territory, on its transfer to the Commonwealth, will be a Territory of the Commonwealth in very much the same way as Papua is a Territory of the Commonwealth ; and we know that that Territory is administered by the Department of External Affairs. The Northern Territory will be outside what might be called the parliamentary ambit of the Commonwealth. Its affairs will be external, and not home affairs, so far as the Commonwealth Parliament is concerned, until it is given special representation and brought into the Commonwealth through its representatives in this Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> suggested that we ought to define the meaning of "The Minister of External Affairs." I do not think that that is necessary; but perhaps the honorable senator would be satisfied with the definition involved in the advertisement of a Sydney tailor, who claims that he is a " Minister of External Affairs." I think the term has been sufficiently defined in our Statutes already. If we are to discuss the individuals who are administering our public Departments, I have no hesitation in saying that I would infinitely prefer- that the administration of the Northern Territory should be in the hands of the Honorable E. L. Batchelor than that it should be in tne hands of a Minister who has declared that he is nothing but a " rubber stamp '' stranded on a lone, sad, sea shore. </para>

                    <para>SenatorO'  Keefe. -  In fairness to the Minister of Home Affairs, the honorable senator should admit that that gentleman said that all Ministers were rubber stamps. </para>

                            <para>- He could only speak for himself; and his statement was denied by the Acting Prime Minister on behalf of the rest of his colleagues. I should like to clearly understand whether we are to regard this measure as merely something to carry us over until the early part of next session. Unless that be so, we may be doing a certain amount of injustice to the white residents of the Northern Territory. When we established Papua as a Territory of the Commonwealth, there were  300  or  400  white people in that Territory, and we promptly gave them a Constitution of a sort. We provided for a Lieutenant-Governor, an Administrator, and an Executive Council. In this Bill, we make no provision of that kind. </para>

But I think it is necessary to remind honorable senators that, in dealing with Papua in  1905,  we provided for an Executive Council and a Legislative Council, and the white people of the Territory were given a certain amount of representation. ' They were provided with a form of local government ; and I venture to say that the Northern Territory can never be satisfactorily governed until it is given some form of local government. </para>

                            <para>- Just so; then they are probably very mixed. The Commonwealth Statistician knows nothing about the number of people in the Northern Territory, because no census has been taken there since  1901.  The white population is about what I have said, or it was three or four years ago, when we visited the Northern Territory, and saw the annual report of the Government Resident. What I am pointing out now is that, short as is the time at the disposal of the Government during this session, it would have been possible for them to have included in this measure two or three clauses which were included in the measure dealing with Papua, giving the residents of the Northern Territory some form of local government, which would have furnished us with some guide as to the views of the white residents of the Territory when we come to deal with a permanent measure to provide for its government. I support this Bill, and I wish distinctly to dissociate myself from the view expressed that it is possible that the Territory would be administered by the present Minister of External Affairs, with any de- </para>

                        (Western Australia) [3.55J. - I have only a few words to say on the second reading of this Bill. I regret that any heat has been engendered, and that, because of certain remarks made by

                        <para>- Yes; I am going to verify my statement. I have a return here which was supplied to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> only yesterday afternoon, and from that return I find that the number of Europeans is : males, 973 ; females, 301 ; total, 1,274. Chinese: males, 1,439; females, 36; total, 1,475. Japanese: males, 126; females, 7 ; total, 133. Others : males, 108; females, 24; total, 132. I was speaking of Europeans and Mongolians,  and  my interjection was justified by these figures. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway,</inline> who was of the party that visited the Northern Territory, knows that the return of the population  in  1905, always excluding aborigines, was 3,374- From 1905 to 1909 there has been a decrease  of  360. In dealing with this matter  of  the population, we refer, not  to  the aborigines, but to those of all nationalities who have come into the Territory from outside.. It is evident, from the figures I have quoted, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> was wrong  in  his statement as  to  the white population of the Northern Territory. I intend, in Committee, to oppose clause 3, placing the administration of the Northern Territory under the Department  of  External Affairs. I think  it  is a mistake to place the administration qf the Northern Territory under the Department cf External Affairs, and I do not care who the Minister may be, or of what Government he happens to be a member. In placing the Territory under the control of the Minister of External Affairs, we are saying that it is a foreign Territory. </para>

                            <para>- I am not concerned as to the person who happens to be Minister of External Affairs. I think that the Northern Territory ought to be administered by the Department of Home Affairs, and I care not who the Minister of that Department may be. I am not speaking personally, but departmentally. I have as much confidence in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor</inline> as I have in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O'Malley. I recognise the ability of both. But we are now dealing with a measure for the government of the Northern Territory, and this Bill may establish a precedent. A day may come when neither <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor</inline> nor <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O'Malley will occupy the positions they now hold. I hope that day is far distant; but I think a mistake will be made if we impose upon the Minister of External Affairs the responsibility of administering the Northern Territory when we take it over. </para>

                        <para>. - If no other honorable senator has any desire to ventilate his opinion in connexion with, this Bill. I have a few words to say in reply. I wish to congratulate the people of the Commonwealth upon having such champions of their rights and privileges as Senators Givens, Stewart, and Sayers. They are three stalwart champions who, when they are acting together, imagine that they possess all the wisdom, all the obstinacy, all the courage, and all the suspicion of the people of Australia. What a combination ! </para>

                            <para>- We shall see how much difference there really is between those two places, and how much the honorable senator knows about it. I think that the people of Australia ought to rest secure in the knowledge that, in the three honorable senators whom I have mentioned, they have men who, even when the shadow of suspicion is cast upon the fair fame of the Commonwealth, are prepared to sacrifice both the time and the privileges of this Parliament in the defence of their rights. They remind me of the three Roman heroes who, kept the bridge. I do not know which of them should really be characterized as Horatius. They remind me of the three Roman heroes, with this difference : that when the bridge fell, the three noble Romans fell into the generous waters of the Tiber, whereas, when the bridge falls on the present occasion, these stalwart champions in the Senate will fall into the sink of suspicion and into the mud of aspersion. </para>

                            <para>- I can only judge of what will occur from what has occurred. There are other honorable senators who, without attempting to cast blame either on the Government or on the Minister who under this Bill will control the affairs of the Northern Territory, are nevertheless labouring under a misapprehension. As a matter of fact, the duties allocated to the different Departments under the Commonwealth Government, were not allocated by the present Ministry. The last attempt made in that direction was made as far back as  1906.  It was then decided that one of the duties of the Minister of External Affairs should be to administer the Territories of the Commonwealth which are not States of the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> knows all about everything, but he does not pay very much attention when he might receive instruction. When he has had his own say he either absents himself from the chamber, or he remains indifferent when any information is being imparted. He is not indifferent to it when he is speaking, but he is very insulting. Now there are two kinds of territories for which provision is made in the Constitution. They are distinct from each other, and have varying possibilities. One class of territory has to be ceded to the Commonwealth for the purposes of the Federal Capital. That is a class of territory which can never become a State of the Commonwealth. In other words, it can never receive anything more than the powers of municipal government. But provision is also made in the Constitution for another class of territory - and this marks the difference between what is "foreign" and what is "external." Some honorable senators imagine that everything external must necessarily be foreign. But that is not so. There may be no foreign matter on the outside of an eggshell, but there may be external matter all the same. In the same manner there may be a great deal of land even on the Continent of Australia which is external to Australia so far as the Commonwealth Parliament is concerned. The second class of territory contemplated under the Constitution is territory which may be ceded to the Commonwealth by any State, and which then becomes a Territory of the Commonwealth. :Such a Territory is Papua, which has always been administered by the Minister of External Affairs. The Northern Territory is about to be ceded to the Commonwealth by South Australia, and consequently it will become a Territory of the Commonwealth. Under the arrangement which was made in 1906 that. Territory will be administered by the Minister of External Affairs, whoever he may be, and quite irrespective of whether he is a Queenslander, a Tasmanian, a New South Welshman, or a Western Australian. The Northern Territory will automatically pass under the control of the Department of External Affairs. No consideration has been given by the Cabinet to the question of which Minister shall control it when it becomes a Territory of the Commonwealth. The question has never been raised. I ask honorable senators who took such a lively interest in the discussion upon the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, whether they noticed the Department by whose instructions that Bill was drafted? "Was it not the Department of External Affairs? But to please Senators Stewart, Givens, and Sayers, forsooth, the Government must rearrange the whole of its administrative offices. </para>

                            <para>- It would be a good job in the opinion of some persons if Ministers were wiped out of existence, and a new set elected by the Caucus. But that result is not going to be brought about in the immediate future. Nothing has been done in- an underhand way, or in a way which warrants any honorable senator, who is an honorable senator, in casting aspersions upon the Government. Nothing has been done which was not done four years ago when the administrative functions of the various Ministers were arranged. I fail to understand why some honorable senators make such a fuss about the Northern Territory being administered by the Minister of External Affairs. It is a coincidence, and nothing more, that that Minister is a South Australian. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator was in this Parliament when the title of the Minister of Home Affairs first saw the light of day, but he raised no objection. If he was not prepared to take that step at the christening feast he should for ever hold his peace. The Minister of Home Affairs has charge of all the machinery in connexion with the electoral matters, the census, and public works. It is wrong to imagine that he has anything more to do than has the Minister of External Affairs. Every Minister has his own work to do, and although the work of some Ministers may not come so prominently before Parliament as does that of the Minister of Home Affairs, or Postmaster-General, or Minister of Defence, that is no reason why any one should imagine that any Department has not a sufficient amount of work to justify its existence. The Department of Home Affairs is not the one under which the administration of a measure of this description should come. I have already stated that the Federal Capital territory can never become a State, but any territories which are external to the Commonwealth can ultimately become States. I hope that Senators Stewart, Sayers, and Givens will live long enough to see, not only the Northern Territory, but also Papua, become States. </para>

                            <para>- The same automatic course has been pursued. There never was a question as to which Department the administration of either Territory ought to come under. I have already stated that it was the ultimate aim of the Government to provide a Constitution for the Northern Territory, and that this was only a Bill providing for its immediate administration. I explained that as soon as certain inquiries had been concluded and the Government had the necessary time at their disposal, the question of granting a Constitution would be gone into, that Parliament would have an opportunity of expressing its will, and that the people of the Territory would then be placed in exactly the same position as the people of Papua. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has. suggested an amendment to clause 3. But I would point out that, as the functions of the Minister of External Affairs are already clearly defined, there is no necessity for dealing now with them. As regards striking out the clause, it contains only two definitions, one defining " the Minister " and the other defining " the Territory." If the two definitions were struck out it would not, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said, make a bit of difference. It would still be the Northern Territory and administered by the Minister of External Affairs. There is no necessity to interfere with the clause. It says what it means - nothing more and nothing less. As regards clause 9, some objections have been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> with respect to improvements which have never been made. I hope that there is no citizen of Australia or of a Territory under the Commonwealth who would be prepared to put in a claim for improvements which have not been made. I am quite sure that if he did he would not get anything. </para>

                            <para>- If the improvements are on the land they must have been paid for or made by the present lessee. In the former case he has as much right to payment for them as he had to pay the previous leaseholder. There appears to be a doubt in the minds of some honorable senators regarding clause 9, which deals with leasehold as well as . with freehold. They seem to forget that if any person has an interest in a leasehold, and it is required for public purposes, it can be acquired under the Lands Acquisition Act, just as if it were a freehold. There ought to be no doubt in the mind of any one with respect to that provision. The only other debatable clause is the one dealing with Crown lands. It provides that no Crown lands shall be sold except in pursuance of some contract entered into before the commencement of the Act. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> and others, who ought to be on this side, will raise no objection to that. </para>

Under this temporary measure, every member of this Parliament will have a voice with respect to any Ordinance which is passed for the Northern Territory. Every Ordinance will be duly laid on the table of each House; and if it is disproved by either House, I am sure that no Government would neglect to take into consideration its wishes by submitting a new Ordinance. I think that I have referred to nearly all the objections which have been raised. </para>

                        <para>. - I suggest to the Minister the advisability of omitting this clause. He has agreed with an interjection of mine that it is like a chip in porridge, that if it is struck out, the Northern Territory will, by virtue of the proclamation, pass under the control of the External Affairs Department. That being so, I think it is not only undesirable, but might be injurious, to retain the provision. Suppose that at a later period it was desired to re-adjust the duties of the various Departments. The Government would then have to bring down a Bill to amend this measure. At present, it is sufficient for the Cabinet to make a fresh allotment of the duties of the various Departments if it thinks fit, and by the issue of another proclamation, to give effect to the re-adjustment. I would remind the Minister that the measure dealing with the Federal Territory contains no provision setting out the Department under whose control it shall pass. The reason for the absence of the provision is obvious. It is all covered by the proclamation. It is undesirable to adopt one procedure in regard to one Bill and another procedure in regard to a similar measure. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) [4.28].- While it is perfectly true that there is no necessity to define " the Minister," still, " the Territory " appears in several provisions, and there ought to be a definition of the term. It will not be enough to enact in clause 4 that the Governor-General may appoint an administrator for " the Territory." It will be necessary to make it clear that it refers to the Northern Territory. Again, in clause 12, the term " the Territory " appears in two places.

                            <para>- I think that if an alteration is to be made, it ought to be confined to the elimination of the definition of " the Minister." If that definition be retained, it will confine the administration of the Act to the Minister of External Affairs, and that might hamper the hands of the Government in the future. If they should consider it advisable hereafter to place the administration of the Northern Territory under another Minister of State, that would have to be done by Statute. If, on the other hand, the definition be deleted, the proclamation placing the administration of that Territory under the Minister of External Affairs could be altered at any time without interfering with the Act. </para>

                        <para>. - I have further considered this matter, and think that it would .be. better to leave the definition clause as it stands. It might otherwise be imagined by people outside, who read the statements which have been made by some honorable senators this afternoon, that the Minister of External Affairs was deprived of the control of the Northern Territory on account of the suspicions to which expression has been given. That is a fair assumption. When we come to consider that a definition of the Territory is necessary, I think, in view of what has already been said, that it would be far better to take the clause as it is. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will see the justice of that position. </para>

My objection is not advanced because I have any suspicions about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor.</inline> I think that the remarks of the Vice-President of the Executive Council on that subject were uncalled for.

                        <para>. - I very much regret the personal element that has been introduced into the debate. It rather seems to me that if a South Australian happened to be Minister of External Affairs, instead of being biased in his administration in favour of his own State, he would be so careful in his conduct as to insist on things being strained against his State, so as to make sure that he was not' exercising undue influence in its favour. Suppose that the Minister of External Affairs were a Queenslander. Is it to be supposed that any man occupying his position would unduly strain matters so as to take the railway through his own State? I should hope that he would not. But according to some honorable senators who have spoken, that is just the position that such a Minister would take up. It is altogether wrong to impute conduct of this kind to a Minister, no matter who he is. The Minister is responsible to Parliament, and if he commits any maladministration, or uses any undue influence, his conduct may be reviewed in Parliament. No matter what Government may be in power, the conduct of a Minister should not be impugned without specific reason being given. Nothwithstanding, however, what has been said by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, I think that he would be well-advised to amend the definition by striking out the first part of it. I do not see that by making this amendment we should be expressing any lack of confidence in the Minister of External Affairs, or that we should be casting any suspicions upon him. In every way, it would be better if the first part of the definition were eliminated. It might be desirable to place certain matters affecting the Territory in the hands of the Minister of Trade and Customs or in the hands of the Treasurer. It might be desirable for many reasons to make alterations in the methods of administration. In that event if this provision were retained it would be necessary to introduce an amending Bill. By leaving out the words to which I have referred, however, the Territory would pass under the control of the Minister of External Affairs for the time being, and it would be possible to make any administrative alteration later on which might be deemed desirable. I therefore suggest that the Vice-President of the Executive Council should accept a modification of the definition in the direction indicated. </para>

                        <para>. -My attitude with regard to the clause under discussion is this : I think that, no matter who the Minister of External Affairs may be, it is a pity that a portion of the Commonwealth should be placed under the control of his Department. My objection would be just as strong if the present Minister of Home Affairs were Minister of External Affairs. It would, in my view, under such circumstances, be equally reprehensible to take this Territory away from the Department of Home Affairs and have it administered by the Department of Externa] Affairs. The Territory remains now what it was before, an integral portion of the Commonwealth. It was a portion of the Commonwealth when the Federation was established, and nothing that we can do will remove it from that position unless we are willing to turn traitors to our nation and hand the Territory over to a foreign Power. In no other way can we free ourselves from the obligation of regarding it as a portion of the Commonwealth. That, I think, is a proposition that will not be denied by any one. The only difference in the situation now is that we are assuming a dual function towards the Northern Territory. Formerly we had control over it to the extent that the Commonwealth has control over any portion of Australia. Commonwealth laws apply to every portion of Australia. Now, however, we are undertaking additional functions. We are undertaking functions affecting the Territory which formerly were fulfilled by the Government of South Australia. But the assumption of these functions is in -no sense an abnegation of the control which we formerly exercised. We have had a good deal of special pleading- with regard to this matter. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has observed that the Department of Home Affairs is merely a Works Department. The honorable senator must think that this Senate consists of a flock of sheep or a lot of fools. There is on the notice-paper of the Senate at the present moment a matter relating to the census. The Home Affairs Department has control of that business. What has a census to do with works ? Yet that is the sort of paM and piffle we get from the Vice-President of the Executive Council when he tells us that the Department is merely a Works Department ! The Department of Home Affairs also has control of electoral business. Has that anything to do with works? The special pleading that we have heard on this subject is absolutely ridiculous. To place the Northern Territory under the control of the External Affairs Department is to cast a slur upon it. It is to treat it as something external to the Commonwealth. I hope that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> suggestion, and that if he cannot see his way to amend the definition he will agree to leave out the clause altogether. </para>

                        <para>- -I thought at one time that the Vice-President of the Executive Council would have been willing to accept an amendment of the clause which would meet the views of many. honorable senators. I have said that it may be but a coincidence that the honorable gentleman at the head of the External Affairs Department is a representative of South Australia, but my objection is to this matter being taken out of the hands of the Department of Home Affairs. If I had not objected on that account I shorn1 d not have said .anything on the matter. It has been said that we have sought to cast some reflection upon the honorable gentleman at the head of the External Affairs Department, but I remind honorable senators that every time a representative of Queensland has risen to oppose the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth under the conditions of the agreement submitted, his opposition has been attributed to personal and State motives. It would seem that what is sauce for the goose is not to be sauce for the gander. I repeat what I have already said, that I was not requested by any one in Queensland or anywhere else to oppose the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill. But I was elected to the Senate pledged against the taking over of the Territory on the conditions proposed. </para>

Even if they did, it should not be forgotten that it has been constantly thrown in the teeth of representatives of Queensland that their opposition to the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill was due to some ulterior motive, because they had a purpose to serve in connexion with the proposed railway. That was said especially by representatives of South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I should be very glad if it were possible to recognise the Northern Territory as a new State within two years, but I realize that we have big problems to face in the Northern Territory, and, personally, I should like to see a new Minister intrusted with the sole responsibility of administering its affairs. I remind honorable senators that the External Affairs Department has already had some little experience of the control of a Territory which is not on exactly the same footing as a State, whilst the Home Affairs Department has had no experience of that kind. The administration of a huge tract of country like the Northern Territory is a very different thing from the purchase of a block of land in Victoria, or in New South Wales, for a post-office. The External Affairs Department at the present time, if not underworked, is certainly not overworked, and should, I think, have sufficient time at its disposal to organize a special staff for the administration of the affairs of the Northern Territory. </para>

                            <para>- I certainly should not, but I am not prepared to treat it as a State of the Commonwealth, nor do I believe any other member of the Committee is prepared to .do that. It should not be beyond the capacity of the External Affairs Department to administer the Northern Territory. This is merely a provisional measure, and if, after a little experience, we find that the External Affairs Department is capable of administering the Territory in a manner satisfactory to this Parliament, we might overcome the objection to the Minister of External Affairs by adding to his title that of "Minister for the Northern Territory."

I believe that the External Affairs Department has most time at its disposal, and is capable of organizing the administration of the affairs of the Northern Territory. I may not be so optimistic as are some honorable senators, but I believe that for several years to come we shall require to have a Department specially created to administer the Northern Territory. Though that might be difficult, I should like to see a new "Minister appointed for the purpose. </para>

I believe the Home Affairs Department have plenty of work to do, and that the administration of this Territory would be altogether outside the scope of its proper work. 1 accept this measure as merely provisional, and I hope that in the not far distant future, we shall have a special Department created for the administration of the Northern Territory, and that the responsibility for its administration and the spending of considerable sums of money in the Territory will be in the sole charge of one member of the Government. </para>

                        <para>. - This discussion must be as interesting to other honorable senators as it is to me, but I venture to say that it is somewhat beside the question we are now called upon to decide. We have not to ask whether the External Affairs Department would be the worst or the best Department to administer the affairs of the Northern Territory. The question before the Com,mittee is : Shall we retain in this Bill words which mean nothing? ' </para>

Russell has not indicated the lines upon which in the future we shall have to travel. Before very long, I think, we shall find it desirable to create a special Department to administer the affairs of the Northern Territory. In the first place, the Vice-President of the Executive Council recognised that there was sufficient virtue in the arguments which have been advanced to induce him to agree to strike out the clause. But now that we find it is necessary to retain a portion of the clause, he insists upon retaining the whole of it. </para>

But seeing that there is a possibility that in the future it may tie the hands of the Government it should be struck out. The only argument advanced by the Vice-President of the Executive Council against the adoption of that course - and it was an argument which was not worthy either of this Chamber or of the honorable gentleman - was that it might be regarded as a reflection upon the present Minister of External Affairs. That suggestion is too absurd for serious consideration. Nothing that has been said here to-day was in any sense a reflection upon that gentleman. As it is obvious that by retaining these  words we may restrain the action of Ministers in the future, I move - </para>

In any case, I still adhere to the opinion that the Northern Territory should be administered by the Minister of Home Affairs. Matters pertaining to that Territory - from whatever point of view they may be regarded - are matters affecting the Commonwealth. Section in of the Constitution reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">Now, South Australia proposes to surrender a portion of her Territory to the Commonwealth. When she has done so that portion of South Australia known as the Northern Territory will become subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth will be the supreme authority in that portion of Australia. I do not know by what straining of terms honorable senators can endeavour to persuade us that a Territory which appertains to internal Australian affairs ought to be administered by the Minister of External Affairs. If there be anything in the contention of the Vice-President of the Executive Council that the Department of Home Affairs is largely a Works Department, my reply is that in the near future the Northern Territory will be the theatre of the largest works expenditure that we have yet witnessed under the Commonwealth Government. Railways will have to be built there, and developmental works of various kinds' undertaken. If the Department of Home Affairs is merely a Works Department, the Ministerial head of it will have a considerable share in the administration of the Territory. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has given notice of the amendment which he has outlined, I think that he ought to persist in it. If he will not do so, I will move it. </para>

                        <para>-  - The opinion has already been expressed by a good many honorable senators that it would be unwise to tie the hands of the Government in this matter, seeing that at some future time they may wish to readjust their Ministerial duties. It appears to me that all the arguments which have been advanced in regard to the management of the Northern Territory really tend in the direction indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell. In the absence of this clause the administration of the Northern Territory would automatically fall under the Department of External Affairs. It is ridiculous to suggest that legislation ought to be influenced by the consideration of whether some real or fancied slight may not be put upon a Minister. We are supposed to legislate to the best of our ability, and in accordance with our convictions. Consequently, we ought to determine the matters which are brought before us upon their merits. We ought not to be influenced by any other consideration. Whilst I am animated by the most cordial feelings towards the present Minister of External Affairs, I am disposed to vote for the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> because it is a good policy not to pass any more laws than we absolutely require. </para>

                            <para>- The mere designation " Minister for External Affairs " does not mean that certain matters shall come under his control. It is wise in this measure to decide which Department shall administer the Northern Territory. That course has been pursued in practically all the legislation which we have passed. Why should we begin to adopt a new system of drafting at this juncture? No reason has been given why a departure should be made, and I therefore appeal to the Committee to give to the Minister the benefit of any doubt they have. </para>

                        <para>. - I think it is desirable to inform the Minister of Defence of that which he evidently is in ignorance. He has not been present during the whole of the discussion, and, therefore, it is necessary to inform him as to what transpired when the question was originally mooted. The Vice-President of the Executive Council agreed with me that if the clause were struck out the effect would be just the same as if it were retained, and he consented to its deletion. lt was not until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> pointed out that it was desirable to retain the portion defining "the Territory " that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> expressed a desire not to retain that portion only, but the whole clause. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> stated that, in view of some criticism addressed to the Senate, the public might consider that the deletion of the definition was intended as a reflection on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor.</inline> That line of argument was, . I think, too weak for serious consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> second objection is that this is merely a drafting amendment. I have a strong disinclination to see brought in as an argument anything which an officer may have said to a Minister. I have a strong objection to take any direction as to my legislative duties from a junior clerk in any Department. </para>

                            <para>- It is not an argument which ought to be addressed to the Chamber. This is something more than a drafting amendment, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> admitted unconsciously when he pointed out that if the definition were not retained it would leave the Ministry free to place the administration of the Act under another Department if they so desired. I contend that the most competent persons to adjust the Ministerial duties are Ministers themselves. No man can possibly know better how to apportion the work falling to Ministerial heads than those who have to do it. It is rather novel that the Opposition are seeking to give to the Government a liberty which they are trying to resist. It is generally the other way about. </para>

                            <para>- It will leave the Ministry free to put the Northern Territory under the control of any Minister. If, however, the definition be retained, and it should be found later that another Department could more advantageously administer the Territory, no transfer can be made without a special Act. In the State domain we frequently hear of a re-adjustment of Ministerial duties. In the case of nearly every Government which has been formed in New South Wales during the last ten or fifteen years there has been a readjustment. I want to leave our Ministers free to re-adjust Ministerial duties from time to time. If, however, we enact in every Bill that it shall be administered by a particular Department, a re-arrangement cannot be made without the authority of another measure. Surely, when you trust Ministers with very much greater powers, individually and collectively, you might at least give them the power to re-adjust their Ministerial duties in a way which will work each Department to the utmost of its capacity, and to the best purpose of all. That is the sole object I had in proposing the amendment. </para>

                                GOULD (New South Wales)  [5.27].-  I ask honorable senators, first, whether we have a Statute defining the duties appertaining to each Minister? No. They have been settled by proclamation. At the inauguration of the Commonwealth the Government allotted the duties to be performed by each Minister, and a proclamation was accordingly published in the

                                The Government can at any time they see fit re-allot the duties of Ministers. Wort, for instance, which is now taken by the Minister of Home Affairs could be put under the Minister of External Affairs, or work which is under the latter Department might be put under the Treasurer, or work which is under the Postmaster-General might be put under another Minister. By an Executive act Ministers can vary the duties as they please, and the Ministry, collectively, are responsible to the Parliament for whatever work they do.

                    <para class="block">What does it matter to Parliament whether a work is done by one Minister or other so long as it is done properly and honestly ? If you tie the hands of Ministers, as proposed in this clause, they will have to ask Parliament to authorize any change of duties which they may desire to make. We shall go into recess in a week or two, and not meet again for months. During the recess there might be some reason for making a transfer of Ministerial duty in relation to the Northern Territory, but that could , not be done without special parliamentary authority. Surely honorable senators will see on consideration that it is only reasonable to leave in the hands of Ministers the freedom which they now possess. There is no reason why an exception should be made to the general rule in the case of this measure. In every State Parliament it is the practice to define " the Minister " as " the Minister charged with the administration of this Act." In other Acts it has been provided that the " Minister " shall mean such-and-such a Minister, or such Minister as may be determined by proclamation. Under the circumstances, it is far better to leave the matter open, instead of trying to tie a bit of unnecessary red-tape around Ministers, the only effect of which must be to hamper their operations. </para>

                        <para>. - If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> had had the experience in this Parliament that I have had, he would long ago have realized the danger of pursuing the practice of having changes of Ministers at frequent intervals. I can remember the time when, at the beginning of the month, one would find a particular Minister in the position of Postmaster-General, whilst at the end of the same month he had become Minister of Defence. That is the sort of thing that I have tried to assail and destroy. The amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> which I supported, would have been the first step towards doing away with practices of that kind. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator does not seem to be able to see the point. At present this particular Department, or any other Department, may be administered by one Minister to-day and within a week or a fortnight may be handed over to another. The objection that I have to that method of conducting business is that, no sooner does a Minister obtain a knowledge of his Department than he is transferred to another ; and when he gets a knowledge of his new Department he is again transferred. The result is that the administration of Departments continues to be controlled by the permanent officials. Honorable senators may desire to continue that state of affairs, but I do not. </para>

                        <para>. - An amendment was made in clause 11 of the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, substituting the word "may" for the word " shall," to bring it into conformity with the South Australian Act. This means that, on the transfer of the Territory to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth Government will have discretionary power in taking over the public officials in the Northern Territory. So far as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mitchell</inline> is concerned, he has been appointed by the South Australian Government for a term, and their action has been ratified by the Parliament of the State.  His  rights are to be preserved under the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill which we have passed. I can. assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> that the present Government will do all that lies in their power to advance the interests of the Northern Territory and of Australia, irrespective of the interests of any public officer. But I would also say that the rights of no officer in the Northern Territory will be sacrificed while the present Government are in power. Consequently, although we may later on think it well to appoint some other person as Administrator of the Northern Territory, the present Government Resident pf the Territory need be under no apprehension as to the treatment he will receive. The interests of Australia will be regarded before the interests of any officer, even though the Commonwealth or the State should have to sacrifice a little money to conserve them. </para>

Executive Council, in reply, said, and I did not dispute the fact, that I could not expect anything of that sort to be done in the few moments left to us of the present session. The honorable senator gave me to understand that this is to be regarded as a temporary measure; but, in this clause, I find that we are asked to appoint an Administrator of the Northern Territory for five years, and that if he behaves himself, he will retain that position for that term. In the measure dealing with the affairs of Papua, we provided for an Executive Council and a </para>

                        <para>. - I do not think there is anything in the honorable senator's objection. It will not necessarily follow that this provision will determine the administration of the Northern Territory for five years. In all probability the development of the Territory will not be so rapid that we shall be unable for much more than five years to do without an official in the position of Administrator. The argument of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, that we could not obtain the services of a good man unless we offered him an appointment for a definite term, is a reasonable one. The Administrator is to carry on his work, not only according to the terms of his Commission, but " according <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> such instructions as are given to him by the Minister." That does not mean that all his instructions are to be given to him when he first takes up the duties of his office. The instructions to be given to him will vary in accordance with the legislation passed, and the decisions arrived at by the Parliament as to the proper government of the Territory. While in connexion with the previous clause I was anxious to vest the Government with more power, in connexion with this clause, it occurs to me that they ought rot to have so much power. Instead of the Administrator of the Northern Territory being appointed on the approval -of the Government, I think he should be appointed on the approval of Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- But to impeach a Ministry before an appointment has been made is a very different matter from impeaching them after it has been made. I recollect that some years ago the claim was strongly urged by the Labour party that certain proposed appointments should be submitted to Parliament. In my judgment, we should make the clause as broad-based and democratic as possible by providing that the Administrator shall be appointed on the recommendation of Parliament. To this end I suggest that after the word "may" the words "with the approval of Parliament " be inserted. Parliament would hesitate very much to condemn a Ministry because it did not approve of the man who had been appointed to the office of Administrator. It would hesitate to cause such an officer to resign his position, notwithstanding that if it had been afforded an opportunity of doing so, it might have made a very different selection. Consequently, I suggest the insertion of the words which I have indicated. Parliament would then have an opportunity of considering who should be appointed to this important office, lt is a position which the occupant is likely to fulfil for a very much longer period than five years. </para>

                            <para>- I do not. We know that when a Ministry accept office, they are nominally appointed by the Governor-General. If the party opposite me were in power, its leader would select his colleagues, and submit their names to the Governor-General for his approval. It is true that the Governor-General might object to them, but as a matter of fact we know that he never does adopt that course. If the Labour party has a majority the whole of its members select the Ministry. Consequently, it is a complete farce to argue that the Governor-General has anything to do with the formation of a Ministry. </para>

                        <para>. - Throughout my life I have never entertained any serious objection to novel proposals, because they were always very interesting. But I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is full of them. He desires to conduct the government of the Commonwealth on up-to-date and original lines. But if Parliament took the appointment of the Administrator into its own hands as he suggests, I would like to know what principles would guide it in determining the merits of the different applicants from whom a selection would have to be made? In the first place I presume that applications would have to be forwarded either to the  President  or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> or to the  Clerk  of the Parliament. The credentials of all these applicants would have to be laid upon the table of the two Houses, so that its members might have access to them. After those credentials had been carefully read, we should have to resolve ourselves into a Committee for the purpose of selecting the most suitable man for the office. Parliament would probably appoint a Committee to make a recommendation. But under this clause the Minister will represent that Committee. Through the Governor-General, he will call for applications, and, after going thoroughly into the credentials of the various applicants, he will recommend that a certain man be appointed to the office. If the Ministry were to do anything shady in connexion with the appointment, Parliament would pounce upon them straight away. Hitherto, every officer of this description has been appointed by the Government, and I hope that practice will be observed in the future. The objection that the Administrator is to be appointed for five years, and that only a temporary form of government will be carried on in the Northern Territory during the whole of that term, is scarcely a reasonable one. Every honorable senator must know that as soon as possible a Constitution similar to that which has been granted to other Territories of the Commonwealth will be granted to the Northern Territory. But the Administrator, whoever he may be - and I hope that the best man will be appointed - will still be the head of the Executive, and the Executive will form a part of the constitutional government that we propose to grant to the Territory. Seeing that we require the services of an Administrator, is it not wise to straight away appoint the best man to that important position, and to begin to develop the Territory under his guidance and under that of Parliament as soon as possible? Then, when the time comes for us to grant a Constitution to the Territory, he will continue in office for the unexpired portion of his term. Indeed, if he be a good man, I hope that his services will be retained even after his full term has expired. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council ought to have been so severe on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> I rather expected him to be in entire sympathy with the proposal of that honorable senator. The latter's idea is that Parliament should be intrusted with the duty of selecting the gentleman who is to fill the high office of Administrator. The  Vice-President of the Executive Council takes exception to that proposal. But there was a time when the Senate was asked to vote upon a motion affirming that the Australian High Commissioner should be selected by this Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I am rather surprised at the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> because he must know what has happened in State Parliaments when they have attempted to fill much less important positions that that of Administrator of the Northern Territory. I cannot recall anything more discreditable than some of the attempts which have been made in State Parliaments to appoint certain members to Public Works Committees. As one who believes thoroughly in the principle of responsible government, I ask honorable senators to retain the clause as it stands rather than adopt the amendment. I think that there is a good deal more in the point which has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> than appears to have arrested the attention of the Vice-President of the Executive Council. This Bill is intended to be only a temporary measure. It is intended to do duty until a complete Bill for the administration of the Northern Territory is submitted for our consideration. Seeing that that is so, is it a business-like proceeding to take power under this Bill to appoint an Administrator of the Territory for five years? That officer, when once appointed, will have a legal right to - hold office for that term irrespective of what may happen in the immediate future. But the gentleman who might be selected today might not be the individual who would be selected when a Constitution for the Territory had been developed. At present, the administration of the Northern Territory, with a population of less than  1,500  Europeans, may appear to be a very small job. </para>

                            <para>- No; because the Governor of a Crown Colony has a beaten track to follow. I think that the point which has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> is well worthy of consideration. Would it not be better for the Territory, if, instead of immediately making a permanent appointment, the Government made a temporary arrangement - an arrangement under which, possibly, the present Government Resident might be continued in office, until we have finally drafted a Constitution for it? I urge the Government, in the interests of the Territory itself, to go slow, and to refrain from making a permanent appointment at this stage. It would be far better to make a temporary appointment or to continue the existing state of affairs until a Constitution for the Northern Territory has been drafted and approved by Parliament. Then we should be in a better position to invite applications from, those who are best qualified to discharge the duties of the office. </para>

                        <para>. - This clause proposes to give permanency to the appointment of an Administrator, and sufficient reasons have not yet been advanced for making the office a permanent one. It is idle for the Vice-President of the Executive Council to say that Parliament has powers reserved to it, by which it may alter the conditions surrounding that appointment. I would invite the attention of the Committee to the important privileges which it is proposed to confer upon the Administrator. What was the Government doing a short time ago? It was fighting for the administration of the Northern Territory to be left in the hands of the Minister of External Affairs, because, under the Papua Act, the administration of Papua as a Territory had been intrusted to him. </para>

                            <para>- The conditions in the Northern Territory are entirely different. While for administrative purposes it might be left for the present under the Department which is administering Papua, there are reasons why we should hasten some portion of our legislation which cannot possibly apply to the case of Papua. For a long time to come Papua will be occupied by its own native people, and we want to keep them there if we can preserve them. But a diametrically different problem confronts us in the Northern Territory. The whole object, I take -it, is to make it rapidly a white man's country. What has been the whole object of the political development of the States ? It has been to leave the government in the hands of their own people. We want to see the Northern Territory erected into a State as soon as possible and administered very largely by elected representatives, subject, of course, to our paramount authority. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, a great deal will depend upon the Administrator; but the Government might happen to appoint the wrong man. My particular objection to the clause is that an appointment' for five years would place a large amount of power in the hands of a single individual. Apparently, the Government intend to rely more upon the personality of the Administrator than upon the inherent merits of the Constitution itself. Let me ask the Committee to consider the great privileges which this measure confers upon the Administrator. He is to be appointed by commission under the seal of the Commonwealth. Those who are familiar with the effect of such appointments know that once the Administrator has been placed in that position, under the seal of the Commonwealth, he will have tremendous powers over the Ministry who appointed him, and he cannot be easily controlled, unless he should happen to commit a flagrant offence. </para>

                            <para>- I dare say that the duties of the Administrator will be laid down, but once the commission under the seal of the Commonwealth has been issued, who can check him in his administration? The commission itself cannot control him, and the only way in which he can be controlled is suggested by the words " shall hold office, subject to good behaviour, for five years." Except as regards a time limitation, his appointment is subject to the same conditions as is the appointment of a. lawyer to the Bench of the High Court. His appointment will be made, subject to good behaviour, for five years. During that period, he will exercise all the powers and functions which belong to his office, according to the tenor of his commission, and such instructions as are given to him by the Minister. It is almost impossible to conceive of wider powers being given to a single individual under a commission, than the Government will have given to this Administrator when they send him up to the Northern Territory with a commission under the seal of the Commonwealth. The Vice-President of the Executive Council admits that impliedly, because he says, and rightly says, that much will depend upon the character of the man. He urges us to give a discretion to the Executive because they want to get a good man. Inferentially, when he is obtained, he must be allowed a large, discretion in the exercise of his powers. Under sub-clause 3, the branch of the Public Service which will be required for the administration of the Northern Terri  tory is to be largely in the hands of the </para>

                            <para>- It is proposed to give the Administrator of the Northern Territory very large powers. He will enjoy those powers for a term which", under the circumstances, is, in my opinion, far too long. The proposal seems to me to be in conflict with the policy of the Government. What is going to happen until the proclamation is issued? The white population of the Territory will be practically disfranchised. We do not desire to leave them in that position. How  can we relieve them immediately ? We can only do so by framing a Constitution for the Territory. When we begin to consider that question, we shall, to use a common expression, be "up against" one of the most important constitutional issues that can be brought before us for solution. I suggest that the. clause should be made to read - </para>

                    <para>That would give the Executive complete control over the officer appointed.

                        <para>. -  I hope the amendment will not be carried. The object of inserting the five years' term in this clause is for the purpose of enabling us to secure the services of the best man possible for the position of Administrator. It is true that the Lieutenant-Governor, of Papua is appointed during the Governor-General's pleasure; hut does not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger know that the term "during pleasure" invariably indicates a permanent appointment? The appointment in Papua may continue for ten, fifteen, or twenty years. There is no analogy between the two positions. The importance of giving a Constitution to the Northern Territory has been kept in view by the Government. Had it not been that the present session was so far advanced, the Constitution might have been adopted this year. We hope, however, to deal with the question next session. As far as relates to the disfranchisement of the electors resident in the Northern Territory, I may point out that there is no probability of an election taking place during the next twelve months. Even if there were an election, and there were a Constitution for the Territory, the residents would not have any vote for a representative, either in the Parliament of South Australia or in the Commonwealth Parliament. Under any Constitution which we grant, the residents will be in the same position as those in Papua. They will have an Executive Council composed of the Executive 'officers and a certain number of persons elected by the residents. That, I assume, is what will really happen. I do not think that it would be wise to amend the clause as proposed, in view of the importance of endeavouring to get a good man to administer the Territory. There is no doubt that the Constitution will be passed during the life of this Parliament. In the meantime, the administration will proceed, and it is possible that when the Constitution is granted, the Administrator will be appointed Lieutenant-Governor, as in Papua. Seeing that this is a temporary Bill, and that the Government are endeavouring to do their best for the Northern Territory, I hope that the clause will be passed as it stands. At any rate, if we do not give the Administrator some security of tenure, we cannot hope to get a good man. </para>

                            <para>- We are here making special provision for the government of the Northern Territory; and I remind honorable senators that in clause 7 of the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, we have provided that -  (1.) All laws in force in the Northern Terri tory at the time of the acceptance shall continue in force, but may be altered or repealed by or under any law of the Commonwealth. (2.) Where, by any law of the Commonwealth in force in the Northern Territory at the time of the acceptance, any power or function is vested in any officer in relation to the State of South Australia, that power or function shall, in relation to the Northern Territory, be vested in and exercised or performed by such officer as the Governor-General directs. (3.) Where, by any law of the State of South Australia in force in the Northern Territory at the time of the acceptance, any power or function is vested in the Governor of the State of South Australia, or in the Governor of that State with the advice of his Executive Council, or in any authority of that State, that power  or function, in relation to the Northern Territory, shall be vested in and exercised or performed by the Governor-General, or the Governor-General in Council, or the authority exercising similar powers and functions under the Commonwealth, as the case requires, or as the Governor-General directs. </para>

The Minister says that that is not so, and I suppose I must rest satisfied with his statement; but I have pointed out how I read the provisions of this Bill. I admit that, under sub-clause  3  of clause  13,  we provide that - </para>

                    <para>But I contend that, immediately upon the rising of Parliament for the recess, it would be possible for the Executive to make an Ordinance under this Bill which might amend a Commonwealth law ; and it would remain in force unless it were disallowed under clause  13  by a motion carried in either House of this Parliament within fifteen days after it re-assembled at the close of the recess. I should like to have a clear understanding of the matter, which I regard as of very great importance. </para>

It is the interest in leasehold land and the interest in the improvements that we have to consider. The amendment is intended to make it clear that the value of the owner's interest in the improvements will be taken into consideration at the time of the acquisition of the land. The improvements might be worth a great deal at the time of the passing of the Bill, and  their  value might have partially disappeared at the time the land was being acquired by the Commonwealth. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) [8.31},- If the Government see fit to resume land, the least they can do is to compensate the owner by giving him the value of the improvements which he has placed upon it. Surely they do not wish to rob him of what he has spent upon the land while it was his own, and while he was at liberty to do what he chose with it ! Even if he has erected the highly-ornamental building of which
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline>
                        has spoken, he ought to be paid its value to him, irrespective of whether it represents a large or a small sum. That is a fair principle to apply, so far as compensation for improvements is concerned. But I would direct attention to the fact that, under this Bill, the Government will be able to say
                        <inline font-style="italic">to</inline>
                        a freeholder in twenty or thirty years' time, " We are going to resume your land, and we will compensate you for it by paying you an amount equal to its value twenty or thirty years ago." As a matter of fact, its value twenty or thirty years hence may be considerably more than its value at the present juncture. Surely we shall be going to extremes if we permit the Government to say to a land-owner, " We intend to ante-date the value of your land for a term of years." I would further remind honorable senators that if an owner wished lo sell his land in such circumstances, he would not be able to get for it more than it was worth to-day. I really think that some period should be specified within which it should be necessary for the Government to exercise their powers of resumption. I think that a term of two or three years should be fixed. However much we may believe in the principle of land nationalization, the rights of the individual must be considered. Consequently, some time limit should be imposed, within which it should be necessary for the Government to exercise their power to resume land at its value at the time of the passing of this Act.

                        <para>. - I wish to emphasize the point which has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould.</inline> This clause imposes no time limit within which the Government should exercise their power of resumption. ' It does not seem fair that, twenty or thirty years hence, they should be able to resume land at its value at the time of the passing of this Act. Certain land may be worth very little at the present moment. But if a man works it for twenty or thirty years, surely he has a right to its value at the time of its resumption. </para>

                        <para>. - This clause merely gives effect to the principle which the Leader of the Opposition sought to have embodied in the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill. I would remind Senators Gould and Vardon that, upon that occasion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was rather annoyed, because a proposal to ante-date the value of the land which may be acquired by the Government to the  1st  July last, was not agreed to. The lands of the Northern Territory have a certain unimproved value to-day.  Anything which may be added to the unimproved value of those lands during the next fifty years will be added to it by the public. Any value which may be given to those lands by reason of improvements made by the owners or occupiers will belong to the owners or occupiers. At whatever time the Government may acquire land in the Northern Territory, they are entitled to the benefit of the value which has been given to it by the people. </para>

                            <para>- As one of the taxpayers of Australia he will get his share of that value. But so far as improvements are concerned he will receive their value at the time of the acquisition of the land. When I was speaking previously I neglected to illustrate a little point for the benefit of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> and other honorable senators who think with him. In connexion with the lands which are held under lease in the Northern Territory there is a condition that at the expiration of those leases the improvements will fall to the Government. But if this clause were permitted to stand in its present form, the occupier of those lands would get the value of the improvements. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> amendment will prevent that. Under it, the occupier will only receive his interest in the value of those improvements. But as he has agreed that the improvements shall fall to the Government, he will have no interest in them on the expiration of his term. In other words, he will have an interest in them only up to the termination of his lease. Consequently, honorable senators will see that the amendments proposed are fair, both to the owners and to the public. _ </para>

                            <para>- Under that Act an owner receives the value of his land as it exists at the date of resumption. But the proviso to this clause says that no greater value shall be attachable to the land than the value at the time when the Act was passed. If a property were resumed ten years hence, and it had been enhanced in value by 100 per cent, the Government would not be called upon to pay that enhancement, but only the value as ft existed at the date of the passing of the Act. The contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> and myself is that there should be a limitation to that provision. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has asked, " What can be fairer when you give an Owner the value of his land as it is to-day, and the value of the improvements as they exist at the date of resumption ? " But that is very much like saying to an owner, "  1  shall enter into an agreement to have the right to purchase your land at any time I see fit at the value which it has to-day." </para>

Suppose that, the honorable senator and myself have a property each, and that the Government say to us, " We may want to buy these estates within the next century, and, therefore, . we will now make a bargain with you that whenever we take them you shall each get the exact value of your estate as it is to-day, but, of course, we shall give you the value of the improvements." Does not the honorable senator see that that will destroy to a great extent the selling value of the land? </para>

                            <para>- Why? Because it has been generally assumed that the Government intend within a reasonable period to convert: all freehold land into Crown land. Every owner within the Federal Territory was prevented from selling his land to speculators for the purpose of working up big prices against the Commonwealth. But it has never been assumed that the Government are going to leave the freeholds in the hands of the present owners for the next half-century, and then resume them. The idea is that the Government shall acquire them as early as possible. If they intimate that as part of their policy they are going to resume all the land in the Northern Territory within a reasonable time, then there is some force in the argument that they should pay the present values, because they do not want to create speculative values. But where a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> value is given to a property by the work of the owner and by the people in the locality, surely it is not intended to hold that up against the individual for all time. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that each individual member of the community helped to create the value of the land. If every honorable senator owned a block of land in the city, and each improved his holding very highly, those lands would increase materially in value in consequence of the aggregation of people as well as the improvements we had made. We should have brought trade to the place, and by that means developed values. Surely that is not a reason why everything should be taken away from us by the State. Let me now go a step further. It has been pointed out that seventy or eighty years ago the land on which Melbourne stands was cut up into allotments and sold, and that allotments </para>

It was our property originally, and its present value has been given to it by the community generally." Would not such a thing be looked upon as  a  monstrous injustice? </para>

                            <para>- It does. Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that at Port Darwin there is a struggling town at present, and that, in consequence of the Government taking over the town and adopting "a vigorous policy to develop the whole of the Northern Territory, a large export and import trade should grow up in the town. A large number of persons would go there to reside, and by that means create, eventually, a great city, perhaps as great as Melbourne is to-day. The value of an allotment in Port Darwin to-day may be about  £10  ; but twenty years hence it may be worth  £10,000.  Suppose that the Government should then come down and say, " We intend to resume this land, and will only give you  £10,  because it is provided in a section of the Northern Territory (Administration) Act that -  in determining the compensation to which the owner is entitled under that Act, the value of (he land shall be taken not to exceed .the unimproved value of the land, or the interest therein of the owner, at the date of the passing of this Act together with the value of the improvements on the land. </para>

We find that, although Geelong started with .great hopes and aspirations, Melbourne was established, and has taken the trade and become the chief city of Victoria ; while Geelong, whatever its position may be to-day, is infinitely inferior, from the stand-point of land values, to Melbourne. </para>

                            <para>- They have had the same general advantages from a settled form of government, and a proper system of administration. Both these cities having been established practically contemporaneously, one has forged ahead much more than has the other. Land in one has become of much more value than land in the other. The population in one has become much larger than that in the other. If you were to go to Geelong and buy half-an-acre of land in the middle of that city, the price you would pay would be infinitesimal compared with the price which you would pay for a similar area in Melbourne. We have got to a certain extent on exact lines. </para>

                            <para>- An enormous sum has been spent in deepening and straightening the Yarra so as to make it navigable by larger ships than could enter it in its primitive state. But why have you spent all this money in different places? It may be that you have spent many thousand pounds more in Melbourne than in Geelong; but the population of the former has been very much larger than the population of the latter. If you take the population and ascertain how much . per head has been expended in Melbourne and Geelong respectively, you may find that there is not a very great difference. Then you want to see where lies the difference between the two great cities. </para>

                            <para>.- It is not merely that. The population began to settle in one place because they thought it was a more suitable site for establishing a great port than was the other. Having spent their money and enterprise in creating this place, would it be fair to enact that land may be resumed by the Government at cost price in 1840 in each case? That would be penalizing the men of enterprise who came to Melbourne in those early days. Honorable senators have tried to shelter themselves behind the statement that it is the community-created value which they seek to obtain. But that is not the case. It is not the State alone which has created the unearned increment. It has been due to the work of individuals in the city. If you want to make a place a great city, you ought to bear in mind that the land-owners are entitled to some of the value and some of the profits. </para>

                            <para>- Where would have been the incentive then to men to push this place ahead? When the Government induced men to buy bits of land covered with scrub, and in a miserable-looking place into the bargain, why did they come here? Because they thought there was a possibility of creating a great city, and reaping some reward for their enterprise. As far as you take from an individual all the incentive to enterprise and the promise of reaping a reward, you will find that men of the type we desire to attract will not be ready to come here. Australia is not the whole world. There are plenty of other places to which men can go and spend their money with the expectation of securing the reward to which they are entitled. </para>

                            <para>- Many men came to this country in very poor circumstances ; but they were men of considerable grit, enterprise, and energy, and they saw a prospect of prospering in a new land. Why does any man go from one part of the world to another, except to better himself? When a man goes to a new country, he believes that there are opportunities there which he cannot find in his own country, and many a man who has been poor in the land of his birth has shown, under fresh circumstances, that he is capable of building up a considerable fortune. It is men of that character who have made Australia what she is to-day. It is not a fair thing to take away from individuals that incentive which induces them to better themselves, and at the same time to confer great advantages upon their country. It is not fair, in order to prevent the possibility of speculative values being placed on land, to say, " We will take the right to resume this land at any time at its original value." I do earnestly protest against legislation of this character, which will place obstacles in the way of  energetic individuals deriving legitimate gain through the expenditure of their own enterprise and ability. If we are going to legislate on these lines, we might as well forthwith" pass a law saying that any lands in the Northern Territory may be resumed at any time at the value which they have to-day. </para>

                            <para>- I do not desire to repudiate any existing agreement that has been made by the Government of South Australia. But if it be necessary for the successful development of the Territory - let us say under closer settlement - to resume land at present held by the cattle kings, have we power under this Bill, or any other existing legislation, to resume at a fair value, or must we pay the cattle kings just what they like to demand? I much admired the eloquent portions of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould's</inline> speech where he laid it down that the added value of land was always created by individuals, and that it might be the same with land in the Northern Territory. He argued that some land there may in the future be worth £1,000 per foot. During a recent debate in this Chamber it fell to my lot to quote instances  relating to the city of Melbourne. I showed that blocks in the city area have increased in value at the rate of £5,000 per annum since the first sales took place, whilst others have increased at the rate of £2,000 and £3,000. Yet we are told that the Commonwealth is to take no steps to insure that the value created by the community in the Northern Territory shall be secured for the community. Surely there can be no injustice in making 'it clear that, even, though we arc not prepared to acquire lands in the Northern Territory for the next tea or fifteen years, the present occupiers shall not be permitted to reap the advantage of public expenditure? </para>

It has been generally recognised that the South Australian Government was not sufficiently powerful to deal effectively with the settlement problem in the Territory. I assume that we propose to spend large sums of money in the Northern Territory,- and within a short period the lands there will become considerably enhanced in value as a result of that expenditure. </para>

We, as a party, stand for the right of the individuals forming the community as against the right of the individual. I support this clause, which I believe to be the best in the Bill. I should like to know what exactly will bethe position in regard to leaseholds. I think we should have a similar provision securing for the community the enhanced value in the case of resumption of land held under leasehold, while at the same time preserving the legitimate rights of the individuals at present holding the land. </para>

As a result, the lands will be considerably enhanced in value. Suppose, for instance, that land there now is worth  £5  per acre, and that by the expenditure it may be of millions sterling, by the Commonwealth, and the introduction of thousands of people into the Territory, it may be worth  £50  an acre ten years from now. If some honorable senators had their way the lands would then be acquired under the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act, and the Commonwealth would be called upon under that Act to pay not  £5,  but  £50  an acre for them. The present Government do not desire to do anything of the kind. We desire to prevent speculation in the lands of the Northern Territory. We desire that they shall belong to the people of the Commonwealth ; and that the added value shall be retained for the benefit of those who are responsible for it. </para>

Russell is exceedingly anxious to ascertain how the Government propose to deal with the enormous areas held under lease in the Northern Territory. Some of these leasehold areas range from  5,000  to  24,000  square miles in extent. I do not think there is a single large area in the Northern Territory held under fee-simple. They are held on lease under an Act passed by the South Australian Parliament some years ago, in which very liberal conditions were embodied. The lands were offered on long terms, and it was provided that, if the South Australian Government desired to resume them for agricultural purposes, they might be resumed on compensation being paid to the leaseholders for improvements effected, and the payment to be made in respect of the foreclosure of the lease was to be settled by a reference to an Arbitration Court. </para>

                            <para>- I contend that there is nothing unfair in the proposals  embodied in this Bill. All that is proposed is that the enhanced value added to lands in the Northern Territory, as a result of Commonwealth expenditure, shall belong to those who created it. If such a provision were not embodied in this Bill, a gross injustice would be done, not merely to the residents of. the Northern Territory, but to all who are interested in the policy the Government desire to see carried out there. The principle underlying this clause is one which can be defended from any platform. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> in making a comparison in regard to land values between Melbourne and Geelong, gave his whole case away, because it is as clear as the noonday sun that what creates land values is population, public effort, and public expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator reminded us of the value which would be added to land in the Northern Territory by the efforts of the neighbours cf persons holding that land. I could not help laughing at the statement. If the honorable senator would read a book entitled <inline font-style="italic">We of the Never Never,</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Gunn,</inline> he would discover how near to each other are some neighbours in the Northern Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Gunn</inline> points out that one of her nearest neighbours resided 100 miles to the north of her, another 105 miles to the south, a third 90 miles to the east, and others about 200 miles to the west. I should like to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> how much he thinks the efforts of these neighbours of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Gunn</inline> added to the value of the land she held? </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to know why the Government should be placed in any better position than a private individual. There are men now in Port Darwin who have held land there for years. Suppose there should be some development there, and an increase of trade, as the result of our legislation, and that half-an-acre of land, which is now worth only £5 should, in ten years, become worth £50. The Government propose to say to the owner of the land, " We want that half-acre to build a public office, and we will give you £5 for it, which was all it was worth ten years ago." A private individual comes along, and says to the owner, " I will give you £50 for that land, because it is worth it." Why should the owner of the land be called upon to lose £45. What right have the Government to take for £5 land for which the owner could get £50 from a private individual ? </para>

He may have used the land so that in the course of ten years its value has increased considerably. A private individual may then say to him, "I am prepared to give you £50 for your block." But the Government may step in and say, " We intend to take it, but we will give you only <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> for it, because that represents its value ten years ago."

                    <para>I am aware that there are leases in the Northern Territory which embrace large areas. But when South Australia passed the Act under which those leases are held, it had experienced a succession of droughts. As a matter of fact, a good deal of difficulty was experienced in getting the land taken up at all. It was owing to this circumstance that it was almost given away. But since then good seasons have been experienced. Large cattle-breeding stations have been established in the Northern Territory, and if the Government desire to resume any of these leases, the Act provides the way in which that can be done. I am sorry that these large leases should have such a long period to run. But they have not forty-two years to run, because that was the original tenure. The longest lease, I believe, has now only about thirty-four years to run. But I would point out that the leases impose certain conditions, with which lessees must comply. Failing compliance with them, the Commonwealth can resume the lands comprised in these leases to-morrow. I am anxious to insure that, in passing a law of this description, we shall do only what is just . To say that the Commonwealth, fifty years hence, shall be able to acquire land for public purposes at its value today, is to suggest something which, to my mind, is outrageous. </para>

                        <para>. - It would be a pity if this discussion were allowed to close without a definite answer being given to the statements which have been made by certain honorable senators to the effect that the lands of the Northern Territory have been locked up by the cattle kings. I hold in my hand a copy of one of the pastoral leases in the Northern Territory which have a tenure of forty-two years. At the outset, I may say that the Territory comprises, roughly speaking, 335,000,000 acres, of which only 473,000 acres in fee-simple have been alienated. These figures evidence the extent to which the land-grabber has seized upon the Territory. </para>

Many years ago the South Australian Government granted these areas to certain English capitalists for making a loan to it with which to develop the Northern Territory. At the end of 1906, 88,812,160 acres of land in the Northern Territory were held under pastoral lease with a tenure of forty-two years. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so. I am not a geographical expert like my honorable friend. It may be an area equal to that of Switzerland, Scotland, or France. But that circumstance does not help me in the slightest. Let us get at the figures. I do not care whether the area is equal to that which is embraced by Warrnambool or by the whole of Victoria. In 1906, the pastoral permits comprised 18,787,200 acres, and the areas held under annual pastoral lease aggregated 1,219,840 acres. The total area occupied at the end of 1906 was 108,878,712 acres, leaving unoccupied 227,000,000 acres. Yet we have been told that the land-grabber has locked up the lands of the Northern Territory so that nobody can acquire sufficient land there in which to bury himself. </para>

                            <para>- I would refer my honorable friend to his recent journalistic convert - the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> - and to the series of articles which it published on this subject in 1907. Those articles pointed out that the Northern Territory was locked up from settlement. What are the conditions which attach to these pastoral leases with a forty-two years' tenure - these leases which do not embrace more than one-fourth of the Territory ? In the first place, they provide that the lessee must stock his land and keep if stocked. Secondly, that he must destroy the vermin upon it. Further, he must not cut timber upon it ; he must not obstruct any mineral or timber lessee or licensee, and he has to pay his rent. If he does not fulfil these conditions the Crown may resume possession of his land. He is entitled to receive three months' written notice of the intention of the Crown to resume it if it be required for mineral purposes, or for the purpose of a railway, or tramway, or any public work, or as the site of any cemetery, or public park. He is also entitled to two years' notice if it be required for agricultural purposes. The leases further provide that the lessee shall not be entitled to any payment in respect of any improvements after the expiration of the first ten years of his tenure, unless he has the written sanction of the Minister to make further improvements upon the land. The obvious intention is that the lessee shall effect his improvements within ten years, and that if his land be resumed within that period he shall be compensated for them. But if it be not resumed within that, period he must not continue to make improvements so that the Crown would have to pay an enormous sum for them in case of resumption. The lease also contains the following proviso - </para>

                    <para class="block">So that, in the case of these leases, the community-created value would not be paid for by the Crown. I think that these conditions were well worth quoting as an answer to the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell in reference to cattle kings, and also to statements which have been made broadcast in many quarters that large areas in the Northern Territory are locked up from settlement. Under the Acts of 1899 and 1901 the leases can be resumed and put to closer settlement whenever the people are there and make a demand for land. I do not see why we should leave out the proviso. I believe that it would be a mistake to do so. I hope that the clause will pass with the amendment 1 have moved and the one which has been foreshadowed. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to know how the interests of the public will be safeguarded under the clause. I am very pleased indeed that it provides that no Crown lands shall be sold, but, as has been pointed out before, there may be an injustice done to the community even under a leasehold system. What safeguard is there against the granting of excessively long leases of some of the valuable lands which are left? Although any Ordinance for the disposal of land will have to be submitted to each House of this Parliament, yet we can easily understand that land might be disposed of under the Ordinance before it was submitted, and consequently it would be impossible to undo any mischief which might have been done thereunder. I should like to know in what way we are, not only' to safeguard the community interest in the lands by preventing them from being sold in fee simple, but also to guard against unreasonably long leases being granted, as we are given to understand has been done in the past? The provisions in the Acts quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> seem to afford a fair opportunity to the Crown to resume a part or the whole of a lease in the public interest at a fair valuation. But I want to know what method the Government intend to adopt in order to insure that no unfair private  Tights  shall be  built  up under a leasehold system ? </para>

He would not speak on behalf of the Commission, but he expressed his own opinion. He said he knew that one of the great attractions to those wishing to emigrate to Canada or to the United States or Australia was the hope of being able to have a freehold tenure. He thought that if New South Wales did away with it, it must not expect anything like the population which otherwise it might expect. I believe that it will be wise hereafter if a future Parliament adopts a different system from the one which is now advocated. I admit that if the Northern Territory were comparatively small there would be a great deal of force in a lease; hold system. </para>

                            <para>- It is the very fact that they do not get a freehold which induces them to go where it can be obtained. I do not believe that there is a single honorable senator who would not prefer a freehold to a leasehold. I recognise that I have to submit to the inevitable because I am in a minority, but I still maintain that the circumstances of the Northern Territory are absolutely different from those of the Federal Territory. </para>

                        I realize that the feeling of the Senate at present is in favour of a clause of this character. I indorse what he said with regard to the desire of an individual to have a freehold, no matter whether it be large or small. The idea is strongly held by certain honorable senators that by granting long leases they will induce settlement. Some honorable senators approve of a ninety-nine years' lease, while others even go to the extent of advocating a'  999  years' lease, with a periodical appraisement of rent. . A man does not regard a property which he holds under a tenure of that kind in the same light as he would if it were his own freehold. If he has a freehold tenure the State can get as much revenue out of him by ordinary taxation as it could by means of a periodical appraisement of rent. In New Zealand they have tried the leasehold system, but they are finding out now that the lessees are anxious to convert the leaseholds into freeholds. So it will ever be.

                            <para>- As you put men on the land, whether it be under a leasehold tenure or under any tenure less than a freehold, they will agitate, and when they get strong enough they will obtain a freehold tenure. I venture to predict that, although we may enact to-day that no land in the Northern Territory shall be sold, before twenty years have passed over our heads, probably within a much shorter period, the system of alienation will have been adopted if the Territory should succeed. Certainly it will be started in the towns, and thence it will gradually extend. In legislation, we have to bear in mind that a man desires to acquire a freehold if he is in  a  position to do so. In every great city you visit you find that if a man can manage to buy his little home he will do so. </para>
