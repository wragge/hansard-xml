                            GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;2.38&#93;. - I wish to say a few words in regard to the earlier portion of the clause. I find that in it &#34; absentee &#34; is defined to be a person who is absent from Australia or the territories under the authority of the Commonwealth &#34;at the lime when the ownership of his land for the purposes of this Act is determined.&#34; But paragraph
                            <inline font-style="italic">b</inline>
                            provides an alternative in that under it an absentee may be a man who &#34; has been absent from Australia and such territories during more .than half of the period of twelve months immediately preceding that date.&#34; Thus, if a man has been absent from Australia for seven or nine months prior to the determination of the ownership of his property, he will, strictly speaking, be regarded as an absentee. It is perfectly true that the subsequent portion of the paragraph provides that He may satisfy the Commissioner that he resides in Australia or a territory under the authority of the Commonwealth. I wish to get from the Vice-President of the Executive Council a clear statement as to the construction which the Government place upon this provision. Under it, will it he possible for a man who mav be absent on a visit to another part of the. world for a period of twelve months to be still regarded as a resident of Australia, and not ns an absentee? Very many of our people leave the Commonwealth for twelve months or two years---

                            GOULD. - I am endeavouring to discuss the construction which will be placed upon this provision. I am not debating the question of whether persons who undertake a pleasure trip can afford to be taxed. If that is the spirit in which legislation is to be enacted, God help Australia ! It would be a disgraceful thing if such a provision were included in a Statute for that reason. Of course, if the determination of this question is to be left entirely in the hands of the Commissioner, that arrangement will be satisfactory, because I presume that the Commissioner will be chosen on account of his standing and fitness for his office.

                    <para>. - 1  re-echo the sentiment which has been expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> when he said &#34;God help Australia!&#34; God has helped Australia, absentees included. But I would point out to the honorable senator that the latter part of the definition amply meets the case which he has put. We all thoroughly understand that a gentleman may leave Australia upon business, but when he does so, he leaves his family, his home, and his interests here, even though he maybe absent for six months, or twelve months, or two years. It will be quite easy for him to satisfy the Commissioner that he has not become a resident of another part of the world, and that he is not an absentee. Consequently, I do not think there is any need for the amendment. The clause is satisfactory as it stands, and under it no genuine Australian will suffer hardship. </para>

If a person is absent from Australia for more than half that lime, and it is clearly evident that he has left the Commonwealth and has taken up his residence permanently somewhere else he will become an absentee for the whole of that year. I do not see that he can be treated otherwise. </para>

                    <para>. - It is ridiculous to suppose that the Commissioner of Taxes would, for the purpose of making a man an absentee, add together two or three weeks at one time of the year and two or three weeks at another. As far as I can see, it is impossible under this Bill for a citizen to be classed as an absentee unless he is away six months continuously. It would only create confusion to make an alteration of the kind suggested. </para>

                            GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;2.47&#93;.- On a previous occasion the Minister, in referring to absentees, said that it would not matter whether a man was away from Australia twelve months or two years as long as he made his home here. Now, however, the Minister points out that a man might be classified as an absentee if he were away for twelve months. I am quite sure that the intention of the Government was not to impose extra taxation on a man who is merely out of Australia on a holiday.

                        <para>. - Every one has a clear idea in his own mind as to what an absentee is. If a person leaves Australia to take up his residence abroad, and starts business in another country, he is evidently an absentee, although he may not be away from this country for three months. It would be useless for such a man to attempt to prove to the Commissioner that he was not an absentee. But if he is a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> Australian, he may be away for two years, and may still satisfy the Commissioner that his business required him to be away for that period, in which case he would not be an absentee. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to draw attention to a class of cases well within the knowledge of honorable senators. I refer to men who, for business reasons, are continually travelling between Australia and New Zealand. I happen to know a gentleman whose home is in New South Wales, but who is not actually in that State more than three months in the year. The rest of his time he is either on the water or in the Dominion. Under the clause as it stands, that man would be regarded as an absentee, because for more than six months in the year he is out of Australia. But under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway&#39;s</inline> amendment he would be exempt from extra taxation, because his absence from Australia is not continuous. There is, surely, no desire to insert in. the Bill a definition which must be harassing to certain sections of the community. Neither is it desirable to throw upon a man the obligation to go to the Commissioner and demonstrate that he is a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> Australian. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has suggested that such a person may appoint a legal representative. I have yet to learn that members of the legal profession work for nothing. Probably in some cases it would be troublesome to supply the Commissioner with evidence. It is quite evident that a commercial traveller who is continuously travelling between Australia and New Zealand is not an absentee. Yet under the Bill the Commissioner would have no option but to regard such a man as an absentee. Of course, if the Minister is prepared to resist all amendments, we may as well abandon our attempts to improve the Bill. But the principle of the measure is not touched by the amendment which is submitted simply with the object of making the measure work more smoothly. </para>

                    <para>. - For the life of me, I cannot see that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> &#39;s amendment would improve the Bill. If it were carried, persons who were away from Australia for six months continuously would still have to satisfy the Commissioner that they were not absentees. Of course, I do not want to see any citizen of Australia put to inconvenience by the Bill. We are not legislating to inconvenience people, but simply to give effect to a principle which the people are desirous to have carried out. The difference between the clause as it stands and as it would read if the amendment were made is not of sufficient importance to justify a division. </para>

                    hit the right nail on the head when he said that we do not legislate to inconvenience people. We all assent to that. The second reading of this Bill having been carried, we wish to assist in removing any possibility of inconvenience. When I was speaking last week, I stated emphatically that I am in favour of taxing absentees - that is, absentees of a particular kind, whom I then attempted to define; namely, persons who have lived in Australia, and who have made their means here, and have enjoyed the benefits of the prosperity generally enjoyed in Australia, and who practically desert the country which has been so good to them.

                        <para>- I am not dealing with that just now. I have described the kind of absentee I should do anything in my power to get at. Men of that character should not be assisted, but should, I think, be made to pay for their dereliction of duty as Australian citizens. There is the other class of so-called absentees, comprising persons who have never been here, and, it may be, corporate bodies that have lent money to Governments or individuals in Australia, which has been utilized in promoting the prosperity of the country. The first part of the definition covers every one who does not reside in Australia. I do not deal with that, because I consider that in agreeing to the second reading of the Bill we affirmed the principle proposed by the Government of applying a different scale of taxation to those who have never been here before, but who are not absentees in the sense in which I use the term. The first part of the definition is clear and general, and it might apply to Australians who are not residing in Australia or in Territories under the control of the Commonwealth at the time the ownership of the land and the incidence of the tax are ascertained. But to make quite sure the draftsman, acting upon the instructions of the Government, included two other definitions to cover those who might try to escape taxation on the scale applied to absentees by claiming that they resided in Australia, although they happened for a time to be away from the Commonwealth. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> includes a person who -  is absent from Australia and such Territories at the time when Hie ownership of his land for Hie; purposes of this Act is determined. </para>

                </interjection>
                <para>I think that is rather a hard provision, because the person might be away from Australia only on a short trip at the time the ownership of the land was ascertained. That should be obvious on the face of the papers, which would show that they were made out by an attorney or representative, and is a clearly ascertainable condition of things. Then we come to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of the definition, which suggests a condition of things which is not so clearly ascertainable, and the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> would meet the convenience of owners of land who will be taxed under this scheme, whilst it would in no way derogate from the effect of this definition. As it stands, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> includes a person who -  has been absent from Australia and such Territories during more than half of the period of twelve months immediately preceding that date. </para>
                <para>The reference is to the date at -which the ownership of the land is determined. I direct the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> to the fact that this would be covered by paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> if the absence were at the time at which the date of the ownership of the land is determined. But paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> is not intended to refer to the same kind of absence as that covered by paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> The absence covered by paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> might be made up of odd periods of absence during the twelve months, amounting in all to an absence of six months. In such a case the land-owner would be liable to taxation as an absentee under this Bill, unless he went before the Commissioner, and satisfied him that he was a resident of Australia. There is no disability upon a man who is a resident of Australia, and may be occasionally absent from the Commonwealth, but in the cases covered by paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> there is thrown upon the land-owner die obligation of satisfying the Commissioner that he is a resident of Australia. I suspect from the wording of the Bill that the land-owner would be required to personally satisfy the Commissioner. If we provided that the absence should be a continuous absence of six months, it would be fair to put upon the land-owner the obligation of satisfying the Commissioner that he is still a resident of Australia, but if the six months may be computed by adding odd days or months of absence during a period of twelve months, we might inflict hardship upon a taxpayer, which, I think, we should all desire to relieve him of. </para>

                        <para>- It is more reasonable to ask that a man who has been away from Australia for six months continuously should satisfy the Commissioner that he is still a resident of Australia than to ask that a man who is away occasionally for a month or two at a time should be required to do so. The presumption in the first case would be that the man had an intention to change his domicile, whilst that would not be a reasonable assumption in the second case. I suggest to the Vice-President of the Executive Council that, in all the circumstances, he might very well agree to accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to repeat my request to the Vice-President of the Executive Council to accept the amendment. I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> and those who may be influenced by what he said, that, while we all agree that there is no intention on the part of the Legislature to legislate for the inconvenience of anybody, honorable senators must realize that under this Bill an obligation will be thrown upon every one whose total absence from Australia during a period of twelve months exceeds six months, to make an application to the Commissioner to direct that he shall not be regarded as an absentee. That must very seriously inconvenience a considerable section of the community. </para>

The Commissioner must, unless he is satisfied to the contrary, declare a person an absentee. Let me put the case in this way. Assuming that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> went away from Australia and was absent for six months and three weeks in all during a period of twelve months, does the honorable senator not realize that automatically the Commissioner must decree that he is an absentee? </para>

A man may be away from home when the taxation demand is received, and may find on his return that there are only two or three days within which he can comply with the demand if he wishes to avoid the proceedings which may eventuate. Is there any provision in the Bill which will indicate to the  taxee  that he is to be treated as an absentee or not? If there were a separate form to be sent out, if there were something to indicate to him straight away that he was being treated as an absentee and that he would be heard within a certain period by the Commissioner or the DeputyCommissioner, there might be some justice and some reason in a provision of that kind. But if he is simply to receive a taxation claim and a notice of the amount of the demand made upon him, and it is not to be indicated to him that he is being so treated, it is not just. * </para>

The first definition in this clause describes an absentee as a person who resides out of Australia, and then proceeds to indicate the period when absenteeism begins. lt includes individuals who own land values in Australia and have never been within its borders, and also those who have been resident in Australia for years, probably for half a lifetime, but who, having amassed wealth, have come to the conclusion that in the interest of the  aristocratic upbringing of their children it would be better for them to reside in Paris, London, Glasgow, or Edinburgh. </para>

Having come to that decision, these persons remove their families and their removable effects, and so sever their connexion with Australia except as regards the land values which they own here. I have stated several times that therein lies the convenience of fixing a period which will denote when absenteeism commences. A man who had been away from Australia for only three months out of a year might be an absentee, because he had shifted everything and taken up his residence elsewhere. But the Bill in effect says, &#34; We shall not make you an absentee until within the twelve months prior to the time ot proving the ownership - within the financial year - you have been absent for six months,&#34; that is for half of the period. Under the amendment, however, a man who owned ^100,000 worth of land values might become an absentee, but evade taxation by not being continuously absent for the six months. He would incur some expense, but the saving of the extra penny would amount to between .&#163;400 and ,&#163;500. Would it not pay a man to slip over from, say, Ceylon at the end of five months, stop here for a few days, and then go away, if in that one year he could save &#163;200 or &#163;300, and so defeat the real intention of the Act ? </para>

                        <para>- Unless a man has lived in the Commonwealth for six months continuously we do not allow him to have a vote; but in this measure we say to a man, &#34; If you go out of Australia for three months twice during a year, we shall tax you as an absentee.&#34; I suggest that the Minister should try to bring the Bill into reasonable accord with the Franchise Act in that regard, and tax a man as an absentee if he has been absent for six months continuously within the year. My amendment is perfectly reasonable and fair. The persons who will be mostly injured by the method in which the Commissioner may interpret the law will be commercial travellers who work between Australia and New Zealand. It is of no use to tell us that the Commissioner will be a wise man, and all that sort, of thing. </para>

I again direct attention to the fact that the wording of the clause is not to the effect that an absentee is a person who has been absent &#34; from Australia and such Territories &#34; during the six months immediately preceding the date when he has to hand in an assessment of his land, but during half of the period of twelve months. </para>

                        <para>- I am reading from the clause, and if the Minister wants to explain that it means something else, I ask him to move the amendment. What attracted my attention was that the words &#34; six months &#34; were not used, as in the Franchise Act, but the words &#34; half of the period of twelve months,&#34; which clearly means that you&#39; can add up the periods for which a man is absent, and if they come to .six months and a week, he may be proved to be an absentee. Let me illustrate how I think the provision is likely to work out in actual practice. Suppose that I am a commercial traveller who has to go over to New Zealand, say, every two months. Before  1  leave Australia it will be necessary for me, on each occasion, to drop a line to the Commissioner, explaining that I am about to go over to the Dominion on a trip. </para>

I suggest to my honorable friend that he should not treat this amendment in a hostile fashion, but try to realize that by accepting it he will bring the measure into consonance with measures which we have passed, because what the Government mean is continuous absence for six months. There is nobody in the Chamber, I venture to say, who does not recognise that six months&#39; absence under this clause means continuous absence, and not several temporary absences. Therefore, I ask the Government to consider whether they cannot introduce the word &#34;continuously.&#34; </para>

                    <para>.- Inasmuch as the usual parliamentary practice has been to postpone the definition clauses of Bills until the substantive clauses have been dealt with, I venture to suggest to the Vice-President of the Executive Council that he should adopt a similar course upon the present occasion. The Bill contains a full page and a half of definitions in addition to seventy-one clauses. Quite a number of amendments have been foreshadowed, and it may be that after we have enacted the substantive clauses we shall take an entirely different view of the terms set out in the definition clause from that which we now entertain. In these circumstances I suggest that the consideration of this clause should be postponed. </para>

I am very sorry to use such a word in relation to so amiable a gentleman as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> but he knows perfectly well that his statement is not in accordance with fact. The definition clause has figured at the commencement of almost every Bill which has occupied the attention of this Parliament, and it is not a fact that it has been the custom to postpone its consideration until the substantive clauses have been dealt with. I would remind honorable senators that if the definitions in this Bill are not clearly understood before the remaining clauses of the measure are the subject of consideration we shall find ourselves upon almost every provision discussing what the definition of certain terms is likely to be. Thus the debate will be protracted to twice the length it would otherwise occupy. If we deal with the definition clause now, there is no doubt that the consideration of the Bill will be expedited. Much as I would like to accede to the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> I cannot see my way to agree to a course which is not in accordance with the usual practice. </para>

The persistency with which members of the Opposition are urging the amendment suggests that there is a deep, dark, mysterious plot on foot to allow the millionaire to escape. They know that owing to the rapid development of the aeroplane, millionaires who may be absent from Australia will be able to return after a few hours&#39; flight, and thus to escape the tax. It is quite unnecessary for the Government to give way on this point, especially as the persistency with which the amendment is being urged indicates that there is some mysterious plot on foot. I think we had better stick to our guns. </para>

                        <para>- Under the Commonwealth Franchise Act, we provide that residence in Australia must be continuous for six months. Now that we wish to impose a penalty upon persons who are absent from the Commonwealth, I claim that we ought to follow the precedent which we have already established. Let us make the analogy complete by providing in this Bill that absentees must be continuously absent from Australia for a specified period. If we fail to do that this clause will undoubtedly drag into it persons who ought not to be covered by it. So far no valid reason has been advanced by honorable senators opposite as to why the word &#34; continuously &#34; should not be inserted. What injury would result from the adoption of the amendment? The danger is that under the clause, in its present form, persons whose absence may aggregate more than six months in a year may be penalized. It is within the knowledge of every layman that it has been found impossible to convince learned Judges of the common-sense interpretation which should be placed upon words. Cases have had to be taken to the Appeal Courts, and even to the Privy Council, in order to convince them. All this trouble will be avoided if the Vice-President of the Executive Council will abandon his attitude that we must not amend the Bill, even to the extent of crossing a &#34;t&#34; or dotting an &#34; i.&#34; </para>

                    <para>. - I would not have troubled the Committee with any observations on this amendment but for the fact that honorable senators opposite appear to be anxious to throw dust in the eyes of the people outside. Senators Chataway and St. Ledger have argued that because we confer the franchise upon citizens who continuously reside in Australia for six months, we ought not to declare a man an absentee unless he is continuously absent from the Commonwealth for six months. But I would point out that under such a provision a man might be absent from Australia half-a-dozen times in six months, and thus become entitled to the exemption. </para>

                        <para>- If we are going to adhere to the definition of &#34; residence,&#34; which is laid down in the Commonwealth1 Franchise Act, it is not right that we should provide in this Bill for continuous absence, because the opposite of continuous residence is not continuous residence. If we say that citizenship means continuous residence for six months, then a man cannot be a citizen if he is not present in Australia for a continuous period of six months. Under this amendment, he might be away from Australia half-a-dozen times in the course of a year. There is nothing whatever in the contention, because, as has been pointed out, if a man can prove that he is a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> resident of Australia, he escapes the extra taxation. In every taxing measure that I have ever seen passed by any Parliament, extended powers have been taken. It has been exceedingly necessary to take those powers on behalf of the authorities which are saddled with the responsibility of collecting the tax. Otherwise, there would be loopholes for escape. It is possible that&#39; honorable senators opposite may have serious amendments to propose which will be worthy of a good deal of consideration.; That being so, it is a pity, and merely displays an obstructive spirit, that they should propose a silly amendment of this sort, which merely takes up time and attention, and prevents consideration being given to more serious propositions. I am inclined to give the fullest possible consideration to every genuine amendment from the Opposition side, but the present amendment has not been proposed in a serious fashion. It would be possible under it for a land-owner to spend in Australia only three days in the year, and yet not be an absentee. Furthermore, I point out that at the end of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> appears the word &#34;or,&#34; showing that the paragraph under consideration is an alternative. If a person can satisfy the Commissioner that he resides in Australia, or in any Territory under the authority of the Commonwealth, he will not be an absentee, and the amendment is riot necessary for his protection. In my opinion, the amendment is moved primarily in the interests of people who may be mere visitors to Australia. </para>

                    <para>- - It appears to me that all honorable senators who have spoken desire to do the same thing, although some desire to do it in a different way from others. The first thing that a land-owner has to do under this Bill is to send in a return to the Commissioner, who will tax him. If he disputes the amount of the tax, he will be able to appeal to the Commissioner. If he is not then satisfied, the action he will take will depend upon the amount he has to pay. If the amount be small, in all probability, he will prefer to pay than to fight the Commissioner. Suppose a man is connected with a business house in Sydney which has a branch establishment in New Zealand. He must spend a good deal of his time travelling backwards and forwards. The clause, as it stands, will put such an individual to a good deal of trouble. I do not desire to see any genuine absentee escape payment of the tax. I believe that absentees should be taxed. But a man who lives in Australia, and merely goes abroad on business should not be treated as though he were not a genuine Australian citizen. </para>

                <para>I cannot see how the amendment would create a loophole of escape. A person who takes up his residence abroad cannot avoid taxation under this measure. When the Bill was first introduced, we were told by the Vice-President of the Executive Council that it was perfect. Now, however, the Government have brought down a whole sheaf of amendments, showing that the measure is very defective. Of course, we know from experience that we have to take statements by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> with a grain of salt. In his humorous moods, observations that he makes cannot be regarded as sober statements of fact. If every amendment is to be met as this one has been, what is the use of parliamentary debate at all ? The Caucus meets in advance, the Government rely on their majority, and no amendment is considered on its merits. </para>

They are dealt with in the first portion of the clause, which defines what an absentee is. Then the clause goes on to include others, but not to exclude those already defined. </para>

                        <para>- We cannot tax people on their intentions. I have no doubt that it is disappointing to my honorable friends opposite to know that. Persons resident abroad, but who might come to Australia for a few days of the year, would not be exempt from being classified as absentees under the Bill itself. But then the clause goes on to deal with those who have been absent from Australia for certain purposes. They are the people in whose interest the amendment has been moved - residents of Australia who are called upon, because of their business, to visit other countries, but whose absence is not permanent. Their homes and their families are here, and they are legally resident here. Vet this Bill throws upon them the obligation once a year of going to the Commissioner, and proving to him that they are residents. What advantage is it from the point of view of this Bill to require such persons to prove their residence in Australia? </para>

                        <para>- It is not such a simple process as my honorable friend may suppose; but even if it were, why should we throw an obligation of that sort upon residents? It would entail upon busy men some amount of worry, trouble, and inconvenience. The amendment does not enable a single individual who is not a resident of Australia to escape. He is already tied up by the first portion of the clause. A provision is proposed which, without affording any protection to the revenue against those who may fraudulently desire to escape just taxation, will be a source of irritation and annoyance to the taxpayers of the country. I can see no reason whatever for the refusal to accept the amendment, seeing that under the first part of the definition genuine absentees are completely provided for. </para>

                        <para>- We are not making things more difficult than is necessary for the genuine residents of Australia, hut we are taking good care that it shall not be easy for the absentee to escape just taxation, as he has done too often in the past. The attitude which the Opposition have taken up towards this clause has reminded me of the man who objected to &#34; an absentee tax, or any other kind ot tax, on tea.&#34; No doubt the real objection of the Opposition is to a tax of any kind. The most objectionable person with whom we have to deal is the absentee. </para>

It has been pointed out that if a man were absent for a period of six months continuously, it would not be unreasonable to tax him as an absentee if he could not satisfy the Commissioner that he was a resident of Australia.

                            has said that it would be an easy matter to satisfy the Commissioner that a man was a resident of Australia, but let me remind him that the Commissioner will not know a tithe of the residents of the Commonwealth. A man is represented as being an absentee, and the Commissioner does not know him from Adam, and has never heard of him before. He will say, &#34; You must satisfy me that you have your home in Australia.&#34; It will not be enough for the man to say, &#34;I am not an absentee; I am a resident of Australia.&#34; He will have to satisfy the Commissioner at least by a declaration, which will probably have to be corroborated by some person occupying a responsible position, such as a magistrate or a notary.

This will be but an added annoyance to the many annoyances that are always associated with taxation. I remind honorable senators also that it will add to the work of administration, and so far as I can see for no good purpose. One would not be justified in saying that the purpose is to harass and annoy taxpayers, because I suppose that is not the intention. I recognise that the Government wish to make sure that there shall be no leakage, and I am not supporting the amendment in order to enable people to escape taxation. I think it would in no way impair the efficiency of the clause, but it would prevent unnecessary irritation and annoyance to Commonwealth taxpayers. </para>

                        <para>- To carry out <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s idea it might be well to add a proviso that no commercial traveller shall be deemed to be an absentee. Assuming, as a matter of grace and favour, that he is permitted to own a bit of land, I do not suppose the Government believe that he should be penalized, brought under the ban of an absentee and taxed more than a resident, and should be obliged once every year - personally, I think, but whether by representative or personally is immaterial - to appear before the Commissioner and undergo an examination as to the time he was absent from Australia, and satisfy the Commissioner that he still wishes to have the honour of being considered a resident of Australia. The thing seems preposterous. The object of the clause is to declare that every one who is not a resident of Australia is an absentee, and to throw upon the persons covered by paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> the onus of satisfying the Commissioner that they are residents of Australia. If this were to be done once and for all it would not be so bad, but under the Bill as it stands it will have to be done every year. The simple remedy is to insert the word &#34; continuously.&#34; It is not altogether reasonable to provide that a person who has been continuously absent for six months shall be regarded as an absentee. But it is less reasonable to say that a man who may be absent for a week or two at a time, but for six months in all, out of a period of twelve months, shall be regarded as an absentee unless he satisfies the Commissioner that he is a resident of Australia. As honorable senators on this side have said, it will not be a mere matter of form to satisfy the Commissioner, who will have judicial functions to perform. If we insert the word &#34; continuously &#34; we shall have a definite period of absence imposing upon the land-owner the obligation to satisfy the Commissioner that he is a resident of Australia. Unless some such amendment is made in the clause, an amending Bill will have to be introduced before very long, because I hope the self-respect of people who must be absent occasionally from the Commonwealth will be so much shocked by this provision that it will lead to a kind of revolt. A system of taxation which in itself is oppressive and inquisitorial should not be made more so, and the convenience of the taxpayer should be considered more than it appears to be by this provision. </para>

It gives a great deal more than any one intending to be an absentee from Australia deserves to get. As soon as ever any persons intend to be absentees it will be their duty to go and inform the Commissioner, and to my mind they ought to be charged from that very moment. But in the definition we allow an absence for one half of the year. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> in his kindly liberality to those who care so little about Australia that they are prepared to leave it for good and all, wants to give them three years. I hope it will be in gaol. </para>

                            GOULD (New South Wales)  &#91;4.22&#93;.-  The Government and their supporters appear to misunderstand the object of the amendment.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline>
                            has stated very fairly that it is borrowed from the New Zealand Act. We know that New Zealand is not a country where very much revenue is allowed to escape through any fault of the law. Honorable senators on the other side think that a man should not be away from Australia for more than six months. But the necessities of some persons are such that they are frequently called upon to be absent for much longer periods. They have the interests of Australia quite as much at heart as have men who have never gone abroad, and they contribute equally to its revenue. There seems to be an idea that directly a man sees fit to go out of Australia he should be regarded as an enemy rather than as a friend. It would be a very great advantage to many honorable senators if they had an opportunity of visiting other countries and realizing that there are men at the head of public affairs abroad who are inclined to deal with questions much more liberally than they are prepared to do. I am sorry that the Government are taking up this hostile attitude.

                <para class="block">Take the case of Australians who have to be in the Imperial Navy for a considerable time. Why should they have thrown upon them this liability to become absentees? I want to relieve an Australian who may be performing a public duty in the service of the Empire or of the Indian Government just as much as he would be relieved if he were a servant of the Commonwealth or of a State. It happens that a member of the Senate is an Imperial officer, whose services might be required in India at any time. Is it reasonable that he should have either to accept the responsibility of being an absentee, and paying the higher rate of taxation, and having withdrawn from him the exemption, or to accept the annual obligation of proving that he is a resident of Australia temporarily absent? Every argument which justifies the relief of an officer of the Commonwealth or &#39;of a State from the obligation can also, in my judgment, be urged in support of my amendment. </para>

                        <para>- No, because this part of the definition of absentee merely says that it shall not apply in certain cases. I do not suggest that the wording of my amendment is perfect, but if the Minister approves of it, it will not be very difficult for him to find a better form of words. It is extremely hard, and against public policy, that we should not give the advantage of this relief to an Australian who may be called upon to serve the Crown in India, or to go on a diplomatic service, and who is as much a servant of the Crown as if he were employed by the Government of the Commonwealth or of a State. </para>

                        <para>- Let me give an instance. Eliminating all the words which have no bearing on my argument, the first definition of &#34; unimproved value&#34; is based on the assumption that the improvements had not been made. Let us take a piece of land and see how the position would work out. Under that paragraph, the unimproved value of a piece of land the improved value of which is &#163;3 per acre, and the cost of improving which was 5s. per acre, would be &#163;2 15s. per acre. That is the value which a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> seller would require, assuming the improvements had not been made. But when we attempt to arrive at its &#34;unimproved value under the next definition, a very different result is brought about. The lane? I repeat, is worth <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> per acre, and the improvements cost 5s. per acre. But although they cost only 5s. per acre, they may have added very much more than that amount to the value of the land. They may, indeed, have added to its value by <inline font-style="italic">-&#163;i</inline> per acre. If we deduct that added value of the land from its full value, we shall see that its unimproved value is only ^2 as against <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 15s. under the preceding provision.

It would be a great improvement on the clause, and,_in addition, it would remove the conflict which exists between the definition which I am seeking to amend and the succeeding definition. From the experience of New South Wales I am satisfied that the more simple the language in which we set out these definitions the better it will be for those who have operations under the Bill. In the minds of everybody the unimproved value of land is its improved value less the value of the improvements. </para>

                    <para>. - Surely the Vice-President of the Executive Council has entirely missed the point of my amendment. He has spoken of improvements, the value of which evaporates by process of time. But such improvements are not in any way touched by my proposal. &#34; Less the value of improvements &#39; &#39; would mean the value of improvements at that particular time. If &#163;100 had been expended upon constructing a dam fifteen years ago, and it had depreciated in value to &#163; 10 at the time the valuation was made, its value would be set down at ;&#163;ro. </para>

                        <para>- How can they be? There is no subject which has given rise to greater conflict than the question with which we are dealing. It is not so easy as it looks to determine the unimproved value of land. We have here a very clear definition. It is stated that the value of improvements is to be the value which they add to the land, irrespective of their cost. They may have cost ^5, but may have added <inline font-style="italic">&#163;$0</inline> to the value of the land. In that case ^50 is to be taken as their value under this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> admits that that is fair. Very well, then, let us have the same provision in the previous definition. We should not have in one definition a provision that the bare value of the improvements is to be taken into account, and in another the provision that, not the cost or value of the improvements, but the value that has been added to the land, is to be considered. There is a difference that has led to trouble, and will lead to trouble later on. I propose to remedy it in a very simple way. </para>

                        <para>- I absolutely despair of producing any effect upon the mind of the honorable senator by argument, -if he says such a thing. I am quite serious. I never was more conscious than I am now - even though I lay myself open to a charge of egotism in saying so - that this is a question which I understand. There is here a conflict on a matter which has been fought out dozens of times in the Land Courts of New South Wales, and which, in one case, was carried to the Privy Council. I refer to the case of the Iandra improvements. The Minister says that there is no conflict, though this difference has been the subject of protracted litigation; and when I mention it some honorable senators opposite laugh, as if I were not pointing out a danger in the very Bill which they profess to have so much at heart. The point at issue, I say again, is that in the one case you are to take the value of the improvements, and in the other you are to take, not the value of the improvements, but the value which those improvements have added to the land. These are two different things I am attempting to remedy the conflict by a simple amendment. If the Minister is not satisfied with the form of the amendment, he can consult the draftsman as to an improvement upon it. </para>

                    <para>. - I take it for granted that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is in earnest, or he would not speak as he has done. But in the drafting of this Bill it has been made clear that the unimproved value of land is to be taken to be the value of any land in question as if nothing whatever had ever been done to improve it. There is no conflict between the two definitions to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has referred. In many instances improvements tan be made that give no value to land. Vet the owner might claim an allowance for them. If a land-owner were foolish enough to build a windmill where there was no probability of gaining any advantage from wind, and he claimed for improvements because the windmill had cost him &#163;5,000, he would have no right to sustain that claim. I remember that in South Australia a station-owner sank a well at considerable expense. The water was so bad that when he put 3,000 old ewes into the paddock, they died in three weeks from drinking the water. He spent ,&#163;3,000 in constructing tanks and troughs and putting up a windmill. He claimed for those improvements, so-called, though they had added no value to the land. It is to avoid claims of that description that those definitions have been drafted. I am perfectly prepared to take them as they stand. </para>

                        <para>- It does not require much intelligence for a man to know, in this country, that the grazing capacity of land is increased by ring-barking the timber upon it. Such knowledge is a merely elementary in connexion with Australian land settlement. I will show why the cost of such improvements should be allowed under the one definition and not under the other. I will give an example. On the holding where I was at one time farming in Riverina there was a certain area of land which had been ring-barked some years before. The Land Board charged me with the value of those improvements. But, as a matter of fact, there was no real improvement at all ; because, subsequent to the ring-barking, the suckers that had grown up had exhausted any value that the process had once given to the land ; and, as a matter of fact, had rendered it worse than it was before. </para>

The previous pastoral lessee had constructed a tank, for which excavations had had to be made. I had to pay him for it. He said to me, &#34;  1  think it is fair for you to allow me so much, because the tank was made, not by the modern methods of scooping, but by taking out the stuff with a cart and horse.&#34; I said, &#34; I do not care if you took it out with a teaspoon; all I am going to pay you for that tank is its present value to me.&#34; Whether the price of labour was i os. a week or 15s. a clay was not pertinent to the issue, so far as I was concerned. I said that I would pay what I could get an excavation of the same size done for at that time. </para>

                        <para>- What I was willing to pay was a fair thing as between the individuals concerned and the Crown. If an improvement had been effected in the matter of ring-barking, which, on the one hand, might have caused that land to be worth 15s. or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> an acre more, although the actual work only cost 5s. an acre, it would not be fair to allow a concession in accordance with the value given to the land by the improvement. He expended only the labour necessary to ring-bark the country, and Nature did the rest. I see no reason why we should exempt from taxation an improvement due to the operation of natural causes. </para>

                    <para>. - What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has said is unanswerable, but the clause does not support it. The difficulty is that the definition as set out in the first paragraph comes into conflict with the second, in which an entirely different definition is given. It rests as an obligation upon the friends of the Bill to reconcile this difference. If they accept the definition which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has given as the basis for determining the value of an improvement, they should not accept the next paragraph, which says that the value of the improvement shall be estimated not on the basis of what it cost to make it, but on the basis of the additional value which is added to the land. That is the very thing which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> does not desire. </para>

                        <para>- I said at not more than it has cost. To take that as a basis would be in accordance with the first definition. But let me ask the honorable senator how he can support the next definition, that the value of an improvement is to be the value it adds to the land irrespective of the cost of making it? I take the case which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has suggested of ring-barking as an improvement. The timber is rung and left there for a time until it has become so dry as to reduce the cost of clearing the land for the plough to a minimum. The ring-barking may have cost 2s. or 3s. an acre, and may have added <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> an acre to the value of the land to a man who wants it for the plough. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> following the first definition, says that what we must deduct from the value of the land is the cost of the improvements ; we must value the land as if the improvements were not there. But the second definition provides for an entirely different basis of valuation. It provides that we shall ask what the improvement has added to the value of the land. It may have cost 2s. 6d. an acre, and have added <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> an acre to the value of the land. Honorable senators must recognise the conflict between these two definitions, and if they will not adopt my method of removing it, they should themselves accept the responsibility of bringing the two definitions into harmony. </para>

                        <para>- I am not speaking as an authority on land values. As a matter of common sense I take it that the unimproved value is the improved value less the value of improvements. I think that the first State in Australia to suggest the true basis on which to ascertain the unimproved values was the State of Queensland, and the definition adopted there has been consistently adhered to. Unimproved value is clearly defined in section  195  of the Local Authorities Act of  1902  of Queensland. The definition therein contained has been tested in the Courts and uniformly adhered to. </para>

                <para class="block">That supplies the valuers of local authorities with a reliable guide in ascertaining the unimproved value of properties. What the Government have done in another place, and what apparently they propose to do here in spite of all we can say is this : They submit three fairly workable definitions of improved value, unimproved value, and value of improvements. But they nullify their effect by proposing a limitation in the definition of unimproved values. If we amend the definition of &#34; unimproved value&#34; by the omission of the words to which I have already referred, we shall closely approximate our definition to the Queensland definition I have quoted. The retention of those words can only give rise to endless confusion. The definition of the &#34; value of improvements &#34; is clear, and would be a useful guide to valuers when taken in conjunction with the definition of &#34;improved value,&#34; and would afford facilities to the Commissioner of Taxes to determine accurately the &#34;unimproved value&#34; almost without the possibility of mistake. I hope that the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to strike out the limiting words I have quoted will be adopted. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite aware that a certain type of man sees some ulterior object in everything that another says. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is welcome to his opinion. Having had his sleep, the honorable senator might now keep as quiet as he was when he was asleep. He was adorning the chamber and fulfilling a much more useful function when he was asleep than he has done since he woke up. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> just now laid down an unquestionable definition of the value of improvements from one stand-point. That is the definition adopted in the land laws of New South Wales. The value of an improvement is its value to an incoming tenant, but not exceeding the original cost of making the improvement. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is supporting the Bill in the belief that it provides for that, and therefore I cannot understand how he can support a definition which violates what he believes to be an essential principle. The principle is set out in the paragraph defining &#34; unimproved value.&#34; </para>

                </continue>
                <para class="block">I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> to look at the definition of the &#34; value of improvements &#34; and say whether that principle is not violated. There is no doubt that it is, and that there is a conflict between these definitions, the value of improvements being estimated on one basis in one, and on a different basis in another. If honorable senators think that the first definition is correct, they ought to amend the second, but if, on the contrary, they agree with me, they ought to amend the first. Let me give an illustration to show how it will work out. Under a later clause, a man who returns his land at 25 per cent, short of its value is liable to have it taken away from him. Take a case which was fought out before the Land Board in New South Wales, and which is known as the Iandra case. In that district, there was land with green timber, which was valued at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> an acre, while land which was alongside, and which formed the subject of the litigation, was valuable, and being sold then at over &#163;$ per acre. Owing to ring-barking and drying, the land with dry timber could be cleared for 10s. per acre, but the land with green timber would have cost at least 30s. per acre to clear. The result was that men were prepared to give <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per acre more to get on to the good land with dry timber than to get on to corresponding land with green timber. One pound, therefore, &#39; was added to the value of the land as the result of the expenditure of  2s.  or 3s. The first definition I referred to states that a man shall value his land practically on the basis of the cost of the improvements, which was 2s. or 3s. per acre. The second definition says that he shall not take the cost of the improvements, but the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> added to the value of the land by reason of the original expenditure. I am not arguing which definition is right, but certainly both definitions cannot be right. I am surprised that the Ministry do not see that a conflict exists, and for the sake of their own credit, set to work to remedy it. Possibly, the explanation is that the clause is not now as it left the hands of the draftsman. In the other House, there was a prolonged controversy over the first of these definitions. Amendment after amendment was submitted by the Attorney-Genera&#93;, one being submitted, withdrawn, and re-submitted. That is how I think the conflict between the two definitions arose. But whether that be so or not, under the first definition an owner is required to deduct from the value of his land only the cost of making an improvement. Let us assume that he follows the second definition, and says, &#34; I am entitled to take off the value added by the improvement. The land is worth &#163;$ per acre. The added value by reason of that improvement is ,&#163;1. I am entitled, under the definition of &#39; value of improvements &#39; to take off the value added to the land by the improvement, which is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1.&#34;</inline> He therefore returns the value of his land at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2.</inline> The Commissioner then comes along, under the previous definition, and says, &#34; You are liable to have your land forfeited, because you have not returned it within 25 per cent, of the true value. What you ought to have done was to take off the cost of the improvements, to value the land as if the improvements were not there &#34; ! In doing that, he would have brought the value of his land possibly to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 15s. or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 16s., as against <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2.</inline> I feel quite convinced, and I believe that I have impressed honorable senators with the fact, that there is a conflict between the two definitions. I shall be quite satisfied if the Ministry will tell me that they will confer with the draftsman on the point. I do not want particularly to move an amendment, but I do wish to see that, for our credit&#39;s sake, we do not pass a definition which is bound to be a source of trouble, conflict, and irritation. </para>

                    <para>. - I really think that the Minister ought to consider what he is doing. In the first place, we had an assurance from him that this was the most perfect measure which has ever been framed, and that it was almost inconceivable that any one could think for a moment that any alteration would be required. In his own graphic language, the honorable senator declared his determination to &#34; sit tight.&#34;Is this his method of sitting tight? It is hardly worth while to do to-day what you are likely to undo to-morrow. We have had an assurance from the Minister that it is intended to bring down other forms of taxation. He has explained quite clearly that the Government could not do everything at once. In view of that intention, I suggest that it is better to retain this definition as it is, so that they can make this officer Commissioner for the dozen new taxes which they intend to impose at a later period. </para>

                        <para>. - Sub-clause 2 of this clause provides that the Commissioner shall direct attention to any breaches or evasions of the Act which have come under his notice. How can he direct attention to breaches or evasions of the Act which have not come under his notice? It seems to me that the provision requires some explanation. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. After the exhaustive criticism to which this Bill was subjected in another place, the Vice-President of the Executive Council gets up and airily moves amendments without condescending to assign any reasons for them. It is obvious that the Commissioner cannot direct attention to evasions of the Act which have not come under his notice. </para>

If we are to assume that the Commissioner will have the necessary knowledge of evasions the words are unnecessary and absurd. If, on the contrary, there is a possibility of the Commissioner&#39;s deputies having a knowledge of these things, and not reporting them to him, or of the Commissioner not making himself familiar with their reports, the words constitute a danger, because they allow of a possibility of the Commissioner saying, &#34; These matters did not come under my notice.&#34; I have heard under-secretaries of Departments plead, in reference to matters of departmental business, that they had no personal knowledge of them. </para>

                <para class="block">The supporters of this Bill tell us that they desire to secure for the State the increment of value created in connexion with land by the community. We are engaged in taxing the increment of value. But, whereas under this Bill lessees of the Crown are to pay nothing, a man who has bought land from the Crown, and paid for it, is to be taxed. If a man has paid &#163;1 per acre to the Crown for his land, which is now worth per acre, he should only be taxed on the increment of &#163;2 per acre. I submit that the amendment is equitable, and trust that the Committee will agree to it. </para>

Apart from that consideration, however, the complications that would arise from putting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker&#39;s</inline> amendment into operation in connexion with the land tax would be so enormous that the difficulties of administration would be greatly increased. It has to be remembered that this is a land tax, not merely a tax upon increments. There is nothing about increments in the Bill. Increments have been introduced by honorable senators opposite for the purposes of argument, and to give them an opportunity of airing their eloquence and knowledge. </para>

                    <para>. - Justification for the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> is to be found in the speeches delivered in this Chamber, and from a hundred platforms throughout Australia. There is nothing upon which honorable senators opposite have been so eloquent as in pointing out how the landholders of Australia have benefited from the unearned increment, or as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has so often called it, the community-created value. It has been argued that, the community having created that value, was entitled to possess it. But clearly the community has no claim where there has been no increment. How can the community claim to take an increment that has not been created ? </para>

                        <para>- That has nothing to do with the principle of the system. The only interesting feature in connexion with the Wakefield system that occurs in connexion with this Bill is that no more pernicious legacy has been left to Australia than the fixed rate of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per acre which was determined upon in consequence of that system. I should like to put this to the Committee as an illustration of the imposing of a tax where there is no increment. Suppose that an honorable senator purchased a cottage for which he had previously been paying IOS. a week in rent. Suppose that after he had completed the purchase the landlord still called, and said, &#34; I want my rent.&#34; That is exactly what is going to happen under this Bill in regard to persons who have purchased land from the Crown. Having paid, we will say, their <inline font-style="italic">&#163;i</inline> per acre for their land, they are now to be taxed on the payment which they have made for it to the Crown. That is a simple illustration of what is going to happen. If honorable senators choose to say that the increment has no bearing upon this tax, I will admit that there is some force in that statement. But, nevertheless, there is not a single supporter of the Government who has not told the electors that we are called upon to impose a land tax because it is desirable to secure the increment. </para>

                        <para>- I quite admit that - except in the case of my honorable friend ! This amendment carries my memory back fifteen years, when I was associated with a similar proposition in the New South Wales Legislature. That was an amendment to exempt from the operation of a land tax land-owners who had purchased their land direct from the Crown, and paid &#163;1 per acre for it. There is no value there which can be fairly taxed unless you are levying a general property tax throughout the country. If you levy a general property tax, that 20s. worth of land is, of course, one form of property, and undoubtedly should pay its share. But when you come to talk of a land tax, you should surely exempt land as to which there is clearly no increment. </para>

                        <para>- It is not a question of exempting where there is no value. There is very little land in Australia that is not of some value. Even the poorest land of which I have any knowledge is worth  2s.  or 3s. per acre for its productive return. But where I have paid a sovereign for an acre of land to the Crown, the Crown has no right to tax me on that sovereign. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is welcome to that view ; but the only way in which the owner of land benefits is by an increase in the value of his land. We are dealing with lands where there is no increment of value, and the owners of whirl&#39; have derived no benefit which is not shared by every member of the community. If I pay &#163;1 an acre for land, and there is an additional value given to the land, the tax should fall upon that additional value ; but the State should not tax the sovereign represented by the acre of land that still remains of that value. There is no justification for taxing that, unless we impose a tax upon all forms of property. If that were done, I admit that we should be entitled to tax the original sovereign given for the land. By exempting the price originally paid to the Crown for land, we shall be establishing this taxation upon an understandable basis. We shall be taxing the community-created value - neither more nor less. I do not hesitate to say that I have never opposed a proposal to tax the community-created value. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator means that he is consistent in uttering the same thing always, I agree with him ; but I can charge him with inconsistency in regard to his action to-day, which is not consistent with the attitude he has previously adopted in this matter. I cannot expect to bind the honorable senator too closely to a form of consistency which his present political relationship might make inconvenient. The honorable senator has spoken more eloquently than I can hope to do, of the justification for levying a tax upon community-created values. It should be remembered that this Bill does not mark the final step in our taxation of land. The more definitely and clearly we make our appeal to the community in favour of a principle they can understand, and the more clearly we put before them a principle which is just in itself, the more likely they will be to adopt that principle and adhere to it permanently. I am a believer in the right of the community to take some portion of the community-created increment of value. But it is because  1  believe in that that I am bound to oppose a tax where there is no increment of value. The Government propose to levy this tax upon the original amount paid to the Crown for the land. The Crown has this money in its coffers, and can invest it at 4 per cent. ; and if it has not got this money in its coffers to-day, it has, by expending it upon public works, relieved itself of the necessity of raising a similar amount to cover the cost of those works. For the reasons I have given, I must say I expected a more sympathetic reception for the amendment than, judging by the attitude adopted by honorable senators opposite, it is likely to receive. </para>

They are very anxious that land-owners should not be taxed on the original price paid to the Crown for their land. But they seem to forget that, whether those in possession of land paid a large or a small price to the Crown for it, they have had the use of the land, in most cases for years, and have also had the benefit of a ten or twenty-fold increase in its value. </para>

                        <para>- I wish honorable senators to understand that, as the result of that investment of &#163;120, in 1837, members of a family who have never seen the land, have reaped an annual rental of &#163;30,000 from it for fifty years. In 1880, that land, which was bought for &#163;120 in 1837, was valued at over &#163;1,000,000. We are not going to tax the wealth of this family. We do not wish to do that. We are content that they should retain the profits derived from the investment. But what we say is that, in the future, the community is going to tax these land values, because it is the community that created them. If I paid &#163;1 an acre for land, I have had the use of it free of rent. </para>

                        <para>- We cannot compare land and cottages on the same basis, because while a man by his own industry may build a number of cottages, no man can create land. Honorable senators opposite are anxious to prevent land-owners being taxed on the original amounts they paid for their land, it may be fifty years ago. They forget that, during the fifty years, they have not only enjoyed the products of the land, but, in many cases, a hundred-fold increase in its value, which the people have created for them, but which they have put into their own pockets. </para>

                        <para>- I am not aware that land has any value at all, except that which is created by the community. If we gave a man the whole of Australia, and there was no community with which he could trade, he might get a living for himself if he worked hard every day in the year. The community gives land the whole of its value. If a man is in possession of a few acres or a few thousand acres, for which he paid a very small sum, it may be many years ago, he has annually been able to reap the productive value of the land, and in almost every instance, has reaped and pocketed the profits from the community-created value as well. The Leader of the Opposition and the honorable senator who moved the amendment are fighting for a section in the community that has, so far, shirked  paving  a fair share towards the cost of the government of the country, and will continue to shirk it as long as they can. </para>

I withdraw the words, in deference to your request, but I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> should be asked to withdraw the statement with which he followed them, when he said that we should not only know of his vindictive character, but should feel it, before six sears were up.

                        <para>- I desire to refer to the sympathy expressed by the Opposition for the big land-owners. I take it that it is the big land-owners who are going 10 be taxed. There are not a great many persons who now hold land which they originally purchased from the Crown, and, in a great majority of cases the amendment would apply to persons in the possession of land that has changed hands several times. I shall vote against the amendment, because the land-owners, for the amount originally paid to the Crown for their land, have had the use of that land. </para>

                        <para>- It is a fair exchange. They have had the use of the land for the money they paid for it, and in most cases, they have had as well the vast additional value added to the land by the community. Our honorable friends opposite lose sight of the fact that the profits which those who purchased their land from the Crown have pocketed from the additional value added to the land by the community will not be taxed under this Bill. It proposes only to tax community-created values in the future. The profits from this year&#39;s values will go into the pockets of the land-owners, but after this year, they will be asked to pay a tax of1d. in the &#163;1 on values over &#163;5,000, and because they will be called on next year to pay a tax of 1d. in the &#163;1 on the value of the land which they have in excess of &#163;5,000 honorable senators opposite are devising every means in their power to defeat that proposal. </para>

                        <para>- I did not think it necessary to add that on an estate worth &#163;10,000 the tax would be 2d. in the &#163;1, and so on. I believe that the sympathies of honorable senators opposite are with those who own more than &#163;75,000 worth of land, and will have to pay at the rate of 6d. in the &#163;1. It is about time that justice was done to the thousands of landless persons who have not only created the rich estates, and carried on the industries of the country, but have been compelled under the present form of taxation to provide for the upkeep of the Government. I intend to vote against the amendment for the simple reason that in the use of their lands the original buyers have had full value for the money which they have paid to the Crown. </para>

                        <para>- The land, I repeat, was sold in parcels of 20,000 acres. If the honorable senator looks up the articles of association of the South Australia Company, which was formed in London, he will find that the land had to be paid for in cash, but a third of the money had to be spent in bringing out immigrants from England for the purpose of working the land, a third in making roads and bridges, and a third to the Government. The whole of the money which was received for the land was ultimately placed in the hands of the land-holders. Is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> prepared to exempt the South Australian Company, and other large landholders in South Australia, the amount which they paid to the State, and which was returned to them in the way I have mentioned ? </para>

I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> to withdraw his amendment in justice to the people of Australia. The South Australian Company, whose headquarters are in London, is drawing thousands of pounds a year as rent from South Australia. Indeed, in the case of many properties, it is drawing rack-rents. Yet it is the rack-renter whom honorable senators opposite want to exempt from this tax. </para>

He may draw a picture of what has happened to some of the big land-holders, but let us look at the other side of the question. Are there no people in the Western Division of New South Wales who were compelled, under its land laws, to pay 25s. and 30s. an acre for land which was never worth 5s., in order to protect their improvements? </para>

                        <para>- All that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has been talking about has been the blunders of the State; but honorable senators on the other side are not leaving it to the State to rectify them. On the contrary, they say that because the blunders of the State have led to private profit, that is a justification for levying this tax on the lands. Let us look at the class of men whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is out to ruin, if he can, whom a vindictive class hatred is pursuing, who are struggling today, and have been reduced to such a condition that special legislation has had to be passed to induce them to remain on the land. The men of whom I am speaking are those whose land was never worth the amount which they paid to the Crown, nor is it likely to be in the lifetime of myself or any honorable senator here. </para>

                        <para>- I was pointing out that whilst honorable senators here were content to rely for arguments and illustrations on cases where there had been an enormous amount of community-created increment, which, I admit, is a fit subject for taxation, they were shutting out those cases where not only was there no increment created, but where the land was not worth as much as the Crown was paid. In those cases there was no attempt on the part of persons to build up big estates. They did not desire to do it because they knew that, so far as land value was concerned, there was not an acre of land in the Western Division of New South Wales for which they could afford to pay &#163;1 on a grazing basis. </para>

                    <para>. - In the main I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that the great bulk of the lands of Australia which have been alienated have received an increment, and that their owners have hitherto enjoyed that community-created value without being taxed upon it. Consequently, they have nothing of which to complain. I confess that at one time I believed in the proposal to exempt from taxation the amounts which were originally paid to the Crown as purchase money for these lands. But upon reconsideration I have come to recognise that there is a kind of academic fairness about that proposal which does not work out in practice. As the Leader of the Opposition himself admits, we have a perfect right to tax land as such. There is no obligation upon us to tax other forms of property. </para>

                        <para>- All this talk about a class tax comes with very bad grace from those who by their votes are supporting the class which gains most from the existing condition of affairs, and which escapes contributing its fair proportion to the revenue. I wish now to refer briefly to a matter which 1 know my South Australian friends will pardon me for mentioning. In the records of the New South Wales Parliament - I read it there eighteen or nineteen years ago - is a despatch which Wakefield forwarded to the Imperial authorities, and in which he stated that to make the South Australian settlement a success it was necessary to have dear land, so as to insure cheap labour. He argued that if the land were cheap every person who came to the country, instead of remaining in the service of his employers, would take up land for himself, and that, consequently, it was necessary to put a big upset price upon it, so that only the wealthy would be able to purchase it. This is the gentleman whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has described as a philanthropist. Though the despatch in question evidences a queer form of philanthropy, it contains the utterances of an honest, outspoken Tory - utterances to which none of the Tories of the present day have the pluck to give expression. They conceal all their opposition to every democratic proposal under the guise of Liberalism. A celebrated character in history once exclaimed, &#34; What deeds are done in thy name, 0 Liberty !&#34; and similarly we may exclaim, &#34; What deeds are done under the lovely name of Liberalism !&#34; I wish now to refer to a matter which is not one of sentiment, but of fact. Some time ago a deputation waited upon the Prime Minister to urge that this tax would oppressively affect the land-owners of Riverina. The members of that deputation presented figures, which were published in the metropolitan newspapers, showing how the tax would operate. They pointed out that they had given a certain price for their land - <inline font-style="italic">&#163;i</inline> per acre in the majority of cases - and that in many instances it was not returning them more than 3 &#163; per cent, upon the purchase price. They declared that the tax would operate so oppressively that in some cases it would eat up nearly all the income which they derive from their land, and that in others it would eat up the whole of that income and leave a deficit. They asked for relief upon the ground that the Crown had already received full value for their land. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is widely acquainted with the Riverina lands- I know that he has been over them. But I wish to point out that most of the land which these men occupy is well fitted for agriculture. </para>

                        <para>- I say that from Hay upwards there is a huge belt of country lying between the Murrumbidgee, the Edwards, and the Murray which a few owners have monopolized, and that there are thousands of settlers who would take up that land if the opportunity presented itself. It is mighty bad management on the part of the present owners if they can make out of it only 2 J per cent, upon their original outlay. There is no justification for a remission of the tax on the ground that it will swallow up the whole of their income from those lands. Their claim will not hold water for a moment, at any rate in the great majority of cases. I am quite prepared to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> statement that faulty legislation in New South Wales has forced men to buy land which they would have been very glad to have held upon rental. I admit that an injustice has been done owing to the operation of bad land laws which were enacted by the Parliament of New South Wales, although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> friends were responsible for those laws. If there are persons who are labouring under an injustice because they were compelled to buy lands which otherwise they would have rented, the duty of the New South Wales Government is to grant them compensation. It would be arrant folly for this Parliament to decline to sanction the imposition of a tax which is just in its incidence merely because a few cases of hardship will arise consequent upon bad legislation on the part of New South Wales. I repeat that if certain persons have suffered injustice by reason of that legislation, New South Wales should compensate them for the injury which has been inflicted upon them. But that is no reason why we should reject a tax which should have been agreed to long ago in the interests of the whole community. I repeat that, upon the face of it, it seems fair to say that nobody should be taxed on the purchase money paid for land to the Crown. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has pointed out, these land-owners have already had returned to them far more than they ever paid to the Crown, in addition to which they have enjoyed the community-created values attaching to their lands for a generation or two without paying any taxation whatever. So that if we were animated by class hatred - as has been suggested by honorable senators opposite - we would enact retrospective legislation. The land-owners may thank their stars that a party is in power which is animated by a spirit of justice and fair play, and which consequently allows them to escape. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker&#39;s</inline> proposal were adopted I should submit a further amendment for. the purpose of dealing with the hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of acres in New South Wales and the other States which have been dummied. Their owners committed forgery, perjury - indeed, almost every crime in the calendar - in order to dummy those lands. I admit that a great deal of this was directly due to bad legislation, which sometimes forced men to purchase land in order to prevent others from obtaining it. Consequently, they were frequently obliged to mortgage themselves up to the neck- </para>

It has already been remarked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that honorable senators opposite over and over again in their addresses to the electors dwelt upon the unearned increment which ought to be taxed. To be consistent, they should support this amendment, which will restrict the tax to the unearned increment so-called, and even then will yield a revenue of more than &#163;1,000,000 sterling. If the Bill goes through in its present form, experts throughout Australia agree that the tax will produce &#163;2,500,000. </para>

By this tax, the Government are endeavouring to place at a disadvantage men who, iri earlier days, instead of renting their lands, became freeholders, and paid to the Crown what was regarded as full value for them. In fact, in many cases they paid a great deal more than the value, in order that they might protect their properties from the inroads of selectors.

                        <para>.- They were compelled to protect themselves. In the early days of Australia&#39;s history, whatever may be the position of affairs to-day, it was eminently desirable that there should be a large number of persons, who, by owning land, acquired a stake in the country, of which probably they could not rid themselves without considerable loss. Some honorable senators appear to think that it would have been very much better had the land been nationalized. I do not hold that view. I believe that it is safer for a country to have men who are tied to it by the possession of land. </para>

                        <para>.- What has that to do with the present position ? It was necessary for the advancement of Australia that, in the early days, men should secure freeholds in this country. That was a means of tying them to the country. Why should men who invested their capital in landed property be disadvantaged in comparison with those who invested their money in securities that they could more easily get rid of ? Are we going to penalize those men, who, in order to advance Australia - and they did advance the country - put their money into the land? </para>

                        <para>- Do not all men in whatever form of industry they engage endeavour to advance their own interest? Of course they do. Those men who paid their <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per acre to the Crown have been legitimately enjoying the profits arising from their investment. At the same time, the Governments which received their money utilized it in the best interests of the community. It was a mere matter of exchange. The Government exchanged land for money which they used for general purposes, and those who bought the land made the best use of it in order to benefit themselves and the country at the same time. Some wonderful examples have been cited, such as that of a man who went to gaol for sixteen years, and whose property was enhanced enormously in value in the meantime. We have also had the example of a man named Howie, who purchased property in Melbourne about seventy years ago, and whose family have been living upon the proceeds ever since. But how many cases were there in which men who paid <inline font-style="italic">&#163;i</inline> per acre for  their land received no adequate return for their capital? Of course, there are examples in the &#34;great cities of Melbourne and Sydney of men whose properties have been increased enormously in value,- but there are other cases of people who gave a fair price for properties which are hardly worth a snap of the finger today. Are the Government going to refund to them the money they have lost ? No ; they simply say to the man who has bad the good luck to make money by his investment, that he shall be penalized, whilst the man who has had the misfortune to lose money has to hold to his bad investment. This is a tax on success. Of course, we know that taxation generally falls most heavily upon the successful; but, at the same time, it behoves us to be perfectly fair and honest as between man and man. Every member of the community, whether he be poor or rich, should have the same measure of justice meted out to him. That is what the Opposition are asking Tor. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has mentioned that in all probability the Government will derive  more  than ^2,000,000 of revenue from this land tax. Whether they will derive that much or more is beside the question. We  are  now debating what I take to be an abstract principle of justice. If the Government wanted 000,000, and this tax did not yield that sum, of course, they would have to look round for other sources  of  revenue. But whatever the yield may be, we ought to have a fair and square deal as between the Government and those who have bought property and paid honest money for it. They should at least receive the benefit of an exemption to the extent of the sum originally paid by them to the Crown. </para>

The cry of those who have demanded amended land laws in Australia has been that the community-created increment of value - the unearned increment as some call it - should be secured by the Government. </para>

                        <para>.- Nonsense. We tried to defeat the Bill at the second-reading stage, but we recognise that it has to be passed in some form. Whatever may have been said by any honorable senator, I simply state that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker&#39;s</inline> amendment deserves support, because it is in principle honest, fair, and just, and an attempt to improve a measure that I look upon as being brimful of iniquities. I have never attempted to screen my view of the Bill. </para>

All that the Government have to say now is, &#34; Resist all amendments.&#34; I do not believe that a single amendment will be made unless by the desire of the Government themselves. Their supporters will go together just like a flock of sheep following a bell-wether. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that honorable senators opposite are proceeding on a false assumption. The argument on this side is based on the premise that this Bill and the Land Tax Bill, which is to follow it, are founded upon the idea of taxing what is called &#34;the incremental value.&#34; Assuming for the moment that there is such a thing as an incremental value of land, the Opposition contend that the Government are unjustly applying the principle which they enunciate. On this question, I take leave to differ to some extent from the opinion expressed by my leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> In speaking on the second reading of the Bill, I said that for all lands which are made reproductive there is no such thing as incremental value. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will not go nearly so far as that, and there&#39; are probably very few in this Chamber who will be prepared to go so far. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> cheers, that proposition, and I shall show him at once that it is utterly ridiculous. Land may have a very large value which the community does not give it, and which nobody but the man who applies himself to that land gives it. I cite an instance from the town of Bendigo, which I visited about a month ago. Quite close to the gold mines, and almost in the heart of the town, there is land which, for over fifty years, was regarded as absolute waste. The area, perhaps, was not more than fifteen or &#39; twenty acres. A few Spaniards, who landed here in consequence of some advertisement as to the resources of Australia, and did not obtain employment in Melbourne, went on to Bendigo. Seeing this land, it struck them that they could make it of value. By bringing their agricultural skill and knowledge to bear, they were able, within twelve or eighteen months, to make that land reproductive, and the products they raised made .Bendigo famous throughout Australia. I ask who created the present value of that land? It was created by these Spaniards, and by the application of their knowledge of agriculture to it. What has been the result? Other persons in Bendigo, and amongst them miners, having seen what might be done with land of that quality, have taken up similar land around Bendigo, and have made it reproductive. Will honorable senators opposite contend that the community created the value, primarily or wholly, now existing in that land? They must admit that it might have remained in its original state for a hundred years if it had not been taken up by men of intelligence, who were able to discern its possibilities. It is on this indisputable set of facts that I base my objection to the use and application of the term &#34; incremental value&#34; embodied in this Bill. Let me deal now with another superstition, for I can call it nothing else, which was suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> The honorable senator mentioned an unchallengeable fact that fifty or sixty years ago a man secured some land in Melbourne for a few sovereigns, and that that land is to-day worth tens of thousands of pounds. I do not say that it might not be a proper thing to impose a tax upon the present owners of that land, but I can refer the honorable senator to land adjoining it which was bought only the other day for from &#163;80,000 to ,&#163;100,000. Here we have two persons owning blocks of land within a quarter of a mile of each other, and, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> though one was secured for a few pounds, and the other cost many thousands of pounds, the same principle of taxation is to be applied to both, and the value of both to their respective owners is to be estimated on the same basis. We may find a block of land ii: Collins-street for which the owner paid &#163;50,000 or &#163;60,000, and a few yards further down the street we may find an equally valuable block for which the present owner or his farther before him gave only a few pounds. It must be obvious that it is most inequitable to propose to treat the owners of these blocks on the same basis. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> mentioned the land held by the Howie family, which has increased in value, it may be, a thousand-fold since it was purchased by Henry Howie. How can honorable senators opposite contend that it would be equitable to impose taxation which might reasonably be imposed upon the Howies upon the owner of land in the same neighbourhood who may recently have paid many thousands of pounds for it? </para>

                        <para>- That is the business of honorable senators opposite; it is not mine. Will honorable senators opposite reply to my argument? Under this measure these lands will be taxed to the same extent, although they were acquired by their owners under absolutely different circumstances. If it may be equitably applied in the one case, it must be inequitable in the other, and it is because this Bill makes no discrimination in such cases that I most seriously object to it. Where does the phrase, &#34; incremental value,&#34; and the proposal to tax it come from? It comes from Henry George, who, twenty or thirty years ago, deluded the world and himself. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker&#39;s</inline> amendment is submitted to mitigate what he and I consider to be the inequity - or shall I say the iniquity - of not taking into consideration the amount paid for land to the Government, in order to enable the Government and the community to secure an incremental value? That is the rock upon which Henry George split, and the reason is palpable. He was driven to the adoption of the single-tax, because he knew he could not meet the difficulty properly. </para>

                        <para>- As the Minister of Defence has come to the assistance of his party, I am disposed to think that I have said enough upon the question of the single-tax, and also upon the stupid proposition enunciated on the other side that land has no value but what the community creates. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has pointed out, in answer to some objections raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> that when the settler went on the land the community gave him some advantages by constructing roads and railways and helping him to destroy rabbits t and other pests, that he was being paid &#39;all the time, and that if he lost by his enterprise so much the worse for him. The Minister&#39;s vision was not wide enough. What is going on in Queensland to-day? There are settlers on freeholds and settlers on leaseholds which they may gradually convert into freeholds, who have to clear their land of pests, and the great obstacle to that work is the pest-infested community-owned land. In those parts of the State - even on the Darling Downs, which comprise the richest and most productive agricultural land in Australia, and, in some respects, in the world - the settlers have frequently complained that the work of settlement and development is impeded by the inaction of the Crown with regard to clearing its land of Bathurst burr and prickly pear. </para>

                        <para>- They may not pay the tax to-day, but they may do so at some future time. I am dealing now with the honorable senator&#39;s contention that the Government is all the time a benefactor to them. As a matter of fact, in the districts I have referred to, the State Government is, to some extent, retarding the work of settlement and development. Although the settler, whether freeholder or leaseholder, is bound by law to clear his land of pests, yet the adjoining block, which belongs to the community, is allowed to become a nursery for pests, so that after all the community-owned land is not by reason of that fact an advantage to him but rather an obstruction to the utilization of his land. Over and over again, both in the State Parliament and by Divisional Boards, resolutions have been passed calling upon the Crown to do what they compel the settlers to do. Let me put the position from another point of view. About &#163;125,000,000 was paid to the Crown for the lands which are held at present. I know of a case in Queensland where a quarter of a million has been lost by two or three squatters who came from Victoria, and who were almost ruined thereby. They paid heavy rents on their leaseholds year after year, and they lost every penny of the sum I have mentioned. </para>

                        <para>- I started with a reference to leaseholders because to us in Queensland the leasehold tenure for large areas is more familiar. The loss of &#163;250,000 on the leaseholds to which I alluded is nothing compared with what many freeholders in that State have lost. I have known cases where men have paid hundreds of thousands of pounds&#39; for land at the rate of ,&#163;i per acre when the Crown was hard up for money with which to carry on the public services. The &#163;125,000,000 which was paid by private individuals to the Crown for lands has been used by the Government for developmental purposes. If, on the one hand, the community created some value to the buyers of land, it is equally true, on the other, that the buyers have done some good to the community. If you are going to ask for incremental value, you ought to allow for so much of that money as has been contributed by private individuals in order to add to that publicly created value, if it is such. </para>

                        <para>- lt does nothing of the kind. The graduated tax is based on the incremental value, and not even the honorable senator can justify the rapid increase in the rate with the increase of values. It is only justified by the Government on the principle of the incremental value. But if you adopt that principle, surely you ought to take into consideration the fact that there are some freeholders who have paid money, in order to enable the Government to have that very incremental value, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has pointed out, it is proposed to tax them twice. </para>

                    <para>. -I intend to support the amendment as it has been amended. I told <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> that I could not support the amendment in its original form, and that if certain words were not excised I should oppose it. I believe that under the Constitution the Government have no right to &#39;tax land at all, as that is a matter for the States to deal with. But as the Bill has passed the second reading, I am quite willing to support any reasonable amendment, which will, at least, do a little justice. The Bill proposes to tax, not only the unearned increment, but also the amount which the holder originally paid for his land. We have heard a great deal about persons not losing money. I know that, while some persons have been successful in land speculations, others have lost a lot of money. I know that in a portion of Queensland where the Government had land sales, you could not get to-day&#163;1 for every&#163;10 which they received for the land. I could cite any number of such instances. I also know of cases where the holders could get ten times as much as was paid to the Crown. But these are not the only persons to be considered. Last night <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> told us that in New South Wales he paid&#163;10 an acre for land which to-day is not worth <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2,</inline> and I take it that it will be taxed on the higher amount. That shows that honorable senators on each side of the Chamber have made bad investments and good ones. This tax will touch them all. If land for which a man paid  &#163;1  per acre ten, or fifteen, or twenty years ago is still worth&#163;1 - and I believe that in the western portion of Queensland you can buy land to-day for  15s.  per acre, which was bought from the Government at  &#163;1  - he will be taxed, of course, on the amount which it is worth to-day, and, therefore, he will be losing both ways. I do not think that we should tax the principal. I admit that it would be fair to tax the unearned increment. I have always believed that every form of wealth should be taxed; but this Bill deals with only one form of wealth. I regard the amendment as a just one. In speaking upon the motion for the second reading of the Bill, I mentioned that the Vice-President of the Executive Council introduced it in a very brief speech, and that he described it as a perfect measure which required no amendment. </para>

                        <para>- Everything is presumptuous which emanates from the Opposition, because my honorable friends opposite have the big battalions upon their side. I repeat that the amendment is a reasonable one. In its original form I did not regard it in that light, because it would have permitted some persons to obtain a larger exemption than that to which they are entitled. Only to-day I was talking to a gentleman who informed me that the State taxes, the Divisional Board tax, and the tax proposed in this Bill would have the effect of absorbing the whole of the receipts from his property. He assured me that, when next year he is called upon to pay income tax. he will simply have to declare that he has no income. If I were at liberty to mention his name, I am sure that every honorable senator would be willing to believe his statement. Surely we do not wish&#34; to entirely deprive a man of his living. If that is going to be the result of the tax in good years - and the past seven or eight seasons have been so good that they are almost without a parallel in our history - what will be its result in bad years? </para>

I care no more for him, though he is the Leader of the Senate, than I do for any ordinary member of it. If I described his conduct as I should like to do, my language would be deemed unparliamentary. He has made himself most obnoxious to every member of the Opposition, and he does not possess the ordinary manners of a man.

                    <para>. - I wish to say a few words in reply to the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger. I believe that all land values are created by the community, notwithstanding that the honorable senator has characterized those who- think in that fashion as stupid. He instanced the case of some Spaniards who took up land in Victoria, and suddenly imparted a value to it by producing something which the community could use. He appears to forget that, but for the community which consumed those products, that land would still have no value. In the Northern Territory to-day there are thousands of acres of the best lands in Australia, and yet no one is rushing to use them because there is no market accessible for them. I do not mind being classed as stupid with men like Henry George, Adam Smith, and Carlyle. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator instanced two cases of land values in Melbourne. He gave the original value of certain land and mentioned the price which it had recently realized. What does that prove? Merely that one section had been trading in values which it never created. What does the Bill contemplate? It does not propose to take from a man the unearned increment, but merely to take a portion of it, and a very small portion. Ten thousand pounds worth of community-created values at 5 per cent, will return &#163;500 per annum. Now, if a man be possessed of &#163;500 worth of community-created values per annum, all we say to him is that he shall pay &#163;20 a- year to assist us to maintain an adequate defence force to protect his property. We affirm that he shall contribute the enormous sum of id. per <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> on those community-created values. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger thinks&#39; that the right to pay the whole of the taxes should belong to the wage-earners of this country. If he thinks it stupid fOr any honorable senator to argue that all land values are created by the people, why is it that the land in Bourke-street is more valuable than 500 miles of the best agricultural land in Victoria? It is not because of its productiveness, but because there are good trading sites there. I hope that he will consider this point, so that when he comes to write another book upon Socialism he will realize that those who advocate taking, for the purposes of the community, a very small percentage of the community-created values in land, are not inspired with a wild idea to attack a special class. The land-owners can well afford to pay for defence purposes the amount which we are asking them to pay. This taxation is merely levied for the purposes of defence. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> has been arguing that as our land-owners have paid for their lands they ought not to be taxed upon them. But whatever may have been paid for those lands, their owners have received more than a <inline font-style="italic">quid, fro quo</inline> for years past. The money which they paid for their purchase has been spent to preserve order, to maintain an efficient police force to protect their property, and to construct roads and railways. In short, it has been used to give them all the facilities of trade which they have enjoyed, and yet they now wish to escape a tax of id. in the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;,1</inline> upon their unimproved land values. They describe the tax as an injustice. But what about the injustice which has been inflicted upon the thousands of landless who have never had an opportunity to acquire land ? It is because I wish to remove an injustice from the many, and to afford the few an opportunity of contributing their fair share to the revenue, that I intend to support the amendment. </para>

I do not think that this Parliament has any right to resort to direct taxation until the Commonwealth has used every penny of the Customs and Excise revenue at its disposal. It has no right to introduce legislation to take control of the lands  of  the Commonwealth, since the Constitution left that control entirely in the hands of the States. I have been a consistent supporter of. the policy of taxing the unimproved value of land for over twenty years. </para>

                    <para>. - I have risen again to suggest one form of inequity that will occur  if  the amendment is not accepted. The point has been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> remarks. According to a case mentioned by him, there are land-owners who will be untouched. Suppose that I have a property in Bourke-street, Melbourne. The moment I feel that this tax is likely to be too strong for me, I can convert my property into cash, and my income will not be touched. But the man who buys the property, or who must occupy it for business purposes, has to bear the weight  of  the tax. As much as  &#163;50,000  may be put into a city property which is required for the conduct of a business. That property is to be taxed under this Bill. But a Government should always be careful in the administration of a land tax as to how such properties are affected. I confess that I should like to see this measure banned by bell, book, and candle, but, as it is to be passed, I wish to see it amended so as to make it less inequitable than it would otherwise be. Although we are twitted with being under the rule of a caucus, I am perfectly certain that if it were not for the caucus domination of the Labour party, there are some followers of the Government who would sweep away the  &#163;5,000  exemption. </para>

                    <para>. - I must apologize for speaking again, but I should like to summarize the views which I hold regarding <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker&#39;s</inline> amendment. It is not a little to have obtained such an admission as that with which we have been favoured by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> when he said that there was a theoretical fairness associated with the amendment. There is really no conflict as to the facts of the case. Two sides have been presented. The supporters of the Bill have continually dwelt on the fact that a large number of land-owners have succeeded in acquiring what is called the incremental or community-created value of land. On the other side it is urged that there is another class of land-owners who, through circumstances which I need not repeat, have purchased land in connexion with which there has been no added value. Those facts are not in dispute. We do not deny that probably a majority of the land-holders possess land in connexion with which there has been an added value. On the other hand, no one has denied that there are land-owners owning land which is not worth more than, or as much as, the original sum for which it was purchased from the Crown. It is quite clear that neither this Bill nor any Bill which this Parliament could pass could differentiate between those two classes - the men who have secured the unearned increment and those who have not. The supporters of the Bill say, &#34; Because we cannot differentiate, we are going to levy the tax alike on those who have secured the unearned increment, and upon those who have not.&#34; We, on the Opposition side, also recognising that it is impossible to differentiate, prefer to make a slight concession to the man who has secured the unearned increment rather than levy a tax on those who have not. That statement marks the difference between the two parties. I wish to make it abundantly clear that if  1  had a choice of levying a tax on those who have secured the unearned increment, and of exempting those who have not, I would adopt that course. But I cannot do so. I prefer, therefore, the course of making a concession to a few wealthy land-owners, in order to do a measure of justice to those who have not been lucky in their investments, rather than to strike at those who have been unfortunate, in order to hit all the wealthy land-owners. I repeat that in order to ease the application of this measure to the man who has purchased land that is not now worth what he paid for it, I am prepared to make a concession to those who have greatly profited by their investments. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to draw the attention of the Government to what appear to me to be unnecessary words in this clause. In the first line of the proviso it is stated, &#34; provided that an owner of land who, after the thirtieth day of June, but before the thirtieth day of September,&#34; has sold or agreed to sell. I think that the words &#34; after the thirtieth day of June &#34; might safely be left out. The proviso would then read, &#34; provided that an owner of land who, before the thirtieth day of September,&#34; which appears to be the dominant date. Much as I should like to see a later period fixed, I do not propose to suggest an alteration in that respect. The object of the clause is this: It sets out the date of ownership for the purpose of the tax, and goes on to provide that if the owner has sold or has entered into an agreement to sell before 30th September, although the conveyance is not complete and the actual transfer has not been put through, if the sale is <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> and not for the purpose of evading payment of the tax, the owner is to be separately assessed in respect of the land in question. The clause has been introduced for the purpose of allowing people who are already in process of subdividing their estates and have made arrangements for sale to secure a measure of relief. That being so, the only date that is relevant is 30th September. The particular date prior to the 30th September on which an arrangement was made to sell makes no difference. It can make no difference whether it was on the 28th or 29th of June, provided no one is permitted to take advantage of the arrangement after 30th September. It is quite a common thing in New South Wales for more than three months to be occupied in getting a conveyance or transfer through. The sole purpose of the clause is to provide that where a transfer is under way the owner shall get the benefit just as if the sale were complete. I do not think that it can be the desire of the Government, or in accordance with the spirit of the clause, to limit the arrangements for the transfer of land which are to be so treated to those which are made between 30th June and 30th September. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will see his way to consent to the omission of the words &#34; after the thirtieth day of June.&#34; </para>

                    <para>. - I can hardly conceive that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> does not realize the true position. We are dealing only with this particular year, that is to say, the taxation year from the 30th June, 1910, to 30th June, 191 1. With those who executed transfers of land before the 30th June, 1910, we have nothing at all to do. They were not the owners of the land on the 30th June, 1910, when the ownership of the land should be determined. This provision is inserted as a concession to those who are <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> sellers of land before 30th September, 1910. We say that if they have entered into an agreement to sell after the date fixed for the determination of the ownership, that is to say, after 30th June, 1910, we will give them a certain time - up to the 30th September, 1 9 10 - to complete the sale and so avoid taxation under this measure in respect of the land sold. This is a concession to the <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> seller of land who is carrying out one of the principles of the Bill and is subdividing his own land, though it may be that in some cases the transfer will be to another large owner of land. </para>

                <para class="block">I recognise that the clause applies to this year only, and that next year it will be inoperative. The only object I can conceive for the insertion of this proviso is to ease off the shock which may be expected to be felt by land-owners when this Bill is first brought into operation. It is true that this is a concession to those who intend to sell their land. The Government propose that they shall have up to the 30th September within which to complete the sale of their land where they have made an agreement to sell after the 30th June. But a man who entered into an agreement to sell his land on the 29th June, and had not completed the transfer on the 30th June, would be denied the benefit of this concession. </para>

                        <para>- The assumption is that he would be able to do so. It is clear from the clause itself that it is considered that three months is not too long a time to allow for the completion of an agreement to sell, because where a man entered into an agreement on the 1st July he is given under this clause three months in which to complete the transfer of the land. What I wish to know is, why a man who entered into such an agreement on the day before the 1st July should not be given the benefit of this concession as well. </para>

                        <para>- But he would have owned the land on that date, though he- may have entered into an agreement the day before to sell it. The clause recognises that though a man may have agreed to sell his land, he will appear on the register as the owner until the transfer is completed. Under this clause, though a man may be registered as the owner of a piece of land on the 30th June, 1910, it is proposed to give him a concession in respect of land which, after that date, he entered into an agreement to sell. It is proposed to give him up till the 30th September, 1910, to complete the transfer of the land. I do not ask that there should be any extension of that term, but I cannot see why a man who has entered into an agreement to sell on the 28th June should not also be given the concession. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the contention of the Leader of the Opposition is correct. I read the clause exactly as the honorable senator reads it. From the way in which it is worded I think that only those who agreed to sell between the 30th June and the 30th September, 19 10, will be entitled to the benefit of the concession. I think the Vice-President of the Executive Council would place the matter beyond all doubt if he agreed to strike out the words &#34; after the thirtieth day of June, but.&#34; The clause would then provide that all who agreed to sell before the 30th September would be entitled to the concession. There is no reason why we should not put it beyond all doubt that those who agreed to sell before 30th June should get this concession. In view of the difference of opinion as to the effect of the clause, I think the Government might reconsider it. </para>

If no agreement to sell were entered into before 30th June, a man desiring to sell his land and making arrangements to do so between the 30th June and 30th September would, under this clause, be exempt from taxation. The reason the 30th June is mentioned is to indicate the date of the commencement of the year during which the tax is levied. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;9.43&#93;.- In the first part of this clause it is provided that the tax shall be charged on land as owned on the 30th day of June, and then there is the proviso that the owner of land on the 30th June who made an agreement between the 1st July and the 30th September to sell his land shall be exempt from the tax. But the man who made an agreement to sell on the 30th June, or 29th June, will not be exempt under this clause. If we turn to the definition clause we shall find that-  &#34; Owner &#34; in relation to land includes every person who jointly or severally whether at law or in equity.  is entitled to land or to receive rent from land. A man who had land on the 29th June might have entered into a contract for its sale, and, if the sale were not completed on the 30th June, he would still be the owner of the land.

                    <para>. - This is a case in which, I think, the Vice-President of the Executive Council might graciously give way. Even one of his own supporters thinks that he should. In Australia it is a matter of longitude as to when 12 o&#39;clock on 30th June is; 12 o&#39;clock in Queensland is not 12 o&#39;clock in Western Australia. There are many cases in which a man may agree to sell, but may not be able to carry out the sale. Suppose, for argument&#39;s sake, that A agrees on the 28th June to sell, but, unfortunately, dies ; is not the agreement to be carried out? This is really a comparatively small amendment. Let us have the satisfaction of knowing that some honorable senator on this side has had the pleasure of seeing a small amendment made in the measure. </para>

                    <para>. - In order that honorable senators may thoroughly understand such a simple matter as this is, I have risen to make a further explanation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> in the position he takes up, is absolutely correct. Suppose that in April, or May, a person agreed to sell, and that before the 30th June the sale was not completed, he would still be the owner. But if the sale were completed before the 30th September he would be exempt from the tax, as he would not be the owner for this taxation year. If the amendment be carried, however, the position might be complicated to some extent. Honorable senators will notice that the words used in the proviso are &#34;has sold or agreed to sell.&#34; If, on the 1st July, or 28th September, any person agreed to sell, and had not completed the sale before the 30th September, he will be exempt. A man who, prior to the 30th June, agreed to sell, but did not complete the sale, was the owner on the  30th  June, but he can complete the sale before the  30th  September. If he does not do so, he is held to be the owner, and is taxed. If, after the  30th  June, a person agreed to sell, although the sale may not be completed until November or December, or some time afterwards, yet, because he made the agreement between  30th  June and  30th  September, he also will be exempt. I hope that honorable senators will allow the clause to pass. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister has rested his case on one class of individuals who may be benefited. I want to put the case of a class of individuals who will be hurt by the clause as it stands. My honorable friend has quite correctly stated that if any person entered into an agreement to sell between the  1st  July and  30th  September, although he may not complete the transfer for months, it may be for years, he gets the concession. Let me take an extreme case. Suppose that an agreement to sell was signed on the  29th  September, although it may be two years before the sale is completed, yet the seller will get the concession. But if, on the  29th  June, any person made an agreement to sell, and did not complete the sale until the  1st  October, he does not get it. </para>

                        <para>- That is where 1 differ from the Minister. The whole purpose of the clause was that if land is in process of transfer, the concession will be granted. But the Minister says now, &#34; We are going to hold out that concession to those who on the  29th  September signed an agreement to sell, although it may take two years to transfer the land, but we will not give four months to a man who entered into an agreement to sell if he happened to sign it on the  29th  June.&#34; That does not appear to me to be a reasonable and fair way of dealing with the matter. The object of the Bill is to encourage subdivision and sale. I cannot see why, if an agreement to sell was signed on the  29th  June, the seller should not get exactly the same consideration as is extended to a man who signed his agreement three days later. </para>

                        <para>- Do I not know that perhaps better than my honorable friend? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> spoke rather curtly, if I may say so, with regard to the disposition of land. But it is not every State which is so favoured as is South Australia with regard to the transfer of land. It enjoys the fortunate position of being the State into which the Torrens Act was first introduced, and under the Torrens system of title - the Real Property Title Act, as it is called in some other States - it is possible to deal with land just as quickly and effectively as it is to deal with shares in a public company. But in other States, more particularly in New South Wales and Tasmania, it is very difficult very often to trace back titles, and complications are very great. Sometimes, apart from the preparation of abstracts of titles, the searchings through the various records to ascertain the correct titles are very extensive, and run into months - at times into years. I understand now the purport of the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen-,</inline> and I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> will see his way to drop the particular words which have been suggested, and so give an opportunity to do so to all who were prepared to accept the spirit of this Act in its full and proper interpretation before the end of September. </para>

                    <para>. - It would be idle to deny the force of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> contention. It would be, to some extent, idle to deny that there is a great deal in the contention put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> and supported to some extent by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> But the great point we have to consider is : How will the Commissioner of Land Tax interpret the provision? If he interprets it in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> way, possibly the purpose of the Act may be defeated. If, on the other hand, he interprets it in the Minister&#39;s way, possibly the intention of the Government will be carried out. But, amidst the conflict of opinion, how can we be sure that he will do so? It is our business to try to make it absolutely clear that he will do so.  1  suggest to the Minister that he should carefully reconsider the clause. </para>

                <para class="block">McGregor. But I can also see that the view which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has pointed out is very likely to be defeated unless this amendment be made. On the whole, I am inclined to think that the very object which the Government intend to carry out will be best secured by the amendment. But if we cannot reconcile this conflict of opinion we ought to reframe the clause in such a way that there can be no doubt when the Commissioner of Land Tax has to interpret it. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that the clause will be made perfectly clear if we strike out the. words &#34; who after the thirtieth day of June but.&#34; I have in my mind estates which, during the last year, have been cut up in different parts of New South Wales, and which, to all intents and purposes, are the property of the vendors until the terms, extending in many cases over many years, have been completed. I do not think it is fair or just to tax men who have parted with their land, in some cases to an enormous amount, particularly when you exempt from taxation those who did the same thing between June and September. I hope that the Minister will carefully read the clause, and see if he cannot consent to the alteration I have suggested. That, to my mind, would leave the clause in less doubt, and also exempt those who have subdivided their estates in a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> manner. I hope that the Government will yet reconsider their position. </para>

                    <para>. - The speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has brought to my mind what has absolutely taken place in New South Wales. An agricultural estate was subdivided and sold on the 21st June; a deposit was made, which, of course, does not come within the scope of the Bill, and the purchasers are allowed three months in which to make a further deposit. The land could not possibly be transferred until the 30th September, although the agreement to sell was made prior to the 30th June. Let us imagine a similar sale taking place a month later - that is, on the 31st July. That estate subdivided would get the benefit of this clause, whereas the estate which was sold a month earlier would not. Is there any reason why we should differentiate between these two estates? </para>

                        <para>- Such an estate would not escape the tax. &#34;All we say is that a concession should be granted to those who have sold, or who have agreed to sell, between these two dates. It seems to me that the revenue will not be hurt in any way if we say that all those who have entered into an agreement to sell before 30th September shall receive the benefit of this concession. Surely it is not intended to make fish of one and flesh of another? </para>

                    <para>. - In the year 1892-3 a great crisis occurred in Sydney by which some building societies had to come under an arrangement with its creditors for the purposes of liquidation. It was deemed desirable to alter their constitutions so as to enable them to offer easy terms to persons who were prepared to purchase properties which were under mortgage to them. The largest of these institutions was the Sydney Permanent Building Society, which found itself in a very awkward position. Its members, therefore, applied to be brought under a State Act, in order that they might obtain some measure of relief. </para>

It would be very hard if, in addition to all the other losses which they have sustained, the members of this society had to pay land tax. The shares of the society were at one time worth &#163;40 each, but today they are worth only &#163;1. It is practically still a building society in liquidation.

But honorable senators will notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> not only wants to bring in building societies registered under State Acts, but associations or companies. He tells us that some of these associations or companies which have gone into liquidation have already parted with &#163;150,000 or &#163;250,000 worth of land. The Lord knows how much more they have to dispose of. Really, he is asking for too much. He gives us no assurance that these building societies, associations, or companies were instituted for any other purpose than to make a profit out of the people. There is no mutual principle connected with them. If they are in possession of land and go insolvent, there is another clause of the Bill which will affect them. I allude to clause 64, which is included for the very purpose of dealing with such cases as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has brought under our notice. </para>

They may fairly ask that the premises which they have purchased, and in which they carry on their affairs, should be exempt. The Adelaide Chamber has recently purchased premises, and intend to have there a large room for exhibition purposes. The members will derive no pecuniary benefit, but I hope to help forward avery useful work. </para>

                        <para>- I want to tax every person or association that does own land of that value. When we talk about exempting clubs, take Sydney. There is a club there which, in the days when members of clubs had special voting privileges under the State law, had a membership of 1,200. Of course, commoners like I am would not be allowed within coo-ee of some of the palatial clubs in Sydney. But there are clubs like the Union Club and the Athenaeum Club, whose members are wealthy men, and ought not to escape land taxation. Too many concessions are being made to these people. I am against the amendment, and think that if the Government were as democratic as they profess to be, they would never have dreamt of proposing such a thing. I shall certainly vote against it. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to ask why. I do not think it is right that we should insert in any Bill a provision of this character. A number of my most intimate friends are very prominent members of the order referred to, but I do not think we should in any Commonwealth Statute discriminate between the members of that order and anybody else. I hope we shall respect the spirit of the Constitution, and at no time translate into legislative effect any provision which will discriminate in the way proposed between the members of our community. </para>

                        <para>- The members of friendly societies are given certain benefits in the way of medical assistance, or assistance to their families at the time of their death. The Masonic body does not offer its members such benefits, but in every other respect it stands on exactly the same footing as the Oddfellows, the Druids, the Protestant Alliance, the Hibernians, and other recognised friendly societies. It would, in my opinion, be most unfair to discriminate between the members of the Masonic body and the members of the friendly societies I have referred to. </para>

                    <para>. - I think we had better reject the amendment now proposed, and recommit the clause, with a view to striking out all the societies proposed to be exempted from the operation of this Bill. I remind honorable senators that it will only operate in cases where the unimproved value of the land held is above &#163;5,000. I see no reason why we should go out of our way to exempt from the operation of this Bill, for instance, the property held by the Trades Hall in Sydney. I venture to say that the people who are represented in the Trades Hall, and who believe in this method of taxing others, have no desire to be exempt from taxation themselves. The moment we refuse to pay our own share of taxation under this measure we give away the whole case for the taxation of other people. The authorities of the Trades Hall iri Sydney occupy land, the unimproved value of which must be over &#163;5,000 and they should be just as liable to this taxation as any other owners of property of that value. I can see no reason for exempting the Masonic body from this taxation. If we have made a mistake in agreeing to some provision to which we ought not to have agreed, the mistake should be corrected. I would put the Trades Hall, the Masonic Society, and every organization of a similar character on the same footing. If they occupy land of the unimproved value of over &#163;5,000 they should pay this taxation. Take the instance of a club like the Commercial Travellers&#39; Club, whose building in Castlereagh-street, Sydney, occupies a most valuable block of land. It may be said that it is not used for purposes of profit, but the use of it relieves the members of the club from the necessity of living in premises that are used for profit. </para>

                        <para>- I recognise that, and I say that they deserve every credit for their co-operation, but I do not think the Legislature has any right to go out of its way to be benevolent to certain sections of the community. There may be other sections in the community who, because they may be without a representative who has the ear of the Government, will be neglected and forgotten. I object to the special exemption of any section of the community from taxation under a Bill applying to people holding land over a certain value. </para>

I point out that there is only one other, and it is a non-contentious clause in this part of the Bill; and that if honorable members will cease their trifling, we can quickly dispose of it, and go home early. </para>
