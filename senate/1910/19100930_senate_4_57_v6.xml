                <para class="block">I submit this amendment because I contend that a man ought to know exactly whom he is making an agreement with, and is to be responsible to. Large steam-ship companies, like the Howard Smith Company, the Huddart Parker Company, and the Adelaide Steam-ship Company, own thirty or forty steam-ships, which are employed in different trades. A man who is signing an agreement with a company of that kind does not know either who his owner is, or the trade he is to be employed in. When a man is about to make an agreement, he asks, " What trade is the ship employed in? What will be my chances of reaching my home sometimes during the tenure of the agreement ? " If, for instance, a man is domiciled in Melbourne with his wife and family, he will naturally say, " I shall ship in a vessel which will enable me to get home once a month, or, at least, once in two months." If a man has to sign the agreement with the owner of a vessel, and he can be transferred to another vessel of that owner, he may be sent to a place with no possibility of reaching his family during six months. It is absolutely unfair to ask a man to enter into an agreement, under the impression that he is signing on to a ship which will visit his home port, at any rate, occasionally. It will be quite sufficient if we provide that the agreement shall be made with the master, from whom he can ascertain the trade in which he is to be employed. In Australia all the steam-ship companies are limited liability companies virtually with managers. The owner of a ship is absolutely unknown to a man, and cannot be reached, if there is a breach of the agreement, whereas if the agreement were made with the master only, any breach could be remedied. The New South Wales Act contains a fairer provision than this clause, because it provides that a man must be twenty-four hours in port before he can be transferred from one ship to another, and if he does not like a proposed transfer he can give his notice and leave. This Bill contains no provision to enable a man to legally leave his ship. He can be transferred from one ship to another ship of a company, or from one trade to another trade, without being given an opportunity of legally leaving. In the Australian trade the agreement is generally made for six months, but at certain ports, generally the home port, where the articles are drawn up, a seaman has the right to give twenty-four hours' notice . to leave, and the master has the right to give twenty-four hours' notice to discharge a man. A ship, whose trade is virtually between Sydney and Melbourne, can arrive here to-day, and a man knows exactly when he will again have an ' opportunity to get to his home, but under this clause he could be transferred to a ship leaving Melbourne to trade on the north-west coast of Australia, or between Queensland ports, and he would have to fulfil his agreement before he could visit his home. All I ask is that the agreement shall be made with the master and for the ship in which he is to be employed, and not for all- the ships of an owner. I hope that the Minister will recognise the justice of my amendment by agreeing to it. </para>

                    <para>. - I quite appreciate the hardships imposed upon seamen which have been depicted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie.</inline> But I would point out that his amendment would not in any way remedy those hardships. It merely provides that a seaman's agreement, instead of being made with the master or the owner of a vessel, shall be made with the master. Its adoption would not prevent the troubles to which the honorable senator has referred. </para>

                        <para>- If the owner of a vessel has power under a seaman's agreement to transfer him from one ship to another, or from one trade to another, the same agreement will allow somebody else so to transfer him. I need scarcely point out that the master is the servant of the owner, and sometimes even masters are transferred from one ship to another and from one trade to another. So that, if a seaman signed an agreement with the master of a vessel, he would have no guarantee that he would not be .so transferred. To achieve the purpose which he has in view, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> would require to impose some limitation on the agreement. </para>

For example, he has declared that if a seaman enters into an agreement with the master of a vessel, he will possess some remedy against transfer, but. that if his agreement be made with the owner of the vessel he will have no remedy. Yet we know that in all these cases the ship itself is liable. </para>

                        <para>- I know men in Adelaide who would not object to work for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> but who would strongly object to accepting employment with other printers. The reason is obvious. Some employers work under fair conditions which insure that their employes shall be reasonably comfortable - whilst others do not. Under this clause a seaman may say, " I want a ship. Such and such a vessel is engaged in a certain trade, the food on board is good, and the master is a man with whom I can work." Under these circumstances he may be prepared to accept employment upon that vessel. But he may further say, " Upon another ship the accommodation is miserable, the food is. bad, and I know that I should not be able to work with the master." Under these circumstances, ought he not to have the. right to decline to accept service on the latter vessel? The Merchant Shipping Act provides that a seaman's agreement shall be drawn in a certain form. That agreement specifies a certain ship, and sets out the port of destination. But in this clause we are asked to provide that a man shall sign articles with either the master or the owner of a vessel. Under it a seaman may sign an agreement to serve on an Inter-State vessel belonging to Archibald Currie and Company, and be immediately afterwards transferred to a ship trading to Calcutta. </para>

                        <para>- In conjunction with other amendments which I intend to move it would. What would the honorable senator say if he were asked to enter into an agreement for three years to serve a colliery proprietor, who had a mine at Powlett River, another at Newcastle, and a third in Queensland, in any of those collieries ? Yet he thinks that a seaman ought to agree to serve upon one ship, and be liable to transfer to another at the caprice of the owner. I would further point out that when an agreement is made with the owner, the seaman has no redress if that agreement be not observed. Action has first to be taken against the master. The Government will be well advised if they agree to my amendment. </para>

                        <para>- In our coastal trade a seaman's agreement is for six months, and the owner or master has the right to give him. twenty-four hours' notice of his intention to discharge him at any time that the vessel is in the home port. Similarly the seaman has a right to give twenty-four hours' notice of his intention to leave the ship. But, under this clause, he may be prevented from giving that notice, because the moment his vessel arrives in the home port, he may be transferred to another vessel. </para>

                        <para>- The statement is quite true. Here was a ship laid up for want of firemen. According to the agreement between the owners and the seamen, the detention of a ship twenty-four hours means the termination of the agreement. We were just within two hours of that period when the dispute was settled, and a general maritime strike throughout Australia was averted. That is the position that will occur under this clause if it is not amended, because I feel certain that men will refuse to make agreements with owners which would permit them to be transferred from one ship to another. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not profess to have anything like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> knowledge of navigation, but I do understand an agreement made between employer and employe. We can all heartily sympathize with the endeavour that the honorable senator is making, but if he alters the Bill as desired, I cannot see how he will effect his purpose. He desires that when a man engages to serve on a ship he shall have the right to remain in that ship just as though he had engaged to serve in a factory. But if the amendment were agreed to the honorable senator's purpose would not be effected. It is evident that a workman who signs an agreement is bound by its terms. The alternative is to refuse to sign an agreement which, under certain circumstances, might compel him to be transferred against his will from one ship to another. The position that should be taken up by seamen is that they should be sure that the articles that they are asked to sign are such as would not compel them to be made slaves of. </para>

                        <para>- But this amendment would not effect that purpose. The Bill does not prescribe any form of agreement. It simply provides that in the case of an Australian-trade ship or a limited coast-trade ship an agreement may be made with the owner or master. The Bill enables an agreement to be made, but it does not prescribe what the agreement shall be. It might embody all the provisions contained in clause 44, or it might embody several other terms that are not laid down there. I cannot support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not know whether the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> would carry out what he insists upon; but it appears to me to be a very desirable amendment to make if it will achieve its purpose. If a seaman makes an agreement with the Adelaide Steam-ship Company, that company can place him on any vessel or send him on any route. But suppose that an agreement is made with the master of the <inline font-style="italic">Cooma.</inline> That means that the seaman making the agreement is to serve on the <inline font-style="italic">Cooma.</inline> As long as it remains in force it is an agreement with the master of that 'particular ship. If the master is transferred during the term of the agreement, the agreement still continues with the next master, because it is an agreement made with the master of that particular ship, and the seaman cannot be removed from that ship to another without his own consent. That is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> seeks to achieve. </para>

The agreement made with the master of a ship, however, is not a general agreement to serve a steam-ship company. No doubt the master is the agent of the company, but only as far as the particular ship of which he is master is concerned. He is not a general agent of the company. </para>

                    <para>. - There is a section in the Merchant Shipping Act which has been omitted from this Bill. That section makes provision as to what the agreement with a seaman shall contain. It provides that the master of every ship shall enter into an agreement to be called the agreement with the crew. The master, not the owner, is responsible under the Imperial Act. It provides, also, that the master is not to carry to sea a man who has not signed the agreement, that the agreement shall be in a form approved by the Board of Trade, and shall be dated at the time of -the first signature upon it. It is to be signed by the master before a seaman signs it. The particulars that the agreement has to provide for are, the nature and as far as practicable the duration of the intended voyage; the approximate period of the voyage, and the places in the world to which the ship is to go; the number and description of the crew; the time at which the seaman has to be on board ; the capacity in which he is to serve ; the amount of wages he is to receive, and so forth. All that has been left out of this Bill. Honorable senators say that the amendment would not achieve my object, but it would partly achieve it. If a man makes an agreement with the owners, he may have to serve in any ship belonging to them. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think the Minister can fully realize the extent of .the trade within the limits of a State.  His  amendment proposes that in connexion with that trade the agreement may be made with the owner or master. If it were made with the owner a man might be transferred from one ship to another. I refer the honorable senator to the conditions operating in Western Australia. A ship may be trading between Fremantle and Albany, and another vessel be longing to the same owner may be trading between Geraldton and Wyndham. Under the amendment a man employed on a ship trading between Fremantle and Albany who might be living at Fremantle, and would be able to get to his home every week, might be transferred to the vessel trading between Geraldton and Wyndham, which would take him away from his home altogether. The same thing could happen in the Queensland trade. The Australian United Steam-ship Navigation Company run a number of boats from Brisbane to the north. A man serving on a vessel at Brisbane might be transferred to a drogher in one of the rivers in the north. </para>

                        <para>- I want to prevent such agreements. I admit that this provision is to be found in the Merchant Shipping Act, but the conditions in the shipping trade of Great Britain are very different from the conditions in Australia. For instance, a company may have half-a-dozen boats running between Liverpool and the Isle of Man, and it is very often convenient for them to transfer their men from one of their ships to another. But, in that case, the vessels make a trip that takes only about eight hours. The same thing occurs between Glasgow and Belfast, between Dover and Calais, and between other ports. The conditions on the Australian coast are very different. A company may have a vessel trading between: Port Adelaide and Port Pirie. It may be found that- trade is to be had between Port Pirie and some other port, and a man whose home is in Adelaide may find himself transferred to a vessel that is trading away from Adelaide all the time. It is easy to see that if a man makes an agreement under which he is employed in one ship engaged in a particular trade, it may be a very great injustice for him to be transferred to another ship engaged in a different trade. </para>

                    <para>. - I would remind the Committee that it is desirable to frame our measures on uniform lines. Various methods have been adopted in the States with regard to fees. In some States the fees payable under an Act have been set forth in a schedule. That has been done apparently in New Zealand, but that has not been the practice with the </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Commonwealth Parliament. In our Acts all fees have been left to be prescribed by regulation. The regulations are laid upon the table of each House, and it is open to any honorable senator to submit a motion disagreeing with them. Obviously it is not wise to start a new departure in the case of this Bill unless very strong reasons can be given. There are very good reasons why the manning scale should be scheduled to the Bill. It involves a principle, and therefore it should not be subject to alteration by regulation from time to time. In some States the fee payable under the Navigation Act is comparatively small. I am informed that in Victoria it is 3s., of which the owner pays 2s., and the seaman1s, and that in some States it is 6s. The fees vary. I am not prepared at present to say what fee the Government will be prepared to prescribe. We have first to" ascertain what the maintenance of the Mercantile Marine Office is likely to cost. We desire to do justice as between the States, and, as I said, the fees vary considerably. This is entirely a question of draftsmanship. But the amendment will make quite a revolution in that regard. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree with the Minister that it is wise to leave the amount of the fees to be settled by regulation. I am aware that in many State Acts, more especially where lawyers are concerned, the fees are fixed. In our Local Courts Act, for instance, the fees are laid down. I do not think that we ought to hamper this measure by putting in too many schedules. A large number of things have to be paid for at the Mercantile Marine Office, though not amounting to much. A seaman has to go there seven or eight times during a half-year, or a dozen times in a year, to be engaged and discharged through no fault of his own, but simply through the vessel being laid up or through being transferred from one ship to another. It will be a very heavy tax upon him if he has to pay fees every time. In every other case when a man is entering into an agreement the employer supplies the stationery and the pen and ink. Why should not the employer of a seaman pay for the making of the agreement? There is no employe who is taxed to the same extent as is the seaman through the Shipping Office. He has to pay for shipping and for being discharged. </para>

I recognise that the Mercantile Marine Office ought to earn a revenue sufficient to meet the expenditure, but it ought to be provided by those who employ the men.

                    GOULD (New South Wales) [11.43].- The Minister has urged the desirability of dealing with a matter of this kind by regulation, but he overlooks to a certain extent the very strong objection which has always been taken to legislation by regulation. It is a mistake to give to the Executive too much power in that regard. When the fees payable are set forth in a schedule, any one who gets a copy of the Act can see what they are. But when it is provided that the fees payable are such as may be prescribed by regulation, it is necessary for a person to get, not only a copy of the Act, but also a copy of the regulations. Unfortunately, the regulations made under an Act are never bound up with the Act in the statute-book. Of course, one may get a copy of an Act with the regulations attached, but there is no certainty as to how long they will remain in force. I might, for instance, buy a copy of this measure after it is enacted, with the regulations attached, but, in the course of twelve months, they might be replaced by others.

                        <para>- Yes. Even in one month a change may be made. I would further point out that the assent of both branches of the Legislature must be obtained to any Statute, whereas either branch of it may disagree with a regulation, in which case such regulation can have no effect. Whilst I recognise that to some extent it is necessary to legislate by regulation, we ought to avoid legislation in that way as far as possible. Under this Bill we know very well that certain fees will have to be paid. If we know the probable amount of the fees, why should we not specify them in the Bill ? They would then remain operative until the Parliament in its wisdom saw fit to alter them. The Minister has stated that we are laying down the practice of dealing with matters by regulation. I say that we should leave nothing to regulation which can reasonably be effected by Statute. </para>

We all know that one Ministry may regard a matter from a certain stand-point, and that its successors may regard it from an entirely different standpoint, with the result that the desired alteration is effected by regulation. </para>

                    <para>. - Every honorable senator will agree that these marine offices should be made to pay their own way. This Bill is really intended to effect a consolidation of the navigation laws of Australia. Hitherto each State has enacted its own navigation laws. Each has charged different fees, because it has had to regulate them by the amount of revenue which it has received. At the present time the Minister cannot foresee what fees ought to be charged by the Commonwealth, because he cannot forecast the revenue which will be obtained. Experience alone can teach us what those fees ought to be. We might prescribe that they should be the minimum fees existing in Australia, and six months hence we might find that as a result the Government were losing a considerable sum, so that it would then be necessary to increase them. The Commonwealth is shouldering a responsibility which has never been assumed by any of the States in that it is providing not merely for the employment of superintendents, but also for seamen's inspectors, and these officers will have to be paid by the Crown. Consequently it is impossible to specify in this Bill the fees which should be charged. Until we know what our revenue is likely to be, it is better to deal with this matter by regulation. </para>

                    <para>. - Even if the amendment be agreed to, I am not sure that the seamen will not have to pay part of the cost of drawing up the agreement. In some States, under the Employers' Liability Act, employers are liable to pay compensation to workmen injured in their service. Yet we know that employers do deduct from their employes' wages a sum sufficient to cover the cost of insuring those employes, although, under the law, they are not supposed to do so. </para>

                        <para>- It was done in my own case for years. I had 5d., 6d., and 9d. per week deducted from my wages for years, although the law imposes on the employer the obligation to insure his employes. If we allow the clause to remain in its present form, the seamen will know exactly how much they are liable to pay. The employer will be able to deduct only so much, whereas, if we strike out the words which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> desires to delete, we shall have no guarantee that the employer will not deduct the whole cost of the agreement. There will be no prohibition upon him not to do so. At present a seaman is only required to pay a proportion of the cost of drawing up the agreement. In Victoria that proportion is represented by one-third, which amounts to 6d. But if we agree to the amendment, the employer will probably deduct the whole of the cost of drawing up the agreement. Consequently, the Committee may very well allow the clause to pass in its present form. </para>

                    (South Australia) seaman's agreement expires, he has an absolute right to get his discharge. The clause would work detrimentally to the interests of seamen. A man might re-engage for a period of five years, and his conduct might be thoroughly good throughout his term of service. But because he wanted to leave at the end of that time, the master might be annoyed with him, and might give him a bad discharge, covering the whole five years. I think a man ought to have a discharge given to him at the end of every six months. I shall vote against the whole clause.

We desire to see this Bill pushed through the Senate as rapidly as possible. I was quite prepared to take the verdict of the Committee upon the clause. I have every confidence that a seaman will get a fair discharge if his conduct has been good. Every seaman knows the position he is in. If he is prepared to remain in a ship at the end of six months, it must be because he is content with the treatment he receives from the captain and officers, and believes them to be fair-minded men. If they are not, he will not re-engage on any consideration. I attach little importance to the process of making alterations in a Bill for the simple purpose of amending it. That practice is against good principles of legislation. I hope that the Committee will pass the clause as it stands. </para>

                    <para>. - If the Minister would look at this matter from the seaman's point of view, he would realize that there is much to be said for SenatorGuthrie's contention.. Take the case of a man who re-engages on a ship. He may serve under one master for two years. As he re-engages he does not get his discharge, and perhaps has nothing to show that his conduct has been good during two years of his service. The latter part of his time <inline font-style="italic">may</inline> be served under another master. Every one who has been at sea knows that the comfortable working of a ship depends enormously upon the attitude of the master towards his men. Though the seamen might have served for two years without any complaint being made against him, the new master or new officers might be men of different disposition, with the result that at the end of his new term the man might give notice to leave. The master would have to give him a discharge for the whole term of his service. Instead of giving him a good discharge, the master might give him a " decline to report," which means " I prefer to say nothing about him." The master could not give him a bad discharge if he were an able and competent seaman, but giving a "decline to report " would mean that when he went to look for another engagement it would be said," We do not want that sort of chap." If, on the other hand, a man got his discharge every six months, when he wished to re-engage on another ship he would have three good discharges from the ship be left and one " decline to report " discharge. He could present those discharges, knowing that it would probably be assumed that the last was due to a change of masters.I have served with men with whom I could not get on at all. The Leader of the Opposition shakes his head, but there are some men that angels could not agree with. There was one man with whom I could not work, and I took advantage of the first opportunity to give him notice, because I wanted to get out of his ship. Of course, I do not know what his version of the matter would be. If the Minister will consider what I have said, he will see that, under this provision, the practice permitted might, in some cases, prejudice a man in getting employment. It should not be forgotten that the seaman is charged shipping fees when each agreement expires, and, that being so, there is no reason why he should not get the piece of paper which would constitute his discharge. </para>

It finds no place in any shipping laws of which we are cognisant, except those of New South Wales. When a departure from the ordinary practice is proposed in connexion with a matter which has engaged the attention of the Board of Trade, some reason should be advanced in support of it. I find in the memorandum containing suggestions from the Board of Trade regarding the Navigation Bill, laid on the table some time ago, the following reference to this clause :  -

                        <para>- This would only add unnecessarily to the clerical work which would require to be performed ; that would, in turn, increase the shipping , fees, and might have some effect later on the seaman's wages. The only object a man could have in keeping discharges for all his service would be to prove that he had not been engaged in any unlawful act while he had been serving on board a ship. But, without such discharges, he could prove an alibi if he were charged with having done anything contrary to the law. I shall support the retention of this clause, which has been adopted in the New South Wales Act, because I believe it to be a useful innovation. I know that I am in this matter pitted against an honorable senator who has had a lengthy experience of seafaring, but I am able to say that, in my own experience of seven years, I found that notice was taken only of my last discharge. I repeat that what honorable senators suggest would only add to the fees charged for clerical work, and might end in a reduction of seamen's wages. </para>

                    <para>. - Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has greatly exaggerated the amount of work involved in the filling in of these discharges. One would think that we were about to throw upon the ship-owners the responsibility of writing out reams and reams of papers, and having them carefully engrossed and witnessed. What is the discharge which is to entail that tremendous amount of labour? It is a thing which happens, I suppose, once in six months, and the filling in takes a few seconds. That being so, it cannot be said that we ought to decide for or against the clause on the ground of the work which it will entail. </para>

                        <para>- The labour involved in that is too insignificant to engage our attention if there is an advantage anywhere else. The honorable senator's next point was that the seamen would not want to carry a swag of discharges. There is nothing to compel him to do so, if he does not wish to carry anything but his last discharge. It will be quite optional with him. If he is of the same mind as the honorable senator, he will keep his last discharge and tear up the previous ones. But when the law places upon him the obligation to pay, he should have the right to obtain the thing for which he pays. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. In the Bill we have provided that when a seaman signs on an agreement, and that carries with it a right to a discharge, he pays as much for the discharge as for the agreement, and, therefore, he is entitled to the equivalent provided "by the Act. The payment which he makes when the agreement is signed is a payment for the work done by the Shipping Office, and for his discharge. Whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> may think that an employer only looks at a man's last discharge, I, though an employer in a limited way, entirely disagree with him. If a man comes to me, and shows a reference from an employer for two or three months, and there is a big gap behind it, I am not so well impressed as I am with a man who can produce certificates from employers covering a period of three or four or five years. It is an advantage in some circumstances, and with some employers, to see more than one reference or discharge. If a seaman desires to keep his certificates, he should be at liberty to do so. I propose to support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - Whilst I was listening to Senators Guthrie and Turley, I thought a good deal of their arguments, but my experience in engaging men leads me to believe that there is much force in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has said. Sometimes when a man puts in an application for the position of engine-driver, you get a sheaf of references. A man may have been all right when one reference was given, but afterwards he enters other employment, and his character may alter. Everything depends upon the last reference. As a rule, one-half of the references are not looked over, but the last discharge is always read. A man may have a discharge showing very good conduct for twelve months' service, but on his last discharge, for six months' service, "bad conduct" may be written, or perhaps no comment at all. One-half of the discharges are mere matters of form. </para>

                        <para>- That may be the rule at sea, but it is not in mining. When a man comes along with a reference from his last employer, very little notice is taken of it. If, after a day or two, a man is found to be competent, he is retained, no matter what his reference may be. If a man has the best reference under the sun, but is not able to do his work, he is not retained. I am well aware that many references are merely given to get rid of men. Such employers do not care what may become of the men, or who may suffer. My experience is that a good man can get work whether he has a reference or not. </para>

Only a short time ago a man who had obtained a good discharge every half year for five years came to me with a complaint. A new master of the ship did not want the .man, and " discharged him with a " bad " discharge, after having obtained discharges marked " very good," and leaving him with a " decline to report " discharge. </para>

                        <para>- I placed the man's career before the owners of the ship, and they asked the captain to withdraw the discharge and give him another one, which he did. If I had not intervened - that is, if his "good " discharge had not been renewed - the man would have had to present a " bad " discharge to the shipping master ; otherwise he could not get a ship. He was one of the best men who have sailed out of Australia, but simply as the result of a little pique on the part of the new master he was dismissed with a "bad" discharge. Let me point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> the difference between a seaman and an engine-driver. When a master has picked his crew, he has to depend upon their past records, because once they are on board he has no means of testing them until they get to sea, and then he has to keep them. On the other hand, an engine-driver who cannot attend properly to his engine can be immediately discharged and replaced. </para>

                        <para>- There is a likelihood of getting an engine-driver, but a ship-master cannot get another seaman in any circumstances. My amendment is not moved for the purpose of making an alteration, but it involves a great principle against which the seamen of England are fighting, with the approval of the Board of Trade. Surely if a man pays for his shipping and discharge, he is entitled to get what is due to him, which includes a discharge at the end of every six months. . </para>

                        <para>- I was not aware of that. It appears to me that under this Bill the seaman will be required to pay a lump sum to cover both the cost of his engagement and of his discharge. That being so, at the end of his engagement he should be refunded a certain proportion of the money which he has paid. That object, I think, could be attained by amending sub-clause  2,  so as to provide that the statement which the master of a vessel is required to deliver or send to the superintendent shall include a report on the conduct, character, and qualifications of any seaman who has been re-engaged. We should thus have on record reports of the qualifications of men who had been re-engaged from time to time. </para>

                        <para>- Unless he obtains discharges, he will have no record  that he has been re-engaged. It seems to rae that as he pays a lump sum for his engagement and discharge, it is only reasonable that when he asks for his discharge it should be compulsory on the part of the master or owner to give it to him. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that, from an employer's point of view - and during my life I have employed a good many men - it is very much more satisfactory to have the testimony of four or five employers regarding an employe than, it is to have the certificate of only one employer 'who may have employed him for four or five months- </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the amendment is a very reasonable one. But I would point out to the Committee that the question relating to holidays would also arise if we required the wages earned by seamen during the previous month to be paid within forty-eight hours after the arrival of their vessel in port. For instance, a ship might arrive in port on the evening of Good Friday, and the banks would not reopen until the following Tuesday. But in connexion with any business which the law says shall be transacted within a given period these <inline font-style="italic">dies non</inline> do not count. </para>

If he begins work on his ship before the time specified in the agreement, he is to be paid from the time he goes on board. If, however, he does not go on board until the time specified, he has to be paid from the time the agreement commences. The clause makes the seaman's position perfectly safe. </para>

It is not clear whether, under this clause, he could, under such circumstances, claim two days' wages for the one day's work.

A seaman's agreement might terminate at 12 o'clock on a certain day. He would have to be paid up to that day. He might then make a fresh agreement. Under the clause as it stands there is a possibility of his being able to demand to be paid for the first day of the new agreement, although he had been paid for the last day of the old agreement, the two days being the same.

I have looked through that part of the New Zealand Act dealing with wages, and find that it contains no such provision. Section 76 of the New Zealand Act is precisely the same as this clause. If a seaman's time under an agreement expired at 12 o'clock on a particular day he would get his discharge; and if he signed on the same ship again, his wages would commence from the time he signed on.

                    <para>. - The proviso to this clause is not, I think, as clear as it might be. I should like to know whether it is intended that if a seaman has hot exerted himself to the utmost at the time of a wreck, that shall be a bar to his claim to wages, not merely during the time within which it is contended that he did not exert himself to the utmost, but for the whole term of his agreement, which might be three years. </para>

When rupees in India were at1s.10d., I have had to pay 2s. 3d. each for them to get money that I had earned myself. I wish to know whether under this clause a man who has not exerted himself to the utmost at the time of a wreck may forfeit the whole of the wages due to him under his agreement, or only wages due for the times during which it is said he did not exert himself. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think that the clause is indefinite at all. It means that a seaman who does not exert himself to the utmost in the circumstances set out would forfeit the whole of the wages due to him. I say without hesitation that a man who would be guilty of such conduct would deserve to lose all the wages due to him. Wrecks may occur on desert islands or at places far from the reach of the law, and we must have provisions to assist in preserving strict discipline in such cases. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has tried to bolster up his objection to the clause by inducing the Committee to believe that when a seaman signs a three years' agreement he does not receive any wages until the termination of the agreement. Under this Bill such a thing would be impossible. </para>

                    (South Australia)  £2.55].  - I am not defending men who will not do their utmost to save life where necessary. I should have no objection to such men being punished criminally. I object that under this clause. a man who may be charged with having failed to do his utmost at the time of a wreck may be called upon to forfeit  ,=£50  or
                    <inline font-style="italic">£60</inline>
                    due to him in wages. I point out to honorable senators that a ship might come into Melbourne that had been round the world. Some of her crew might have  ^50  or
                    <inline font-style="italic">£60</inline>
                    due to each of them in wages. Others might join in Melbourne, and as soon as the vessel got outside the Heads again she might be wrecked. Under this clause there would be no penalty upon those who had just joined the vessel in Melbourne, whilst other members of the crew might lose
                    <inline font-style="italic">£50</inline>
                    or
                    <inline font-style="italic">£40</inline>
                    in wages. I should be prepared to support a proposal for a criminal prosecution of men under the circumstances stated, but such conduct as is dealt with in the clause should not be a bar to a claim for wages. I ask who would benefit by this provision? I take it that the ship-owners would stick to the money, though after the ship was wrecked they would have nothing to do with it, and it would be in the hands of the underwriters. They could keep wages forfeited in this way as a plum. I can mention a case that occurred within half-a mile of my own house. A ship came to the powder buoys at Port Adelaide with  200  or  30c  tons of dynamite on board stowed close to a cabin that was discovered to be on fire. The alarm was so great that the police interfered with the church services and turned the people out of all the churches in Port Adelaide to avoid the possible effects of an explosion. The crew of the vessel tried to put out the fire, but were unable to do so with the equipment on board.

                        <para>- The honorable senator might let me finish the story. He may say that they did their utmost, but they did not succeed in putting out the fire, and the fire brigade came down the river with a float, got alongside the vessel and put the fire out, but the men when they got to Sydney were all dismissed from the ship for leaving it. Under this clause a man may be charged with not having done his utmost at the time of a wreck, and he would have to prove before a Court that he had done his utmost. </para>

Honorable senators want to provide that if, after the agreement is ended, a seaman does not exert himself to save the ship's stores, and equipment, he shall forfeit all the wages which he has earned. </para>

                        <para>- Whether a ship is wrecked or lost, under this clause the crew are required to exert themselves to the utmost, and, if they do not, they are to be punished. Who will be the judge of the danger which a crew are called upon to face? It will not be the seaman. He is not to be allowed to have a soul of his own, but is expected to obey every command. Even though a man may be running into certain danger and be conscious of it, honorable senators want to enact that if he disobeys, the command, he shall forfeit all the money which he has earned. As a matter of fairness, we should not enact such a provision. If honorable senators want to provide that a man who refused to render assistance in a case of shipwreck or loss shall be imprisoned or hanged, I am prepared to go to that length. But I am not prepared to bar a man's claim to his wages, the loss of which might not affect him, but would affect his wife and family. I hope that a clear definition will be made. </para>

A seaman is guilty under the clause of failure to exert himself to the best of his ability to save the ship, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> comes along, and says to his wife and children, " My good people,  1  feel all sympathy for you. Either your husband's wages must be forfeited, or he must be hanged. Out of my great mercy for you, I shall hang him." I do. not think that the honorable senator meant what he said, but if he did, the man's wife and family would be the last to thank him. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that before an owner or master can deprive a man of his wages, the latter has to show that the man did not exert himself to the utmost. There is no injustice done in the matter, because <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> his claim for wages holds good in the case of a wreck or the loss of the ship. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> says that, under the clause, a man may be asked to tread hot plates, or to do something of that sort. That is not a matter of exertion, but a matter of courage. If strong evidence is given that a seaman, hid himself when he ought to have been looking after the sails, or that an engineer hid himself when he ought to have been at his post, and that he could not be found when he was wanted, does the honorable senator contend that a man who has disobeyed not only the law of the land, but the law of humanity, ought not to be deprived of his wages ? The lien on a seaman's wages is one of the strongest and most easily enforced liens which any workman has. </para>

                        <para>- The Bill contains ample provision for a seaman to allot his wages, or to direct where or how they shall be paid. He is drawing upon them all the time. This clause only refers to the wages accruing due at the time, and not to the wages which he has earned, because they may be appropriated to a large extent. Only the amount accruing due, which in many cases is remarkably small, is in jeopardy under the clause. It will only be in jeopardy when a man has not exerted himself, as he ought to have done on the ship in a case of wreck, but before he can be deprived of that amount, the owner or master must go into a Court and prove affirmatively that he was a dastardly coward. Surely when that onus is thrown upon the master or the owner of a vessel, we ought to declare that a seaman who does not exert himself to the utmost in time of emergency shall not be able to enforce his claim for any wages which may be due to him. </para>

                    <para>. - I should have every sympathy with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> in the objection which he has raised, if there were anything really serious in it. But as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has pointed out, there is good reason for providing that a seaman ought to forfeit the wages accruing to him under certain circumstances. I would point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that clause  76  amply safeguards the seaman against injustice in respect of the payment of his wages. Under that provision a seaman who is in receipt of <inline font-style="italic">-£4.</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> a month may apportion a large amount of it to his wife and family. </para>

That may not be very much. On the other hand, if the owner unduly delays the payment of wages due to the seaman, the former is required to pay the latter double the amount of those wages. </para>

                        <para>- The owner has to give the seaman two days' pay for every day that he delays the payment of the wages due. Consequently, the sailor is amply protected. I am sure that no honorable senator wishes to protect the seaman who shirks his duty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has admitted that a shipwreck may occur, and that the sailors may not exert themselves as they ought to in endeavouring to save the vessel. But a ship is never wrecked while there is a possibility of saving her. It is during the time that she occupies a perilous position that everybody on board should exert himself to the utmost to save her. If a seaman does not so exert himself, I do not think that the punishment provided by this clause is too severe. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> will not insist upon delaying the passing of the provision. </para>

He has referred to the latter portion of the clause, which provides that proof that any seaman who has not exerted himself to the. utmost to save his ship in case of "wreck" or "loss" shall bar his claim to wages.

If <inline font-style="italic">Chambers</inline> be an authority on the subject, it is clear that a "wreck," or "loss," means that, for all practical purposes, a vessel has disappeared.

                    <para>- Sub-section  2  of clause  85  deals with the case of seamen who are engaged " by the run." The proposal here made differs from the corresponding provision in the Merchant Shipping Act. It provides that in case of a wreck the seamen shall be paid only a proportionate amount of the wages to which they would have been entitled had the run been completed. Suppose that a ship left Adelaide for Newcastle and was wrecked at King Island. Under this clause the seamen on board who were engaged by the run, would only be paid a proportion of what was due to them, calculated on the basis of the proportion of the journey that had been completed. The proposal is absolutely unfair. The old practice was that, if a vessel was not able to fulfil her contract, men shipped by the run were paid for the full run. Let me mention a case that has happened. A ship was fitted out in Melbourne to be sent to Newcastle. Her crew was short, and the owners decided to take a couple of men from Melbourne to Newcastle to make up her complement. The men were ordered on board at night. When they got on board the master told them that the run to Newcastle was cancelled, and that the ship was going to Port Pirie. The men immediately took up the position that they had not engaged to go to Port Pirie, but to Newcastle. Under the existing law they were entitled to their run-money as if they had gone to Newcastle. But under this clause, if that ship had gone outside the Heads and afterwards returned, the men engaged by the run would only have been paid a proportionate amount, and would have been brought back to Melbourne or landed at some other place at which they had not engaged to go.

                        <para>- If I were sending a lot of sheep from the Gulf inland, and arranged with a number of men to go that trip, and they were willing to perform that duty for a certain sum, the mere fact that my sheep died on the road would not relieve me of my obligation to pay them for going from the one point to the other. It would not be their fault that the sheep died. It is true that many drovers take men on at a moment's notice, and that they are liable to be dismissed at a moment's notice. But that is not the position of the sailor. He cannot be dismissed at a moment's notice, nor can he leave at a moment's notice. He is engaged to go from one port to another. </para>

It does seem to me to be entirely fair to say that when seamen start out with no hope of earning a .reasonable sum until they have finished a certain journey, they should be entitled to the wages for which they contracted to make that journey. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has made out- a very good case for his amendment. If we leave out the words " a proportionate part of " the clause will still leave the wages " subject to all just deductions." Those words will meet every reasonable case. It is only fair that if a seaman is engaged for the run, and through no fault of his the vessel meets with disaster, he should receive the wages due to him, " subject to all just deductions." <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> does not propose to eliminate those words.
