I do not wish to offer any objection, but honorable senators who have previously been members of the Senate will know that the practice followed has been for the  Chairman  of the Printing Committee to give notice on one day that he would move on the following day the adoption of the Committee's report. In the circumstances, I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> to give some explanation of the unusual course he now seeks to follow. </para>

(2)  The number and names of the telephone exchanges in each State, with the number of subscribers connected with each.  (3)  The number and names of metallic circuit exchanges in each State.  (4)  The number and names of multiple switchboard exchanges in each State, and the time when it is estimated the exchanges of the Commonwealth will be uniformly installed as far as switchboard systems are concerned. I am not asking the honorable senator to supply the information to-day, but I should be glad if he will endeavour to secure it by the next day of sitting, or as soon thereafter as possible. </para>

                <para class="block">It is not intended to do anything affecting the privileges of any honorable senator in connexion with the suspension of the standing order in question. The point is that under standing order 34 the Senate can only appoint seven of its members to serve on a joint Committee. The House of Representatives, however, has chosen eight members of the Library Committee. As this is an important Committee, it is thought desirable that the Senate should have an equal number of representatives upon it. The only way to secure that end is by carrying this motion. It is also the desire of those who have been concerned with the subject that an honorable senator who takes a very lively interest in literary matters should have a place on the Library Committee.

                        <para>- It is all very well for the Vice-President of the Executive Council to laugh. But I would ask, " What is the need for this hurry?" Cannot the matter be allowed to stand over till our next day of sitting? I do not like to agree to the suspension of any standing order unless there is an absolute necessity for adopting that course. I do not know how often the Library Committee meets - whether it be once a month or not - but if the motion were deferred till our next sitting day no harm would be done to anybody. </para>

                        <para>- If honours are to be divided amongst the members of the Senate why should the names of two or three honorable senators be found frequently appearing upon Committees whilst the names of others are entirely ignored? I strongly object to the adoption of the motion, which has been brought forward apparently for the purpose of currying favour with an individual. So far as my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, is concerned, I say at once that he is an able man, who is well fitted for a position on the Library Committee, but I think that his appointment should be permitted to stand over until the Senate next meets. I hope that the Government will be true to their colours and true to their own party, as well as to other honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>- I decline to believe that Committees are appointed which do not meet at some time or other. But the point to which I wish to direct special attention is that standing order 34 decrees that a Library Committee, consisting of seven honorable senators, shall be appointed, and shall sit with a similar Committee appointed by the House of Representatives. Yet the fact remains that the Committee appointed by the Senate in a previous session sat with a Committee appointed by the House of Representatives, which was not similar from the stand-point of numbers. The sole object of the Vice- -  President  of the Executive Council in moving this motion, is to permit of the appointment to the Library Committee of a number of honorable senators equal to the number of. members appointed by the other branch of the Legislature. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend must ask those who approved of the Standing Orders. If those orders are not to the liking of honorable senators the remedy is in their own hands. But whilst we have Standing Orders to govern our procedure we ought to make at least a pretence of adhering to them. Notwithstanding that a similar standing order in the other branch of the Legislature provides for the appointment of a Library Committee consisting of seven members for some reason or other it has appointed eight members. That is a most unbusiness-like way of doing things. If the other House chooses at any time to violate its Standing Orders it is at liberty to do so. But the moment it does so, by appointing an additional member to one of its Committees, is the Senate to immediately violate its Standing Orders by appointing an additional member to a similar Committee ? I wish to ask whether the matter ought not to be brought under the notice of those who can speak for both branches of the Legislature? Surely there ought to be some definite understanding in reference to the appointment of these joint Committees. In the absence of such an understanding Committees may be appointed which are so strong numerically as to become absurd. We are now asked to indorse a practice which is extremely undesirable, because if we can break one standing order with impunity we can break all our Standing Orders. </para>

                    <para>- I join with those who have protested against the suspension of standing order 34 as proposed by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. We must recollect that our Standing Orders were adopted no later than last year for the guidance of the Senate. They were adopted after very careful consideration on the part of a Committee appointed for the purpose, and after full discussion by honorable sena 1 tors. Those Standing Orders are absolutely useless, if, at the sweet will of a Government, they may be suspended and departed from. It appears to me that the Ministry have committed a blunder by failing to include <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> upon the Library Committee. Now they coolly ask us to sanction the suspension of this standing order so that they may rectify their blunder. </para>

                    <para>. - It is more or less clear that a breach of its own Standing Orders has been committed by the other Chamber in appointing its Library Committee. I therefore think that it would not be out of place if we were to frame a resolution drawing attention to that breach, and leave it to you, sir, to report further upon the matter. I am not inclined to agree to a suspension of standing order  34  now that it is clear that the difficulty arose through the other House neglecting or failing to observe an explicit standing order. We should certainly take the step of going to the origin of the error, and asking that it should be corrected rather than suspend our own standing order. Great care was given by the Senate in the preparation of its Standing Orders, but the very first thing which it is asked to do this session is to suspend a particular standing order, and the only reason given for making the' request is that apparently the other House has made a mistake. You, sir, are the proper authority to draw the attention of that House to the error, and I think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council would be acting wisely if he were to invite you to try to get the mistake corrected before we take any action either with regard to suspending the standing order, or to making a fresh appointment to the Committee. </para>

                    (Queensland)  £3.12].  - For three years I sat on the Library Committee with
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline>
                    and nothing would please me better than to see him reappointed to it. I was very surprised to find that he was left off this session. This discussion is not limited to the Library Committee, because a similar position exists in connexion with the House Committee. In the last Parliament the other House appointed a House Committee consisting of eight members, although its standing order on the subject provides for the. appointment of the  Speaker  and six other members. We cannot balance the representation on the Library Committee, because we find that the other House has one more representative than has the Senate, unless we take a similar course in connexion with the House Committee. I think, sir, that it would be a good thing if you would make suitable representations in the proper quarter, so that this breach of a standing order may be rectified, or if there is always going to be a breach of its standing order by the other House, we might consider the propriety of altering our own rule.

                        <para>- I said that I did not speak from a recent acquaintance with the Standing Orders of the other House. It may be that they .have committed a wrong in appointing eight members to their Library Committee. The absence, pf <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> would, I feel absolutely certain, be a considerable loss, not merely to the Library Committee but to the Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and I must congratulate the honorable senator upon his courtesy and self sacrifice in having done so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> association with the Library Committee commenced with the inauguration' of the Parliament. If we remember that that Committee has been responsible for collecting what is practically the only national library in Australia and getting the nucleus "of that which will be a national library when the Parliament finds its home in the national Capital, and if we also remember the interest, the enthusiasm, and the energy which the honorable senator has displayed in relation to everything connected with the Committee, and the amount of solid valuable advice which he has been able to give to its members, it will be recognised, I think, that his absence from that body would be a distinct loss. If by any reasonable means his omission from the Committee, which appears to have been due to an unfortunate accident on this occasion, can be rectified, I think that the Senate will be well advised in supporting any proposition, consistent with the existence of established rule and principle, which will insure his return to a body to which I think he has appropriately belonged. </para>

I hold that it would be wrong for the Senate to commence the session by breaking a rule which has been made for its guidance. 1 trust that the motion will not be persevered with, no matter who is to be appointed to the Library Committee. If the other House likes to break its rules that has nothing to do with the Senate. I hope that we shall not set a bad example because the other House has done wrong. </para>

                <para class="block">In submitting the measure to the Senate, I am introducing a very old friend. Under section 69 of the Constitution Act, the Commonwealth has power by proclamation, to take over from the States posts and telegraphs, defence, lighthouses, lightships,, beacons, buoys, and quarantine. By proclamation, the Commonwealth has taken over defence and post and telegraphs, and* it has taken over quarantine to a very considerable extent by Act of Parliament. For various reasons it has been thought advisable to also take over lighthouses, lightships, beacons and buoys by Act of Parliament.. We have the power, as I have stated, to proceed by way of proclamation, but it is anticipated that if that course were adopted a great many difficulties and differences of opinion might arise. It was felt that by negotiations under this Bill, ocean lights, and beacons might be taken over and that the more contentious question of taking  over  harbor and other lights could be left to another time or another Bill, or even to proclamation. If we pass a Bill to take over certain lights that will not take away from the Commonwealth the power by proclamation to do anything else when it has come to a definite conclusion in that direction, nor will it take away from the Commonwealth the right by another Bill ta take away from the States, harbor lights and other marine marks which might not be considered as ocean marks. The number of lighthouses of this description to be taken over by the Commonwealth is approximately 120, and the cost of maintenance is about ^60,000 a year. </para>
                <para class="block">Since the establishment of Federation the State Governments have in this matter been in a condition of uncertainty, and though some additional lights and marine marks are absolutely necessary for the safety of vessels around our 8,000 or 9,000 miles of coast-line, the State Governments have hesitated to incur the expense of their erection, because they were in doubt as to when the. Commonwealth might issue a proclamation to take them over. </para>

                        <para>- It will be the duty of the Commonwealth to erect new ocean lights. It is suggested that twelve new ocean lights are necessary. Four are required on the Queensland coast, four on the coast of Western Australia, and one on the coasts of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania respectively. The necessity for the erection of these ocean lights, to secure the safety of vessels navigating our waters, is a strong reason why something definite should be done in this matter as soon as possible. We  know  that divided control may be very inconvenient and unwise, but we have under existing conditions a diversified control of marine lights and marks. The position is <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> go-as-you-please in each State, and there is no uniformity in their control. </para>

                        <para>- Consequently it is thought well that, in the interests of ships navigating around Australia, some definite course should be adopted. This Bill, if carried into law, will enable the Commonwealth to carry out  improvements  that are really required, and will give the Commonwealth Government an opportunity to give effect to an understanding come to with the State Governments for the transfer to it of ocean lights. The way will be left open to us to -come to an agreement with respect to all other lights and marine marks. It is not desired to raise any conflict with respect to the definition of an ocean light, a harbor <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> river light, or a marine mark of any description, but we want some definite understanding on the subject that we may commence really necessary work of this kind as soon as possible. The Bill is a short one of sixteen clauses. It provides for definitions, administration, and the taking-over of marine marks from the different States, and the control of the lighting of the whole of the coast of Australia apart from harbors and rivers. Penalties are provided for any violations of the law. </para>

                        <para>- There is no difference in principle, but in clause 15 there is a slight verbal alteration. In the Bill introduced previously, penalties were provided for in clause 15 for riding beside a light, or mooring to a light or marine mark. There was nothing said about obstructing such a light or mark, and the only alteration in this Bill as compared with that previously considered in the Senate makes the obstruction of a light also an offence against the law. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will agree that if the other matters included in clause 15 as offences are legitimately so regarded, provision for a penalty for the obstruction of a light should also be included in the clause. Clause 16 provides for the making of regulations. I hope that honorable senators will discuss the. second reading fairly, and will endeavour to get the Bill through Committee, so that if possible we may be able to adjourn this evening until the 3rd August. </para>

                    <para>- - I desire to make only a few remarks on this Bill. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has intimated that to all intents and purposes it is the same as the Bill passed in this Chamber last session. I assume the only justification for the step now taken is that, owing to the termination of one Parliament and the commencement of another, it was not possible to revive the Bill of last session at the stage which it had previously reached in the Senate. In the circumstances, it would be useless for honorable senators on this side to discuss a Bill with which they have already dealt. Of course, there are new members in the Senate, who, unfortunately, sit on the wrong side of the chamber, and they may desire to discuss the measure. No one on this side will desire to delay its passage. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator cannot do so, because upon a previous occasion he said that it contained no principle. I remind the Senate that certain honorable senators were in the last Parliament so strongly opposed to the Bill when introduced by the previous Government, that they forced the Senate to a division upon it on three occasions. I do not know whether they intend now to be consistent and continue their opposition; but I can say for honorable senators on this side that they are quite content to accept the Bill as it stands.. </para>

                    <para>. - As the Leader of the Opposition has just said, there was in the last Parliament considerable opposition to this Bill, because, while under it the Commonwealth is asked to take over certain marine lights and marks, we do not know just what it is we are being asked to take over. We were told that there is in this matter a certain agreement with the State Governments. </para>

                        <para>- This Parliament knows nothing whatever about that understanding or agreement. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has told us to-day that, approximately,  120  lights are to be taken over. I say that we have a right to be informed what lights are to be taken over, and what are to be left in the hands of the State Governments. We have a right also to know on what conditions any lights are being taken over. </para>

We do know, however, that in some of the States the lighthouse-keepers have to put up with conditions which are no better than those of the sweated dens of Melbourne. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator had been kept bobbing up and down in a light-ship for years, he would be glad to go ashore at some time or another, shall not oppose the Bill. The Opposition and the Government are in accord as to the desirability of passing it, but I say it will be a mistake to pass it. I lodge my protest against the proposed partial taking over of lights, beacons, and buoys. They should not be taken over under an agreement such as has been suggested, or by asking the State Governments what lights they were prepared to transfer to the Commonwealth. It might be expected that they would give us all their bad lights, or lights which involve trouble and expense, and keep those which could be most easily managed. Again, honorable senators should consider what the effect of this Bill will be upon shipping. If the measure is passed, shipping will be hampered by having to pay Federal light dues as well as State light dues, and it will add to the expense of the collection of light dues from ships using Federal and State lights. The Bill is a bad one, and the present Government should not have touched it at all. It would have been better to have delayed legislation upon the question until the whole matter had had full consideration. </para>

                        <para>- We have been informed that all lights outside harbor lights or port lights are to be taken over.  1  admit that there may be some difference of opinion as to the correct definition of a harbor light. But these matters cannot be provided for in a Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> himself, when the Navigation Commission drew up its report, saw the advisableness of the Commonwealth taking over ocean lighthouses such as are provided for in this measure, and leaving other lights to the control of the States. That being so, I cannot understand his opposition to what is proposed to be done. As to the status of lighthouse-keepers, it is safe" to say that they will be no worse off under Commonwealth control than they are under the States. The officers of other Departments that have been taken over by the Commonwealth have benefited materially from the change. If at present any lighthouse-keepers are being sweated I should . think that that was a very good reason for the Commonwealth taking over the lights of which they are in charge. </para>

                        <para>- But the control of harbors is left to the States. Those harbors require certain lights for the proper working of them. Even though those lights may be wanted for navigation purposes they will also be required for purely harbor purposes. Consequently it would appear that the Commonwealth has not control of every light used in connexion with shipping. We have a right to take over all lights affecting navigation, and that is as -far as this Bill proposes to go. I hold that it is quite a waste of time and effort to offer opposition to a measure that clearly assumes all the power required for taking over ocean lights, seeing that the Navigation Commission which was specially appointed to inquire into the subject has recommended this course. </para>

The clause under consideration provides that the clues shall be fixed by regulation, and collected by Customs officers. They will be prescribed on the recommendation of officers who will take care to obtain sufficient information to enable them to  fix  rates which will bring in an income approximating to the cost of administering and maintaining the lights. The information will, of course, be furnished to Parliament, and' will be at the disposal of honorable senators. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to emphasize what I have already said in reference to the uncertainty which obtains at the present time. Those honorable senators who are acquainted with the conditions which have existed in the different ports of the various States, must recognise that, in some of those ports, everything has been done to attract trade. In some instances the light dues have been so small that they have not paid, and, in others, they have been so mixed up with harbor dues, pilotage fees, Stc, that it has been almost impossible to obtain an accurate idea of what they really were. I entirely agree with the view of the Leader of the Opposition that these charges should be so adjusted as to make the service self-supporting, and to afford protection to the sea-going people around our coasts at as reasonable a cast as possible. </para>

In discussing the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply he expressed the hope that the business-paper would be so arranged that, at a later stage of the session, we might have a lengthy adjournment, so as to enable representatives of distant States to pay a visit to their constituents. He was not present on the following day when I heartily indorsed that view, and when I added that I hoped a reasonable adjournment would be agreed to only after we had done some work. Since I have been a member of this Chamber I have always opposed unnecessary adjournments. </para>

                        <para>- A debate took place upon the motion submitted by- the then Leader of the Senate and several Labour members protested against the proposed adjournment. A division resulted in fourteen votes being east in favour of the motion, and eleven against it. Amongst the noes I find the names of Senators de Largie, Findley, Givens, Guthrie, Henderson, Lynch, Pearce, E. J. Russell, Stewart, Turley, and myself. If we were right in opposing that adjournment on the ground that the Government should have had in readiness Bills to give effect to its policy, I am equally right in opposing the present adjournment, seeing that the Governor-General's Speech outlines certain Bills which might well be initiated here. </para>

                        <para>- Whilst I am prepared to make every allowance to the Government on account of the indisposition of the Minister of Defence, I submit that Bills which might be initiated in the Senate ought to be ready to be proceeded* with now. The Government have already been ten weeks in office, which is a longer period than the Deakin Government had been in power when their action last year in moving for a fortnight's adjournment was challenged. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. I oppose this motion because measures ought to have been in readiness to keep the Senate occupied. If, after those measures had been dealt' with, it had been found a few weeks hence that we were without work, owing to the other Chamber being unable to keep pace with us, I should then have welcomed an adjournment, which would have afforded honorable senators an opportunity of visiting their different States, and of remaining there for a few days, in order that they might get into close touch with their constituents. To me this is rather a surprise motion. Certainly, , it has been bruited abroad that the Senate was going to adjourn, and every motion which the Vice-President of the Executive Council has submitted to-day has contained a reference to the next day of sitting. </para>

He certainly ought to have had Bills ready for the Senate, when he would not have felt called upon to move for a prolonged adjournment after having sat for only eight or nine hours in all. </para>

There is a very important Bill which has been before the Senate, off and on, for six years. The Navigation Bill was first introduced here six years ago. The shipowners and the seafaring people have been awaiting its enactment during all these years. </para>

                        <para>- I intend to say a few words about" that matter directly, and possibly the honorable senator will not like them too well. The Navigation Bill was referred to a Royal Commission, which examined many witnesses in a very exhaustive fashion, and presented a report. Next we had an Imperial Conference in London in connexion with the measure, and we got a report from our representatives. A measure, based on the conclusions of the Royal Commission and the Imperial Conference, was introduced into the Senate last session, and partially dealt with. Unfortunately, it was not finally dealt with. But the Government have that Bill in their possession. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator says that that was not a partial commencement with the Bill, what is a final commencement anyhow? In my opinion, the very initial act was a final commencement. The Government has that measure as a basis to go on. I am informed on the best authority that there are not more than fifty amendments contemplated by the Government or their advisers. Is it too much to expect that the Minister in charge of the Bill, with the aid of the Attorney-General and the Crown Law officers, should have been able to draft fifty amendments in a measure which is already in print in less time than they have had at their disposal? The Government have been in office for ten weeks; they have found time to attend various functions, and it was not too much to expect from them that they would see that the Bill was ready for the Senate, because, after all, to make fifty amendments in a Bill of which they had a very clear idea was not a task beyond the powers of their officers to accomplish in a week. Seeing that they have been either too lazy or too neglectful to deal with the matter in a business-like fashion, so as to provide work for the Senate, I intend to vote with those who object to the proposed adjournment. I shall do so as a protest against the dilatory action of the Government and the way in which they are treating the Senate. In the mind of any person, especially in the minds of some members of the other House, and also of some Ministers, there seems to be nothing but a feeling of contempt for the Senate. They are continually voicing that feeling. If we are going to allow any Government, I care not what Government it is, to treat the Senate in that fashion, we shall deserve all the sneers which may be levelled at us. It is for that reason that I have always protested against unnecessary adjournments, and will take every opportunity to vote against them. </para>

                        <para>- I shall come to that point presently. Last week we were detained for four and a half hours. Is it reasonable to expect men to come from their homes, especially from homes in very distant States, for the purpose of putting in four and a half hours at legislative work? That is reducing the whole thing to a farce. 1 submit now, as I pointed out on the Address-in-Reply, that a much more businesslike method for handling the affairs of the country would be for the Government to push on with whatever business it can bring forward, and then to propose an adjournment for a reasonable period. I am very glad indeed that the Government do not want to keep us hanging about performing the goose-step, and pretending to be at work when there is no business to be done, merely for the sake of keeping up appearances. But, apart from that, the question arises whether there ought to be a need for the Senate to adjourn at all. Perhaps I cannot do better than ask honorable senators to cast their minds back to the time to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> referred. On the formation of the last Government, which had been in existence only four days, when it met the Senate and asked for an adjournment, in order to prepare a programme, there was an immense outcry of indignation from the Opposition benches. We were told that we should have had ready for the Senate not only our policy, but Bills giving expression to it, and by division honorable senators sought to curtail the adjournment. After the recent election the Deakin Government did not remain in office for a single day longer than suited the convenience of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> and his colleagues. We afforded to those gentleman every possible opportunity to get their measures ready for early presentation to Parliament. We vacated office, leaving the way open to our successors to ' step in and get their measures ready... That occurred ten or eleven weeks ago, but what is the result ? We are met here to-day with a frank admission by the Government that, in spite of the ample opportunity afforded t) them, there is practically no work yet prepared for the Senate to do. I regret that fact. I regret it, first of all, because I am here. For the last three weeks I have been here prepared to go on with work, and I shall be here when there is work to be done. No one who looks at the matter impartially can fail to recognise that the Senate has utterly disappointed the hopes of its friends.  It is not taking the place which it was designed in the Constitution' to take, nor is it likely to do so if such procedure as this is to be the hall mark of every session. I speak now as one whose public career will probably end as a member of the Senate. I have hoped almost against hope that, in some way or other, it would endeavour to pull itself out of the bog into which it has wandered. I look to the present Government with a strong majority, and represented by three Ministers here, to do something in that direction. It is quite true that one Minister  is absent from his place. I do not want too much to be made of that fact. There is no honorable senator who is more sympathetic towards <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> or any other man stricken in health, than I am. But it is not fair for honorable senators on the other side to plead that it is because of his indisposition that the proposed adjournment is necessary ; it is rank hypocrisy to say so. The fact is that there is no business ready for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> or other Ministers -to proceed with. If fifty <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearces</inline> were on the Treasury bench, the necessity for the proposed adjournment would still exist. If the measures were ready, we have two Ministers prepared to go on with them ; but no measures are ready. </para>

                        <para>- There are plenty of other measures which could have been prepared. It is, I am sure, disappointing to old and new senators that at the end of the third week of the session we have not done one solid day's work. No man can pretend that we have done a single day's work since we met, and yet we are called upon to adjourn. That is regrettable. At the same time, I wish it to be clearly understood that I entirely support the Government, seeing that they came down with' an admission that they have no work ready for us. It is very much better that they should say to honorable senators, in the circumstances : ' ' We think it better to close the doors of the Senate until we have some business which can reasonably occupy your time." </para>

But after my honorable friend's explanation, I cannot say that our personal position in the Senate is very much clearer. Supposing that we resisted the proposed adjournment, and carried the motion, who would take on the business of the country when the Government are unprepared with business? </para>

                        <para>- Not at my present emolument. If Senators Needham and Givens, and the two senators who have 10 strongly brought their own Government book, can give us an assurance that if the motion be carried they will be prepared to go on, not with Government business, but with some business which is of equal importance to the country ; if they will say that during the recess they have so assiduously studied the political position that they have some urgent measure so perfected in their own minds and ready for -presentation to the Senate that they can go <inline font-style="italic">ton</inline> with business, we may be able to extricate ourselves in that way from the difficulty in which we find ourselves. I am reminded by the position into which the Senate has got itself of the maxim of a "French philosopher, "The. more things change, the more they are the same." It is astonishing how a change of position brings about a change of sentiment and opinions. We are evidently in the unenviable position of having to choose between <inline font-style="italic">n</inline> close, association with  His  Satanic Majesty and jumping into the sea, a particularly disagreeable Hobson's choice. I am afraid that, in the circumstances, we shall be obliged to accede to. the request of the Government, and accept the adjournment. When this particularly strong Government, composed of men of magnificent talent, enthusiasm, and ability, with an interval of over ten weeks from the time their predecessors handed over their offices to them, have been unable to find any work for the Senate to do, I might be permitted to improve the present occasion by asking how long it is likely to be be fore they will be ready to ask the Senate to go on with the business of the country. </para>

                    <para>. - Of course. I regret very much that circumstances have prevented the Government from at least bringing before the Senate the measure that was the stalking-horse of so many Governments in the past - the Navigation Bill. A great many changes will require to be made in the text of that Bill before it can be introduced to the Senate again. We know the progress that was made with this measure in the past. The Senate took nearly six years to consider less than eighteen clauses. If it took six years to consider eighteen clauses in the condition in which the Bill was originally introduced, how many years would it take the Senate to consider 400 clauses if the Bill still remained in that condition? That is a problem to which I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger to apply his mathematical mind. The reason we have not brought the Navigation Bill before the Senate up to the present time is that we are endeavouring to make it so acceptable to honorable senators that instead of taking another six years to consider eighteen of its clauses, the Senate will be able to dispose of 476 clause's in less than six weeks. </para>

There are other aspects of this question to be considered. No one on this side has a right, and I am sure no honorable senator opposite desires, to blame the Minister of Defence for any delay in the bringing of measures before the Senate. </para>

I ask Senators Needham and Givens to remember that a large proportion of the measures referred to in the policy of the Government are of such a character that they could not be introduced in the Senate, and I direct their attention also to the fact that those are the very measures which are of the greatest urgency. Do they desire that the Government should manufacture some kind of Bills for the Senate to play with, or to occupy the time of honorable senators?

If measures of urgency introduced in another place could be got through rapidly, they would very likely be ready for the Senate next week. But I took the precaution, adopting a suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition, to make inquiries so that any adjournment decided upon might be of sufficient length to meet the convenience of the majority of members of the Senate. I should like to ask those who are objecting to the adjournment proposed whether it is not better that we should adjourn until the 3rd August, to suit the convenience of  honorable senators, when by doing so, we shall have business to go on with when we meet again? Would honorable senators who are objecting to the proposal which has been made, have us adjourn for only a week, to come back and find that there was still no business on the paper, when, by prolonging the adjournment for a few days more, we might return to take up the consideration of a full business-paper?

                        <para>- There is another thing I should like to direct the attention of Senators Needham and Givens to, and that is that when we had an Opposition in the Senate the debate on the Address-in-Reply used to last for a fortnight or three weeks. On this occasion only three members of the Opposition spoke upon the Address-in-Reply. I am not sorry for that, because it is more in the interests of the country, of honorable senators, and certainly of the Government, that we should adjourn for three weeks than that honorable senators should come here to talk nonsense for three or four weeks on the Address-in-Reply. I have proposed an adjournment until the 3rd August because we have no business at present to go on with, because it would suit the convenience of the majority of honorable senators not. to meet again before that time, and because thereafter we shall be in a position to do the business which needs to be done in the interests of the country. </para>

The question that I desire to put, has reference to a statement published in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> commenting upon the new regulations to be enforced by the Postmaster-General. It was stated that the regulation would not apply' to telephones as to which there were certain proprietary rights. I gather, therefore, that there are exceptions to the regulation which is to come into force on 1st September, owing to the fact that all the telephones in this country are not under the control of the Postmaster-General. I should like to know whether that inference is correct; and, if so, to what extent there are proprietary rights which will not be affected by the new regulations? </para>

I wish to say a few words in explanation. When my name was suggested for membership of the Library Committee, I felt that that was the Committee on which I should most like to be; because I thought that membership of it afforded an opportunity for a vast amount of interesting work in connexion with the building up of the Commonwealth Library. But it appears that through an oversight, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> name was omitted when the Committee was constituted. I recognised that the absence of that honorable senator would mean a great deal to the Library Committee. I, therefore; thought that the best way out of the difficulty was to tender my resignation. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has taken a keen interest in the Library from the inception of this Parliament. I have resigned because I wish to give him an opportunity to continue his services, whilst, at the same time, I did not wish a standing order of the Senate to be violated. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has acted from generous motives in tendering his resignation from the Library Committee ; but I think there is wisdom in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has suggested. This is not a Government matter. It is simply a matter as between the members of the Senate. Those who took in hand the arrangement of the sessional Committees, endeavoured to get the best representatives on each Committee in accordance with their judgment. When a difficulty occurred with reference to the motion which I submitted at the beginning of to-day's sitting, it Was hoped that a conference between the  President  and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> would enable a suitable arrangement to be made.

                        to tender his resignation until we know what it is proposed to do in reference to the representation on the Committee of another place. If, when we meet again, the Senate is prepared to carry my motion, no harm will be done, and

                        I am afraid that he has acted with youthful impetuosity ; but he need not be in so great a hurry. He is aware that what has occurred is simply the result of an unfortunate error. If the attempt to arrive at a suitable understanding fails, there will then be time for
