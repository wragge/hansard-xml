                                GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;2.39&#93;.- I assume that the motion is submitted with the concurrence of the Senate, because no notice of it has been given. I have much pleasure in seconding the motion, and I am quite sure that the Senate will not be behind hand in desiring that there may be prosperity in South Africa. Although its new Constitution is in many respects different from that under which the Commonwealth exists, at the same time we cannot fail to recognise that it is a means by which a number of self-governing dependencies have been brought together, so that they may have the opportunity of speaking as the young and rising nation of South Africa, just as we speak on behalf of the young nation of Australia, and the Dominion Government does of Canada. It must be a matter of congratulation that self-governing States have so largely availed themselves of the opportunity of placing themselves in a position to speak as a whole, instead of with different voices. In any case, I am sure that we all wish most hearty success and prosperity to South Africa. We, on this side, are pleased that our Prime Minister has gone there to represent . Australia as a whole, and feel sure that he will acquit himself to the satisfaction of his friends and wellwishers.

                <para>This is a Bill which is debated on the first reading, but I do not think it should lead to any lengthy discussion, because it proposes merely a grant from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of&#163;816,619 for the ordinary services of government on the basis of last year&#39;s Estimates. Honorable senators recognise that until the Estimates for the current financial year are passed we have to depend on these temporary Supply Bills. We are asking, in this instance, for two months&#39; Supply, not because we do not hope that the session will have closed before the expiration of that time, but because it is possible that it will last into the second month, and by granting two months&#39; temporary Supply now we shall obviate the necessity of passing another Supply Bill before the Appropriation Bill is dealt with. There is no extraordinary item covered by the Bill, and therefore honorable senators will not consider it necessary to discuss it at great length. As there is a long programme of work to be got through before the session closes, the less time that is wasted on formal matters of this description the greater will be the probability of our being able to get through the business in a reasonable time. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;2.48&#93;.- The Vice-President of the Executive Council might very well have explained to the Senate what work the Government contemplate proceeding with during the remainder of the session. I notice from the press that the Prime Minister in another place made a statement with regard to the matters with which the Government intend to ask Parliament to deal before the session comes to a close. I think a similar courtesy should have been extended to the
                </para>
                <para class="block">Senate. It has hitherto been customary when a statement of the business to be submitted to Parliament has been made in another place it has been at once repeated here. As the Senate did not sit yesterday, it was, of course, impossible for the Vice-President of the Executive Council to inform honorable senators then as to the business to be proceeded with during the remainder of the session, but the honorable senator might very well have made a full statement to-day. If one is to judge from the newspaper reports of the work which, according to the Prime Minister, the Government contemplate asking Parliament to tackle, it is of sufficient importance and volume to occupy both Chambers for sis months. Some time ago we were led to believe that a strong effort would be made to close the session before the Prime Minister left for South Africa. At the time a very important measure was under consideration in another Chamber, and, very naturally, led to considerable discussion, and it has been found impossible to get the work of the session done as expeditiously as some persons seemed to anticipate. </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad that the Opposition in the present Parliament do not merely say yea or nay to every proposal submitted by the Government. We have been able to give reasons for the opinions we hold, which on several occasions have had an important effect upon the legislation introduced by the Government. We are promised a Bill for a referendum on a most important proposed alteration of the Constitution, and we shall require a considerable time for the proper consideration of that measure. A number of Bills mentioned by the Prime Minister bristle with technicalities and difficulties, and deal with matters upon which there is great divergence of opinion. We have not yet reached a stage when we can rely solely upon the ability, industry, and intelligence of the Ministry or of the Caucus to submit perfect legislation, which will be in the best interests of the country. I am prepared to admit that, so far as they are able to judge, Ministers give their best attention to their business, and submit what they believe to be perfect measures. But when those measures are made public, and are subjected to the criticism of the Opposition, it is invariably found that they are open to. material improvement. </para>

                        <para>- I have frequently observed that this Chamber is one of the most fertile places in Australia for fiction, and I think that publishers generally would take advantage of a great opportunity for the production of fiction if they gave a little attention to the imaginative and fictitious statements which are so frequently heard in this Chamber. I have no objection to voting the money required for the ordinary services of government on the basis of Estimates already approved. I do not know whether this Bill contains anything more, but I have not had an opportunity of going through it. I should like to know whether another little vote is included for the Treasurer&#39;s Advance account. </para>

                        <para>- I have not been able too discover that, but the Bill should certainly include a vote for the purpose. I hope that when the Vice-President of the Executive Council replies to the debate on the first reading he will give the Senate a statement of the business that the Government really contemplate placing before this Chamber during the remainder of the session. I must say that I think the Prime Minister made a very heavy demand upon the credulity of honorable members in another place when he invited them to believe that they would be able, in the course of a month or so, to deal with matters the consideration of which might very well occupy  six months. Perhaps the Vice-President of the Executive Council will be able to explain that this demand on the credulity of honorable members was due only to the exuberance of the moment. </para>

I am one of those who credited, and still credit, the Government with honest intentions in the matter, but there are some persons who attribute the delay in the issue of the proclamation to reasons which do not appear on the surface. </para>

                    <para>. - for reasons which will be obvious, if not to the Senate, at least to the public, I ask how long we are to continue the practice of voting temporary Supply? I do not say that the present Government are alone to blame in this matter, but they <inline font-style="italic">are</inline> becoming notoriously conspicuous in the adoption of the practice. On 3rd July, immediately after the opening of this Parliament, we passed a Supply Bill authorizing the appropriation of &#163;744,000. That measure covered Supply for one month. On 4th August we agreed to a further Supply Bill for &#163;1,280,000, &#34; which covered Supply for two months. On 6th August, a proposal was submitted to the Senate authorizing the Government to appropriate ,&#163;500,000 from a trust fund, :and on 9th August, a further sum of &#163;3,500,000 was appropriated for the payment of old-age pensions. To-day we are asked to sanction a further  advance of &#163;1,500,000 from a trust fund, and to grant Supply for a period of two months to the extent of &#163;816,619. _ So that, roughly speaking, we are committed to an expenditure of more than ,&#163;8,000,000. </para>

Whether they are expending it wisely we have scarcely had an opportunity to consider. I repeat -that, up to date, Parliament has appropriated the sum of &#163;8,250,000 out of the revenue for the current financial year, which the Treasurer estimates will be a little more than &#163;15,000,000. _ In other words, we have already appropriated more -than half the anticipated revenue for the financial year, and that without being afforded an opportunity of discussing the &#34;financial policy of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. But the Senate has not been afforded an opportunity of discussing it, and that opportunity does not appear to be within measurable distance. Yet honorable senators opposite have the consummate audacity to tell members of the Opposition that if they are good children the financial policy of the Government will continue to boom. Ministers ought to know that finance is the key of all sound government. If their finances are not upon a sound footing every measure which they introduce will land the country in difficulties. More than half the anticipated revenue for the current financial year has already been appropriated, and yet we have not had a clear exposition of the financial policy of the Government. Indeed, beyond the Budget statement of the Treasurer himself, and the tables which accompanied it, not a single member of this Parliament has been afforded an opportunity to get a clear idea of how the financial proposals of the Government will work out. It is time that the public understood how long this sort of thing is&#34; to continue. </para>

This is the only place in which we can lay a fairly heavy hand upon the expenditure of the Government. So far as their financial proposals are concerned, they seem to be rushing like a locomotive under a full head of steam on a down grade. Yet we &#34;are asked time and again to take it for granted that everything is all right. Millions of pounds are being paid into the Trust Funds, and we are invited to regard that as. all right.. </para>

                        <para>- If we add to the  &#163;^9,407,  which I have mentioned, the rentals which are paid for Commonwealth offices in other cities, the total sum would lie sufficient to pay interest upon  .&#163;750,000,  which might be expended very profitably in erecting buildings of our own at the Seat of Government. At present the Commonwealth appears to be paying some very curious rentals. For instance, in the Rialto, Collins-street, Melbourne, it pays  &#163;500  for the Statistician&#39;s office, which, when I visited it on the last occasion, consisted of only two rooms. In the same building  &#163;300  is being paid for a post-office, and another  &#163;400  for the Census office, making  &#163;1,200  rental in all. The rents paid in Melbourne aggregate  &#163;^9,917,  those in Sydney  &#163;8,353,  and those in Brisbane &#163;r,i37- Although Melbourne and Sydney may be regarded as about equal in size, I find that whereas in the former city the* Commonwealth pays only &#163;i,2gi for postal stores, stables, &#38;c, it expends no less than  &#163;4,438  in that connexion in the latter city, or about four times as much. For instance, it pays  &#163;250  a year rental for a post-office at the railway station, Sydney,  &#163;675  for a parcels post-office and stables in Castlereagh-street,  &#163;575  for a money -order office,  &#163;260  for a post-office in George-street west,  .&#163;479  for a postal store at  170  Clarence-street, and  &#163;500  for another postal store at  97  Clarence-street. </para>

I do not say that the present Government are to blame for the existing condition of affairs. But it appears to me that there is the germ of a very considerable scandal in the excessive rentals which the Commonwealth is paying. I do not intend to delay the passing of this Bill, as I am anxious to proceed with the business with which we are expected to deal within the next month or six weeks. I may suggest to the Government that, as there is so much work to do this session, they should initiate some of their measures in the Senate. We might drop, for the time being, the Navigation Bill. </para>

                        <para>- Quite likely. I never knew a little landlord, or a big landlord either, who would not &#34; take you down,&#34; if he got the chance. I am not an apologist for landlords. It is easy enough from these figures to draw the inference that Sydney is robbing the Commonwealth, while Melbourne is treating us uncommonly well. That appears to be especially the case in relation to the Post and Telegraph Department. I again ask the Government to look into the matter, and see if something cannot be done to remedy a position under which we are paying such an enormous sum in rents, that it would surely be advantageous to erect buildings for ourselves. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the Commonwealth is now face to face with a position which demands the urgent consideration of every man who desires to see the Federation make progress. We have heard from different quarters a good deal about the prosperity of the country at the present moment. As evidence of that we are referred to the very large amount of money that is received in revenue from the Customs as showing that the people of Australia are so prosperous that they are able to purchase largely goods imported from abroad. The fiscal policy of Australia is protection. That policy has been entered upon deliberately with the object of developing the resources of Australia, providing employment for the people, adding as speedily as possible to the population, and- strengthening Australia as a community from every possible point of view. If that be the policy of Australia, and if the Tariff which is now in operation is the expression of it, the fact must be patent to every man who gives this matter the slightest consideration that we are not carrying out the fiscal policy which the people of Australia have laid down for us. Our Tariff is one of the greatest revenue producing engines in the world. There is not a single country on the face of the earth to-day whose Tariff produces such a large sum per head of the population as that of Australia, with the one exception of New Zealand. That fact may no doubt be very pleasant from the Treasurer&#39;s point of view. He may desire that money should be flowing in so rapidly. But from&#39; the point of view of Australia&#39;s citizens, from the point of view of the man or woman who desires that Australia&#39;s progress shall proceed on the best lines, I think it is one of the most unfortunate circumstances which could possibly arise. What are we doing? Last year, we spent about ,&#163;50,000,000 sterling on imported goods from other countries. A large proportion of that money could have been, and ought to have been, spent in manufacturing those goods upon the soil of Australia by Australian hands. If our Tariff is to be effective from the Protectionist&#39;s point of view, it must be very radically altered at the earliest possible opportunity. We are not protecting our industries now. The large imports are the best indication that could possibly be adduced of that fact. I have no doubt that the members of the Labour party in this Parliament, who are Protectionists, and new Protectionists, will say that until the people of Australia give us the power to deal with the conditions in every protected industry, we are going to do nothing. Now, I think that the people of Australia ought to have the power themselves to say what conditions shall prevail in every industry, and that the power should make itself felt through the Commonwealth Parliament. But our duty to  begin with is to make it possible for Australia&#39;s industries to grow here in .spite .of competition from the cheap labour countries pf the world. At present, there is not a single manufacturing industry in Australia that is not being exposed to the fier.ce competition of the low wage countries of the world. Our huge imports are incontestable evidence of &#39;that fact. Before we can ask employers to pay decent wages, we must protect them against the competition of foreign sweaters. We are attempting to put sweating down within .pur .own borders. No man is more anxious that that should be accomplished than I am. But we are permitting the goods of sweaters in other parts of the world to pour into Australia to the extent of millions&#39; every year. Where is our consistency in that &#39; matter ? We might just as well be exposed to the sweater within our borders as to the sweater outside our borders. We should have some control oyer the man within, but we certainly have no control over the man without, except through our Tariff ; and that our- Tariff is insufficient for the purpose is plainly evidenced by the huge stream of imports which is pouring into this continent. </para>

                        <para>- I know the honorable senator&#39;s fiscal faith. I am not addressing myself to him, or to the party with which he is associated, because I know that they are not Protectionists. Neither are they Free Traders. They are Revenue  Tariffists  I am addressing myself to the members of my own party who are Protectionists, who are bound by the Labour policy to oppose Revenue  Tariffism  in every shape or form, and who, if they dp not adopt effective Protection, have but one alternative, and that is Free Trade. I am addressing myself, not to senators on my right, but to those on my left. As I have said, I know what the fiscal policy of the Opposition is. It is to tax the poor man, to tax the necessaries of life, to raise as much revenue as possible through the Customs, so that the big land-owners, the large income-earners ana the rich men may escape taxation. The very opposite is the policy of the party with which I am associated. We say, &#34; Sweep away your Customs taxation, and use your Tariff, not as a revenue-raising machine, but as an industry-creating machine.&#34; Yet we have a Tariff on the statute-book which is notoriously ineffective. I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> say behind me a few moments ago that we cannot get  enough people to dp the work which has to be done  in  Australia now. Therefore I suppose his contention is that it is useless to attempt to establish new industries. But  if  we had the industries - if we bad even the germ pf the industries-r-we should very soon have the people. In any case, I direct the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> to the very  important point that Australia is at the present moment passing through a period of greater prosperity than I believe she has ever  experienced  before, certainly., a period of greater prosperity than I have ever seen since I came to the country. After that we .shall have the inevitable reaction. We have had  ai  succession of good seasons, for which we are all thankful. We have had&#34; very high prices for pur primary products. But the day will come when the drought will reassert itself, when  prices  will go down and the cry of the unemployed will be once more heard in the land. Now is the time to begin to prepare for that eventuality. It will be too late when the deluge is upon us. Let us lay the foundations for our industries now, so that when the necessity for- employment arises there will be plenty of it for such of our citizens as may be unfortunate enough to be out of work. I have said that the rush of imports is almost unprecedented. Let me give a few of the figures. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, they show a still greater advance. Last year we imported &#163;12,000,000 worth of apparel and&#39; textiles, and paid in duty on them no less than &#163;1,872,000. Of metals and machinery we imported about &#163;IO,000,000 worth and&#39; paid in duty &#163;997,000. These facts of themselves are a sufficient condemnation of the Tariff as it stands. This is the greatest wool-producing country in the world, yet we import woollen articles to the value of  &#163;1  000,000. </para>

                        <para>- I think that we might be the greatest cotton-producing country in the world too. There is not a.  shadow of a reason why we should spend a farthing in importing either woollen or cotton goods. We are now using only  1  per cent, of the wool that we grow. We grow very little cotton, but there is no reason, so far as I can see, why we should not produce all the woollen clothing that we. require, and, in addition, grow and manufacture all the cotton goods that we require. </para>

                        <para>- I want the Tariff wall to be raised so high that these imports will be as nearly stopped as possible. I want to see these goods produced here. If the working people are to be taxed let it be done to establish industries, not to save the skins of the rich men. Here we have the working people paying within a few pounds of  &#163;2,000,000  in taxation on their clothing, yet we have the rich landlords shocked almost into paralysis by a proposal to raise  &#163;1,000,000  by land-value taxation. We imported last year, as I have said,  &#163;10,000,000  of metals and machinery. We have every mineral required in the industries either of Australia or of any other country. Why not utilize them? We have the men, the raw material, in fact, everything requisite, yet we pay millions sterling to keep persons employed at the other end of the world while our own citizens are in many cases going about idle. Although we have plenty of clay - some of the finest clays in the world - yet we paid last year nearly  .&#163;250,000  in taxation on imported earthenware. On wood, wicker, and cane work - and Heaven knows we have plenty of the raw material in the continent - we paid in taxation  &#163;324,197.  On jewellery, although we produce gold, silver, and nearly all the precious stones, we paid in taxation  .&#163;222,000.  And most wonderful of all, on leather, although we have cattle by the million, we actually paid  &#163;253,000  in taxation. I do not see why Australia should not be a large leather-exporting country. </para>

                        <para>- I always do wear Australian boots. I know that a great number of Australians, if they can get any thing else, will not wear Australian boots; but I think that the Government might very well issue an order to the effect that every local manufacture should be stamped with the legend &#34; Made in Australia.&#34; If one goes down town to buy a pair of ready-made boots, probably he will find them stamped &#34; Made in Germany,&#34; or &#34; Made in France,&#34; or &#34; Made in America,&#34; or &#34; Made in England,&#34; whereas, as a matter of fact, they were made, probably, in Melbourne. I may tell the. honorable gentleman that I never wear ready-made boots. It is the same with hats. You cannot get a single hat factory in Australia to stamp its goods. </para>

                        <para>- A tailor told me that a large number of Australians have a prejudice against locally-made articles, and that if articles should bear the stamp of a local firm, they would not buy them. We ought to try to get over that sort of feeling. Every article made here ought to be stamped with the words &#34; Made in Australia.&#34; Make that the law of the country, and get the people to understand that Australian goods are of as high quality as those of any other country, and a great deal better, I am glad to think, in some lines. Australian blankets and flannels are not only equal to those of most countries, but superior to a great many of them. These industries might be very largely extended. &#34;We manufacture at present about one-seventh of the woollen goods used in Australia, and the balance is imported. Instead of importing, we ought to be exporting. I am glad to see that a company has been formed which is to operate in Launceston. </para>

It is an industry which, I think, ought to produce in every year all that we require. It is highly improper rh.it  &#163;1.000,000  should be dragged out of the pockets of the people in taxation on one of the most commonly-used articles of food, and a necessary of life. Taxation for revenue purposes on the necessaries of life should be entirely abolished. I again direct the attention of our friends, the anti-land-taxers, to the fact that landowners are being asked to find only  &#163;1,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- It is merely getting for the community the value which the community itself has created. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> says that it is robbery. I think that we could not have more clearly expressed the honorable senator&#39;s taxation morality. What we call justice is robbery in his vocabulary. If the community increases the value of land by &#163;1,000, I say that the community is entitled to that money. The value created by the effort and expenditure of the people in various directions, and by the increase of population, belongs to the people, and ought to be claimed by them.. If any honorable senator wishes to know the source from which I desire to get revenue, I point him to that stream which is now flowing in its millions into the pockets of private landowners and financial institutions of Australia. I need not labour this question very much more, but I think I have made it abundantly clear that in the very near future something must be done in connexion with the Tariff. I read the reply given by the Minister of Customs to a deputation that waited on him the other day to the effect that everything would depend upon the result of the referendum to be held next year to seek larger industrial powers for the Commonwealth Parliament. If the people give the Commonwealth Parliament power to fix wages and conditions, I suppose the Government will immediately proceed to deal with the Tariff. But what will happen if the people do not give the Commonwealth Parliament that power? I say that if the Government are not prepared to make the Tariff an effectively Protectionist Tariff, there is only one alternative before them, and that is to make it a FreeTrade Tariff. Are the Government prepared to do that? Is any political party in Australia prepared to do that? </para>

                        <para>- That is not necessary. ls any political party in Australia prepared to adopt a policy which, if carried into effect, would turn hundreds of thousands of workmen, women, boys, and girls, into the labour market to-morrow? No political party in Australia would be so foolish as to propose such a policy. If that is an impossible policy, there is only one other which can be adopted, and that is the policy of screwing up the Tariff so as to make it effective to keep out the imports that are at present flowing into Australia in such an extraordinary stream. The Government may say that if the people do not give them the power they propose to ask for, they will not play into the hands of the manufacturers. But when I talk about Protection, I do not think of the manufacturers. I think of Australia, of the boys and girls who are growing  up every year in this Commonwealth, and for whom some avenue in life must be provided. I think of the Commonwealth and of a policy which would place in the hands of every Australian some handicraft, which would give the people an opportunity of developing their mental and mechanical, as well as their physical, powers - a policy which would make them self-contained, and would put them in a better position than any other policy I know of to defend this country against foreign aggression. Honorable senators may say, &#34; We agree with you, but look at the sweating.&#34; I say the way to prevent sweating is to raise the Tariff so high that it will cut off the competition of the sweated countries that are now pouring their goods into Australia. When we have destroyed that competition, we shall be in a position to say to the manufacturers of Australia, &#34; We are protecting you against the foreign invader, and we now insist that you shall pay decent wages and give fair conditions to your workers.&#34; Our Tariff is not effective. It permits millions of pounds&#39; worth of goods which could be manufactured in Australia to pour in here annually. It is heaping revenue into the Treasury breast high. The income from Customs taxation in the Commonwealth is advancing by leaps and bounds. That, surely, is not a circumstance which brings anything like joy to the heart of the average Labour man? We want to see the goods which are now imported produced here. We do not want the government of our country to be carried on by means of Customs taxation. We wish to reduce that form of taxation to the lowest possible limit short of sweeping it away altogether. Every one knows what Customs taxation is, why it was devised in the first instance, and why it is continued. It was introduced for revenue pure and simple, and in order to derive that revenue from the poorer section of the people. The poor man who has a large family pays a greater proportion of his wages in the form of Customs taxation than does any other man, whilst the rich man pays less proportionately to his income.-. I am glad to have had an opportunity to say a few words upon this very large and important subject. I wish to impress upon the Government, upon every member of my own party, and also upon the Opposition, that this is a question which will demand the earnest attention of the people of Australia in the very near future. </para>

                    <para>.- I am surprised at the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> in view of the fact that when the Tariff was under consideration it was repeatedly urged by Protectionists that its effect would be to cheapen goods. The honorable senator supported the imposition of a very high Tariff, and in doing so placed a burden on the whole of the consumers of Australia. But our Protective </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Tariff has not resulted in a decline of the_ Customs .revenue. On the contrary, it has&#34; increased that revenue by leaps and bounds. That will always be the result of a high Protective Tariff. When the fiscal question was being debated here, it was pointed out that a vast quantity of goods was imported into Australia which it would not pay any man to manufacture locally. For instance, it would not be profitable for any individual to undertake the local manufacture of dress material such as is worn in Queensland. We know, too, that fashions change, and that an article which was originally priced at two guineas or five guineas may, perhaps, be bought for one guinea when it is no longer fashionable. Importers must make their profits quickly. Consequently, when we impose a duty of 40 per cent, on such articles, the revenue must increase. I would further point out that the cost of living has been materially increased by our Protective Tariff, and that, as a result, men belonging to labour organizations are claiming increased wages. They have to thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> for having increased their cost of living. </para>

I should have liked the Government to inaugurate a better system of immigration. Honorable senators opposite are constantly declaring that we ought to provide for the land requirements of our own people before bringing immigrants to the country, and, to a certain extent, I agree with them. But I hold in my hand a booklet which has been issued by the &#34;Department of External Affairs. It is signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> L. Batchelor, the Minister controlling that Department, and is dated the 15th August of the present year. From it I learn that in nearly every State land may be secured at a very cheap rate. </para>

I would rather see four-fifths of our population settled upon the land, and only one-fifth resident in the towns, than see four-fifths resident in our cities and only one-fifth settled upon the land.

                        <para>- The honorable senator makes an interjection about a Federal land tax. He may not be very venturesome, but there are_ people in his own State who have not been content to sit down behind the counter of a store in a little country place, but have preferred to come over to the mainland and fake up land in Queensland. We do not, in Australia, want people who are content to earn 15s. a week behind a shop counter in some huckstering business. The men who will advance the interests of this country are those who will strike out for themselves, as many of our forefathers did. </para>

I have it from a gentleman in Victoria that, in one year, a farmer in this State bought 1,200 acres of land, which was fallowed when he purchased if, paying &#163;9 per acre. The first wheat crop that he got off it- a yield of between 30 and 40 bushels to-  the  acre - pretty well paid off the cost price of the land, &#34;in face of such facts it cannot be said  that  land is extraordinarily dear even in Victoria. </para>

If he were, he would know that a man on a wheat farm with 1,200 acres grows other things than wheat. He raises cattle and pigs, and probably goes in &#39;for dairying. My informant vouched for the fact that this land-owner, with a yield of about 35 bushels to the acre, paid for his land in two years. </para>

                        <para>- That preface was signed on the 10th August, so that the book must have been compiled long before that date. But, admitting for the sake of argument that the interjection is correct, that gives the price of the land at that date. The honorable senator knows that in Queensland land can be got, even free homesteads. How could this book be written in anticipation of the land tax? It would be the worst thing which the Government could do if the object were to uphold the arguments in favour of the tax. </para>

                        <para>- It might be if the new settler had the capital, but that is not always the case. If the Government believe what is stated in the book, as I do - and I know that in a great many instances concerning Queensland it is true - they  should  ask for a little more money with which to bring out persons, and settle them. We have been told that the Commonwealth has been very prosperous for the last five or six years. I believe that it has been. I am satisfied that we have never had more prosperous years in our history, but we do not  find  a great influx of people. We hear that Queensland, New South Wales, and Western Australia, and, I believe, New Zealand, are bringing out immigrants at their own expense. What the Commonwealth  ought  to do is to select a suitable class of immigrant to go on the land: With an overflowing Treasury they should not hesitate for a moment to carry out a vigorous policy of that kind. We have vast spaces still unsettled. We talk about taking over a Territory half as large as Europe is, yet we do not hear a word of a scheme for bringing out immigrants. We are simply left in the dark. The revenue is going up by leaps and bounds, but the Government remain silent on this question. For our system of defence we need immigrants. We shall be asked to-day to appropriate money for defence, yet we hear not a word about bringing out any persons to assist us in that regard. We can find money for various other purposes, but the question of an immigration policy is put off from day to day. According to a return which has been presented to the Senate at my instance, the annual rental of the Patent Office in Melbourne is  &#163;1,100.  I should like the Minister to see if he cannot get that amount reduced. </para>

                        <para>- The Patent Office is now situated in the Victorian Railway Station Buildings, in Flinders-street. There is not much room for the officers. An annual rental of  &#163;1,100,  at  3J  per cent., represents a capital of  &#163;31,427.  Is it not shameful that the Commonwealth should be required to pay that sum&#39; every year for the accommodation of a few clerks? It is one of the most disgraceful facts which, are disclosed in the return. The officials in connexion with the Department were so over-tired with work that they furnished the return, not to the Senate alone, but. to the other House, without taking the trouble to set out the total sum which is paid irc rentals. I have been twitted by the members of another place with calling for a return without the additions being made. It is a disgraceful exhibition by public officers. If a return I move for is ever presented in that fashion again I shall try to see what can be done. In this return&#39; we get three batches of figures, but not one batch is added up as should have been done. The duty of public officers is to furnish a correct return in the form asked for. The rents we pay represent a capital value of  &#163;542,857. </para>

                        <para>- To three States. In Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, we pay. between  &#163;19,000  and  ,&#163;20,000  in rents. What are we paying all over the country to the States, or, in many instances, to private individuals? The Rialto, in Collins-street, Melbourne, is, I believe, a private property, and if its owner got nothing else but the Government rental he would&#34; be well paid. I should like the Minister to tell us what we pay  &#163;1,100  a year to the Victorian Government for in connexion with the Patent Office.

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> cannot look beyond Melbourne in such matters, but there are honorable senators who do not come either from Melbourne or Sydney, and so can take an unbiased view of them. I think that the property in the one place is as valuable as that in the other, and I do not see why &#163;350 more should be charged for a post-office in Collins-street, Melbourne, than is charged for a post-office in the Stock Exchange, in as good a position, in Sydney. I do not accuse the present Government of blame in this matter, but I direct their attention to the facts, and I hope that they will see that justice is done to the taxpayers, and that their money is not wasted in this way. The payment for a room in the Melbourne Stock Exchange at the rate of two-and-a-half times as much as is paid for a similar room in the Sydney Stock Exchange cannot be defended on any ground whatever, nor can any one defend the payment of more rent for the Patent Office in Melbourne than for the Commonwealth Offices and Treasury Offices combined. The return from which I have quoted will be circulated, and people will want to know why these things are done. If previous Governments have been to blame in the matter, I ask that the present Government shall rectify the wrong. That is the principal matter on which  1  desired to speak.  1  may think it well to refer to a few of the items of the schedule when the Bill is in Committee. In view of the  state of the revenue, and of the fact that we are proposing to take over a large tract of country, and that, according to the Minister of External Affairs, land is available for settlement at reasonable prices, I hope the Government will try to do something to fill up the vacant spaces of Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - 1  do not intend to traverse the arguments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> although the temptation to do so is very strong. I will only say that any man who professes to be an advocate of a progressive -tax upon land values, and couples that with high Protection, has the most insane ideas of taxation that I ever heard of. An opportunity will be afforded later to discuss these questions, and, therefore, I shall not occupy the time of the Senate in debating them this afternoon. I rise mainly to refer to one matter which has been brought under my notice un several occasions, and that is the difference in the salaries paid to responsible officers holding similar positions in the different States. It seems to me that men holding similar positions in New South Wales and Western Australia, or in any of the States, should be paid something like the same salaries for similar duties and responsibilities. </para>

                        <para>- I say that, as a rule, officers having the same duties to perform, and charged with similar responsibilities, should be paid something like the same salaries. I have had several com- plaints made to me on the subject, and  1  have here some particulars of cases occurring in the Customs Department. I propose to give these particulars, and, perhaps, the Vice-President of the Executive Council will be able to explain the reason for the differences shown in the following table : - </para>

                        <para>- The figures given answer my purpose. Where is the warrant for so big a difference in salary as that paid to a Sub-Collector of Customs in New South Wales of&#163;600 and that paid to a Sub-Collector in South Australia of&#163;380? In view of the figures given I do not wonder that there should be some dissatisfaction in the Public Service in some of the States. I think the matter is well worthy of inquiry to show whether such a difference in duties and responsibilities in the different States exists as to warrant so great a difference in the salaries paid, especially in the case of temporary clerks. Surely it cannot be right that in one State they should be paid 2s. a day less than in any of the other States?  I  ask Ministers to look into the matter and see whether the differences to which I have drawn attention are justified. I have not much to say on this Supply Bill. I take it that amounts set out in the schedule are in accord with the Estimates previously approved. I do not know why the Ministry should ask for two months&#39; Supply when one month&#39;s Supply would be sufficient. We shall not close Parliament in  a  month. . </para>

It will be the duty of Parliament to properly discuss every measure submitted by the Government, and I do not suppose the session will close until that has been done. If it is to continue for so long as may be anticipated in view of the business which we are told has yet to be done, the Government should on this occasion have been satisfied with one month&#39;s Supply. </para>

                    <para>. - In introducing this temporary Supply Bill I endeavoured to set as good an example as I possibly could. Honor.orable senators are all aware of the programme that has been announced by the Prime Minister and of the work that will be entailed in carrying out that programme. The longer we take over such incidental matters as Supply Bills the longer the session is bound to be. I was under the impression that honorable senators read the newspapers, and were fully informed of the programme which has been put forward by the Prime Minister. But, as it has become almost a habit for legislative bodies, such as the Senate, to require an independent statement to be made in that connexion, I am prepared to conform to that requirement, although I was willing to forego the pleasure of doing so when I moved the second reading of this Bill. It is the intention of the Government to carry two measures connected with land taxation. Although I do not intend to discuss those measures at the present juncture, it is necessary for me to state why there are two. One is an assessment Bill, and the other a taxing Bill. In addition, two Bills will be introduced dealing with amendments of the Constitution. One of these is intended to vest in the Commonwealth Parliament the power which is possessed by every State Parliament to legislate in respect of industrial matters, and the other deals with the very much discussed and vexed question of the nationalization of monopolies. These measures must be dealt with. There are also two Bills relating to the Sugar Bounty and Excise. They are necessary, because existing legislation in that connexion is about to expire. Then there are two measures relating to the question of defence. One of these has already been approved by this Chamber, and the other is the Naval Defence Bill. The Northern Territory Acceptance Bill has already passed through the Senate, and will have to be dealt with by the other branch of the Legislature. It will also be necessary to introduce a Bill dealing with the administration of. the Federal Territory. A great many persons - including even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> - have complained of delay in the issue of the proclamation under which the Federal Territory will be taken over by the Commonwealth. But every honorable senator ought to know that before that proclamation can be issued legislation must be enacted for the administration of the Territory. </para>

                        <para>- If we issued the proclamation first, what law would be operative within the Federal Territory ? We should have the people of one township stealing from those of another the goats of which some honorable senators have spoken, and there would be no law to prevent them doing so. In other words, a state of anarchy would exist. Now, the Government do not believe in anarchy. Although we are a Socialistic Government, we wish to preserve law and order, and as soon as the maintenance of law and order has been insured throughout the Federal Territory, the Government will&#39; issue the necessary proclamation. Then we shall have to pass a Bill dealing with Tariff anomalies. A number of these anomalies exist, and the Government hope to secure the assistance of both Houses in remedying them as soon as possible. A very necessary measure in connexion with oil bounties will also be introduced. I am sure that the representatives of New South Wales and Tasmania, where shale abounds, will be very gratified to learn that the Government take such an interest in the welfare of their States as to impel them to introduce this legislation. A Bill will also be introduced dealing with penny postage, and it is intended that it shall be brought into force during the last two months of the financial year. The longer the introduction of this reform is delayed the more expensive will it become. We further intend to introduce a small Bill to amend the Judiciary Act. It is also proposed to bring forward an amending Electoral Bill. Of course, we are all familiar with the Navigation Bill, which has been occupying the attention of the Senate for some time. The Government do not intend to force that measure through both Houses of Parliament during the current session, but we think it is desirable that it should be transmitted to another place, so that its consideration may be entered upon there next year. A Bill dealing with lighthouses, lightships, beacons, and buoys, has already passed the Senate, and will require to be dealt with by the other branch of the Legislature. There are one or two other small measures with which it may be necessary to deal. But I would point out to honorable senators that a number of these Bills are so short that it ought to be possible to deal with two or three of them in a day. They are Bills of only one or two clauses. It is not the length of the list that should alarm honorable senators. The question which they have to consider is the importance of the proposed legislation. Out of the entire list, there are only a few debatable measures which ought to occupy much time, either in this Chamber or the House of Representatives. I hope that we shall astonish even ourselves by the amount of business which we shall transact. </para>

If honorable senators are prepared to occupy as much time as has been occupied this afternoon in discussing matters which are entirely beyond the scope of the question under consideration, we shall not dispose of the business which I have outlined until after Christmas. When we have such St. Ledgerdemainian Chataways discussing a trifling Bill of this description, I do not know what we may expect when we come to debate such measures as the Land Tax Assessment Bill. </para>

I do not suggest that Senators Gould, Chataway, and St. Ledger have occupied one minute more than they were entitled to occupy. They were really moderate in their criticism. I come now to the sixty-fifth section of the Labour party - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> It would have been much better if he had reserved his well-thought-out and really eloquent discourse to a more appropriate occasion. Everybody recognises that the Labour part)&#39; is a Labour party, and not a fiscal party. Labour interests, and the interests of Australia must be placed before any sectional interests, so far as the fiscal policy of the country is concerned. I quite agree with the statement of the Minister of Trade and Customs that the manufacturers of Australia, by reason of their past conduct, have a right to wait for that measure of protection which we are prepared to extend to them, until the Commonwealth Parliament has obtained power to deal with industrial matters. When the Government introduce a Bill dealing with the fiscal policy of the country, I hope that it will be in such a form as will satisfy every honorable senator. </para>

                        <para>- I would like the honorable senator to give notice of such a serious question. If the Government are in power at the time of which he speaks, they will be guided by the circumstances which then exist. Before concluding my remarks, I would like to say a. word or two to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline> who was at great trouble to quote from a document which has been issued by the Commonwealth Government, and by every word of which I am prepared to stand. I would like honorable senators to read the whole of that pamphlet, and not to arrive at conclusions founded upon piecemeal extracts from it. We hope that, as the result of the policy of the Government, greater areas of land will be available for closer settlement purposes in the near future. It is in anticipation of that result that the publication in question has been issued. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> also spoke of the enormous rentals which are being paid for Commonwealth offices in Victoria and the other States. One notable  instance which he quoted was the payment of &#163;1,100 annually for office accommodation in the Railway Buildings. Melbourne. The impression which he conveyed was that a certain amount of responsibility rested upon the Government in connexion with that transaction. </para>

                        <para>- It is not the case. I may tell the honorable senator that, in October of last year, the Honorable George Fuller, a member of the Fusion Government - despite the fact that he visited the Federal Capital site and told the people that in the near future the Seat of Government would be established there - entered into a contract with the Victorian Government to lease the accommodation in question for five years, at an annual rental of&#163;1,100. I would ask the honorable senator, who is always standing up for the fulfilment of existing contracts, and who is never tired of talking about repudiation and confiscation, whether he wishes the Government to repudiate this agreement, which was entered into by a previous Ministry, of which he was a loyal supporter? I hope that, in the solitude of his own chamber, he will reflect seriously upon the statements which he has made, and that in future he will not be so voluble until he is sure of his ground. </para>

                        <para>- If there are inequalities they arise out of the judgment of the Public Service Commissioner and his inspectors. Every one will admit that these gentlemen know the value of the services rendered in the different offices that they have examined better than an ordinary member of Parliament can ; and if they see fit to pay&#163;20 more to an officer in Western Australia than to one in South Australia, or&#163;40 more to one in South Australia than to one in Queensland, they have done so because the work of the office, or of the officer, is of such a character as to justify the difference. As far as concerns political influence, I wish <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> would go down to the Public Service Commissioner&#39;s office and try to work that influence upon him. He would soon realize the impossibility of doing anything of the kind. As far as I am concerned, I did not support the appointment of a Public Service Commissioner. I was always in favour of Parliamentary and Ministerial responsibility. But the officer has been appointed. He has done his duty faithfully and well ; and I, as a member of this Government, intend to support his decisions. I think I have now dealt with all that requires to be said in answer to criticisms, and I hope that, in view of the programme of work that we have to accomplish, the Government will receive help both from the Opposition and their own supporters to enable the legislation to be passed within a reasonable time. </para>

                    <para>. - In connexion with the Department of External Affairs, there is a vote of &#163;120 for the Commonwealth Literary Fund. I should like to have some information as to the object of that fund. In all probability, information has been furnished on more than one occasion, but I did not happen to be present at the time, or do not remember it. If the vote is in the nature of an acknowledgment of distinguished or brilliant literary work done by Australian authors or authoresses, it is in the nature of a bonus. I quite agree with that object. In all probability there are no persons who have done better service for the Commonwealth, and who have received less in payment in proportion to their labours, than literary men and women. </para>

                    <para>. - As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has indicated, this vote represents part of a sum which is applied to a fund to be paid to distressed authors, or to the relatives of deceased authors who have done notable literary work in Australia. I hope that by the time the honorable senator requires anything of this description a larger amount will be available. Joking apart, I may add that the Government would appreciate it very much if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger had less to say, and wrote a great deal more. The amount voted last year was &#163;700, of which &#163;570 was spent. </para>

Furthermore, though I do not wish to pry as to who receive benefits from the fund, I should like to know their character, or something about them. The fund is, of course, under the control of the Minister of External Affairs, but I assume that he delegates the administration to a Committee. </para>

                    <para>. - I resent very much the manner in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has treated questions from this side. I thought that I spoke civilly enough. I certainly spoke with no desire other than to get information of which I was not possessed. How he could have inferred that I had risen as a sort of joke I am at a loss to understand. He started with a personal reflection on myself, which I took as good humouredly as I thought it was given. He made a direct assertion that I had merely asked the question in order to waste time, and when he was asked to give the names of the Committee he gave me the names of three eminent, well-known men whom we would all trust for that particular purpose. Then he went further and insinuated that another of the indirect objects which I had in asking the question was that I might indirectly cast a reflection on three able and trusted gentlemen. I did nothing of the kind. I simply knew nothing about the matter. I thought that the <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> manner in which I asked the question would have been apparent to the Minister. It seems to me that Ministers&#39; nerves are getting so frayed that when one or two senators rise on this side they lose all control over ordinary good manner and good form. </para>

I hope that when he has a few remarks to make in future, especially if they are directed to me, he will give us an intimation as to whether he is really serious or joking, and then I shall be able to treat him accordingly. If I have misunderstood him on this occasion I am very sorry. I have given him the information desired. </para>

                    <para>. - According to a return an annual rent of &#163;60 is paid for the Electoral Offices in the Treasury Building at Brisbane. The offices are two miserable, badly-ventilated, badly-drained rooms situated almost in the vault of the Treasury. When I paid my last visit the offices were so crowded that there was hardly room for anybody to move. I addressed to the Department a letter, in which I pointed out how impossible it was for the work to be properly carried out there. One room was allotted to the principal officer, and the other accommodated six or eight clerks, and, if I remember aright, it measured about 20 feet by 14 feet. My visit was paid in what is known as the wet season, and the whole place was putrid with the smell of growing vegetable matter half way up to the windows of the rooms, which faced a quadrangle. There was no room for the officers to move about, and there was absolutely no room for people to go in to do business. Probably the last Government, and the one they replaced, were more to blame than are the present Government. The public cannot even get a glimpse of the rolls so badly lighted is the miserable place. It is unhealthy, and not worth any rent. I do not expect a definite reply to-day, but I ask the Department to look into the. matter, and see if better quarters cannot be obtained for the accommodation of the electoral officers. </para>

                        <para>- A few days ago, we had sent round to us a form of questions in connexion with the census to be taken&#39; on the 3rd April next. In addition to the questions provided for in the Act, there are some questions marked &#34; confidential,&#34; such as &#34; salary and wages,&#34; &#34; average number of hours&#39; work,&#34; &#34; notes and coin in circulation,&#34; and whether a man is a total abstainer or not. I assume that the additional questions cannot be placed on the census-paper until they have been submitted to the Senate, and approved of? We are anxious to know when the Government propose to give us an opportunity to debate the matter. </para>

When, in addition to that, one sees a vote of &#163;6,000 in connexion with the administration of the Electoral Act, one is naturally anxious to know in what way the money is to be spent, especially in view of the fact that the Government, in this Bill, are asking for only two months&#39; Supply. </para>

I wish to ask the honorable senator whether, during that debate, it will be competent for the Senate to strike out some of the questions which at present appear on the awfully  ridiculous census papers which are proposed ? The question may be submitted for discussion in such a way that we would be unable to take action to strike out some of the questions which appear upon a paper which is so ridiculous that it would disgrace the Commonwealth if it were made public. </para>

If any honorable senator wished to take action in connexion with them, it was his duty to give notice that he intended to do so. No honorable senator has done so. It was the intention of the Government, after about  9  o&#39;clock tomorrow evening, to move to report progress on the matter then under discussion, when an opportunity would be afforded on the motion for the adjournment of the Senate to any member of the Senate to discuss this question in any way he pleased. No honorable senator has given notice of any amendment of the proposed questions in connexion with the taking of the census. </para>

I want some information upon the proposed vote, in view of the fact that in another part of the schedule votes amounting to over  &#163;1,000  are set down to cover salaries and contingencies in connexion with the Electoral Department. The officer of the Department, who is in attendance, should be able to supply the information asked for. I have no objection to pay officers reasonable salaries, but I think they should work for them. I never previously knew of a vote being submitted which the departmental officers behind Ministers were not able to explain. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so; but I hope we shall resist the voting of any money until we know what it is for. I do not blame the present Government especially in this matter, because they are only following a practice which has been followed before by their predecessors of submitting votes without giving any information with respect to them. When they were in Opposition, the&#39; members of the present Government wanted information about every item in the Estimates ; but now that they are on the Treasury bench they are as bad as their predecessors were, and have no information to give the Committee. I know that if honorable senators opposite were not supporting the Government they would want <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> know what this money is for ; but because they are they are dumb. We are told that we shall get the information for which we ask after the dinner adjournment, but we are expected to pass the vote before we adjourn for dinner. I want to know what this vote is for. The Government should be able to give the Committee the information, and honorable senators should not permit the vote to go until they get it. </para>

                    <para>. - Some honorable senators seem to think that the proposed vote of  &#163;6,000  &#34;for expenses in connexion with the administration of the Electoral Act covers some extraordinary and new expenditure. One would imagine that they believe there is something behind the item which the Government are unwilling to explain. They speak as if we had some scheme prepared, and all that we needed to carry it out was to have this vote accepted. I gave honorable senators all the information I could possibly get, and I promised that I would get any further information available with respect to this item. After making the most diligent inquiries since, I find that the information I have already given is all that can be given in connexion with the item. Last year a sum of  &#163;32,537  was expended in the administration of the Electoral Department. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales)  &#91;6.2&#93;.-  I have referred to the Budget Papers, and I find that last year the expenditure in connexion with the administration of the Electoral Act was  &#163;33,557.  But there was also an expenditure of  &#163;41,779,  under the heading &#34; Commonwealth Elections.&#34; We are not in a position to discriminate between the way in which the money was expended upon these two items ; but it seems to me that the  &#163;41,779  was an extraordinary expenditure.

                        <para>- Then I take it that an expenditure of  &#163;30,000  or  &#163;36,000  must recur each year, irrespective of whether or not a general election takes place. It would have been well if the Minister had given the Committee a fuller explanation of this matter in the first instance. It may be that this expenditure is incurred in collecting the names for the electoral rolls each year, in printing them, and in defraying the cost of holding Revision Courts. </para>

                        <para>- In  1907  the amount provided for the expenses of electoral administration in another Supply Bilk which covered one month was  &#163;1,500.  That  is  equivalent to  , &#163;3,000  in  a  Bill which  is  intended to cover two months. In; still another Supply Bill the expenditure under this heading was  &#163;1,000.  Yet we are now asked to vote  &#163;6,000  to cover an expenditure for two months. If the additional expenditure is required to defray the cost of introducing the card system of indexing, I have no complaint to make. But we are not unreasonable when we ask why we are invited to vote  &#163;3,000 a  month to cover the expense of administering this Department for  a  period of one month, when on previous occasions we have been asked to vote only  &#163;1,000  or, at most,  &#163;1,500. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to know if there is any way in which we can avoid duplication in the printing of documents for the two branches of the Legislature? I mentioned this matter some time during the last Parliament. I was then, under the impression that the evil could be remedied if the Printing Committee chose to take the necessary steps. But since I have been appointed  a member of that body I have discovered that, under our present Standing Orders, it is powerless to remedy it. Honorable senators are familiar with the form in which the <inline font-style="italic">Votes and Proceedings</inline> of the House of Representatives and the <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline> of the Senate appear. Usually the report of the Printing Committee occupies about one and a-half folios of printed matter. Precisely the same document is presented to both branches of the Legislature. Its contents are in tabulated form, and, consequently, are somewhat expensive to put into type. Yet the document is set up separately for each House. It ought to be a perfectly simple matter to use the same material in printing the records of each House. </para>

                        <para>- They do not. On one occasion I compared the <inline font-style="italic">Votes and Proceedings</inline> of the House of Representatives with the <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline> of the Senate, and found that a table printed in each was not spaced in the same way. That will show <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> who is a practical printer, that the same type was not used in each case, although there was not a solitary word of difference between the two. I do not expect the Government to show forthwith how to avoid this duplication. I have been thinking over the matter, and made an endeavour to bring it before the Printing Committee ; but I found that that could not be done under the Standing Orders, because the Committee was not empowered to deal with the printing of either House of Legislature, but only with the printing of documents presented to Parliament. The matter should be taken in hand in the interests of economy. Every member of Parliament feels it to be his bounden duty to keep the expenses down as much as possible. There is no need to pay for printing twice over if we can avoid it. I suggest that the Government should endeavour to see whether something cannot be done to obviate overlapping. I admit I do not know how it can be prevented. It might involve a complete reorganization . of our parliamentary methods in respect to printing. But I should be glad if something could be done. I believe that our printing bill could  be reduced by something like 10 per cent. </para>

We are certainly desirous of securing economy where that can be done without interfering with efficiency. As the honorable senator has suggested, however, it would be impossible for me to point out how a remedy might be effected.  His  remarks will be brought before the Acting-Treasurer, and submitted to the Government Printer. An explanation will be called for. When we get to the Federal Capital, and have our own printing office under our own management, I trust that such duplication will be remedied ; and I would. ask honorable senators to: expedite business in. order that we may secure that object as soon as possible. </para>

A number of these isolated reports have been furnished to us. They show the work that has been done within specified intervals. I desire to ask whether the Government cannot arrange to have these reports, which are being furnished piecemeal, properly edited and brought together, so that we may have a record of the investigations made by the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour</inline> in Australian waters, showing clearly the work that has been done and the amount of success that has been achieved ? These interim reports merely show what has been done during twelve or fourteen days in Queensland or New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dannevig,</inline> who is in charge of the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour,</inline> ought to furnish us. with a general report in such a form that the public might learn something about the trawling possibilities on the Australian coast. Will the Minister make a note of the point and see whether . a report cannot be furnished of the proceedings of the vessel up to the 30th July ? If the Government wish to have an illustration of how that sort of thing can be done, I refer them to the very fine reports made by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> Saville-Kent in connexion with the Queensland fisheries. Those reports not only show that on a particular date the vessel engaged in the service got the net on to a rock bottom, but gave illustrations of the voyages and furnished interesting particulars. The books that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Saville-Kent</inline> wrote were very valuable, and were of great benefit to the fisheries of Queensland. The Government having taken this work in hand, it would be a good thing to have a report furnished to Parliament showing the progress that has been made up to date on the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour.</inline></para>

                    <para>I forward&#39; herewith, by direction of the Minister, to be laid on the table of the Senate, copy of a report of the 27th cruise of the fishing investigation ship <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour</inline> in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales waters. It is desired that this and subsequent preliminary reports of the work of the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour</inline> shall not be printed in the present form., as it is intended to submit for publication later on a full report dealing with the number of cruises conjointly. </para>

                <para class="block">It is intended that the report to be prepared shall deal with the whole of the investigations made by the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour</inline> during a series of twenty-nine cruises. Two more of those cruises have to be made,, and two more progress reports will be received, before the general report is prepared. That is the proper way in which such reports should be dealt with. Obviously, the material and the results gathered as a consequence of each of these cruises are not of much value in themselves. It is only when the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour</inline> has extended her operations over a considerable area, and when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dannevig,.</inline> and the Customs officers appointed to cooperate with him, are able to prepare reports, and bring them into some sequence, that the information collected will be of great value. At the present time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dannevig</inline> is co-operating with scientific experts at the universities in regard to the kinds of fish obtained. Information is being tabulated as to points at which the fish have been caught, with the view of locating them for the benefit of fishermen; and also to indicate where they are to be found at different seasons. When the results of the twenty-nine cruises are put together, it will be found that valuable information has been obtained for the use of capitalists and others who may desire to put money into a trawling enterprise. It will be scientific information of a reliable character as to where certain fish are to be found, the seasons of the year when they are in the waters indicated, and the kind of bottom upon which the trawler will have to operate. The Customs officer now on duty here is co-operating with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dannevig</inline> in this work; and, as I have said, the scientific authorities at the various universities are being consulted in order that the information obtained may be presented in the most useful form. </para>

The report, when published, will be much appreciated by the public generally, and will be of the greatest possible value.

                    <para>. - I have had several conversations with fishermen with regard to the value of the trawler&#39;s work so far as the. fishing industry is concerned, and the universal verdict was that it had been of no assistance to them in their business. I do not pretend to know whether that is so or not, but if it is the case the trawler is evidently failing to do what was intended. Most of us are aware that there is a large quantity of fish in Australian waters, and that the fishing industry is in a very imperfect state of development. The idea in sending out the trawler was to obtain for fishermen such information as would enable them to prosecute the industry with profit to themselves and to the general community. </para>

                        <para>- If we can find out where the fish are, and catch them, the next step will be to attack the middleman.. The opinion of the fishermen was that the work of the trawler seemed to be spasmodic, without method, that it hurried up and down the coast, and did not make a thorough examination of any particular portion, and, further, that the information made public through the press did not help them in any way. Another complaint they made was that local fishermen were never consulted as to the local names for fishes, and so forth. It is not a matter in which I am very well posted, but it appears that in various districts fish bear different names, and that these names are known only to the local fishermen. The members of one fishing association insisted that it was essential, in the interests of fishermen, that when the trawler did go up the coast of Queensland a local man should be taken on while it was working in each district, so as to give the captain information on the one hand, and supply the fishermen with the result of the work on the other hand. It appears to me that the trawler is galloping - if that word can be used in regard to a ship - up and down the coast of Australia at too great a rate to be able to do anything effective. If this system is continued, the net result of it will be that we shall be spending a great deal of money with very little advantage. I bring the matter under the attention of the Minister, and if he is able to effect any improvement, I am sure the various bodies of fishermen along the coast will be very thankful, and the public will be benefited by the expenditure. </para>

                    <para>. - During the discussion on this item some reference has been made to the reports which have been supplied to the Senate. On a previous occasion it was thoroughly understood that progress reports were to be made for the purpose of  acquainting the Parliament and the country with what the trawler has been doing. But it was also understood that we were to be supplied with an annual report covering the whole ground. In my opinion, a great deal of value attaches to the progress reports. Otherwise the trawler might dis&#62;:over some grounds which were very profitable, and the general public would get no information on the subject until the annual report was published, and the value of the work of the trawler would be to a considerable extent lost. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has referred to the view which -fishermen generally take of its work. I admit that there is a deal of truth in what he said, but it must be remembered that men who have been fishing in a small way have been, and still are, somewhat prejudiced against the inroad of the trawler. We have not to regard their prejudices at all, but to consider whether it is scientifically carrying out the work it was intended to do. My opinion is that no one ship can suffice for a coastline of- 8,500 miles. Hitherto the arrangement has been to allow each State to get some benefit from the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour.</inline> She was sent to Tasmania, thence to Port Philip Bay, thence to South Australia, thence to New South Wales, and next to Queensland, without being allowed sufficient, time in which to make an exhaustive report at every place. The time must come when it will be necessary to employ two or three trawlers, if we wish to carry out the work with anything like satisfaction, and we want reports to be supplied from time to time. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt some samples would be interesting; but that is not the object. It is not a question of the kind of fish which are obtained, but whether the waters round our coast are such as to breed the fish and keep them in their shoals. So far the trawler has done good work; but it has not been kept for a sufficient time at any point to give an exhaustive report. </para>

                        has stated that certain fishermen have condemned the trawler, and said that it is of no use in assisting them to carry on their avocation. That is quite possible ; but I remind the honorable senator that trawling is a branch of fishing which has not hitherto been carried on in Australia.

                        <para>- One can. well understand that those who go in for fishing in a small way have derived no particular benefit from the progress reports of the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour,</inline> because the class of fishing it is seeking to establish is deep-sea fishing. In order to assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that some practical good has resulted from the circulation of the reports in Australia and the Old Country I may mention that two Melbourne men have started a company to work in Queensland waters, and so satisfied the State Government as to their <inline font-style="italic">bond fides</inline> that it has made them a concession of land below Moreton Bay for their factory. Furthermore, one of the big firms engaged in trawling in Great Britain have made investigations into the progress reports of the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour,</inline> and are so satisfied with them that they are sending out their manager to make inquiries on the spot, with a view to commencing operations here. That has been the result before a concrete report of the whole work has been drawn up. We have every reason to be satisfied that something tangible has been accomplished. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> said that the work has been somewhat spasmodic, in that the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour</inline> has been moved about. That is quite true; but it was done for a good reason. When the vessel was first equipped and sent out in the winter, she was sent into the waters round Victoria and Tasmania. Every Australian who has travelled knows that -in the winter those waters are very rough, whereas Queensland waters are very smooth. When the worst of the winter arrived, and before she had completed her work in the rough waters, the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour</inline> was sent up to Queensland to work in smooth water; but in the summer she will be brought down to complete her work in the southern waters. That is why the change was made. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know. Of course, they are investigating the sea bottom, which will be charted. In addition to marking out the parts which can be trawled, they are also marking out the places where certain fish are known to be, and whether they are there in quantity or not. Apart from the fisheries investigation, the trawler is doing a very useful work in ascertaining the depths and the currents. The results of these investigations are being tabulated for future use. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> will see that, because a few fishermen have criticised the trawler as being of no use to them, he should not, on that scanty information, condemn the work which she has been doing. </para>

                    <para>. - It cannot be said that I am&#39; opposing the vote for the trawler now for the first time, because I have opposed it every year I have been here. I have listened to the explanation of the Minister of Defence, but the honorable senator did not tell the Committee that the Victorian Government spent a good many thousands of pounds on a trawler, and had to admit that their experiment was a failure. I have read the reports presented by those in charge of the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour.</inline> Dealing with the visit made to Tasmanian waters, we were told that flathead could be caught in Oyster Bay, and that three rock cod had been caught on one line, a thing that any lad could do. The information generally supplied as the result of the trawler&#39;s visits to Tasmanian waters has been known for years to the men engaged in practical fishing in those waters. I may inform the Minister of Defence that they are not men who confine their fishing operations to harbors. They go out to sea for a great deal of their fish, and they tell me that the trawler is a &#34;frost.&#34; It may be a very nice toy for some individuals, but that is all that it is. </para>

They have seen the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour</inline> at work, and they saw the Victorian Government&#39;s trawler at work. They were in the habit at one time of going out with sailing hookers to fish. They would be away from port for a month at a time, and they caught fish on the Tasmanian coast, and brought it to Melbourne for sale. Their knowledge of the fishing on the Tasmanian coast is much greater than that- of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long,</inline> or my own. </para>

                        <para>- The fact is that a trawler is of very little use on the greater part of the coast of Australia, because the bottom is composed of coral or rock. This destroys the nets, and a trawler would have to be continually going into port to repair her nets. The fishermen of Tasmania were aware of all the information supplied in the reports from the trawler long before she went to Tasmanian waters. The New South Wales Government, as well as the Victorian Government, have tried trawling, and after the expenditure of many thousands of pounds have been unable to make a success of it. Now we are told by the Minister of Defence that, although the operations of the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour</inline> may not have been of much value to the fishing industry of Australia, she is useful as a survey boat. With all respect for those who man the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour,</inline> I think they are not competent for the survey of the waters of our coast. Men who have been engaged in the North Sea fishing trade are not necessarily qualified for marine surveying. I maintain that the money spent on the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour</inline> is wasted. We are invited to believe that the fishermen of Australia are prejudiced in the views they express as to the work of the trawler. Some of these men are from fifty to sixty years of age, and have spent almost the whole of their lives in the fishing industry. I admit that they. have done no trawling, but that is because of their knowledge of the condition of the bottom in the waters in which they usually fish. They know that trawling would be quite impracticable where the fish are found in anything like payable quantities. It is of no use to look for fish on a sandy bottom, where there is no food for them. Schnapper, for instance, are. never caught away from a rocky bottom. </para>

                        <para>- I have done as much schnapper fishing as most people, and I have never known them to be caught away from a reef. When I was a member of the Queensland Parliament I used to go schnapper fishing in a Government steamer. We had a Government official on board, and I remember that we tried the whole of the coast of New South Wales from the Tweed Heads almost down to Newcastle. We tried the coast to the north also, but we never found any schnapper in Queensland waters away from a reef. A trawler would be of no earthly use for fishing over such ground. It is possible that with a trawler big shoals of barracouta might be caught, but no one would eat that fish. At any rate, most people in Tasmania will not eat it because the fish are full of worms. We have been told by the Minister of Defence that some one is thinking about establishing a canning industry at Moreton Bay. I can tell the honorable senator that people have been canning fish there for many years. The fish principally canned is the mullet, which goes up the Brisbane River at certain times of the year in myriads. Canned mullet is very good if the fish is properly canned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway,</inline> in company with myself, was informed two years ago by the people engaged in the industry in Moreton Bay that they could not afford to can fish at the price at which they had to sell the article to the public. I should like to ask what return we have had for the money spent in the construction and upkeep of the trawler? On the basis of the vote asked for in this Bill it takes &#163;6,000 a year to keep the vessel going. What is there to show for that expenditure? Some scientific gentlemen may believe that we have something to show for it, but in the opinion of the general public there has been nothing to show for it so far. Are we to continue this expenditure because the officers of the Department are unwilling to admit that they made a mistake in the first place in recommending the construction and use of a trawler? They will never make such an admission until Parliament tires of voting money from which we get no return. I want to see the trawler go out and catch fish in marketable quantities. </para>

                        <para>- A great number, and there have been a great number of prospectuses published in connexion with mines in Western Australia, as well as in Queensland, which contained just as much buncombe as is contained in the reports we have had from the trawler. Will any honorable senator tell me that any company would he formed in England to catch&#39; fish in Australian waters on the strength of the reports that have been presented by those in charge of the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour?</inline> Let the manager of the trawler demonstrate that trawling can be carried on in Australian waters as a commercial success, and then people will be prepared to put money into the business. They have proved nothing so far that was not already well known. I do not blame those who are employed on the trawler if they can find a Parliament so simple as to vote sums of money every year to enable them to cruise around the coast in fine weather, because &#34;the trawler cannot go out in wet and bad weather. We have been told that the trawler has performed valuable survey work. </para>

                        <para>- Why not? They have already decided to go in for horse-breeding and for the manufacture of cloth. If, by entering upon the fishing industry, they can benefit the country, I see no reason why they should not do so. From the information which is in my possession, I believe that the trawler has proved a failure. That impression is confirmed by the statements of men with life-long experience of fishing. I would ask honorable senators why the Victorian and New South Wales Governments abandoned trawling operations ? </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to direct the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> to the fact that when the trawler commenced operations the object of the Government was to thoroughly prospect Australian waters. That the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour</inline> has not been able to accomplish this is easily understandable. I am satisfied that the work which that vessel has clone has been well done, and that it has proved fairly successful. Apart from the increased knowledge of our coast which we have obtained from the trawler&#39;s reports, we know that some good fish have been taken. The one objection urged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> is that in Tasmanian waters the search of the vessel has been unsuccessful. But any sensible man knows that barracoutta, of which he spoke, ought to be tanned. They were never intended for human food. They were designed to be converted into leather with which to sole our boots. They taste just like a piece of dried wood. But there are unexplored Australian waters which the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour</inline> ought to exploit. When she does so, trawling grounds will be found which are equal to any in the world. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> may have caught schnapper upon a rocky bottom. But, because of that circumstance, he must not jump to the conclusion that all the schnapper in the sea are to be caught there. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose that I have seen more trawlers than the honorable senator ever heard of. I have seen hundreds of them. But, apart from that, the honorable senators informants seem to be just like himself. They have got into a conservative groove, and feel that they really cannot appreciate modern methods and modern thought. They say &#34; Give us a rake,&#34; because it is a rake, and they have always been used to a rake. The Australian fisherman has not had an opportunity of acquiring a knowledge of trawling. He knows very little about it. The Australian people generally do not know much as to what fish their waters contain. Until the whole coast has been fully prospected, I shall certainly support every Government in the pursuit of this work. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has not brought forward one argument in reply to mine. I showed that Victoria and New South Wales had conducted experiments with trawlers, and proved the idea to be a failure. The men who gave mie information on this subject are equal in respect of knowledge, if not superior, to the honorable senator. I do not care twopence about the honorable senator&#39;s remarks concerning me, because when people read them, they will attribute them to his ignorance. Instead of attempting to reply to my arguments, he has simply resorted to abuse, because I maintained that previous experiments with trawlers had been a failure. I have a perfect right to maintain that contention, and if the honorable senator disagrees with it, he should bring forward arguments, instead of making abusive remarks about my conservatism: I venture to say that I am a better Liberal than he has ever been, and have proved it all my life. I am not going to be &#34;choked off&#34; my opposition to this project by abuse. The honorable senator has talked about my being &#34; oneeyed.&#34; There is an old saying that &#34;in the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king,&#34; and there are quite a number of politically blind people on the Ministerial side. The honorable senator has told us about the emerald isles in the north-west of Australia, where there are beautiful fish to be caught. I have given him the results of experience of schnapper fishing in Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria. It is a remarkable thing that there are no schnapper between New Zealand and Australia. I suppose he would say that there is schnapper in Tasmanian waters. But he does not know. The honorable member can make a speech, but I do not believe that he really knows one fish from&#39; another. Yet he has posed as an authority, whilst any person who differs from him is met with abuse instead of argument. There has been no proof in any of the reports that there is any prospect of making a financial success of this enterprise. Are the Government spending this money on a mere plaything? To make a financial success of -anything of the kind it has to be proved that there are sufficient marketable fish to be obtained by trawling. I maintain that we have not, except in rare places, a bottom where we can successfully use a trawler. We have no places like the Dogger bank or the Newfoundland bank where fish can always be obtained in this manner. These facts have been demonstrated by the Victorian and New South Wales Governments time after time. Yet we are told that we are not to learn from previous experience. We are voting money that we might just as well throw into the sea. </para>

                        <para>- They had not a properly-equipped trawler to employ upon the work. New South Wales followed precisely the same course. Neither State had the ghost of an idea of exploring round the coasts of Australia to find out whether there were good fishing grounds or not. It is quite possible that within 10 miles of the Victorian coast there may be no fishing grounds suitable for trawling. The same may be said as to the New South Wales coast. But, after all, these are but a small portion of our 8,000 miles of coast line. Because the State Governments found nothing satisfactory, that is by no means a reason why we should desist from our efforts to ascertain whether there are good trawling grounds or not. </para>

                    <para>. - This discussion has gone further than I thought it would do when I first raised the point with regard to the trawler. I have risen again to impress upon the Government the necessity of making the annual reports in connexion with the work of the trawler valuable for the information which they contain. I have before me the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Saville-Kent&#39;s</inline><inline font-style="italic">Naturalist in Australia,</inline> which is an exceedingly fine work. 1 direct the Minister&#39;s attention to the illustrations which it contains. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. SavilleKent</inline> was one of the best authorities on the subject. This book shows how thorough his knowledge was. The illustrations to it are most interesting. I hope that the Minister will make it his business to see that the reports will not be mere summaries of everyday occurrences like the lowering of the trawling nets, such as we are now getting from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dannevig.</inline> I suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dannevig</inline> is a person of considerable experience, who knows what he is doing, and that he will be able to furnish us with proper scientific descriptions of the fish and other forms of marine life obtained by the trawler&#39;s nets. But reports should not only be interesting and full of useful information j they should contain such illustrations as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Saville-Kent</inline> used to furnish with his valuable works. They should give definite information and not a casual report or a log of what was done from day to day. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway&#39;s</inline> suggestion will be adopted by the Government, and that there shall be furnished to Parliament and the public monthly, or at other intervals, a complete and adequate report of what has taken place. It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> to talk about utilizing grounds which are found to be suitable for working. The vessel, when an appropriation was asked for, was designated an exploration vessel. She was to go out and do exploratory work, in order to indicate and open up to private enterprise particular grounds which they might very easily utilize. I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway&#39;s</inline> remarks will not go unheeded. When the construction of the vessel was in question, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> raised some strong objections to the establishment of any such department of government. Amongst other things, he stated that in Launceston it was impossible to obtain a flounder under a cost of is. <inline font-style="italic">6d:</inline> I remember inviting him to accompany me and find that he could do something different from that. He did not accept the invitation, but I proved to his satisfaction afterwards that his statement was absolutely incorrect. I think that most of the statements which he made tonight are equally incorrect. </para>

                    <para>. - There is an item concerning which I should like to get an explanation. One can hardly rise to ask the question without being suspected, and honestly suspected, of making a joke, but it is the item itself which is responsible for even the appearance of a joke. Under the head of New South Wales Military Forces, on page 16, I notice this item, &#34; No. 1. Travelling and mileage allowance, Australian Volunteer Automobile Corps,&#34; without a sum being attached thereto. On page 19, under the head of Victorian Military Forces, I find a similar item, with the sum of .&#163;30 appearing in the opposite column. On page 21 there is a similar item under the head of Queensland Military Forces, but no amount is stated. On page 24, I notice a similar item under the head of South Australian Military Forces, with the sum of  &#163;20  appearing in the opposite column. On page  26,  under the head of Western Australian Military Forces, a similarly worded item appears, with the sum of  &#163;20  opposite thereto, and on page  28,  under the head of Tasmanian Military Forces, we are asked to vote  &#163;20  for a like purpose.  An automobile corps has often been spoken about in connexion with military manoeuvres and camps. It may be contemplated to use the corps for war purposes, but in each case the item seems to be ridiculous. Either it is too little or too much that&#39; we are asked to vote. If it is not for the mere convenience of the officers, we are entitled to know why we are called upon to pass these items. If the automobiles are used for some particular purpose - for example, for volunteer camps - what practical results can follow from the Automobile Corps if we are io vote only  &#163;20  or  &#163;30  for each State ? </para>

                        <para>- I propose, therefore, to treat the honorable member&#39;s question seriously, and to give an answer to the best of my ability. In each State there is an automobile corps, consisting of persons who place their automobiles at the disposal of the Department, and who are given honorary commissions. These gentlemen,, at much cost to themselves, very often render very considerable service to the Defence Forces, especially when an annual camp of training is held. They do not get militia pay, because they are volunteers, but we give them a mileage payment based on the number of miles which their automobile covered during die course of the camp. The reason why no sum appears opposite the item relative to the New South Wales Automobile Corps is that during the two months covered by this Bill no camps will be held in the State, and consequently the automobiles will not be called upon to attend. In the other States a camp of some kind will probably be held, and, consequently, provision has to be made in this Bill. These automobiles are not kept for the amusement or the pleasure of the officers. On the contrary, they render services which we could get in no other way - for instance, when a camp is being held.. Owing to the fact that we have the automobiles at pur services, the umpires who have to decide on the relative merits of the work done by the commanding officers at a sham fight or anything of that kind, are able to cover enormous distances which they could not do if they had to rely upon horses or cabs. In that way they are able to render much more effective service. Moreover, in time of war the automobiles will be at our disposal, and will be used by the officers in command of our forces. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. During an&#62; Easter camp in Victoria and also in New South Wales, an automobile was placed at my disposal, and enabled me to see a great deal more than I could have seen in any other way. I, therefore, do not treat the item in any&#39; sense in a jocular fashion. These gentlemen render a very valuable service to the Commonwealth, and get very little compensation. The smallness of the amounts which are set down is explained in the way I have indicated. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger will turn to the Estimates-in-Chief he will find -that in the case of New&#39; South Wales a vote of  &#163;200  is proposed. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to refer to a small matter in connexion with which, I think, some action should be taken by the Department. I believe that some time ago in Townsville a non-commissioned officer who was marching his men to a particular place was compelled to halt them for some reason or other. It appears that this was a deadly  offence in the eyes of the military authorities. A court-martial was ordered, and officers were summoned from the length and breadth of Australia at great cost, I suppose. </para>

                        <para>- A naval officer, I &#34;believe. The ridiculous aspect of the matter to me was that it should be necessary to put the country to a great deal of expense to hold a court-martial on the man for what was a very trivial offence, if it was an offence at all. A great deal of ridicule was heaped on the Commonwealth authorities at the time for allowing such a thing to take place. Perhaps the &#34;Minister of Defence can tell us exactly what happened. If my information be correct, I trust that some other means of dealing with offences of the kind will be dis covered. The Commonwealth has no money to fling about to give men trips all over Australia, merely in order that they may attend some pettifogging court martial which may be considered necessary by military or naval martinets. </para>

                    <para>. - Obviously I am obliged to guess at the matter to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> refers. The honorable senator is not quite sure whether it is a naval or a military matter, what the offence was, or what the court martial was about. I know that a case of the kind occurred in Queensland ; but I speak from memory of papers which came under my notice a good while ago. An officer was in charge of a party belonging to the naval force at a church parade, or a parade held at the time of the visit of some foreign warship. The parade was held on a Sunday, and as this man was marching his corps down the street, he halted them in front of a public house. He left them standing in the street whilst he went into the public house, presumably to have a drink. </para>

                        <para>-  I suggest to Senators Keating and Stewart that they should ask that the papers be laid on the table of the Library, and should look through them for themselves. I have gone through the papers, but they have heard only an <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statement. The papers disclose both sides ot the matter. As to the reason for the holding of a court martial, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> knows, or ought to know, that when a charge is made against a military or naval officer, it is in the interests of the officer himself that there should be a trial ; and in military and naval matters the method of trial is by court martial. The officer concerned in this instance was given an opportunity of resigning or attending a trial by court martial. He elected to be tried by court martial. </para>

So far as I have been able to gather from the newspapers - and I could get information on the subject from no other source - no satisfactory reason has yet been given for that . explosion. Whether I happen to be on this or the other side of the Chamber, Ministers seemed to be impressed with the idea that they should let no one know the facts of this affair. I should like to know if the present Minister of Defence is in a position to give the Committee any explanation of the matter. There is a vote down for an automobile corps, and I am reminded by this vote to ask whether the Defence Department have given any consideration to the question and are prepared to ask Parliament to vote money for the establishment of an aeroplane corps? </para>

                    <para>. - With regard to the explosion at Thursday Island, no further facts have been ascertained, and no explanation of the explosion has yet been given. With respect to the reference to an aeroplane corps, the honorable senator is, no doubt, aware that the late Government made provision for a competitive test of aeroplane machines, and offered a prize of &#163;5,000, under certain conditions. A number of entries have been received, and local committees have been appointed to test the machines submitted. So far, none have been submitted for a practical test; but we hope shortly that in some of the States machines will be submitted to a practical test. We have instructed military officers we have in England, who are attending manoeuvres there, to pay particular attention to what is being done in connexion with the use of aeroplanes and dirigible balloons, and to send out all the information they become possessed of on the subject. Several of the officers have already acted upon these instructions, but the information so far received is not of a very encouraging character. It appears that the difficulties inherent in the use of such machines have not yet been overcome, and it is not demonstrated that they are of any real military value. We shall have reports on the subject from time to time, and when the Government are satisfied that aeroplanes or dirigibles are of practical use in time of war, they will be prepared to make provision for their use. There is in the Commonwealth at the present time an aeronaut who is willing to give instruction in the art of flying. The persons interested have waited upon me, and have said that they are prepared to submit to the Defence Department a specific offer to instruct certain of our officers in the art. When the offer is made, I shall be prepared to give it favorable consideration. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to ask one or two questions in connexion with the vote for the Vancouver mail service. It forms, I suppose, a part of the subsidy payable under the existing contract, which will continue in operation until August of next year. I should like to know if the Government are still in negotiation with the Governments of New Zealand and Canada with regard to a new mail service between Canada, New Zealand, and Australia? I suppose that the negotiations are not yet complete ; but, if they are, perhaps the Minister representing the Postmaster-General will be able to say whether it is the intention of the Government, in the new contract, to modify materially, or at all, the conditions as to the route to be followed by the vessels engaged in the service. </para>

                    <para>. - There have been so many wrecks on the coast of King Island that if tombstones were erected there to the memory of those who have perished in those wrecks, it would make the place a very fine cemetery.

                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">King Island? We know that the cost of such a station must be comparatively trifling, because nearly every steam-ship of any importance is now provided with the necessary apparatus for wireless telegraphy. There are about 800 people on King Island, and there are 40,000 or 60,000 acres of land there suitable for settlement. But I speak in this matter, not on behalf of the residents of the island at all. I have recently met men who have lived there for the last twenty years, and they say that what prevents settlement on the island is the fact that there is no means of communication with the mainland or with Tasmania, except by a steamer or sailing vessels. I should like to know whether the Government intend, even though it may be difficult to decide whether Jones&#39; system or Brown&#39;s system is the best, to establish a wireless telegraphic station on King Island as soon as possible. </para>

                    If the honorable senator were dropped in 10 feet of water, and could not swim, he would not be anxious for uniformity if any system of wireless telegraphy might be made use of to rescue him. A boat containing a number of people may be set adrift off King Island, and the people may be lost through lack of a means of communicating with the mainland. It would not cost more than &#163;30 or &#163;40 to establish a wireless telegraphy station at King Island, and I ask the Government, in the interests of humanity, to see that this kind of communication is established at the island as soon as possible.

                    Ledger has referred to the Vancouver mail service, and in this connexion I must admit that what I saw in the newspapers came to me as a staggering surprise. I went over to Sydney to interview the present Postmaster-General on the subject. Later on the honorable gentlemen went to Queensland, where he was interviewed by the Chamber of Commerce and other bodies. I admit that the interviews were of a confidential nature ; but if there was one impression conveyed to us it was that if any proposal were submitted in connexion with the Vancouver service under which Brisbane would be placed at a disadvantage as com pared with her position under the present arrangement, the Commonwealth Government would not entertain it. I hope that that is so. From what I subsequently learned, I understand that the Ministry have abandoned all idea of making Auckland the first port of call
                    <inline font-style="italic">en route</inline>
                    to Vancouver and thus allowing New Zealand butter and frozen produce to be sent to Canada at the expense of the worst or last port of call, namely, Brisbane. If, under any new scheme, the Government propose to sacrifice &#39;Queensland, or any other part of Australia, in order to give the New Zealand Government a better chance than they now enjoy, I shall strenuously oppose it. No Australian Government will be discharging their duty, if for the sake of saving a few pounds a year, or of doing a good turn to their fellow Britishers in New Zealand, they give the latter a better chance than they give to Australians. There is one other matter to which I desire to refer, namely, the new telephone rates. I am not one of (those who is prone to believe every word which appears in the newspapers. I run a newspaper myself, and therefore I ought to know the value which attaches to newspaper statements. But according to a statement in the Melbourne daily newspapers, there has been a falling-off of 30 per cent, in the number of telephone calls recorded during the past month. I have no objection to that falling-off j indeed, I have contributed to it. I am a small telephone user, and naturally the members of my household during the past month have used the instrument a little less frequently than they used it previously. But I cannot understand the statement in to-day&#39;s newspapers that the Department has decided that the small user who wishes to have a telephone installed in his house must pay for two years&#39; service in advance.

                        <para>- The statement is that he is required to enter into an agreement for four years, and to pay two years&#39; rental in advance. We know perfectly well that to a concern like a bank or a shipping company or the Mutual Store, or the Civil Service Co-operative Store, a payment of &#163;8 for installing an extra telephone is neither here nor there. But to an insignificant person like myself it is a very serious matter. When an individual who leases a house for twelve months with the right of renewal is asked to pay the Department <inline font-style="italic">&#163;fi</inline> down, and to agree to occupy his house for four years, what does it mean? </para>

                        <para>- Supposing that truth is represented by 100 per cent., the Vice-President of the Executive Council says, in effect, that the newspaper statement to which I refer represents only about 40 per cent. If that statement is a lie, we ought to know it at once. Do not let us have it repeated day after day for a long time. I hope that it is a lie; but from the silence of Ministers I doubt whether it is not partly the truth - whether it is not a qualified lie. I hope that the Government will give us an assurance that they do not intend to introduce a system which will press most heavily upon the small user of the telephone, and most lightly upon the big user. If I establish a factory for the manufacture of matches, or of pants, it will not matter to me if I have to pay &#163;&#38; in advance for the installation of a telephone. But to the small suburban householder it will be a very serious matter. It seems to me that the Postal Department, in its efforts to make the large user pay in proportion to the benefits which he receives, is making a grave error, inasmuch as it is putting him in a better position than that occupied by the small user. It is the latter who will suffer all the time. It is the small man who runs a boot shop or a fishmonger&#39;s shop who will be compelled to pay through the nose, while the big man will escape. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt. During the past month the telephone calls have dropped 30 per cent. Can the Government show that by way of compensation they have received a reasonable increase in the number of subscribers? The telephones were made for the public, not the public for the telephones. During the past month the members of my own household have used the telephone as little as possible in. order that I may have to pay as little as possible. But it takes us just as long to get a call answered now as it did previously. I have attached to the wall alongside the instrument a pencil and paper, so that every person who uses the telephone and gets an effective call may make a record of the fact. We thus know exactly how many effective calls we have had during the month. </para>

I have nothing to say against the measured service system, though I may have something to say about it later on when I learn how the departmental method of measurement compares with the householders&#39;. But what happens? You call up the telephone attendant, you get your man, and the moment after you are cut off ; then you ring for three or four minutes and get him back again.

                        <para>- As a matter of fact, this telephone business has not been discussed in the Senate, and I am doing nothing unreasonable in discussing it now. Would the Government mind looking at the telephone system from the point of view of the public, not of the officials? I would give this much credit to the officers - that one can look through their official reports from beginning to end and find no indication that they advised the Government to adopt this new system. We are now being faced with a most extraordinary proposition. We do not know how we stand. I came in under the measured system and thought I knew exactly where I was. But after four or five weeks I discovered that if I happened to move from my present house to another I should have to guarantee the Government to stand by the telephone for four years and to pay for two years in advance. When I first had the telephone installed I was Government Whip, and I suppose that I was furnished with the service just about as promptly as anybody could be. I have no complaint to make on that score. But how long would an ordinary suburban resident be kept? He would be called upon i0 PaY m advance, and it might be five or six weeks before he got his telephone. In addition to that, he would have to give a guarantee to keep the telephone for four years. No such condition as that has been previously laid down in Australia or in any other part of the world. I venture to say that the Government cannot find a case in the world where it is demanded that a telephone subscriber shall not have an instrument put into his house unless he guarantees to pay for it for four years, and, in addition, to put down two years&#39; subscription in advance. Whether these statements that have appeared in the newspaper are correct or not I do not know, but I shall be glad to listen to a Ministerial explanation. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> commenced by saying that, as a newspaper man, he did not, as a rule, believe everything published in newspapers. But his argument would induce one to believe that he was thoroughly satisfied with that which appeared in a newspaper to-day with respect to the telephone service. As a matter of fact, the statement to which he lias called&#39; attention is absolutely incorrect. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline>
                    have been in operation since  1902.  They were introduced by a Government that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                    warmly supported, and were operative at the very time when he held a position in a Cabinet. What are the facts in regard to the statement that appeared in one of the newspapers this morning? Whilst it is true that  1  per cent, of the subscribers might be affected by Regulation  12, 99  per cent, would be exempt.

                        <para>- Because  99  per cent, of the subscribers enjoy the telephone service under conditions that are not affected by regulation  12.  They reside in close proximity to some telephone exchange, and the cost of installation is comparatively little. If a person is called upon to pay two or three, or it may be ten, years in advance, it is to recoup the Department for the erection  &#39;Of  special lines and for special installations in places far removed from a telephone exchange. Unless there were such a regulation in operation, a person might desire to have telephone communication established at a house a considerable distance from a local exchange, and it might be that after two or three months he would feel disposed to remove from the locality. The Department would be  .1  considerable loser in consequence. The regulation, as I have said, was first brought into operation in  1902.  The present Government, therefore, is in no way responsible for it. </para>

                    <para>. - It is well known that the negotiations which have been mentioned by myself and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> are, and must be, more or less confidential. We have respected that, confidence, at any rate I have. I hope that the Government will be shortly able to declare their &#39;intention with regard to the Vancouver mail service. It must be evident that it will take them every hour of the intervening eight months, if they have not begun negotiations, to bring about a satisfactory contract. Over and over again it has been pointed out, as a reason for haste, by the Canadian Government, that it will take them twelve months to fix up a contract. Month after month is passing by. The Postmaster-General has got every member of the Senate more or less in confidence as to what went on at the interview. The Government remain mute all the time, and we have to extract information, so to speak, through their teeth. While every senator who was present at the deputation in Sydney and in Brisbane will preserve the confidence which the Postmaster-General imposed on them, or asked us to give him, I think that he is not dealing fairly with us. </para>

                        <para>- I am dissatisfied because the Postmaster-General is not playing fairly with us. We cannot disclose the substance of the negotiations which was made known over the table to the representatives of Queensland and the representatives of great industries in that State and others. Every one who was present had some indication of the mind of the Postmaster-General in this matter. I do not think that it is at all trespassing on that confidence to say that I have a grave suspicion as to whether that contract is going to be maintained for the benefit of Australia, especially of the State of Queensland. That suspicion may be unjust ; but the Government know that they cannot renew satisfactorily a contract for a big mail service in a very short period. Necessarily, it must be renewed in some form or other. Canada and New Zealand are pressing a point of view which apparently is to the disadvantage of Australia in general, and of Queensland in particular. Notwithstanding that fact, and that the time available is short, the Government are remaining quiet without declaring their intention. I do not suppose that the Minister will now attempt to answer me. Possibly he may plead that I have said nothing that calls for an answer. He is the judge of that; and I shall have to abide by his decisions. The conduct of the negotiations is, in my opinion, one of the most unsatisfactory acts of the Government, and is causing a good deal of anxiety and uneasiness, especially to Queensland. If one aspect of the negotiations is persevered in, the Postmaster-General is likely to play right up to the hilt the game of New Zealand, and possibly of Canada, to the entire disadvantage of the Commonwealth, especially of Queensland which, in co-operation with New South Wales, year after year paid heavily for the initiation of the trade between </para>

                    <para>.  - I am very glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> dealt with the new telephone regulations, and the conditions under which the telephone is used under the measured-rate system. I do not intend to go into the whole question to-night, but to direct the attention of the Government to certain matters. If they are going to apply a uniform rate as for rental and as for use of the telephone, they should take into consideration the different systems of telephones in existence. Some telephones are on the common battery switchboard ; some are on the old multiple switchboard, and some can be used without the slightest danger of induction that will lead to the discovery of conversation taking place between two persons who are conversing, and one or two others who are not on the same line. There are also telephones which will enable a person to deal directly with the person with whom he is conversing, and when the conversation is finished, to at once disconnect himself, and immediately get telephonic connexion with somebody else. These are circumstances which I think ought to be taken info consideration by the Government before they fully establish any proposition for the uniform charging of persons who use telephones. There is another matter which I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, and that is in connexion with the conditions which certain shipping companies propose to impose on travellers. I .desire to ask whether, in view of the fact that apparently it is not contemplated that the Navigation Bill shall go right through its course this session, the Government are prepared to take action with regard to certain shipping companies which propose to impose upon passengers conditions which are contrary to law. I need not go further than to state that they propose to establish amongst others, a condition which is an infraction of the Quarantine Act. </para>

                        <para>- If that is the case, I shall not pursue the matter much further. Section 59 of the Quarantine Act provides that a company shall bear the cost of quarantine; but certain companies which enjoy a mail subsidy, and are supposed to carry passengers in ordinary circumstances, propose to impose upon them the obligation of discharging them from their responsibilities, not only in that regard, but in other directions. I do not wish to go into the matter very fully at present, but on a more appropriate occasion I shall do so if an opportunity is afforded to me. In the meantime, I ask the Government to carefully ascertain from all shipping companies which receive a subsidy for carrying mails if they are prepared to conform to Australian laws and Australian conditions, and not to ask passengers to sign anything which mil. deny to them any rights they may have under the common law or under the Statute law of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to know whether the Government are satisfied in regard to the way in which telephone calls are registered. It appears to me that a subscriber has no guarantee of the correctness of the register. It is not automatic, and no matter what mistakes may be made, he has no way of rectifying them, or, indeed, of discovering them. I took the trouble to go into the Adelaide Telephone Exchange, which, I believe, has one of the most up-to-date switchboards. I found that the manner of getting an effective call is very efficient; but when the parties to a conversation ring off, all they have to depend upon is the fact that the girl in attendance is supposed to. press a button that lifts a lever which moves a figure on a certain register. So far as I can see, there is mo other way of registering calls. There is no way for a subscriber to satisfy himself as to the correctness of his account. At first blush it might seem that when the girl at the switchboard neglects to press the button, it is all in favour <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> the subscriber, because the call is not registered. At the same time, there is nothing to prevent a girl from pressing the button a dozen times if she desires to do so. </para>

                        <para>- The girls are only human, I suppose. They get cross sometimes, and might do that. What I wish to emphasize is that there is no absolute certainty with regard to the correctness of the register. It depends upon whether the attendant presses a button or not. I do not think that that is satisfactory to either party. If you could get an automatic register, well and good. But when a great many of the calls are not effective, and cannot be registered, I do not see very well how you are going to get an automatic register. Under the existing system subscribers are placed at the mercy of the switchboard attendant, and they should not be placed in that position. I am concerned in this matter for a correct registration of effective calls, and I should like to see some means adopted which would give telephone subscribers an assurance when their accounts are rendered that the effective calls they have made have been correctly recorded. </para>

                        <para>- I wish the honorable senator would talk sense. A large establishment could not be expected to provide* hundreds of halfpennies, so that one might be put into a box for every effective telephone call. The matter is one which should be treated seriously. The present system cannot be considered satisfactory, even- from the point of view of the Department. They have to depend upon the switchboard attendant, as well as the subscriber, and they have no assurance that she will press the button for every call. I do not think it is too much to ask Ministers whether the matter has been considered, if there is in existence in any other place in the world a better system, and, if so, whether it could not be adopted here? As a telephone subscriber, and one who, in business, must use the telephone frequently, I should like to be satisfied that when .my account is rendered it will be absolutely accurate. Under -existing conditions, 1 do not know that; and if I employ some one to keep a record of &#39;effective calls on my telephone, and it disagrees with the record of the Department, my record will not be accepted. I am satisfied that, up to a certain point, the present system is a good system ; but there should be some means by which the switchboard attendant and the subscriber might satisfy each other that the number of calls has been correctly recorded. </para>

                        <para>- Even that system would not be free from objection, since a token might be put in the slot when the call made was not effective. A subscriber may ring up the exchange five times, to be told four times out of the five that the person he has rung up is engaged ; and if the system suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> were adopted, the token would not be put in unless the call were effective. If the Government have any scheme in view to overcome the difficulty, they should tell the Committee what it is.

                        <para>.- That is so; but I think that some notice would have to be taken of it if a number of subscribers adopted the practice, and it was shown that, as a general rule, the Department was overcharging. I do not suppose for a moment that the Department has any desire to overcharge any subscriber. If a subscriber attempts to keep a record of his calls, he cannot rely upon every one in his place marking the record every time his telephone is used. In many instances a subscriber is disconnected almost immediately after he has been connected with the person with whom he wishes to speak. This may be the result of some error ; but when the connexion is restored it is possible that the subscriber may be charged for two calls. I am not sure that an automatic system would overcome that difficulty which is one of the most serious objections to the adoption of the toll system. Under the existing system a charge of&#163;4 is made for telephone connexion, whether with a business firm or a private subscriber. Under the previous system, I paid &#163;5 a year for a telephone at my private house, and the charge to a business firm was &#163;9. Under the existing system, there is a margin of &#163;5 in the one case, and only &#163;1 in the other, necessary in order to bring about an equality with the previous conditions. If we are to have a toll system I think it would be very much better to adopt that proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Austin</inline> Chapman, when he was Postmaster-General, of making a charge of&#163;2 or &#163;2 10s. to each subscriber, and even then giving a certain number of free calls. That would have been a very much more popular system. </para>

                        <para>- I am perfectly well aware of that, sir, but I submit that I have a perfect right, so long as I do not go into details, to draw a parallel between the railway and telephone services. The complaint has sometimes been made that our railway services are conducted in order to make a profit, and not, as was intended, to open up the country. I say that the telephone service should not be conducted in order to make a profit, but to afford the public the greatest possible facilities for the transaction of business. The railway and telephone services, as institutions conducted by Government, should be managed on similar principles. We are told that if the telephone service was handed over to private people, they would expect to make a profit out of it, whereas the Government do not need to look for a profit from the conduct of the service. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> alluded to the rent that is being charged in certain cases. I must admit that I was surprised to hear that any regulation of the kind referred to was in force. From information I have since obtained, I understand the explanation is a very simple one, as it applies only where people require a special line that would cost the Department &#163;40 or &#163;50. It is only reasonable that in such cases the subscriber should be asked to indemnify the Department for the expense involved. </para>

                        <para>.- I did not. There are other honorable senators in the chamber. I understand that if a man desires a telephone line to be erected to his residence, which may be 3 or 4 miles distant from an exchange, he is compelled to pay the cost of that line. I recognise the reasonableness of such a provision. </para>

It is only, natural that honorable senators who have some knowledge of the working of the telephone should feel themselves justified in saying a few words upon this subject, even though by so doing they risk incurring the displeasure of the Government. I hope that in future the Ministry will not exhibit quite so much touchiness upon matters as they have this evening. </para>

It seems necessary to remind the Minister that he is not Czar in the Senate, and that a threat of that kind is likely to provoke retaliation. Nobody desires to see the Navigation Bill go through more than I do.

                            <para>- Sometimes I get the whip on me, and sometimes I lay it upon others. I strongly object to the threat of the Minister of Defence, especially in view of the fact that the Opposition have made a splendid concession to the Government by allowing them to put through a Supply Bill for more than &#163;800.000 in one day. Many honorable senators upon this side of the Chamber have spent considerable time in assisting to improve measures, and in respect of the Navigation Bill from the very moment of its appearance this session not a single individual can be honestly taunted with having wasted time. I would remind the Minister that the Opposition is not going to be driven by the Government, and that our Standing Orders enable an Opposition, if provoked, to fight for a very long time. More than that, there are some honorable senators upon this side of the Chamber who possess sufficient mental and physical strength to continue such a fight for a prolonged period. Although the session has been a strenuous one we are ready for the worst. I have no desire to add to the heat that has been displayed, but I will say that the Government well deserve the fairly warm retort that has been made for the way in which they have conducted the Supply Bill. </para>

I was a member of an Opposition for many years, and I shall always main- tain the rights of an Opposition. I have had to face truculent Governments. I do not want to see Labour Governments truculent. There was no time wasted this afternoon. We got the Supply Bill without any notice. No one, knew that it was to be here this afternoon until it was suddenly thrown upon the table. There have been only eight hours of discussion. The remarks of the Minister of Defence were very uncalled for. Every member of this Parliament has his rights,. Even if I am supporting a Government I do not take the Estimates of that Government without discus&#39;sion. Estimates are laid before Parliament for members to discuss them. Whether a man is a supporter of a Government or sits in opposition to it, he is bound in the interests of the country, if he is to do his duty, to examine those Estimates and to criticise them if he thinks fit. </para>

In another part of Australia we have a Government coercing an Opposition. That sort of thing is degrading to parliamentary government, and reduces it to a farce. Yet we have had something of a similar character attempted here. Whether I support or oppose a Government, I shall stand up for the freedom of members of Parliament. I wish to ask the Minister when the report&#39; of the Postal Commission will- be circulated? </para>

Did not the honorable senator know that on Friday last I gave contingent notice of motion with reference to the suspension of the Standing Orders in anticipation of that Bill arriving? The honorable senator ought to have known that such a measure was coming before us. If he did not know, he was neglecting his duty. But I can feel for the honorable senator. He has been so long in Opposition that he cannot get out of the habit of opposing. It is a very good thing for the Government that they are not entirely dependent upon a majority of one. Honorable senators opposite may feel that they have done very well in blocking the Supply Bill for such a long time. I challenge them to show any other occasion when a Supply Bill of this description was not dealt with by the Senate in less than a quarter of the time that has been occupied to-day. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> talks about the Estimates being flung upon the table, I reply that at no period of the history of this Parliament has it ever been considered that the Estimates-in-Chief &#39; were under discussion in connexion with a Supply Bill. The Estimates come before Parliament in a proper and well regulated way. But an opportunity has presented itself in connexion with an ordinary Supply Bill for wasting time and delaying business. I do not blame either <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> or any member of the Opposition for taking advantage of the opportunity. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators opposite are perfectly at liberty to do so. But I wish to remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, who has threatened us with consequences involving physical endurance, that the Government intend to carry out the programme that they have laid before Parliament, and if we have to sit every day in the week, and every night, an attempt to do that work will be made. If the members of the Opposition are prepared to put the supporters of the Government to inconvenience, they must remember that they will also put themselves to inconvenience. We have nothing to thank the Opposition for, as far as we have yet gone. I am at a loss to know who leads the Opposition when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is away ; but the Acting Leader of the Opposition, whoever he is - whether it be <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould, Senator Chataway,</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger - was in a position to control honorable senators on his own side to some extent, and to give a fair chance for work upon the Navigation Bill to be done to-day. Last Friday I said that I would give an opportunity on Thursday of this . week to discuss the census papers if sufficient progress were made with business. I do not- hold myself or the Government bound to carry out that promise to the Opposition after their conduct today. </para>
