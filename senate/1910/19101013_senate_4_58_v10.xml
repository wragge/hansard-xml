                        <para>- On behalf of my colleague, I have pleasure in making the following statement: - Instructions have been issued to-day to all  Deputy  Postmasters-General that, from and including to-day, postage stamps now issued in the various States are to be valid for the prepayment of postage at all post-offices in the Commonwealth, so that from this date letters can be posted in any State, prepaid by the stamps of any other State, and State boundaries, therefore, no longer exist so far as postage stamps are concerned. Honorable senators will understand, of course, that this does not affect the rates of postage, which must of necessity be continued pending legislation. </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable senators will find that the Bill now presented to them, dealing with the naval defence of the Commonwealth, has to be read in connexion with, the main De-, fence Acts of 1903 and 1909. I desire to intimate that, for general convenience, I have obtained supplies of the Act of 1903 as amended  by  the Acts of 1904 and 1909. It will be found to be more convenient for reference in this form than as separate Statutes. The aim of the Government in connexion with naval defence is that, whilst the Navy that we are establishing shall be, in some respects, separate from the British Navy, it shall at the same time be auxiliary to that Navy. We think that that is by no means a contradictory position. It is a position that has always been recognised in the policy of our party ; and, although it has at times been fiercely assailed, especially by those who have argued that, as the sea is one, the Navy must be one, nevertheless, in recent years we have witnessed a considerable revulsion of feeling on the question, and it is now generally admitted by leading naval authorities in the Mother Country that by building up in Australia a separate Navy, auxiliary to the British Navy, we shall be adding a fresh source of strength to the Empire. We also wish to emphasize the fact that our Navy will be under complete Commonwealth administration and control. Just here I should like to quote from the proceedings of the Conference with the representatives of the self-governing Dominions on the naval and military defences of the Empire, 1909. On page 28 of the proceedings will be found set out the agreement reached between the representatives of the United Kingdom and the representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia in regard to the position of our naval unit. The second paragraph reads as follows : - </para>

                        <para>In peace time and while on the Australian Station this fleet unit would be under the  exclusive  control of the Commonwealth Government as regards their movements and general administration ; but officers and men should be governed by regulations similar to the King's Regulations, and be under Naval discipline, and when with vessels of the Royal Navy the senior officer shall take command of the whole. Further, when placed by the Commonwealth Government at the disposal of the Admiralty in war time, the vessels should be under the control of the Naval Commander-in-Chief. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That agreement, we believe, safeguards the principle of Commonwealth control over our own Navy. It recognises that the placing of the Fleet unit under Admiralty control must be the act of the Commonwealth, and that the vessels should be so placed by the Commonwealth Government. This will call for the sympathetic co-operation  of  the British Navy in time of peace as well as in time of war. We need this, because, in time of peace, we must see that our standard of efficiency, discipline, and control is equal to that of the British Navy. The only way in which we can accomplish that is by having the most complete, thorough, and sympathetic cooperation established between ourselves and the Mother Country. I quote the following paragraph from page 29 of the Proceedings of the Conference - </para>

                    <para class="block">These are merely general principles. They do not bind the Commonwealth or the Admiralty to anything. They are expressions of general principles to which the parties represented at the Conference gave their adhesion. Of course the working out of these principles will take time, and the Commonwealth Government, and through them, the Parliament, will have to give their assent to each proposal as it is made. These principles are not definitely dealt wilh in this Bill, but provision is made in the measure to give effect to them. They will be given effect as the result of acts of administration from time to time, and possibly of Imperial, as well as Commonwealth, legislation. As I said when speaking a few days ago, we are in the unique position of being a nation within a nation. We are part of an Empire, and there has never been a case before in which, within an Empire, there has been a country with a separate navy, having independent control, and possibly a separate flag, and yet in a position to impose responsibilities upon the whole  of  the Empire. It may be,, as the position develops, that it will be found necessary for the Imperial Parliament, and also for the Commonwealth Parliament, to legislate in order to give full' effect to the idea. On the question  of/  officers, for instance, we hope eventually to have our own naval schools and colleges, in which we shall be able to thoroughly equip and train our officers. But in the earlier years of our Navy,' and until we have had time to thoroughly establish and equip such institutions, we must have recourse to the - Admiralty, and must rely upon their generosity and good feeling to provide us with a certain number of officers, in order that we may have the instructors necessary for the training of our officers and men, and to bring them up to the standard of the British Navy. We have no reason to doubt that this service will be freely rendered by the Admiralty. In all the despatches, the authorities of the Admiralty have shown the most cordial desire to co-operate with : us in every way. Already we have offers to place several" expert officers at our disposal, and in connexion with the recent despatch of our torpedo-boat destroyers from Great Britain, the Admiralty lent us every assistance in training the officers and men we sent lo the Mother Country, and in lending officers and men to assist in bringing the ships to Australia. In time of war, or of the imminent danger of war, it would be unsound and disastrous to have divided naval control. Whatever wars the Empire may become involved in, we shall be involved" in also. If those wars are of a naval character, we shall be concerned in them, even though they should :be wars which we may have done nothing to bring about. That is one of the disabilities attaching to our position as part of the Empire. It brings us many advantages, but some disadvantages, of which this is one. Obviously, in the conduct of such a war, there should be only one control at sea. It would be clearly unsound to have divided control, with two or three fleets acting -independently, and so enabling the enemy -to meet and defeat each in detail. We recognise that undivided control at sea in such circumstances is absolutely essential. The time of placing our fleet, the circumstances in which it shall :'be placed, and the manner in which it shall be disposed of when it has been .placed, will, of course, rest largely upon -the Naval 'Commander-in-Chief of the forces engaged in the war. But there is no reason to believe that the Admiralty would disregard any representations made to them by -the Government of any of the Dominions as to the disposition of their fleet. The "Imperial . Defence Conference agreed to the establishment of a naval unit in the Pacific, of which Australia and Canada are to find separate parts, New Zealand contributing to the British Navy an armoured cruiser and some torpedo-boat destroyers, and the British Admiralty finding the other vessels to complete the unit in China, waters. This unit will be intrusted with the control and defence of British interests in the Pacific. The various parts of the unit will, in time of war, of course be under one command for this purpose. The Australian unit agreed upon consists of one armoured cruiser of the new <inline font-style="italic">Indomitable</inline> class, three unarmoured cruisers stipulated to be of the <inline font-style="italic">Bristol</inline> class - but, since the Conference, it has been decided that they shall be of what is known as the <inline font-style="italic">Improved. Bristol</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">City</inline> class - six destroyers of the <inline font-style="italic">Improved River</inline> class, and three submarines. That is the unit which the representatives of Australia at the Conference undertook to provide. In order to meet the requirements of that unit, we need to commence educational establishments for officers, and we propose to establish a naval college. A site has been chosen at Middle Head, in Sydney Harbor, and a sum of money, which was collected in New South Wales during the now historic <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> agitation, and amounting to ,£45,000, is to be handed over to the Commonwealth Government for the establishment of the college there. Under this Bill, we take power to establish that college. This, also, was part of the agreement entered into, as will be seen from the following quotation which I make from the summary of the result of the <inline font-style="italic">Proceedings of the Conference -</inline></para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">What I particularly wish to refer to is that it was agreed at the Conference that these training schools should be established. The establishment of a training school will be a work of some years, and it must be some years before we can hope that officers will be turned out from it. In addition, we shall need naval, gunnery, and torpedo schools for experts and the ordinary schools for the <inline font-style="italic">personnel.</inline> In a discussion of the matter elsewhere, objection wa* urged to the establishment of schools for these purposes on land, but the person who made the objection seemed to be oblivious of the fact that all these schools exist in the Mother Country, and are established on land at places contiguous to the sea, and, of course, at times the students at the schools are taken to sea. At Deptford and other places in Great Britain these schools are established on land. They are found to be economical, and to afford the best method of training youths for this work. The sites for these schools have not yet been chosen. This is a matter on which we are asking Admiral Henderson to report. The Bill merely gives power to establish the schools. In connexion with Admiral Henderson's visit to Australia, I wish to say that, in the establishment of a navy, we must provide for a main naval base, where ships can be refitted'.; 'where, if necessary, construction and revictualling can be undertaken at a place where the ships may lie safe from the attack of any possible enemy, and at which they may take shelter after an engagement whilst the work of refitting is being carried out. In addition to this main base, we require subsidiary bases at different parts of the Commonwealth, which must be selected for their strategical value. Whilst these subsidiary bases will not contain the main workshops and construction works, they will need to be, on a smaller scale, a duplication of the main naval base. In addition, it may be necessary to have torpedo depots at different places, where torpedo-boat destroyers, submarines, and similar craft can be refitted and obtain extra stores, but they will need to be protected by land defences or be in positions difficult of access to the vessels of an invading fleet. On all these questions we are obviously ill-prepared to decide. We have a small naval force, but, as honorable senators are aware, it is not up-to-date. For many years, the Commonwealth Naval Force has languished both for want of funds and lack of experience. The Government feel that all these matters should be determined absolutely independent of any local or parochial considerations. They should be decided solely on the ground of the strategical value of the places selected for the establishment of these bases. With that idea in view, we asked the Admiralty to recommend an officer to give us advice. After consideration, it was arranged that Admiral Henderson should be invited to come out to Australia. We invited him, and he is at present engaged on this mission in Australia. He is in possession of the highest recommendations, both from Lord Fisher, the late First Lord of the Admiralty, and from Admiral Wilson, the present First Lord, for the work in which he is now engaged. We have invited the co-operation of the various State Governments in placing at his disposal all the information he may require about the various ports of the States. We have given Admiral Henderson an absolutely free hand. We have merely indicated in our instructions to him the points which we regard as of special importance, such as the capital cities and other places that are obviously of commercial importance. Otherwise, we have left him an absolutely free hand to take the map of Australia and mark upon it the places where these bases should be established. It is the intention of the Government, so far as they can, to be guided in their action in this regard by Admiral Henderson's report. We confidently appeal to Parliament to back us up in what we believe .to be the only sound way in which to commence the establishment of naval defence in Australia. In regard to the question of administration and control, it has to be remembered, first of all, that an undertaking has been entered into by the Conference agreement which we adopt, that our unit shall be kept in an efficient state, which means that all the ships shall be kept fit for war at any time, even though an emergency should suddenly arise. That being so, the vessels of the unit must be provided with permanent crews and 'officers. It is advisable also, following the example of the Mother Country, that administration should be -divided from command. So there will be appointed in command of the unit a naval officer who, of course, in the first instance will probably be a British officer, but who we hope, eventually, when our own men have had the advantage of training and experience, will be an Australian officer. At any rate we propose to appoint in command of this unit an officer who will be separated from the duty of administering the Naval Act. In this measure provision is made for that officer appointment. These officers will be appointed by the Governor-General in Council. Even the British officers who are appointed at the outset will be recommended by the Admiralty, and appointed by the Governor-General in Council, in other words by the </para>
                    <para class="block">Minister charged with administering the Act. We propose to copy, as far as we can, the British Admiralty, and taking into consideration the smallness of our force, to establish an administration commensurate with our requirements. Consequently, we take power in this Bill to establish a Naval Board of Administration. Under the existing Defence Act reference is made to a Naval Director. That officer has been, and will be until this Bill becomes law, associated with a small Board for administrative purposes. But to all intents and purposes, our small Naval Force has hitherto been under his control. The reason why we have omitted from this Bill provision for a Naval Director is that we propose to replace that officer by a Board of Administration, of which he will probably be a member. That does not mean that we" are either abolishing that officer's duties or the officer himself, but merely that we are establishing a different system of control which is more in accord with the new requirements. Upon this Board there will probably be the head of. each sub-Department. For instance, we shall have a Construction Branch. We hope to construct one of the protected cruisers, and the remainder of the torpedo boat destroyers and submarines. The officer, at the head of the Construction Branch will have a seat on the Board. I wish honorable senators to understand that the scheme which I am now outlining is of a tentative character, because we have yet to receive the advice of Admiral Henderson on the subject. But it is the scheme which we at present contemplate. Some alteration may be made in the constitution of the Board ; but there will certainly be a Board of Administration. Then, there will be an officer in charge of the Naval Intelligence Branch, including the disposition of ships, and he will occupy a seat upon the Board. Another officer will have control of the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> and training of our Naval Forces, and he, too, will have a seat upon the Board. Still another officer will deal with contracts, and he also will have a seat on the Board, as will also the paymaster or accountant, who will be responsible for the financial side of our Naval Forces. Then we shall have representatives of the sub-heads upon the Board. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, because in England the conditions which obtain are not similar to our own. In the case of a great force such as the British Navy, which has a number of half-pay officers who are quite as good as are the officers who are in full commission, and where officers can be called up and discharged, there is a much simpler method of control than we have at present. We have not the numbers to choose from that they have in the Old Country. We have not the officers at our disposal. But bearing in mind our altered circumstances, I say that this scheme is modelled somewhat on the lines of the British Admiralty. </para>

In the first place there will have to be a permanent force sufficient at all times to keep ready for service the vessels of the unit which I have outlined. It may be that some of those vessels may not at first have the full complement of crew, and that they may be used around our coast for the purpose of training the naval militia. </para>

It is considered desirable by the Admiralty that those vessels shall be in full commission.

During the next financial year the Government contemplate recruiting for this new force, and arranging with the Admiralty to have these recruits trained either on the ships of the Australian Squadron or on some other vessels, so that in 1912, when the vessels of the unit arrive, we shall be able to fill up, at any rate the lower ratings, with Australians. The Imperial authorities are now intimating to all persons in Australia joining the British naval service that they will be liable to be transferred to the Australian unit. </para>

                            <para>- They will, when we take up this other scheme. At present they are giving each recruit to understand that in 1912 those recruited in Australia will be transferred to the Commonwealth unit. Under this arrangement there is an obvious disadvantage to the Imperial authorities in that each year they have to bring before the Imperial Parliament provision for the maintenance of their establishment of 133,000 officers and men. The Australian unit will be an addition to their ordinary establishment, and unless we make provision for meeting the requirements of 1912, the Imperial Government will have to provide either for an increase of their establishment or for a decrease of it. They do not wish to do that if it can be avoided. Consequently, the Government have in contemplation the taking of early action to commence recruiting, and we are informed that within two years men can be sufficiently trained to enable them to fill the lower ratings of our prospective Fleet-unit. As regards the other ratings, a much longer time will be required. Indeed, from ten to twelve years' training is necessary before gunners become proficient in their calling. Of course, some may become fairly proficient in about seven years. Then we have made provision on  the  Estimates for the establishment of schools in which boys ranging from twelve to fourteen years will be taken and trained for the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Navy. These lads will require about three years to get through their land course, and to fit them to go to sea. We hope to commence the establishment of these naval schools towards the end of the year, but it is very unlikely that the lads trained in them will be fit to go to sea on any of the ships of the Australian unit, which will be in commission, before 1913. I come now to the Citizen Forces - that is, to those who are not permanently employed in our Naval Forces, but who are recruited from the ranks of our citizens. These will consist of two classes. Clause 21 of the Bill reads -  (1.) The Citizen Naval Forces shall be divided into the Naval Reserve Forces and the Naval Volunteer Reserve Forces. (2.) The Naval Reserve Forces shall consist of officers and seamen who are not bound in time of peace to continuous naval service and who are paid for their services as prescribed. (3.) The Naval Volunteer Reserve Forces shall consist of officers and seamen who are not bound in time of peace to continuous naval service and who are not ordinarily paid for their services in time of peace. </para>

As in the case of the Military Forces, they will be continued until the new force is thoroughly established ; and then the question of their abolition will be considered. These two bodies will constitute the second line of the Naval Reserve Force. Next we come to the Naval Reserve Volunteer Force. It will embody those who have served their term, and, therefore, will not become operative for some years. Those who have reached the age of twenty-six years will pass out of the Naval Reserve into the Naval Volunteer Reserve. They will not be liable for a continuous service of twenty-five days. They will only be liable to come up to serve when called on; but they will be kept registered at their station, and liable to service whenever required. In addition to these, there are, throughout the Commonwealth, various persons whose services would be of considerable value for naval purposes. For instance, there are a number of pilots employed on boats- that run to and from Brisbane through Torres Strait. They would be of incalculable advantage to the Commonwealth in time of war, because they know all the passages about the Barrier Reef, and its intricacies. They are at present embodied in our Naval Volunteer Force, but are not called upon for any service. We propose to establish a reserve of such men, so that they may be enrolled and be at our disposal in time of war. That explains to the Senate how we propose to raise the force. As I said before, we shall require, in the first place, to obtain from the United Kingdom the officers and the men in the higher ratings. The local officers will be retained and given full opportunity of gaining promotion and obtaining, service. </para>

                            <para>- As we begin to draft local men into the ships, the Imperial men will be withdrawn ; and the same course will be pursued with the officers. The capital cost of the unit is estimated at £3,695,000, namely, the armoured cruiser at  ,£2,000,000,  the three protected cruisers at  .£1,050,000,  the six destroyers at  £480,000,  and the three submarines at  £165,000.  These are, of course, only approximate estimates. At present, we have no means of ascertaining the cost of construction here. All sorts of estimates have been submitted to me. The cost has been estimated', in some cases, at  12  per cent, above the British price, and in others at  25  per cent. When the third destroyer is put together in the Fitzroy Dock, we shall be able to ascertain how our people shape at this work. The estimated cost of the upkeep of the unit is about  £500,000  a year. That is based on the assumption that we shall give higher rates of pay than are allowed in the British Navy.. </para>

We propose to bear the whole cost, because we consider that it is only our duty to do so.

The question of discipline is, perhaps, one of the most difficult matters tq deal with in this connexion.

                            <para>- Some honorable senators know that flogging has been abolished, but others do not. I want to draw attention to the fact that it is not prescribed as a single punishment throughout the calendar of offences. All the harsh forms of punishment which at one time were characteristic of the Royal Navy were abolished a long time ago. Of course, serious punishments are provided for certain crimes. The punishment of death extends to other crimes than that of murder. In the civil code that is the punishment for murder and some sexual offences; but in the Naval Discipline Act it is the punishment for treason, for cowardice in the face of the enemy, for giving information to the enemy, for refusing duty in the face of the enemy, and for desertion in the face of the enemy. I think that most of us will admit that, in such circumstances, the punishment of death is well-deserved ; that a man who deserts in the face of the enemy is as bad as a murderer, because he leaves his comrades to their fate, in order to save his own skin. The object of the Government in adopting these regulations is to keep as near as possible to the code of the Royal Navy. In time of war our ships will have to co-operate with its ships. If our standard of discipline were different, if our system of control were less effective, the result would be disastrous not only to our ships, but also to the whole Navy which might  De  engaged in an action. We, therefore, have to keep up the effective standard which we are adopting. I hope that honorable senators will not be unduly alarmed ar this proposal. A large number of young Australians - 600 or 700, I think - are at present serving in British ships on the Australian Station. They are taken to the ships at an age when a lad is generally most restive under control. But I have not heard that the Australian has been more obstreperous than his British <inline font-style="italic">confrere</inline> in the ships. I have not heard any complaints from them as to the treatment to which, they are subjected. That is a good indication that we can safely adopt this code for our ships; of course, with the safeguard that, if necessary, we have the power to make an alteration. In conclusion, I would remind the Senate that, as Australia is an island, it can be reached by no foe except by sea, and that if war has to take place, it is far better that it should be conducted on some other land than ours. If we can prevent a landing, a war can never take place on our shores. It is a very risky undertaking to bring ships across the sea, even when the defending fleet is small, if the invader knows that the ships of that fleet are effective, vigilant, and courageous. So I think that this unit, small as it is, will afford a very good guarantee that Australia will be safe to pursue her peaceful career. Another point is that almost every one of our principal commodities depends absolutely for its stability in price upon keeping open the great sea routes. If those routes were blocked or threatened* for a single week, the effect upon the prices of our products would be disastrous. Therefore, in passing this Bill, we shall not merely safeguard the peace of Australia, but also the trading interests and the well-being of her people. </para>

                            <para>- The Sugar Excise Tariff Act and the Sugar Bounty Act of  1904  fixed the Excise on sugar at  £4  per ton up to the year  1910,  the amount decreasing from that date by £1 per annum in the years  191 1  and  191 2,  and thence ceasing. At the same time, the import duty was fixed at £6 per ton, and the bounty at £3 per ton, a gain to the farmers of just over  £3  per ton of sugar; the idea being that, at the end of the same period, the bounty also should lapse. For some time past in Queensland there has been a certain amount of uneasiness in regard to the proposals of the Government. It has been felt that the producers of sugar were not yet in a position to do without the bounty. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; I include the whole number of coloured people. 1 understand that there are some who object to this legislation. To them I desire to put this position. The Commonwealth Government has a desire to see proper labour conditions obtaining in all indus tries. We are hampered in giving effect to that desire by the provisions of the Constitution ; but we have been able, by the use of our powers in regard to Excise, to effect a very considerable alteration in connexion with one industry at least - namely, the sugar industry. We are hoping that <inline font-style="italic">ber</inline> fore very long the Commonwealth will be given full power to legislate in regard to the industrial condition of the people in all industries. </para>

                            <para>- In all States. When that time arrives, it may properly be argued that there is no reason why any particular industry should be picked out to receive a bounty, because we can frame our protective Tariff on whatever lines we choose, with the object of keeping out foreign competition. We can then proceed to stipulate the conditions which shall" apply to the production of various articles in Australia. But until we have secured an amendment of the Constitution, we are, unfortunately, without that power. We have done something, however, in regard to the sugar industry, and I will give a few figures to show what has been effected by Commonwealth legislation. In  1902  the number of sugar-cane farmers who employed white labour in Queensland was  1,521,  and the number of those who employed black labour  975,  the total being  2,496.  The percentage of farmers employing white labour was  60.9,  and the percentage employing black labour was  39.1-  In New South Wales the number of sugar-cane "farmers employing white labour was  1,005 &gt;  those employing black labour numbered  115,  the total being  1,120.  The percentage who employed white labour was  89.7,  and the percentage employing black labour was  10.3.  The acreage under sugar cultivation, cultivated respectively by white and black labour, in Queensland in  1902  totalled  95,697.  In New South Wales the area under cultivation was  24,057,  of which area  21,591  acres were cultivated by white labour and  2,466  acres by black. The percentage in New South Wales was  89.7  cultivated by white labour, and  10.3  by black. I turn to the figures for a year which affords us a more adequate means of making an effective comparison with the year  19 10.  In the year  1904  there were in Queensland  2,429  farmers employing white labour, and  993  employing black labour, the total being  3,422.  The percentage employing white labour was  71,  and the percentage employing black labour <inline font-style="italic">sg.</inline> In New South Wales 1,304 farmers employed white labour, and 222 employed black labour, the total being 1,526. The percentage employing white labour was 85.5, and the percentage employing black labour 14.5. In Queensland, in 1904, 45,424 acres were cultivated by -white labour, and 74,375 by black labour, the total being 119,799. The percentage cultivated by white labour was 37.9, and the percentage cultivated by black labour 62.1. In N ew South Wales 19,114 acres were cultivated by white labour, and 2,411 acres by black labour, the total being 21,525. The percentage cultivated by white labour was 88.8, and the percentage cultivated by black labour n. 2. I come to the year 1.910. In this year it is estimated that in Queensland 4,630 farmers are employing white labour as against 322 employing black, the total being 4,950.  The .percentage of farmers employing white labour is estimated to be 93.5, and the percentage employing black labour 6.5. </para>

In New South Wales, in 1910, the number of farmers employing white labour is estimated at 1,078, and the number employing black labour at 80, the total being 1,158. The percentages are 9,3 employing white labour, and 7 employing black. The acreage cultivated by white labour in Queensland this year is estimated to be 116.550, and the acreage cultivated by black labour 8,869, the total being 125,419. The percentage cultivated by white labour is estimated to be 92.9, and the percentage cultivated by black labour 7.1. The acreage cultivated by white labour in New South Wales is estimated to be 12,507, and the acreage cultivated by black labour 875, The percentage cultivated by white labour is estimated to be 93.6, and the percentage cultivated by black labour 6.4. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I have another return before me which shows the increase in sugar produced by white labour, ranging from 12,254 tons in 1902 to 170,684 tons in 19 10, whilst the sugar cultivated by black labour has dropped from 65,581 tons in 1902 to 15,492 tons in 1910. So that honorable senators will see that it can be claimed that the policy inaugurated by the Commonwealth has had the effect of turning the sugar industry practically into a white man's industry. </para>

The figures show that a large number of the farmers who are now employing white labour were farmers who formerly employed black labour. I venture to say that we cannot estimate the value of this great alteration in the conditions of the sugar industry in hard cash. </para>

                            <para>- I know that that is argued. It was said at one time that it was impossible, no matter what was done, to have the industry conducted by white labour. At any rate, that argument has been shown to be fallacious. I have before me reports as to the labour supplies in the various districts of Queensland. The State is divided for the purpose of Commonwealth legislation into four districts. The reports for 1909 show that in No. 1 district the labour supply was adequate; in No. 2 district, ditto; in No. 3 district, ditto; in No. 4 district, ditto, except at Nambour, where labour was a little scarce at the close of the crushing. There was in the previous Act a provision regarding labour conditions. I was responsible for that provision, having moved -the amendment in the Senate. Unfortunately, however, we had not at that time much experience of this kind of legislation. The provision was somewhat clumsily drafted, and it has not altogether effected the desired purpose. It was laid down that the Minister should have power to withhold the whole or part of the bounty payable if he found that the rate of wages paid by growers was lower than the standard rate ruling in the district. As, however, there were no standard ruling rates, the Minister had to adopt a standard for himself. That standard was fixed at from 22s. 6d. to 25s. for adult workers, 25s. per week for youths, and found, or an allowance for rations in lieu of found of from 4s. to 5s. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that that is so. In 1907, some alterations were made. The Minister had a scale prepared, fixing the wage of adults at from 22s. 6d. to 25s. per week, and found; boys, from 10s. to 15s., and found; youths, from 16 to 18 years of age, at from 15s. to £1 per week, and found ; old, infirm, and non-able bodied men, at from 15s. to <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> a week, and found. When we compare those wages with those formerly paid to kanakas, they are princely, but it has to be admitted that improvements are still desirable in connexion with wages conditions in the sugar industry. We have inserted in this  Bill provisions i.1 this respect that will bring it into conformity with those inserted in the Iron Bounty Act. Although Australia has been fairly successful in the sugar industry, it is singular to note that the imports of sugar are still considerable. I have a return which shows that in .1902 there was an importation of 93,100 tons of sugar, valued at ,£1,120,512. The importations dropped, until, in 1907, they were 6,167 tons, valued at ,£77,259. But in 1909, owing to the failure of the crop in Queensland- </para>

                            <para>- We have to consider the operations of the miller and the refiner. We are of opinion that there is still a lack of justice in the terms between the miller, refiner, and grower. Our policy is that, where a monopoly exists, it should be owned by the Government. There is undoubtedly a monopoly in the sugar refining industry of Australia. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company has, undoubtedly, a very big control over the sugar industry. Speaking for myself, I am of opinion that, so long as that monopoly exists, no matter what Acts Parliament may pass, it will rob the .grower of a very great deal of the-, benefit of our legislation. </para>

                            <para>- Even the cooperative and State mills do not fix the prices of sugar, and they are, to some extent, as helpless as the grower himself. It is the Colonial Sugar Refining Company that fixes the prices of sugar. The doubt in my mind, as well as in the minds of many other persons, is that, in view of the price which the public generally are paying -for sugar, the grower is not getting a fair deal. When one considers the enormous price which the public have to pay for sugar in Australia, it is evident that the grower is not getting a fair deal. </para>

                            <para>- I  know that there is a strong agitation for an inquiry into this question. Some people are demanding that the inquiry should be made before these Bills are proceeded with. But the Government take up the position that the sugar-growers of Queensland, New South Wales, and any other part of the Commonwealth, should be given a definite assurance of what their policy will be for the next few years. We think it only reasonable that before they embark further capital in the industry they should have some assurance of stability in the conditions which will apply te it. We say that, so far as the bounty, Excise, and Tariff are concerned, these Bills will give that assurance. But we add that, if the Commonwealth Parliament is endowed with the necessary power, this Government is prepared to exercise it, in order that we may give those engaged in this industry further relief, and we are prepared to say that the business of refining sugar shall not continue to be a monopoly. </para>

We believe that the two Bills we have introduced will deal with the question effectively, so far as we are in a position to do so at the present time. They will give an assurance of stability and permanence of policy, and we hope that the time will come when the people of Australia will endow us with the power to deal effectively with the other matter to which  I  have referred. </para>

                    <para>-  1  am aware of that. As the Minister is anxious that the Bill should be advanced a stage,  I  have no objection to the course proposed.  I  am glad that the Government have recognised the necessity oi taking some action in this matter, and have afforded honorable senators an opportunity to debate the questions involved as fully and as completely as possible.  I  am aware that some time ago it was contemplated that a Royal Commission should be appointed to inquire fully into the whole questions dealt with in these Bills.  I  believe it would have been better if the inquiry had been made before this legislation was proposed. The evidence and report of the Commission would have been of the greatest assistance to honorable senators, and would have enabled them to become fully seized of the. difficulties surrounding the question. We are now called: upon to deal with it in the absence of information which would have been of great value to honorable senators who are not so intimately acquainted with the details of the sugar industry as are the representatives of Queensland. I have noticed also that there is a proposal to anticipate legislation. Certain provisions are contained in a cognate Bill to enable the Minister to withhold the bounty under certain specified conditions. We know that when, in connexion with another Excise Bill, a similar proposal was made, the measure was afterwards claimed to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of the Constitution. I do not see the advantage of proposing legislation which may land us in difficulties, because, even assuming that a proposed amendment of the Constitution should be carried, if this law is passed prior to the amendment, very grave questions affecting its validity may arise. I do not propose to say any more on the subject now, as we can debate the whole question on the second reading of the Sugar Bounty Bill. </para>

                    <para>- - I do not intend to detain the Senate at this stage, because both these Bills can be sufficiently debated on the second reading. I should like, however, to say that the conduct of the Government in this matter justifies very severe comment. On this vexed and important question, affecting the whole of Australia, and one State in particular, and involving a great social and economic policy, we should have had a full and searching inquiry before we were called upon to modify or confirm the policy of the past. We have had the advantage of the operation of our legislation during the past six or seven years, and I consider that it is a blot upon the present administration that we should be asked either to confirm or modify the legislation of the past without the advantage of the light and information upon the subject which might have been afforded us as the result of a searching inquiry into the whole of the questions involved. </para>

It is true that they have not the right to vote; but they have a right to remain in Australia for all time. I should like to know how many of them are in the Commonwealth. If they are here legitimately, they have a right to employment, the same as has everybody else. I would suggest to the Minister that he should communicate with the Queensland Government with a view 1o obtaining the information which I seek. </para>

The matter which I wish to bring under the notice of the Senate is one which concerns the good name of the Commonwealth. It has been the ideal of every member of this Parliament that, in the Commonwealth Service, there should be nothing in the nature of sweating. We have done a good deal towards realizing that idea ; but I am sorry to say that much still remains to be done. Unfortunately, I cannot discover, in the present Postmaster-General, any disposition to proceed further in the direction indicated. </para>

I have had quite a number of communications from officers filling these positions, whose remuneration is the handsome sum of ^78 per annum, -with quarters. That is equivalent to 30s. per week, with house rent. One might almost put it down as the wage of a ploughman. Indeed, there are many ploughmen who are much better paid. The ordinary labourer is in receipt of a better wage. </para>

                        <para>- I am stating facts. I know of one case in which the officer has not only to be on duty from 9 a.m. till 6 p.m., but is also required to work on Sundays. These men have to be expert telegraphists, they have to issue and pay money-orders, and generally to transact the whole business of the particular office in which they are employed. At the very least, they ought to receive the minimum wage of  £110  per annum, instead of which a large number of them receive only <inline font-style="italic">£78</inline> per annum in cash, with free quarters. These free quarters are an imposition, pure and simple. The Commonwealth rents a building from some private individual for which it pays a rental of perhaps 15s. or 20s. per week; and then charges die postmaster rent for occupying a portion of it. I say that it is to the public advantage that the officer should reside in the building ; and, consequently, he should not be charged rental for it. These officers should be paid at least <inline font-style="italic">£110</inline> per annum, which we have declared shall be the minimum wage. </para>

                        <para>- What has that to do with the question? I am sure that the Honorary Minister, as an old Labour agitator, has always claimed that if a man's time is at the beck and call of his employer, he ought to be paid for it. At any rate, I have always claimed that. There is no difference between the attitude which I take up now and that which I assumed when I was not a member of Parliament. I said then that if a man's employer kept him from 6 o'clock in the morning until 6 o'clock in the evening doing nothing, he was entitled to his wages just as if he had been working the whole day. That is the practice which is recognised in quite a number of employments. For example, wharf-labourers are paid waiting time. The officers in charge of these semi-official post-offices are employed from 9 a.m. till 6 p.m. They would not be allowed to engage in any other work. If they did so, . they would immediately lose their positions. Consequently, the Commonwealth is in duty bound to pay them a decent wage. Thirty shillings a week is not sufficient for a man occupying a responsible position - a man who is responsible for the due delivery of the correspondence of, probably, a very considerable population, and through whose hands perhaps hundreds of thousands of pounds pass annually. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. If the Commonwealth establishes a post-office at a certain place, puts a man in charge of it, and demands the whole of his time, it should pay him a living wage, namely, <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 10 per annum. But the principle which obtains in the Service is that the remuneration of these officers depends very largely upon the volume of business transacted by them. I say that that is a false basis. They ought to be paid for the time which they devote to the service of the Government. Thirty shillings per week is not a living wage. It would not be a living wage for any ordinary workmen, much less is it a suitable wage for persons who have to shoulder the responsibility which these officers have to shoulder. </para>

                        <para>- And the result of its investigations is well worth ^8,000. I repeal: that the report of the Commission has only just been made available. A reference to the report will show that the Commission has reported on the matter in such a way as will remove the grievances complained of. It was rather unfair, I think, for the honorable senator to assert that the present Ministry is responsible in any way for the delay which has occurred. It was equally unfair on his part to state that the present Postmaster-General is no more anxious about these matters than was any of his predecessors, and is doing nothing to remedy the grievances that exist. It was also unreasonable for him to contend that it has been possible to act upon the report, or that the present session has afforded an opportunity to take any step in that direction. I believe that it will be acted upon by the present Government as soon as time will permit. A quotation from the report will be a satisfactory reply to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> I can afford to ignore the charge he made against myself and others when he said, " Look at the difference it makes to old-time Labour agitators when they get into Parliament or on to the Government bench," because I feel quite sure that my record will bear very favorable comparison with his own as regards the remedying of grievances when an. opportunity presented itself outside. I doubt very much whether he was ever in a trade union, let alone took the part of an agitator. And as regards the redress of grievances, I think it is only Parliament which has known him in that capacity. I had a very early training in that class of work.

                    <para>Your Commissioners recommend that the principle which should guide the Department in scheduling semi-official offices should be the amount of business transacted, and not on the revenue receipts. Offices that are important as line repairing or repeating stations should not be classed as semi-official. The minimum salary of the person in charge of a semi-official office should be £110 per annum, and a stipulation should be made that messengers employed should not be under 15 years of age, arid should be paid the full amount of salary granted by the Department for this position. Persons engaged in semi-official offices should be permitted to qualify for staff appointments on passing the prescribed examination for appointment as telegraphists. </para>

Post-offices are divided into four classes, namely, receiving offices, allowance offices, semi-official offices, and official offices. When the revenue of an allowance office reaches £200 a year it is made a semi-official office.  When the revenue of a semi-official office reaches £400 a year it is made an official office. It was to the latter class that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> mainly directed his criticisms. I am informed by my colleague that the persons in charge of semi-official offices get an equivalent of the amount which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> desires they should get, namely, £110 per annum.

The reasons for making this special provision as regards coal can be applied as strongly to any other deadweight cargo, such as, for example, ore or wheat ; and, therefore, the Government propose to accept the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I want to know whether that is really so. It is unnecessary to require a ship to adopt the winter load-line if she is going north. There are five or six different load-lines, and under the Board of Trade regulations the load-line is fixed according to the season and the trade in which the ship is engaged. In Australia, the winter season in certain parts of our seas is the calm season. I think that the Government are going against the weight of evidence in fixing the winter load-line for all vessels carrying coal. The evidence goes to show that the load-line should be determined, to some extent, by the season, but also by the nature of the trade. </para>

                    <para>. - There is absolutely no doubt in the minds of shipping people as to what is dead-weight. All cargo that is carried by weight, and not by measurement at  40  cubic feet to the ton, is dead-weight cargo. Wheat, therefore, is dead-weight cargo. I confess that I should have liked this clause to go a good deal further than it does. It might with justice be made much more strict. I have tried in the past to secure an alteration, but the Board of Trade has stood up against me. Let me point out what occurs. Ships load up with wheat in Australia, we will say, in the months of November and December. They load up to the summer mark, being allowed to do so because they load in the summer months. They go round the Horn. It is true that a ship leaving Australia in November or December gets round the Horn in the summer, but when she gets into the western seas she runs alongside ships coming from Montreal and Chicago loaded with exactly the same cargo, though they are only allowed to load up to the winter North Atlantic mark. I shall not present an amendment on the present occasion, because I know that the Board of Trade would be "dead up against" me. I have tried to get an alteration made on two previous occasions. I am not going to block this Bill by an amendment now ; but, if I am spared, and occupy a seat in this Parliament, I shall take an early opportunity of bringing this matter up again at an early date by an amending Bill. </para>

                <para class="block">I think the clause as it stands includes more than we can reasonably expect at the present time. It means that every ship engaged on the Australian coast must be fitted with a wireless telegraphic installation. I have no objection to every passenger ship being so fitted, but the clause in its present form goes rather too far. It would meet all reasonable requirements if the operation of the clause were confined to passenger ships. It has to be remembered that nineteentwentieths of the coasting trade is conducted on the eastern coasts, where there are many lighthouses and settlement is close. Consequently, there is not so much necessity for wireless telegraphy on vessels in that trade as is the case in some other parts. I hope that the Minister will be able to accept my amendment. Every foreign-going ship carrying passengers from Australia should be fitted with wireless telegraphic apparatus. We know that, as a matter of fact, for the safety and convenience of their passengers, nearly all such ships are now supplied with this apparatus. But the reasons which would justify the Government in compelling this to be done in the case of foreign-going vessels show that there is not anything like the same necessity for this provision in the case of nineteen out of every twenty vessels engaged in the coastal trade of Australia. I hope the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - The Government are putting up one or two land stations for wireless telegraphic communication at the present time, and they hope to erect more later, but, for some years, the number of land stations on our coast will necessarily be limited. Obviously, it would be foolish for the Government to impose these conditions generally and indifferently unless there were some means by which a vessel having wireless telegraphic apparatus might communicate with another ship or with the shore. I take it that the regulations will be framed with a knowledge of this fact. On the other point, I ask why we should exempt cargo ships. The lives of the crew and officers of cargo ships are as precious to their friends and the public generally as are the lives of the passengers on a passenger ship, and the property in each case may be said to be equally valuable. The idea is to enable a warning to be given, or an appeal for help to be made, in order that life and property may be saved. One can imagine that where a ship is trading close to the coast, and might easily communicate by signal with the shore, the Minister would not impose this condition, but in the case of ships that go to sea, it may be very necessary for the protection of the lives of crews and passengers, as well as of property, to provide that they should carry wireless telegraphic apparatus. In such cases, the provision ought to be enforced whether the ships carry passengers or not. </para>

Though I shall not press my amendment, it seems to me that nineteen out of every twenty of the ships engaged in our coastal trade would be in a position to communicate with the shore. In North Queensland, we are developing trade with the Gulf ports, and I hope that with the growth of the Commonwealth we shall develop trade with the Northern Territory and the north-west coast of Western Australia. I admit that a comparatively small vessel engaged in that trade might meet with an accident in circumstances in which it would be well if wireless telegraphic communication could be availed of.

                        <para>- I wish to ask the Government to reconsider the matter. We know that where the Mother Country has entered into reciprocal treaties they must be respected, and we might gracefully recognise that by the insertion of the clause referred to. I hope that before we reach the recommittal stage the Government will upon reconsideration take that view. In view of the pressure of business, it would be wrong to delay the passage of this measure unnecessarily, but the provision referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> is an important one, and its omission from this Bill is at least ungraceful. </para>

The appointed clay has therefore passed by, and there is now no reciprocity in this matter. Any foreign ship coming into a British Dominion has to comply with British laws and regulations with respect to load-line. That is a good reason why there is no necessity for the insertion of the clause referred to in this Bill. </para>

It is very desirable that every facility should be provided for trade between Australia and New Zealand. I cannot imagine New Zealand failing to recognise our certificates relating to the adjustment of compasses ; and I think that, in this Bill, we should declare our desire to grant reciprocal treatment to that Dominion. </para>

                        <para>- There is a regular line of vessels, some Australian and others New Zealand, trading between the Commonwealth and the Dominion. It can doubtless be arranged between the Minister of Customs here and the Minister of Navigation there, that the New Zealand authorities shall recognise our certificates, and that we shall recognise theirs. No doubt an arrangement of that kind will be made. But I do not think that we ought to pick out one British Possession and specify it in this Bill. </para>

The Minister has said that he has not the slightest doubt that, if the adjustment of compasses in New Zealand is in accordance with the Board of Trade regulations, and is scientifically accurate, the Commonwealth authorities will recognise certificates issued by the Dominion. In these circumstances, what objection can be urged to my amendment? </para>

                <para class="block">This matter did not receive the attention of the Navigation Commission ; but if I had been called as a witness before that body, I could have given it some striking testimony regarding the need for a provision of this character, as the result of my own personal experience. I was on board a steamer off the Australian coast when, during the course of a heavy gale, the rudder snapped in the post-hole. We immediately found ourselves in a difficulty. The ship had on board a full complement of passengers, and a fair cargo, and there was no means of controlling her. The opinion generally expressed at the time was that, but for the fact that she had yards on her foremast, the vessel would have gone to the bottom. I quite recognise that a number of exercises, such as boat drill and similar obligations which are cast on shipmasters by regulations, have never been observed, and have, fallen into desuetude. I think it is highly necessary to provide for an independent chain connexion to the rudder body, so that in the event of a  similar  accident occurring, the crew could still have command of the ship. Sometimes the chains that are attached to the rudder are rusty, or hang idly down the stern, and there is no means of attaching them, and sometimes they are not connected at all. In the case of a break, such as that which occurred on the ship in which I was employed, it, was very necessary in the interests of the crew and the passengers that an independent chain connexion should be established at once. At the time I referred to, competent seamen expressed the belief that if our ship had not yards on her foremast, to enable her to lay to the wind, she would have foundered very quickly, simply because there was not an independent chain connexion with the rudder, which would have enabled the man at the wheel to control her in the heavy gale which was blowing. We should have been only too glad to have had such a connexion as is provided for in my amendment. We had to wait nearly three or four days in a raging hurricane, because it was most dangerous to out out a boat to establish a connexion, and even when a boat was launched with the greatest possible amount of risk, it had to be kept clear until the sailors could get close enough to the rudder body to attach the chain, and so give command of the rudder to the man at the wheel. I had a very narrow escape on that occasion, and this amendment is submitted with a view to prevent other persons from finding themselves in a like predicament. I feel sure that the Minister can offer no objection to its insertion. </para>

                    <para>.-I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that this clause deals with the loading and discharge of cargo and that his amendment, if made therein, would be somewhat incongruous. The words of the amendment do not actually express what he is aiming at. I was under the impression that what he wanted to provide for was a chain connexion with the wheel; that is. a chain running along the deck. It is certainly open to that construction. </para>

                        <para>- Judging from my observations, most of them have. I suppose that all vessels from 1,000 tons upwards are steered by steam, and have a hand-steering gear which can be brought into use in an emergency. I presume that that is the case with a large proportion of the coasting ships. In that way, double provision is made for controlling a ship. The effect of this amendment will be to impose this precaution on every ship which is engaged in the coasting trade. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not know whether if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> could draft an amendment it might not have the opposite effect to that which he intended. We all know that there are types of people floating around who do the most strange things. If some of these apparently harmless lunatics knew that there was a load of kerosene on board the steamer in which" they were travelling the places which they would choose for having their daily pipe would be the hatches. On land we see people doing remarkable things, and the place of danger is the very place to which they resort. If a passenger wanted to send himself and a few friends to eternity, he would be afforded a splendid opportunity if it were notified that she was carrying gunpowder. Clause 256 empowers the Minister, if he thinks that the carriage of explosive goods will interfere with the comfort and the safety of the passengers, to prohibit them from being sent. That gives sufficient power, I think, to meet the case suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> The shipper has to give notice that he is going to carry dangerous goods, so that the authorities may decide whether to allow them to go by one ship or another. </para>

                    <para>. -This is no laughing matter. Clause 253 enables any seaman or apprentice to decline to go to sea in a ship carrying dangerous goods. We look after the seaman, and surely passengers have a right to know that they are travelling in a perfectly safe ship. It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to say that the Minister has certain powers in regard to the shipping of explosives, "but in practice the Minister knows nothing whatever about these things. He leaves the management to his officers. If a ship comes into a port laden with explosives care is taken to keep her away from the wharfs, and to make her discharge her cargo in a safe place. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. Some people are so nervous that if they knew that a ship was carrying a few pounds of cordite or dynamite they would not go to sea, although it might be as safe to do so as to travel in a Melbourne tramcar.  1  have seen, on some ships, large iron tubes filled with compressed carbonic acid. Being carefully stowed and securely lashed, they were perfectly safe. If they were improperly handled, however, there would be danger of an explosion. Passengers know that the officers will see to it that they are carefully stowed. It is useless to multiply imaginary dangers. There is no precedent for declaring publicly at the ticket-office that dangerous goods are to be carried. Ship-owners incur heavy penalties, if they do not stow their cargo properly. Furthermore, all goods are shipped under the supervision of Government officers. The seamen and officers on a ship are self-compelled watchmen, in their own interests, as well as for the safety of the passengers. </para>

                        <para>- I know a case where a plug of dynamite fell into a blacksmith's tub, and the man lost his life through it. That was at Charters Towers. I know another case where a commercial traveller in New South Wales had a packet of dynamite in his possession. It was not supposed to go off, but he got wet and brought his things into the club-room of an hotel, where there was a fire. Shortly afterwards there was an explosion which blew the hotel to pieces. If dynamite and other explosives are put in a hot place the fumes from the nitro-glycerine will readily cause an explosion. </para>

So we might go on <inline font-style="italic">ad infinitum.</inline> If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has no better amendment to suggest, I would ask him to rely upon those who will have to define what are dangerous goods. If it is necessary to be so careful as the honorable senator suggests, there ought to be a notice at the top of a ship's companionway, " Please do not fall down this ladder." When the honorable senator has been shown how ridiculous his suggestion is, I hope he will not press it. </para>

                        <para>- If honorable senators will make inquiries, they will find that almost the whole of our supplies of explosives are brought here in sailing vessels. I admit that sailing vessels are fast going out of use ; but the Bill provides for such a description of goods when they are being shipped, as will enable those in charge of a vessel to stow any explosives in such a way that they may be carried as safely on board a steamship as on board a sailing ship. In view of the precautions provided for, the Committee should allow the clause to go as it stands. If we are to accept the view of some honorable senators, we should demand that passengers should be notified, in the case of a vessel carrying coal, that it may develop gases which may take fire and lead to an explosion. That is what actually occurred once in Sydney. A vessel called the <inline font-style="italic">Argot,</inline> lying at the side of a dock, laden with coal, had her deck blown into the air, as the result of an explosion. Honorable senators will see that it is, therefore, absolutely dangerous to carry coal in a ship; and if they are not prepared to say that no coal shall be carried in a ship, without a notification to passengers, they should accept the clause as it stands. </para>

                        <para>- Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> can move to amend the amendment. I desire that when a passenger makes his contract with a shipping company he shall do so in the full knowledge that the company proposes to carry dangerous goods on board the ship in which he wishes to travel. Honorable senators have tried to be witty in connexion with this matter, but really it is one of some consequence. We hedge about the handling of explosives on shore with a great many precautions. There are magazines established in the neighbourhood of almost every town where explosives are stored, and access to them is permitted only to certain individuals. Some passengers might not care to travel on a vessel that is carrying dangerous goods. </para>

Though, in some cases, man has some control to prevent a shipwreck, in many instances shipwrecks are beyond the control of man, and are regarded as the act of God. I should not care to travel in a railway compartment with a case of dynamite, or a few kegs  of  gunpowder. If I knew such explosives were in the compartment, I should change to another if I did not decide to leave the train altogether. I should have that much respect for my own skin. I hope the Committee will agree to the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- We know that a large number of harmless commodities have been responsible for accidents at sea. It is a well-known fact that numerous fires have resulted from wet wool. Spontaneous combustion may occur in the case of quite a number of articles. I would further point out that if we are going to specify what are " dangerous goods," so far as cargo is concerned, it is equally incumbent upon us to specify who are dangerous persons. We might specify such articles as vitriol, benzine, <inline font-style="italic">aqua fortis,</inline> and explosives as " dangerous goods." But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has not taken the trouble to indicate a single article which he regards as coming within that category. He has asked the Committee - probably without a moment's consideration - to make an amendment in the clause. Doubtless, he feels that having remained silent for half-an-hour he must do something. He has urged no reason why his amendment should be adopted, and, in such circumstances, it is altogether ridiculous to expect a deliberative assembly to accept it. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Clause  250  provides that " dangerous goods " means goods which have been declared by proclamation to be dangerous. It is only to such goods that the amendment would apply. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie asks an honorable senator to come here possessed of all the knowledge of a Customs officer, he is asking an impossibility. The marginal note to clause  253  reads, " right to decline to sail in ships carrying dangerous goods." Why do not the Government specify what are "dangerous goods" there? If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> amendment be a ridiculous one, clause  253  is equally ridiculous, inasmuch as it does not specify what are " dangerous goods." If it be right to allow a seaman or apprentice an opportunity of declining to proceed to sea in a ship carrying " dangerous goods," it is equally right that a passenger who has paid his fare should be afforded a similar opportunity. </para>

                        <para>- If I have offended the honorable senator by saying that he used the word " coal," I withdraw that word and substitute the word "gas." Until we reach that period of civilization when vessels can be propelled by means other than coal, I contend that the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> and supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline> is absurd, because it would necessitate the posting of a notice at the head of her gangway or at the booking-office that coal was on board the ship. Neither honorable senator has refuted any of the arguments adduced. I hope that the amendment will be rejected. </para>

                    <para>. - It is not at all likely that coal will be proclaimed to be dangerous, and, therefore, it need not be referred to in connexion with this clause. In my opinion, the amendment does not go far enough. Suppose that a passenger leaves Australia for London on a steamer on which there is a proclamation that no dangerous goods are on board, and such goods are shipped on her arrival at Capetown. What is to become of the poor passenger? I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> ought to propose either that the passenger should be returned to his port of embarkation or that the steamer's owners must pay his passage to London in a vessel which is not carrying dangerous goods. I am afraid that the poor passenger is likely to be left stranded somewhere. An amendment of this kind, if it is to be made, ought to be complete. For instance, it ought to empower a passenger to claim his passage money if he finds that some dangerous goods are on board. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> will endeavour to make thorough provision for securing the safety of passengers. I do not know why this amendment ought to be confined to dangerous goods. There- may be dangerous passengers on a steamer. </para>

They have not yet told us what they intend to proclaim as dangerous commodities. They have made no reference to the matter, so that we are practically left in the dark. Are we going to pass the clause without the Government signifying whether they intend to accept the amendment or not?

I never mentioned coal as one of the dangerous articles, and the references that have been made to that commodity do not affect my argument. I hope that the Minister will see his way to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> amendment. Otherwise we have no hope of carrying it. I shall not discuss the various goods that might be combustible, but remembering that the next clause provides that seamen and apprentices may leave a ship if there is combustible material on board, the least we can do is to give passengers an opportunity to leave if they do not think it safe to travel. </para>

                    <para>. - I have given further consideration to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> amendment, and am still of opinion that the clause as it stands gives all the protection to passengers that is requisite. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> seemed to think that I was joking when I stated that the insertion of such a provision might cause an individual to do something to the detriment of his fellow passengers. But I was never more serious in my life. I really think that the knowledge that there were dangerous goods on board might suggest to some person to do things which were dangerous to themselves and to the other passengers. We have all heard of cases where persons supposed to be sane have committed rash acts, regardless of consequences. The best protection we can give to passengers is to intrust the authorities with full power to deal with explosives and dangerous goods, and to prevent their being shipped except under proper conditions. Merely to indicate that dangerous goods were on board, might needlessly alarm the passengers, and, perhaps, cause some not to travel by the ship. The shipping companies are not too anxious to carry explosives, and charge higher freights for them, even though they may be perfectly safe. Some time ago the Defence Department wished to send some shell from one State to another. They were absolutely harmless, lt was impossible to explode one of them unless a certain mechanism was fitted, and they were fired from a gun. But, though we were prepared to pay an unusually high freight, we experienced difficulty in getting a ship to take the goods. Eventually we had to charter a sailing vessel for the purpose. Another source of protection is that ali ships are insured, and the underwriters employ agents who keep their eyes open as to the class of goods carried on board ships. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator forgets that a crew has to travel with a ship on which dangerous goods are allowed to be placed. The officials administering this measure would not allow such goods to be placed on ships carrying passengers. Inasmuch, however, as they can be placed on other ships, it is only right to give the members of a crew an opportunity of leaving. First of all, dangerous goods will be proclaimed"; and, secondly, the person sending dangerous goods has to give notice in writing that he is sending them. Those are two safeguards. Furthermore, clause 256 provides, that, if, in the opinion of the Minister, the carriage of any particular cargo would endanger the safety of a ship or interfere with the comfort of the passengers, he may prohibit its carriage. In view of there precautions, I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> to withdraw the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. -While every care has been taken in this Bill to protect seamen who may desire to leave a ship upon which dangerous goods are carried, no concern whatever has been displayed for the passengers. Several honorable senators have complained that I have not defined what dangerous goods are. It is no part of my business to do so. It is left to the Government to issue a proclamation stating what goods are dangerous. All that I desire is that an opportunity shall be given to passengers not to travel by a ship carrying dangerous goods, if they do not feel disposed to do so. The Minister has referred me to clause 256 ; but if we had a Government in power which was favorable to shipping companies, the probability is that that provision would not be enforced, and vessels would be allowed to carry dangerous goods as often as they pleased. </para>

                    <para>. - I believe that there is no precedent for clause 253 in this form. I suggest to the Minister that, if he desires to retain it in the Bill, and to secure the effect intended, it should be placed after clause 254. As it stands, a seaman or apprentice might decline to go to sea simply by declaring that there were dangerous goods on board. </para>

                        <para>- Clause 254 contemplates that, if the owner or master carries dangerous goods,  they may be forfeited; and I presume that the meaning is that if a seaman or apprentice knows that such goods are being carried in contravention of the law, he may be allowed to walk ashore and claim' his discharge. I suggest the transposition of the two clauses, making clause 254 come before clause 253; and then we should, I think, insert in clause 253 the stipulation " on satisfactory proof of such contravention shall, if he so requests, be entitled to his discharge." </para>

                    <para>. - I think the honorable senator is making a mistake. If this clause were inserted after clause 254, there would be nothing for the seamen to leave the ship for, because, under that clause, an Admiralty Court might have ordered the destruction of the dangerous goods. I take the case of a seaman signing articles in Great Britain on a ship voyaging to Australia <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> South Africa. There is no stipulation in the articles that the ship may carry dangerous cargo, but when she reaches South Africa she takes in a cargo including dangerous goods. I say that in that case it is right that any seaman should be in a position to say, "I am not prepared to risk my life on a vessel carrying dangerous goods, and I want my discharge." Of course, if, in the first instance, the seaman signed articles with a knowledge that dangerous goods might be carried on board the ship, he could not break his articles. In the Merchant Shipping Act dangerous goods include gunpowder, benzine, lucifer matches, nitro-glycerine, and any explosives within the meaning of the Explosives Act of 1885. If a man is asked to sign articles on a ship that is going to carry any of these dangerous goods, it is a matter of bargaining for wages. The seaman would say that if he was expected to run such risks he must get more wages. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has said that most of our supplies of explosives are brought here by sailing ships, but, as a matter of fact, most of the explosives imported now for the Broken Hill and other mines are brought from South Africa in a special steamer continuously employed for the purpose by the South African Explosives Company. We had reason to know that in Adelaide a few weeks ago, when the vessel, with 250 tons of dynamite on board, was found to be on fire, and a very little concussion would have resulted in a disastrous explosion. I think this clause is a good one, and that it is in its proper place in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- There need be no trouble about it at all. For instance, a man's articles may stipulate for a voyage from London to Australia, Australia to New Zealand, and back to London. When the ship reaches Australia, instead of continuing the voyage to New Zealand, it may be proposed that she shall go to China, and the seaman has then the right to leave the ship, because she would not be going where he stipulated to go under his contract. The position would be exactly the same under this clause if a seaman had not agreed to serve on a vessel carrying explosives. </para>

                    <para>. - I understood <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> to say that if a ship left England for Australia, and calling at South Africa, took in a cargo, including explosives, the seamen would be able to walk ashore. Surely the honorable senator does not think that our law would apply in that case? Under this provision the seamen could only leave the ship when it arrived in Australia. If we pass laws like this, we shall be very likely to get into trouble. I say that a Bill containing such a provision is likely to be reserved for the Royal assent. If we provide that seamen engaging on a British ship may, on its arrival in Australia, leave the vessel for one pretext and another, the Imperial authorities will veto the measure. </para>

                        <para>- I do not find fault with the honorable senator for making a mistake, because we all make mistakes. I take the case of a German ship loading at Hamburg, a port from which a great quantity of dynamite, lithofracteur, and other explosives used in mining, is exported. The crew sign articles at Hamburg for a voyage to Australian ports, and does the Minister mean to tell me that, under our law, they would be able to break their agreements if explosives were carried on the ship? If that be so, we may find Australian ships, when they get outside of Australian waters, taken in hand by the authorities of some foreign nation that will take no notice of our law. What are we to do in such a case, are we to declare war ? This kind of legislation is only inviting retaliation by other nations. I wish to see the Bill pass in such a way that there will be no difficulty in securing the Royal assent to it. If the Minister thinks this clause satisfactory, I shall not divide the Committee upon it; but the Government must accept the responsibility for it. </para>

                        <para>- I pointed out on a previous occasion that only half the seamen are in the forecastle quarters simultaneously. I would remind the Committee that, whereas the crew of a vessel are in daily intercourse with each other, the passengers are mostly strangers to each other. It is wrong to jamb eight or ten passengers into a cabin in a confined space. A man may be travelling from one port to another who is afflicted with a serious complaint, and he may be placed in a cabin with eight or ten other passengers. I have known persons who were suffering from contagious diseases, such as consumption, to be huddled in a stifling cabin in the tropics, with insufficient air-space. I think that the amendment is a reasonable one, and I ask the Committee to accept it. </para>

                        <para>- Of course it may. But it is not advisable to attempt to overcome it in the Bill itself, because <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> making the attempt we should probably tie our hands in some other direction. It is much better that we should leave matters of detail to the regulations. The honorable senator draws a parallel between this accommodation and that provided for seamen ; but the two things are quite distinct. On many ships, where passengers never use the cabins, the seamen have to live, and there is a reason why a hard-and-fast rule should be laid down in that case. The honorable senator ought, to understand that the Government will not give to passengers less accommodation than is allowed to the crew. The amendment is not complete in itself. A few more regulations will require to be put in the Bill, if it is carried, in order to meet the case. I ask the Committee not to accept it. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister has adopted his usual method of dealing with an amendment from this side. On this occasion we are met with a very peculiar argument, but it was not used by the honorable senator when he pointed out that it might be inadvisable to require 140 cubic feet of air space for each member of the crew and each apprentice. My amendment, if carried) will not curtail his hands at all. He can make as many alterations as he thinks fit to suit the various classes of ships; but he cannot give a passenger less than 140 cubic feet of air space. It is very peculiar that he should object to the proposal. Perhaps he does so because it comes from this side. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps  1  have made a mistake, and, if so, I am sorry. I shall not ask the honorable senator to interfere with any regulations which he may choose to make. Although he admits that it is not likely that any Minister will give less than 140 cubic feet of air space to a passenger, still he refuses to make such a provision in the Bill. It is another case of government by regulation. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> moved the previous amendment, the Minister did not say that its subject-matter should be dealt with by regulation, and that an attempt was being made to tie the hands of the Government. But when I ask that a similar provision for passengers shall be put in the Bill, he immediately says mat it is inadvisable to do so. One thing is prescribed in the Bill, and the other is to be dealt with by regulation. I am not asking that the regulations shall he framed now, but that they shall provide for that amount of air space to. each passenger. The Minister is dealing with the amendment very harshly. Surely the Senate ought to be allowed to exercise some control over the subject-matter of the regulations. Are we to be governed by regulations when it suits the Minister, and by a provision in the measure in other cases? i do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> wishes to leave a loophole for another Minister, if not for himself, to make a regulation which will give a passenger less than 140 cubic feet of air space. I submit that it is as reasonable to make this provision in respect of passengers as it was to prescribe the accommodation for the officers and crew. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that the Committee will act very inconsistently if it rejects the amendment, for many hours we fought the proposal to give 140 cubic feet of air space to an officer. That was a new provision allowing more space to an officer than is allowed in any other country. We ought at least to have as much consideration for those who find the money to work the ships as for those who work on them. Moreover, the passengers will all be in their berths at the one time; but only one-half of the officers and crew will be in their berths at a time. I shall certainly support the amendment. </para>

I told the honorable senator that I was prepared to consider any amendment in connexion with that clause, not that I would support it. Was I likely to pledge myself then to something which had not been drafted? Does the honorable senator expect that ships which are not sea-going are likely to provide this amount of accommodation ? If we make this amendment, the Government will have to frame a regulation requiring 140 cubic feet of air space per passenger and four-berth cabins in every ship afloat. </para>

I am of opinion that the passengers who avail' themselves of travelling facilities on the Australian coast have good reason to be content with the accommodation provided for them, although I am well aware that in many instances it is less than 120 cubic feet. I have travelled in coastal-trade vessels, where I have been very comfortable, and very well attended to, but where the cubic space was considerably less than 120 feet; yet I suffered no personal inconvenience. I believe that the amendment will undoubtedly hamper trade without conferring any corresponding advantage. I intend, therefore, to support the Government, and to leave the matter to regulation. </para>

It would do nothing of the kind. The clause itself provides that the regulations may prescribe any things necessary or convenient to be done for the  carriage oof  passengers generally, and particularly in respect to the matters enumerated. All that Senatorayers' amendment would do would be to lay down a specific condition with regard to vessels making voyages in excess of 300 miles. That would be the only limitation on the power of the Government to make regulations. Consequently, the class of vessels mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> would be completely subject to regulation. Honorable senators ought, at any rate, to vote on the amendment with a clear conception of what we are doing, and should not be misled by such a statement as we have had from the Honorary Minister. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment does not hamper the Government, even as I have amended it at the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> ; because they can make any regulations they please to provide for passengers an air space greater than 140 cubic feet. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie labours under the same delusion as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .Findley</inline> .does, when he says that the amendment would interfere with the passenger trade between Sydney and Newcastle. My proposal, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has pointed out, would not in- the slightest degree limit the power of the Government to make regulations affecting that trade. But I do desire that passengers who are likely to be more than a night at sea should have at least as much accommodation as is provided for seamen. I think it only reasonable that they should have at least 140 cubic feet of space provided for them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger informs us that he has often been satisfied with less than  tso  cubic feet- I have occasionally travelled on a boat where such limited accommodation was provided, but I have never been satisfied with it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger might be satisfied with 50 cubic feet of space, but I am not, and I do not think that ordinary passengers are. The Government may be of the same opinion as their new supporter, and, if so. they will. I suppose, succeed in defeating my amendment. We have had some peculiar examples of political conduct lately. We have had members of the Labour party denounced by Labour Ministers because of their utterances, and now we have a new recruit added to that party in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger.  His  support of the Government is something of a novelty. Of course, they want a lawyer over there, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger may be able to assist them in the drafting of their Bills. I am getting rather suspicious of this change of front. I hope, however, that the Government are not of the same opinion as their legal adviser, and that, after all, they will accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - It has been brought under my notice that shipping companies are attempting to contract themselves out of every obligation which has been imposed upon them either by an Act of Parliament or by the common law of the country. When a passenger wishes to take out a ticket, he is asked to sign the conditions. I know of one member of the Senate who states that when he refused to sign the shipping company told him that, unless he did so, he would not be given the ticket. I think there should be some provision included in this Bill to meet this sort of bluff on the part of steam-ship companies. I do not know exactly what ought to be done, but the Government ought to see to it, because I refer to a serious grievance, and some effort should be made in this measure to remedy it. </para>

If anything, the clause safeguards the rights of passengers.

I admit that the point raised is' an important one, and I shall be glad if honorable senators will make representations to me on the matter. I shall pass them on to the Attorney-General, with  a  view of having some provision drafted  which will meet the difficulty, if it is not already met by the Bill.

There may be some discussion of the manning scale when we come to consider the schedules. If the Minister will agree to my request, I give him my assurance that I shall do all I can to see that rapid progress is made with the rest of the Bill. This clause raises a very big constitutional question, and one which I should like to approach fresh and prepared.

(2.) The receiver may, if he thinks fit, receive the amount, and shall grant to the person paying it a certificate of the amount paid and of the services in respect of which it is paid, and that certificate shall be a full discharge and indemnity to the person by whom the money is paid, and to his ship, cargo, equipment, and effects, against the claims of all persons in respect of the services mentioned in the certificate.  (3.)  The receiver shall distribute any amount received by him under this section among the persons entitled to it on such evidence and in such proportions as he thinks fit, and may retain the share of any person who is absent. (4.) Any such distribution shall be final and conclusive as against all persons claiming to be entitled to any portion of the amount distributed. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause provides that where salvage of less than£1,000 is payable, the receiver shall distribute it amongst those who are entitled to it, as he may think fit ; and the next clause provides that where salvage amounting to more than£1,000 is payable, it shall be distributed by a Court of competent jurisdiction. My own idea is that all claims should be settled by a Court, and not by an individual. Subclauses 3 and 4 should, therefore, be omitted. I move - </para>
