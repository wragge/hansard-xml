            <para class="block">I have taken this course because the establishment of wireless telegraphy in Australia is a very serious matter, and one which is entitled to the fullest discussion. I am aware that a debate upon this question took place in the other Chamber yesterday, and that, consequently, it may seem superfluous to discuss it again to-day. But the chief feature of the debate in the other branch of the Legislature was the pathetic way in which the present Postmaster-General attempted to whitewash his predecessor, and the equally generous way in which the ex-Postmaster-General endeavoured, to whitewash his successor. Each loudly declared that if in office he would have done precisely what the other did. I say that if neither of them can do better, the sooner both are wiped out of public life the better. Such a disgraceful mess as has occurred in connexion with the contracts for the erection of wireless telegraph stations in Australia has no parallel in our history. Here is an important matter, which has been under the consideration of the Commonwealth authorities for the past six years. Tenders were called for the establishment of two wireless telegraph stations in Australia, and the contracts were let on the 4th April last - over seven months ago. Yet neither the contracts nor the guarantees in connexion with them have been signed. </para>

                No. I am merely pointing out the position as it exists to-day. I am free to confess that, under ordinary circumstances, there might be some excuse for such a complete mess being made of an important public contract - a mess which might extend over a month or two. But the present deplorable muddle has continued for seven months, and it is no nearer being cleared up now than it was when the contracts were entered into. I think, too, that when honorable senators ask the Government for information on matters of public importance, the information should be supplied, to them fully and frankly. Last Thursday I asked the Minister representing the Postmaster-General for certain information in regard to this question, and replies to my questions were given by the Honorary Minister. Yesterday I asked further questions, and received further replies. But the replies which were furnished yesterday were a complete contradiction of those which were furnished to me last Thursday. The answers given in another place were also a complete contradiction of the answers supplied to me last Thursday. I claim that when honorable senators ask for information the Government ought not to supply it in the most disingenuous way. I am quite aware that Ministers merely read out the replies which are furnished to them by departmental heads. But it does not matter who is responsible for those replies - my complaint is just as grievous.

                I will come to that aspect of the question presently, if the honorable senator will allow me to proceed in my own way, as my time is limited. On Thursday last I asked particularly if it was not a fact that the Marconi wireless telegraph system was adopted by the British Admiralty, and that that system was installed on the ships of the British Navy. I was assured by the Honorary Minister that it was not a fact, and that the system installed upon those vessels was an entirely different one. I accepted the replies in good faith.

            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GIVENS.</inline>
                - Certainly. I asked -
            </para>
            <para>Is it not a fact that the vessels of the British squadron stationed in Australia and also the Australian torpedo boats, are fitted with the Marconi wireless system? </para>
            <para>The reply given was - </para>
            <para>The ships of the British squadron stationed in Australia are understood to be fitted with the special Admiralty system of wireless, which is not identical with the Marconi. The Australian torpedo boats are being fitted with wireless apparatus by the Marconi Company'. </para>
            <para>As a matter of fact, the ships of the British Squadron aras fitted with the Marconi system, though a slight modification of it may be adopted by the Admiralty, to suit the exigencies of the Naval Service. But the British Admiralty are paying the Marconi Company several thousands of pounds annually. for the use of the Marconi system. I repeat that I accepted the Minister's reply in good faith, and no doubt he thought that it was absolutely accurate. But it was not. Honorable senators have a right to complain when they are supplied with inaccurate information, because such information does not permit of them arriving at proper conclusions upon any public matter. I also asked whether Admiral Poore had been consulted upon the question of the wireless system to be installed in Australia., and whether he had offered certain advice. In reply, I was coolly told that he had not been consulted, and that no advice had been obtained from him. The reply was - </para>
            <para>No. Admiral Poore. personally was not consulted. The Admiralty, however, was consulted, and nominated the officer then in charge of wireless for the squadron to act as member of  a  Conference which considered the tenders. It was on the advice of this Conference that the tender for the Telefunken system was accepted. </para>
            <para class="block">I was quite prepared to believe the statement that Admiral Poore had never offered an opinion upon this question, and yet I was told, in answer to a question which I asked yesterday, that he had offered a very decided opinion. In such circumstances, what am I to believe? Yesterday I asked - </para>
            <para>Is it not a fact that Admiral Poore expressed a decided preference in favour of the Marconi wireless system as against the Telefunken? </para>
            <para class="block">The reply given was - </para>
            <para>No. Admiral Poore, however, before tenders for the Sydney and Fremantle stations were received, advised that from a strategical point of view Marconi's installation should be fitted,- as, owing tq the existing contract with the Marconi Company, H.M. ships would not be able to communicate with the shore stations or carry out any trials with a view to testing the installations if any other system were adopted ; but in a subsequent communication Admiral Poore advised that the Admiralty were released from the obligation against inter-communication with stations fitted with other than Marconi apparatus, and that the restrictions on H.M. ships from communicating with or carrying out trials with any shore stations fitted with apparatus other than Marconi will, therefore, no longer apply. </para>
            <para>In another communication the Admiralty advised that, subject to the system selected being able readily to communicate with H.M. ships and to inter-communicate with any other system in use, the Commonwealth may adopt what system they please, and need not confine themselves to any one system exclusively. </para>
            <para class="block">So that upon their own showing the replies furnished by the Government on Thursday last were absolutely incorrect. It is a matter for regret that when honorable senators ask  for information on matters of public importance they are not supplied with full and frank replies. It is quite true that an answer may be technically correct from the stand-point of the wording of a question. But I would point out that an honorable senator would require to know what is the actual position to be able to frame a question which could not be evaded. </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline>

                It is obvious that if the contracts for the erection of wireless telegraph stations in Australia were let on the 4th April last, the present Government cannot be blamed for having entered into those contracts. But I fail to see how they can escape censure for having permitted the existing muddle to continue during the six months that they have been, in office. The sooner that muddle is cleared up the better. _ But how did the muddle occur? The Government practically invited tenders to all and sundry for the erection of wireless telegraph stations, but they never took any steps to enforce the conditions of tender. The' result is that to-day we find ourselves in this position : A contract was let seven months ago, but we are no nearer to a settlement, and to the establishment of wireless telegraphy in Australia, than we were before. Every civilized country in the world has installed a wireless system in some shape or other. We have had two torpedo-boat destroyers built for the Commonwealth service. There are installations of wireless telegraphy on those vessels. What is the use of the installations on our ships at sea whilst we have no stations on shore to receive messages from them? It is absolutely useless to have the installations on the destroyers under those circumstances. The British Admiralty have erected wireless telegraph apparatus on all their stations in every part of the world. Vet we in Australia are lagging so much behind. In Canada, where there is a population somewhat similar to our own, and where practically the same conditions apply, there are thirty wireless telegraph stations. Yet -we have not a single one, and the only attempt we have made has landed us in a complete muddle. As far as my information goes - that is to say, as far as I am able to make my information public; because I am in possession of certain confidential information which I cannot use - I believe that a sort of ephemeral company was formed in Australia, called the Australian Wireless Company Limited. It was formed for the purpose of exploiting the needs of the Common wealth for the erection of wireless telegraph stations. It was a well- known fact that, as far as the company was concerned, it had neither the experience nor the capital, nor any other qualification, for engaging in the work.

                - The company was formed with a total capital of .£5,000, but my information is that only £300 of that was paid up. However, by a subsequent resolution the company, at a meeting held this year, increased its capital to £12,000. That is the nominal capital, but how much of that large sum has been paid up I am unable to say. Whatever the real capital may be, however, the company has never attempted to do anything to carry out its contract. The only thing it has succeeded in doing so far, is to get from the Commonwealth Government an advance of 50 per cent, on the original contract for carrying out one station ; and the probability is that the company will be able to put a pistol at the head of the Commonwealth Government to get another 50 per cent, advance for the carrying out of the other station. The question arises as to whether the company will be able to carry out its contract at all; or whether, if the contract was carried out, it would be of any. use to us.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GIVENS.</inline>
                - The company has increased its price 50 per cent. The company offered the Telefunken system to the Government at £4,150 for each station. The tender price for the Marconi ' system was somewhere about £19,000 for each station, but the Government apparently never inquired as to the value that they were to get for each of those two offers. The Marconi Company offered its complete invention, which is protected by patents in every part of the world except in Germany. The company' offered its full patent rights to the Commonwealth to be worked in every part of Australia.

            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GIVENS.</inline>
                - Yes ; under the conditions of tender the Marconi Company were offering to the Commonwealth Government all their patent rights. But the Telefunken Company were giving nothing at all, because they had no patent rights outside Germany. In Germany the Marconi system is not fully protected, and the consequence is that the Telefunken Company has practically pirated a great deal of the Marconi Company's patents.

            </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GIVENS.</inline>
                - Not in Germany. The Marconi Company's inventions are  patented all over the world, but for one reason or another its rights are not fully protected in Germany, and  the Telefunken Company has practically raided the Marconi Company with respect to a certain portion' of its patents in that country! The consequence is that, were the Telefunken Company's system to be established in Australia, the Commonwealth Government would be practically liable for infringement of the Marconi Company's rights, because this Telefunken Company, according to' all we can learn, would have only
                <inline font-style="italic">£300</inline>
                of paid-up capital, and we should be left stranded. Surely the fact that the Marconi Company was offering to us the full rights 'over its patents in Australia should have been taken into consideration in the letting of the contract. Again, we were told by the Minister that at least 40 per cent, of the wireless systems of the world are under the Telefunken system. I should like to know where the Government got that information from. I have before me a list of no fewer than forty-one of the greatest steam-ship companies in the world, the vessels of every one of which are fitted with the Marconi system. All the vessels crossing the Atlantic, and all those trading to Australia, are fitted with the Marconi system, with the exception of the German mail-boats. All the important Admiralty stations in the civilized world are using the Marconi system. The same system is in use by Canada, by. the United States, by Belgium, by Italy, by Chili, by the Argentine Republic, and by numberless other countries. From what source, then, did the Minister get the fact, alleged by him to be correct, that 40 per cent, of the wireless systems of the world are under the Telefunken system? Will the Minister give us a list? It appears that Ministers are merely trying to shelter themselves behind a general statement, and to obscure the fact that a very great mistake has been made," for. which, however, I do not entirely blame the present Government, who are not wholly responsible. It is also a fact, which I have on the best authority, that out of every nine messages received from ships crossing the Atlantic eight are sent under the Marconi system. Yet we are told that it is advisable for Australia to adopt the Telefunken system.  Surely the reasons given are totally insufficient.

                The honorable senator talks about monopoly. The Marconi Company would have had no monopoly. They offered to sell to the Commonwealth Government all their patent rights for something like a reasonable and fair sum, and to give us a service which Australia would have used in common with all the other civilized countries of the world. I maintain that we ought not to be satisfied with anything less than the best.

            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline>
                Millen. -  The very fact that the German Government have accepted the Telefunken system for use in the German Navy might be a very good reason why we should not adopt it.
            </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GIVENS.-</inline>
                That strikes me as being a very reasonable remark. I asked the Government whether it was not a fact that the Telefunken system was essentially a short-range system, whilst the Marconi system was the only one which could be used for very long ranges - for distances over 1,200 miles, as specified in the contract. The Minister assured me that the Telefunken system was quite as capable of sending wireless messages over very long distances as the Marconi system. My information is, however, that the Telefunken system, as was insinuated in my question, is essentially a short-range system, and that the Marconi system is the only one which is efficient for very long ranges.

The conditions were that the stations erected should be capable pf sending messages over  1,200  miles in any conditions of weather, and should also be capable of receiving messages in any weather conditions. As a matter of fact, there is no wireless system yet invented which can guarantee to receive messages over a distance of even  5  miles in all weathers; because the electrical disturbances at certain times are such that it is not possible to send wireless messages at all until the weather clears up. It is not possible to guarantee to send or receive wireless messages during thunder storms. But these people came forward and put in a tender which was very low compared with the tender of the Marconi Company. If the company were really a
                <inline font-style="italic">bonâ fide</inline>
                concern, why was the tender so very low? The answer is plain on the face of the thing. The tenders were issued for two stations only ; whereas it is a matter of notorious fact that if the Commonwealth of Australia is to be efficiently and well served with wireless telegraph stations, it must have at least twenty or thirty stations by-and-by. The company in question, therefore, tendered a very low price because they said to themselves, " Once we get these stations established under our system, the Commonwealth will have to pay whatever price we like for other stations, because the Commonwealth will be compelled to have a uniform wireless system all over Australia."

                - The company could not have had the Commonwealth Government in a hole if the Government had kept their eyes open, and had gone about this matter in a business-like manner. The proper way to settle a matter of this kind would have been for the Commonwealth to take the right to establish other stations at not more than  25  per cent. advance on the price for the establishment of the stations for which the tenders were accepted. Then the Commonwealth could have proceeded to construct as many more stations as it liked.

                In the limited time at my disposal I cannot go into this matter at length. I have no desire to put the Government to any inconvenience or to make capital for any political party or individual out of it, but I say that the matter is of so much importance that it should command the attention of this House, and particularly of the Government, at the earliest possible moment. It is on the face of it a ridiculous state of affairs that a contract let seven months ago has not yet been signed, and that there is no possibility of it being signed in the near future, or of our being able to get out of the mess without severe loss. If the Commonwealth is to suffer a loss in connexion with this matter we had better submit to it straight away rather than delay the establishment of wireless telegraphy, which is a public convenience in every civilized country to-day. It is useless, apparently, for us to go on with a contract like that now under consideration. The trouble seems to have arisen from the fact that, in the first instance, the Commonwealth authorities did not know exactly what they wanted or where wireless stations should be established, nor did they know which was the best system to adopt, and they had no persons here competent to advise them in the matter with the exception of the officers of the Australian Squadron. In the circumstances, it is passing strange that the decided expression of opinion by Admiral Poore in favour of the adoption of the Marconi system was not acted upon, especially in view of the fact that the two Australian torpedo-boat destroyers now in our waters are fitted with that system. Wireless communication can only be made between the two systems with great difficulty, in spite of the assurance of the Minister to the contrary. There is a legal difficulty in the way also, since the Marconi people object to the use of their system to communicate with stations in which the Telefunken system is installed, except in cases where such communication is necessary to relieve actual distress. It should not be forgotten that the Commonwealth vessels in which the Marconi system is installed will suffer from that limitation. Inall the circumstances we are entitled to a full explanation of the whole matter. It will require a good deal of explanation to satisfy any one why a contract let over seven months ago has not yet been signed, and we have no guarantee for the due performance of its conditions. I should like to know why such loose conditions and specifications were agreed to when the contract was let. I hope the Government will be able to give the information asked for, and that honorable senators will express a decided opinion in favour of having this very important matter cleared up.

                If the honorable senator will bear with me for a moment he will find that the reply will be given. There is nothing to conceal in connexion with this matter. The responsibility for the acceptance of the tender does not rest upon the present Government, since it was accepted by the previous Administration. Five tenders were received, and that of the Australian company for  £4,150  was accepted. The tender of the Marconi Company was for  £19,050.

                - There are reasons for the delay in signing the contract. The Defence Department and the Admiralty were consulted before tenders were called. The Defence Department authorities agreed to the insertion in the contract of certain sites for wireless stations. When the tenders were received the Defence Department and Admiralty authorities dealt with them, and at their Conference no question as to the establishment of an inland site was raised. Later on, when the actual location of the site for the establishment came on for consideration, the Defence Department and Admiralty authorities stipulated for an inland station, and that was a departure from the original terms of the contract.

Some difficulty has arisen with respect to the site to be selected in Western Australia. The Admiralty and Defence - authorities have been at variance in regard to a suitable site there. The blame for delay, it will be seen, does not rest upon the contractors, nor altogether upon the Postmaster-General's Department. I feel sure that every member of the Senate desires that the most suitable site in Australia shall be selected for the installation of this most necessary system. After all, the delay of a month or two is preferable to proceeding with the erection, of these wireless stations on sites which may  afterwards be found to be altogether unsuitable.

All the main centres in Russia are fitted with this system, but I have not complete information as to the places in which it has been adopted. I wish to repeat that the responsibility for the acceptance of the tender does not rest with the present Government, because it was accepted by the last Administration, and if any unnecessary delay has taken place it is not due to any fault on the part of the Postmaster-General's Department. There have been differences of opinion on the part of the Admiralty and the Defence Department. So far as I can gather, the successful tenderers are disposed now, and have been disposed since the acceptance of their tender, to proceed with the works, and carry out the conditions specified. But owing to the site being taken outside the specified area, difficulties have arisen in respect to Sydney nnd Fremantle. The difficulty in regard to the Pennant Hills has been removed. The contract is being proceeded with, and it is hoped that it will be completed within a very short time.

                (New South Wales) [3.19] - I venture to assert that nothing which has been said in this debate, and nothing which is likely to be said, can constitute such a caustic indictment of the officers of two Departments as did the reply of the Honorary Minister. In the first place, I wish to indorse
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens'</inline>
                complaint in regard to replies which are furnished to the Senate. There is a practice for officers of Departments to take advantage of, perhaps, an ill-chosen word, the purpose of which is obvious enough, to give either a partial reply, or one which, in the circumstances, is misleading. Every honorable senator can recollect that a question has been asked, the meaning of which has been obvious, and that the reply which was put in the mouth of the Minister, and which took advantage of the phrasing in the question, caused a laugh. Why?

I can only appeal to the Senate, which knows that what I am saying is correct, that more than once laughter has greeted the reply to a question. Why? Because it was recognised that the reply fenced with the question.

                Whilst the responsibility for the acceptance of the tender was with the previous Ministry, everything which has, or has not, transpired since the end of April must, if there is to be any responsibility, rest with the present Ministry. Let us examine the Minister's statement. On the 4th April, a tender was accepted, and at the end of that month the present Administration came into power. Apparently, after that date, something transpired in reference to the selection of a site. I cannot conceive of a greater instance of departmental bungling than that disclosed by the Minister's statement today. Tenders were invited, apparently, in the most haphazard fashion - without the Department knowing where it intended to place the stations, and without a preliminary inquiry which would have elicited necessary information for inclusion in its invitation of tenders. This went on until August, when a site at Sydney was decided on, and an additional sum of £2,000 was offered to the contractors.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denison</inline>
                and his colleagues are not so disposed. It is two months and a half since the matter of the site was determined, and apparently we are not much nearer the completion of the contract, nor has a period for its completion been fixed. If there was a time when that ought to have been done, it was when the Ministry agreed to give the extra sum. Surely, when you undertake to revise a contract, and agree to pay a higher price because of additional work, or work which is alleged to be additional, that is the time to review the whole matter and the conditions of the contract. If there had been any business capacity, it is then that the Government would have asked, "If we are to pay you this additional sum, what time do you want for completing the contract?" That precaution was not taken.

                - I think it is quite clear that there has been no desire on the part of the company to sign the contract, or the guarantors to sign a bond. One of the gentlemen whose names have been given as guarantors has the reputation of being a man of wealth, but I can quite understand that he would hesitate to sign a guarantee bond for a company whose capital is to be counted by a few hundred pounds. It is immaterial that he is a shareholder in the company. It is a limited liability company, and, therefore, his liability is limited by the number of shares which he holds, but when he signs as a bondsman, his guarantee becomes a personal one, and it would be possible for the company to proceed against him.

                Will the honorable senator tell me why the question of time was not settled when the increased price was arranged ? To my mind, the most deplorable announcement we had to-day was the intimation that the Government propose to go ahead with the work. I venture to say that, during the last few months, there has been a great deal brought to light in connexion with this matter. I believe that it would meet with the public approbation, and make for the advantage and safety of Australia, if the Government, even now, would terminate the work, even although it involved paying compensation to the company, and proceeding on the safe lines adopted by the British Naval authorities.

                - Germany naturally desired to have a system by means of' which it would not be so easy as it would be with the Marconi system to interchange messages with other war-ships. The same thing appeals to us here. Apparently, it appealed to Admiral Poore to have a system which was not essentially that of one of our potential enemies. I think that, in putting that forward, Admiral Poore implied more than he said. It must be an advantage to have the Marconi system.

                - Given enough messages, I undertake to decipher any code you like. I can understand that in the Defence Department there is set out a means of deciphering any code which you happen to drop across. ' It would have been a great advantage if Australia had adopted the system which prevails, not only in the British Navy, but in our own Navy. That is the explanation why the Australian Company tendered at such a ridiculously low price. I am inclined to think that if we looked into the tenders it would be found that the Marconi Company offered something in connexion with the patent rights which was absent in the case of the other company. But, if that was not so, a sinister aspect attaches to the matter. I am not prepared to believe that there is a difference of ^15,000 in a genuine offer under the system. If it undertook to supply the same material and service, it is obvious to be that the buffer' company - the company which stands between the German manufacturer and ourselves - submitted a price knowing that if we installed one Telefunken station we should have committed Australia to that system.

                - I was laid up at the time. But we are speaking to-day with a knowledge which was not then current. To-day we are confronted with this question : " Because a mistake has been' made, shall we persist in the adoption of a system which we have reason to doubt is the best for Australia?" My own judgment is that the Marconi system would be worth infinitely more to the Commonwealth than would the Telefunken system. I regret that the Government have not taken the bold step of declaring that they propose to cancel the contract into which they have entered, to pay the contractors the compensation to which they are entitled, and to establish the wireless system which is in vogue in the British Navy.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline>
                is to be congratulated upon having brought this matter under the notice of the Senate. Whilst I recognise that it is the duty of the Minister to defend his Department, I cannot avoid saying that his defence, in at least two phases of it, was somewhat weak. Misleading answers should never be supplied by any departmental officer to Parliament through a Minister. The sooner Ministers recognise the wisdom of taking up a firm stand in reference to such matters the better. The answers supplied to the questions put by
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline>
                were undoubtedly misleading, and I hope that we have witnessed the last of that sort of thing in this- Chamber. I' do not intend to discuss which Government is to blame for having entered into contracts for the adoption of the Telefunken system. If that system be not a proper one to install in Australia, undoubtedly ' the responsibility rests with the Postmaster-General who accepted those, contracts. But, in the light of recent events, it is patent to everybody that a bungle has been made, and there is even a suspicion of something worse than bungling. I am told that an additional  £2,000  is to be paid to the contractors for erecting a wireless telegraph station at Pennant Hills instead of at South Head. I know something about the erection of buildings, and I should very much like to be paid an extra  £2,000  for erecting a building at Pennant Hills instead of at South Head. If I also had the right to proceed with the work, notwithstanding that no contract had been signed, I should be upon velvet. This contract savours very much of a system which is in vogue in America, under which options are granted to companies. Many of these companies practically build themselves up upon these options or franchises. It may be that the wealth of one gentleman who is associated with the company to which the contract has been let is a guarantee of its good faith. Personally, I am not acquainted with him, though I have seen his name mentioned in the public prints. But in dealing with contracts, everything should be done in a business-like way - in a way that is safe alike to the Commonwealth and the contractors. If our officers cannot prepare contracts in such a way as will insure that they shall be carried out within a reasonable period, it is time that they were displaced, and that the services of new men were requisitioned. , I am altogether dissatisfied with the present condition of this contract, and with the action of the Government in connexion with it. Now is the time for the Ministry to take up a firm stand, even if by doing so they involve the Commonwealth in a small loss. I venture to say that a loss of £5,000 or £6,000 will be regarded as insignificant if it prevents the Commonwealth from sustaining a greater loss hereafter, and from incurring serious danger in the future. I trust that the Government will initiate the strictest inquiry into all the conditions sur* rounding, not merely the contract, but the contracting company itself. If it be a
                <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline>
                company, let the work proceed in a business-like way. But if, after a contract has been let without it being signed, the Government can increase the amount of that. contract by  £2,000,  where is the matter to end? I am somewhat astounded that the Government do not appreciate the magnitude of such a step. Private individuals do not do that sort of thing. Having entered my protest against the deplorable condition which at present obtains in regard to these contracts. I will resume my seat.

                one would be led to believe that only a single system has been properly established throughout the world. But that is not so. Even in Great Britain itself no fewer than three different systems are in use. The cry, therefore, that our Navy will be able to use only one system is sheer nonsense.

We must remember, too, that an attempt was made to establish a system of wireless telegraphy in Australia some years ago. But nothing came of it, because the Government of the day did not regard the time as ripe for the installation of such a system. But suddenly a cry was raised that the Commonwealth was behind the times, and consequently an attempt was made to establish a wireless system in Australia.

                SYMON.- That is not what I have gathered from this debate. It has been reported that the Admiral on the Australian Station held a different view.  But I did think that it was a very extraordinary thing that we should adopt a system which has been adopted on German war-ships and mercantile vessels rather than a system which has been adopted by the British Navy and generally by the British mercantile marine. Of course, I do not pretend to pit my view on the relative merits of these scientific systems against the views of experts ; but I should think that there are good  reasons for adopting the system which is in use in Great Britain and on practically all British vessels rather than a system which is used by certain great Continental Powers, and especially by one Continental Power with which at present Great Britain is engaged in naval rivalry that we all hope may not lead to any bitterness or to consequences that would be greatly deplored throughout the world.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>
                SYMON.- I do not think that Germany would. But, at the same time, we ought not to adopt a system which would permit of messages being easily interchanged between German vessels and our shores rather than a system which would render it more difficult for such messages to be interchanged. I do not, however, wish to enter into that matter further, but there are several things in connexion with the subject which have struck me very forcibly. Some of them have been alluded, to in strong terms by
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline>
                The first is that 1 cannot understand the position taken up by
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline>
                Largie, that it is much better to have delay than to choose a site that might be found to be inappropriate. In the next place, it is said that we are now in a position which binds us to adopt the Telefunken system, and that it is impossible for us to extricate ourselves from the difficulty, if we happen to be in a difficulty. The next point is that we have entered into business relations with an Australian company, "and that we ought, I suppose, to be blind to its demerits and dumb in regard to our opinions concerning it.

            <para>

                SYMON.- Then I do not know why these references to an Australian company should be repeated over and over again. It does not seem to me to be material whether the company is established in Australia or anywhere else.

                SYMON.- If the conditions attached to this work are wrong, and if the whole of the circumstances show that there has been a gross muddle, and that the public interests of the Commonwealth have been disregarded, it is perfectly immaterial to me whether it is an Australian company that is concerned or whether it is not.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>
                SYMON.- It does seem a very extraordinary thing, as
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                has pointed out, that there should be a difference of about £15,000 in reference to this comparatively small job. I cannot understand it. It strikes me that there- must be something wrong. It suggests, as has been said by an honorable member in another place, that there must be " something fishy " about the position. That view is supported by the great delay which has taken place because of the alteration of the position of the Sydney station. Either this company has entered into the arrangement without any intention of carrying it out, or else, having entered into an unprofitable bargain, the company does not wish to go on with it and desires to escape from its obligation. There must be some reason why this delay of nine months has taken place since the tender was accepted, and why no progress has been made with this pressing public work. But there is another thing that I should like to say. My honorable friend
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline>
                emphasized the point that the Commonwealth is bound to go on with this business. I suggested that, in my experience, when a tender was invited and accepted the acceptance was always conditional upon an agreement or formal contract being solemnly entered into. I have been furnished with a copy of the printed conditions of tender, and they show quite plainly that it was intended - and I think the late Government are to be congratulated on not having departed from the ordinary conditions of tenter - that a formal agreement or contract should be entered into afterwards. That has not been done. This is the ordinary form of tender applying to the carrying out of public works. Under it the tenderer undertakes to enter into a bond in a form approved by the Postmaster-General for the due fulfilment of the contract. Can any one deny that there must have been the grossest carelessness somewhere in view of the fact that a tender of this kind for a work of pressing importance should have been left in this inchoate and indefinite state for nine months without the contract having been - as far as I know - prepared, or the signatures of the persons concerned having been obtained? The first thing that strikes one is the disparity in the prices. We have not got all the papers, but it is perfectly obvious that the Marconi contract must have been for more efficient work or for a better service, or for entering into an arrangement which the other people did not take into account.

                SYMON.- We have not the papers before us, and, therefore, we are not able to form an opinion on that point. The second thing is that throughout this form of tender it is stated that there is to be an agreement, a formal contract, between the parties. That has not been entered into. The next thing is that it was specially stipulated that there should be a bond or guarantee. This guarantee was to be entered into and completed to the satisfaction- of the Postmaster-General within fourteen days after the receipt of notice that the bond and agreement were ready for signature. Was that done? Has that notice been given? Has that bond ever been prepared? Has the agreement been prepared? Has the intimation been given?

That is the only difference that exists now, and when reasonable time has been given the contract will be signed.

May I also tell my honorable friend that these conditions of tender, when advertised nine months ago, provided for the time allowed for the completion of work ?

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>
                SYMON.- I will point out something as to the site in a moment. But surely it is not a businesslike thing to allow three months to elapse since the site was determined, and since the £2,000 concession was given to the contractors, before they are asked to sign the guarantee. The Government have absolutely nothing to show. They are entirely in the hands of the contractors, as to whether the contract shall be carried out or not. If the contractors are humbugging the Government in respect of the time allowed them, and the guarantor says, " I am sick of this thing," there is nothing binding upon the contractors. They have not even been notified to come and sign the bond.

            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline>

            </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>
                SYMON. - That is a pretty explanation ! That is a pretty excuse for a muddled contract ! We wait nine months for a person to enter upon a work which is in the public interest, and which is believed to be necessary for the defence of Australia ; and then, after waiting that time, and being humbugged by the contractors, the representative of the Government says, " It does not matter whether they back out of the contract or not, because, if they do, we shall not have to pay them any money." Surely that is a peculiar way of doing business. The next thing in regard to this contract is that the conditions of tender stipulate that within fourteen days after the receipt of notice from the Postmaster-General that the bond and guarantee are ready for signature, they shall be signed. That notice was given nine months ago. The matter should have been settled then. But the contractors extracted £2,000 more - over 50 per cent, above the original price - from the Government, and having secured that they humbug three months longer as to the time of completion. Then the conditions go on to say that there is to be a bond of two approved sureties. As far as I know, one of the sureties mentioned is a capable man. But he is also capable of looking after his own interests, and may decline to- sign the guarantee in the present unsettled condition of affairs. But there is one other important question, and that is the alteration of the site. I take leave to say that the Government have been robbed in having agreed to pay that £2,000. There is not a single word in these conditions in regard to the site which entitles the contractors to any compensation whatever for any change of the kind. In fact, no site is stipulated at all. The Government have simply been humbugged. The paragraph states that it is left to the tenderers or contractors to suggest the exact location of each station, but that the final decision must rest with the Government. The following conditions are, however, given as an indication of the principal requirements. The station at Sydney was to be located between the South Head, at the entrance of Sydney Harbor, and Botany Bay, or in the vicinity of the North Head, at the entrance of Sydney Harbor. That is wide enough.

                - Some people are " funking " it, but I do not think the Government or the officers of the Post and Telegraph Department have any need to funk it. Difficulties have arisen, and they have been explained. When I tell honorable senators that it is fairly well known that after three years' experiments the American Navy are about to adopt the Telefunken system, and that a very large station in which that system will be installed is to be erected in New York, the information will probably relieve their minds to some extent. It cannot be such a bad system after all. I challenge any member of the Senate to make all the inquiries he pleases, and he will find that the Marconi and the Telefunken systems are the two most generally recognised. When we remember that a country like Germany, that attaches as much importance to the perfection of all its utilities as any other country in the world, has adopted this system, it is surely some guarantee that it is a good system. Russia. I dare say, is as great as any other country, and her authorities as wise and judicious, and her adoption of the Telefunken system is a further guarantee that it is generally recognised as a good system. I can leave out of consideration Austria, Belgium, Holland, and other countries that have adopted the system. Honorable senators must recognise that there are wise men in the countries to which I have referred, as well as in Great Britain, or even in Australia. When the people of these countries have adopted this system,. Australia will not make a very serious mistake in adopting it.

                Of what use is it for the honorable senator to ask questions when no answer given satisfies him? It would be better for his own sake that he should never ask any questions, because he repeatedly declares that he never receives answers that satisfy him.

            <para class="block">In the circumstances, I should prefer that he would not ask me any questions. I wish to inform honorable senators that there is no difficulty in the interchange of messages between different systems of wireless telegraphy. No country would adopt a system which was not interchangeable with the system adopted by other countries. It is because the Telefunken system can be interchanged with other systems that it has been adopted by the countries in which it is used. This is probably the reason why the Postmaster-General of the last Government and his advisers thought it well to adopt the Telefunken system. They knew that with it communication would: be interchangeable with other systems, and that no difficulty would arise from the fact that Australia had adopted the Telefunken, and Great Britain the Marconi, or the other two systems mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. But honorable senators must have something to talk about. The session is coming to a close, and, apparently, they have not said enough' already, and so this or the last Government must suffer from an infliction of the kind at the close of the session. I believe that the late Government did the best they could in the circumstances, and the present Government, in taking over the responsibility, have done the best they could ever since. </para>

                GOULD (New South Wales) [4.9].- The great object we wish to attain is to discover where the truth lies in reference to this business. So far as I can see, there is very little evidence to justify insinuations of anything of an improper character in connexion with the matter. At the same time, we have so far received no satisfactory explanation from the Government. Tenders appear to have been invited for the erection of these stations in particular localities. A certain number of tenders were received, and one was accepted. Some time later it was discovered that the site selected for the erection of a station was not suitable, and should be changed. One would have thought that previous to the selection of the sites in the first instance the officers of the Department would have consulted with the naval and military authorities to ascertain whether they had any objection to sites suggested by the Department, or were prepared to suggest sites themselves. It is patent that any wireless station established on the coast of Australia should be in a place safe from attack by any foreign Power.

If so,. I should like to know whether that was approved, not merely by the local authorities, but by the Admiral on the Station? If the Imperial authorities, as represented by the Admiral on the Station, were consulted, the Senate would like to know when it dawned upon those concerned that it was necessary to make a change. If the papers were laid on the table they would not, I think, disclose that the Admiral on the Station gave any authoritative opinion that a suitable site could be found between North Head and Botany Bay.

An alteration of the proposed site involved an abandonment of all the original conditions of the contract, and before the Government agreed to pay the successful tenderer an additional sum of money new conditions should have been determined upon, so that no difficulty might arise later. The Government, by their action, placed themselves in a position of very great difficulty, and I imagine that if they went into the law Courts they would find that certain portions of the specifications would not be worth the paper on which they are written.

Some stress has been laid on the fact that it is an Australian company which sent in the lowest tender, and that, therefore, it ought to have some advantage. The Telefunken system is a German one. I dare say that the gentlemen who formed the Australian company arranged with the patentees to have the rights in Australia, and, therefore, they put in a tender to install the system. It is one which has been developed and worked in countries outside Australia. If we are to choose between two systems - one which comes from a foreign power and one which comes from our own country - which ought we to adopt ?

It is perfectly true that if that course were taken, and another system adopted, the gentlemen whose tender has been accepted would be entitled to compensation, but it would be far better to compensate them, even to the amount of the contract, than to introduce a system which probably would not prove the most suitable for our requirements.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline>
                on having brought forward this very important question. If there is anything which appeals to my mind, it is the absence of information on the subject, not only on the part of the Government, but on the part of honorable senators. I do not claim to possess much knowledge, but I do remember that when the wireless telegraph system became a practicable utility, the Marconi and Telefunken systems - which were then the two most prominent ones - were considered by a Commission composed of the representatives of the leading nations  in the world. It was decided then and there that the Marconi and Telefunken systems could be utilized for separate purposes, so as not to be made interchangeable. Whether they could be made interchangeable is quite another matter. On this ground, the Telefunken system was adopted by the German nation, and the Marconi system was adopted by our own people for purposes connected more particularly with marine questions and great questions of naval warfare. It is for this reason that I ask the Government to be a little more careful before they adopt a Continental system in preference to our own system. I think that in the volubility of the conversation which goes on here it is forgotten that Australia could be very easily isolated in a time of national crisis. The cables could be cut. Surely if there is anything which can appeal to the spirit of Australia it must be the necessity of having means of communication with our Royal Navy. If our instruments were attuned to the Telefunken system and the Royal Navy to the Marconi system, we should be in darkness. That is, I think, a point which the Government might very well pause to consider, and also whether it is not advisable to work in harmony with the Admiralty. I understand from views he has expressed in public that Admiral Poore thinks that we ought to adopt the Marconi system.

Whatever may be the merits or demerits of the rival systems, we should have uniformity. It is of no use to have a Telefunken station here and a ship with a Marconi system 100 or 1,000 miles away, and a Telefunken system there and a Marconi system somewhere else. We want a uniform system, not only in Australia, but on the ships which will have to communicate with our stations.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline>
                was not that the two systems cannot communicate with each other, but that you can make them noncommunicable.

                Exactly.According to the information in my possession, it is a fact that vessels which are fitted with the Marconi system are prevented from exchanging communications with vessels or stations fitted with any other system except in cases of actual distress. Then what is the use of installing the Telefunken system in Australia, seeing that all the vessels which trade here are fitted with the Marconi system? The vessels of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, of the Orient Steam-ship Company, of the NordDeutscher Lloyd Line, of the Union Castle Line, of the Aberdeen Line, and of the White Star Line are all fitted with the Marconi system. Indeed, with the exception of the German Mail Line, all the boats trading to Australia have installed that system. Another strong point is that our own torpedo boats are fitted with it. It is plain that we should make up our minds to adopt either one system or the other, and thus secure uniformity throughout the Commonwealth.

The same remark is applicable to the lighthouses. All the wireless telegraph stations in Canada have installed the Marconi system.

                Largie. I was told the other day, in answer to a question, that it was not a fact that the vessels of the British Navy are fitted with the Marconi system. Yet we all know that it is a fact. But the gravamen of my complaint is that a complete muddle has been made in the matter of letting these contracts. They were let on the 4th April last, but, as the Honorary Minister has explained, there has been some dispute or delay in the matter of deciding upon the best possible sites for the proposed stations. The best site for one of those stations was determined in August last, and yet, although the Government have agreed to pay the contractors an additional £2,000 for undertaking its erection, the Commonwealth has no guarantee that the work will be proceeded with.

                That may be so. But from a humane stand-point - from the stand-point of life-saving - it is essential that we should have wireless telegraph stations erected round the coast of Australia. From a commercial point of view, it is also necessary that we should know the progress which ships are making, and that we should be acquainted with their positions at sea, so that we may know when they may be expected to arrive in port. From a defence stand-point, the establishment of wireless telegraph stations along our coast is of vital importance to us. It is also necessary that the outlying portions of the Commonwealth, which are not connected with it by cable, should be provided with that means of communication to which they are entitled under our progressive civilization. At the present time there is no communication with King Island, which is situated in Bass Straits. During recent years a series of shipwrecks has occurred there, and but for the kindness of its inhabitants the survivors might have starved. Then, it is desirable that we should have communication with Papua and other outlying possessions. Consequently, it is important that no further delay should occur in the erection of these wireless telegraph stations. If the company to which the contracts have been let will not carry them out, those contracts should be taken from it.
            </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley.</inline>

            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GIVENS.</inline>
                - There is no sign of it carrying them out. Up to date the contracts have not been signed, nor have the guarantees, and we have no assurance that they will be signed. As I read the conditions of the contract the company must assign all its patent rights in Australia to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth claims a monopoly in the matter of communication by means of wireless telegraphy in Australia, and consequently we have the sole right to any particular system that we may choose to adopt. If the Marconi Company had erected stations in Australia it would have had to relinquish all its patent rights in this part of the world to the Commonwealth. Possibly, for that reason, its price was higher than that of the company to which the contracts have been let. But I do not know whether it was excessive. I do know, however, that a disgraceful muddle has been made of the whole business- a muddle that the Senate should insist upon having rectified at the earliest possible moment. I ask leave to withdraw the motion.

                        <para>- The Honorary Minister cheers the sentiment contained in that provision, but I do think that, on mature consideration, some of my honorable friends opposite will come to the conclusion that they are making a very great mistake.I think they will come to that conclusion for this reason: No one can deny that we are here, not for the purpose of subordinating our views upon general questions, or even colouring our views on general questions by our position as state representatives, but that, subject to that exception, we are here for the purpose of safeguarding the rights of the States. That is primarily our function as senators. I quite recognise that, very often, the expression " State rights " is misused. It is very often employed to designate matters which are not State rights at all. No honorable senator will, I think, accuse me of any inconsistency in that respect, when the course that I took last year in connexion with the Financial Agreement is remembered. A strong argument was used to the effect that that agreement was a vindication, or assertion - or an affirmation, if honorable senators prefer that term - of State rights. Rightly or wrongly, I took the opposite view. But there is a great distinction between the position in connexion with that agreement and the position in connexion with this proposal. </para>

As was said when this Bill was before the Senate for its second reading, there is another tribunal - a far higher tribunal than the Senate, or than this Parliament - before whom the question will be brought, and by whom it will eventually be decided. But now is the time to point out the grave dangers that, in my view, are involved - grave dangers to the Federation itself, to the principles of Federation, and to the foundation upon which the relations between the Commonwealth and the States were laid. We are here, as I have said, for the purpose of safeguarding State rights. </para>

                        <para>- It is not for this Parliament to think of giving the people an opportunity of remedying their own system of State government. We are not here to interfere with the right of the people of the States to settle their own local affairs. I never will consent to such an interference as this with the self-governing powers of the States. If you are going to interfere with their railway servants, why do you not interfere with the whole of their Public Service? Why do you not interfere with their executive officers? Why do you not remove their Governors? Why do you not take power to subvert the action of their Governments? If you do it in one thing, you may do it in all. I do not, however, desire to go into that aspect of the question, because we have a greater forum before whom we have to appeal; but I do not wish to allow this opportunity to . pass, and to give a. silent vote against this measure, without making perfectly clear at this stage the grounds upon which I shall vote. The other matters dealt with in this Bill are, in my judgment, relatively unimportant, in comparison with that to which I am referring. </para>

It is our duty to preserve the indestructibility of the States'. If we are going to destroy them, let us have a plain proposal to that effect. </para>

Mathematically, of course, the whole is greater than the part, but the parts of this Federation are the States, and the States within their own sphere are in a position of equality with the Commonwealth. In the next place, they are sovereign States, just as much as this is a sovereign Federation. Within the scope of their powers of government, their rights are identical with those of the Commonwealth. </para>

Logically, it would be as. right to add to this a proposal to subject the whole of the p'ublic servants of the States to a tribunal created by the Commonwealth, that is to say, to Commonwealth law, as it is to propose to subject the railway servants of the States to such a, tribunal. Why is it not proposed to include the servants of the Education Departments of the States, or qf any other State Department ? </para>

                        <para>- Why should it? The fact of the matter is that what honorable senators opposite wish to do is to obtain an organized force throughout the Commonwealth against some particular State. They are going to override a particular State in its control of its own servants by enabling the railway servants in all the other States to combine with the railway servants in that State. 1 say that that is indefensible, lt will lead to anarchy. It is certainly directly destructive of States' sovereignty, and to that I shall never agree, so long as I have a voice to protest against it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> says that there is a necessity in the case of the railway service. Logically I see no difference whatever in principle between a proposal that the Commonwealth should take over the railway servants of the States and a proposal that they should take over all the other .servants of the States. In fact, if we do the one, we shall have introduced the thin end of the wedge, and may proceed to take over the whole of the executive powers of the Government in any State. It must be so. If there is no answer to a proposal to take over the State railway servants, there can be no answer to a proposal to take over the men in the Education Departments, the Lands Departments, and every other of the public Departments of the States. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that it is final. I am speaking for myself, and not for the Vice-President of the Executive Council. I wish I were speaking for the honorable senator. I am sorry that he does not see with -me. I can only put the matter before him in the way in which it strikes me, and 1 say that if we -can take over the railway servants of a State, and subject them to the control of a . Commonwealth tribunal, we can take over, in the same way, all other public servants of the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> sees some distinction between the railway servants and other public servants in a State. It is to me the most marvellous thing in the world that honorable senators opposite should propose to take over the whole of the railway  servants who are employed to carry on the great State enterprise of the railways, and do not propose to take over the railways themselves. I could see some sense in this proposal if it were proposed also to take over the railways of the States. </para>

                        <para>- We have all come to the conclusion that it is a right thing, and should be done, but there is no analogy between the position of a sovereign Government of a self-governing country and an individual manufacturer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie referred to the industrial peace of the country. I attach quite as much importance to it as the honorable senator does. I think it is very essential that there should be industrial peace, but I say that we have no right, I will not say under the pretence, but under the appearance, of a desire to secure industrial peace, to invade the self-governing rights of the States. At the risk of seeming to repeat myself, I must impress upon my honorable friends that they are proposing to interfere with what is within the legitimate powers of the sovereign Governments of the States, and, so long as we have a Federal form of government in the Commonwealth, those sovereign rights of the State Governments should be respected. My honorable friends say, truly enough, that they intend to ask the people to assent to this proposal. If they were going to ask the people to agree to hand over to the Commonwealth the railway systems, as well as the railway servants of the States, that would be a logical and intelligible proposal. But they are asking the people to say, " We shall leave to the Governments of the sovereign States the control of the railways as instruments for the public good, and propose to take away from them only the power of controlling their own servants. We are going to say that the Crown, as the Commonwealth, shall control the servants of the Crown as the Government of a State." I ask my honorable friends whether they think such a proposal is in accordance with good sense, or is one which ought to be submitted to the people without first of all getting the consent of the Governments of the States ? It would have been a courteous and reasonable thing to have, first of all, gone to the Governments, or even the Parliaments, of the different States, and asked them whether they were prepared to hand over this portion of their self-governing powers to the Commonwealth, or to subject a section of their public servants to the legislative control of the Commonwealth through a Commonwealth tribunal, or in some other way. </para>

                        <para>- The Governments of the States are composed of persons who have been elected by the people, and the courteous thing for us to do is. in the first place, to go to these Governments and ask them whether they have any objection to this proposal before bringing a Bill like this into Parliament. I say that this is trampling on the rights of the States, not upon " tin-pot dignities," but upon the just rights of the Governments of the sovereign States. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend will have an opportunity to advocate that course, and to show that it is a proper, courteous, and polite way in which to treat the State Governments. I remind honorable senators that we are here, to a certain extent, to represent the State Governments, not their individual policies or the Governments themselves, but the system which they have been appointed to carry out. I do not care who are the members of the Governments of the different States, but I feel that, so long as I am here, it is my business to recognise them. It is my business to appeal to my honorable friends opposite - and I do no more than make what I think is a reasonable appeal, though they may not consider it so - to reflect whether they are doing right in proposing in this way a serious, and I will say a revolutionary, change in the principles and basis of our Federation. It would have been a perfectly easy thing to have ascertained the views of the different States through their Governments. If they expressed wrong views, their people could deal with them. If we felt, as the Parliament representing the Commonwealth, that, notwithstanding any protest the State Governments might make, we should still be justified in this proposal, we might then have referred it to the people. </para>

                        <para>-I should not say so if some overwhelming reason were shown for what was proposed. The Vice-President of the Executive Council says that this is only my view, but we have the undoubted fact that the people whom we are seeking to bring under Commonwealth legislation, and in that respect under Commonwealth control, are the' instruments employed to carry on a particular State Government enterprise. As such, they are under the control of the State Governments, and we have no more right to take over the men who drive the engines than to take over the engines they drive. So far as the system is concerned, such a proposition could only be defended if it were associated with a proposal to take over the whole of the railways. At any rate, my view is that this is an interference with the highest of all State rights, and that is the right of a State to exercise its own government in accordance with the views expressed by its representatives and in the ultimate resort by the people who elect them. The enterprise of running the railways is just as much a part of a State Government as is the administration of the Lands Department. If you take over the instrumentality, that is, the employes, without taking over the thing itself, you will give them a sort of truncated system, and will not facilitate their operations, but will hamper and injure them. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know what this proposal is, then. We had better strike it out. I do not know why you should not propose to place all other public servants under the control of Commonwealth legislation. I have always thought that the management of the railways by the States was a great example of State Socialism, and a very salutary one. I am one of those who have always believed in certain descriptions of State Socialism within proper limits and for proper purposes. I have always thought that the railway service was one of the subjects which might very well be controlled by the State, as it always has been. I cannot understand those who talk Socialism interfering with the management, by the State, and one of its Socialistic enterprises. </para>

                        <para>- Now I have gained one point. I will not say that my honorable friend is convinced, but he thinks that that would get over the difficulty. I think so, too. If the Commonwealth took over the whole of the railways not a soul could raise the slightest objection to the control of the men, because it can do what it likes with its own employes. </para>

                        <para>- If you cannot take over the railways, on what possible principle are you to take over the men who are running them under the control of the State Governments? I do not profess to believe for a moment that my honorable friends opposite assent to the view I am putting, but I ask them to consider whether this is not a direct interference with the self-governing power of the States, their sovereignty within their' sphere. Their sovereignty includes the conduct of the railway enterprises within their territory, and that must comprise the control, the management, and the doing of justice to the men in their service. The moment you ask the people to vote that they shall be made subject to Commonwealth legislation, which may be one thing today and another thing to-morrow, and subject to the tribunals which it may create, you declare that the State sovereignty is not competent to do justice to its own employes in that Department, and that the power should be withdrawn from them. If anything is degrading to the States, that, it seems to me, is. Therefore, I shall oppose the motion on the ground that this proposal is one which ought not to be submitted to the people except in consultation and harmony with the State Governments to begin with, and is one which I think every man should resist to the utmost, if he intends to remain under a Federal Government in which the State to which he belongs is still regarded as a sovereign entity with the full power of doing justice and managing its enterprises and servants. </para>

I am not unmindful of the fact that not long ago there took place in Victoria a strike on the part of its railway servants. </para>

                            <para>- If the public opinion which was in favour of the legislation to bring that strike to an end was right it must have been wrong afterwards when it repealed the legislation which disfranchised public servants, and which was truly described as panic legislation. I venture to say that had the strike lasted for another week or so, it would have extended, probably, to two or three States. </para>

                            <para>- We are not asking for the lot here and now. I feel sure that some of the State Governments would be well pleased indeed to have the grievances of their railway employes settled by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. What have the State Governments to fear? If we obtain this power, it does not mean that we shall take control of the railways, because if we get this power we shall not be able to put even a solitary window in a railway carriage ; we shall not be able to make any alteration in regard to properties belonging to the States; we shall not have power to employ an additional man or to dismiss one. We merely ask that State servants shall be placed in the same position as is occupied by outside citizens. </para>

                        <para>. - I cannot allow a measure of this importance to pass without saying a few words upon it. I wish particularly to refer to one aspect of the question which was dealt with by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon..</inline> He seems to view the proposal which is contained in this Bill from a very narrow stand-point. In one breath he affirms that we are about to appeal to a superior power, the people,, and in the next he claims that the legislation which we are asking them to ratify, amounts to a revolution. What is the revolution which is proposed? We all know that some years ago a number of distinguished gentlemen met together for the purpose of framing a Commonwealth Constitution. They made rib provision whatever for safeguarding the interests of the men who are employed upon our State railways. </para>

                    <para class="block">My point is that the interests which were represented at the Convention are not those which are represented in this Parliament. A majority of the members of this Parliament are present, not as the result of having consulted the State Parliaments, but as the result of having recently consulted their masters, the people. I would also remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that before the proposed amendments in the Constitution can be effected, we must again consult the electors. I hold that State railway servants ought to be able to ventilate their grievances, if they have any, before a  properly-constituted Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration "Court. We have been told that under this Bill we shall be interfering with the sovereign rights of the States. My own impression is that many persons who voted for Federation would not have voted for it had they not thought that there would be a great interference by the Commonwealth with the sovereign rights of the States. The longer that the six States are permitted to legislate upon industrial questions the closer will this Parliament come into conflict with them. At the present time, I think that the people favour the curtailment of the sovereign powers of the States, or, at least, believe in endowing this Parliament with equal power to regulate industrial conditions. Under this Bill we do not ask for greater power than is possessed by any one of the States to-day. Surely if we are to have a sovereign Parliament with defined powers - and  1  am not going to worship the Constitution which was framed by the great intellects of twelve years ago-- </para>

                            <para>- I recognise that this Bill embodies the first great extension of Federal power. I repeat that we are not asking for greater power than may be exercised by each of the States to-day. If honorable senators are anxious to preserve the sovereign rights of the States they should be equally anxious to empower  the Commonwealth Parliament to deal with the industrial conditions which obtain in the different States. In New South Wales we know that Industrial Courts have been established . before which the conditions of employment which obtain in any industry may be fully ventilated. But in those States in which the workers cannot bring their grievances before a fairly constituted tribunal, we know that employes occupy a much worse position. The proposal in this Bill to which most exception is taken, is that men who are employed by the States shall not be afforded an opportunity of appealing to a Federal tribunal to regulate the rate of wages which they shall be paid, and the labour conditions which shall be imposed upon them. Personally, I believe that if we could consult the State Parliaments, without appealing to political prejudice, there is scarcely one of them which would not welcome the establishment of an independent tribunal to determine these conditions. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that they would welcome the creation of a tribunal which* would regulate the wages of railway employes throughout the Commonwealth. If we were to consult the present Labour Government in New South Wales upon the question, the chances are that we should receive a reply favorable to the labour aspect of it. On the other hand, if we were to consult the Tory Governments of Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania, we should perhaps obtain an opposite reply. But seeing that we are about to consult their masters upon the question of whether these Bills shall be placed upon the statute-book, and that the issue will entirely depend upon their votes, we may very well dispense with the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> that we ought to approach the States cap-in-hand with a request that they should agree to an extension of the powers of this Parliament. </para>

I feel proud of their work, and I believe that they were as able a body of men as could be found at the time Tor the task which they undertook. But I do not wish it to be understood that ideas were not prevalent in the community which did not secure representation in the Federal Convention. The various franchises which existed in the different States prevented them from receiving that representation. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. My own reading and experience have convinced me that it is exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to keep up-to-date in the matter of the science of government. We are accustomed to credit those who travel in advance of ourselves with being possessed of very little knowledge. When we have made up our minds upon certain questions we imagine that the last word has been said upon the science of government. That Ls the starting-point of Conservatism, no matter to what school of political thought we may belong. Consequently I decline to accept the theory that when our Commonwealth Constitution was framed the last word was uttered upon the question of Constitution building, whilst I do not think for a moment that we have produced as great political economists as have other lands. It would be almost impossible for a small community like Australia to produce the intellectual giants who have been produced by other countries through all generations. We can boast of no political economists like Adam Smith, or Karl Marx. But we have an opportunity of reading their works and of putting their theories into practice, and as a result I think we have reached a higher average of political intellectuality, than has any other people in the world. Yet we are far from having a perfect Constitution. That being so, we should be very chary about accepting any doctrine as <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> last word on the science of government. We all know that cherished theories to which we have clung so tenaciously for years, have frequently proved to be faulty. For that reason we should not bind ourselves hard and fast to any particular principle. There is one great question, however, which has obtruded itself very prominently during recent years, and which I think will become even more prominent in the future. It is the question, " Which is to be the supreme Government in Australia?" We all know that in the Commonwealth there are State Governments which .we are constantly reminded ought to be sovereign within their own ambits. But I hold that there can be only one supreme authority in any nation. Ours is a nation from sea to sea. The Australian States comprise one great people, controlled by one Government; and that Government, when a difference arises, should have supreme control. Indeed, our present Constitution provides for that in some cases. It is laid down that when there is a conflict between the laws of the Commonwealth and the laws of a State, the supremacy must lie with the laws of the Commonwealth. If we apply that principle to the present circumstances, we shall find a solution of the whole difficulty. </para>

                    <para class="block">Conflicts  of  jurisdiction will increase as time goes on, and I am satisfied that the people of Australia recognise that there is danger in having a divided authority. We may talk as we like about State rights; but there are certain things in which the Commonwealth must be supreme. I recognise, of course, that there are matters within a State which the Government of a State can control much better than can the Central Government. Local requirements are much better known to members of a State Parliament than they can be known  to  members of a Central Parliament. The Federal Parliament does not possess the same intimate local knowledge as do the State Parliaments. Consequently the local Parliaments should have control over such affair*. 'But unless in other things the Central Parliament has supreme power, the whole Federal structure falls to the ground. Many instances may be quoted, in which a State right, as affecting a particular State of the Commonwealth, may become a State wrong, as affecting the other five States. We saw that illustrated in a marked degree in connexion with the coal strike about twelve months ago. There was a dispute that paralyzed the industries of Australia; and simply because of a trifling flaw in our Arbitration Act the Commonwealth was not able to interfere. There is no denying the fact that every State was suffering on that occasion. The same thing may arise again. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> referred to that point when he said that there are certain things that both sides can agree upon, as far as State Socialism is concerned. He argued, however, that surely the States are entitled to retain the power of spreading the principle of State Socialism. With that doctrine I quite concur; but up to a certain point only, because State Socialism, in any one State, may turn out to- inflict a wrong upon the other States. I like to take a concrete case rather than to talk in generalities. Let us take what is likely to become a State monopoly in respect of one particular commodity. In New South Wales at the present time we have a Government in power which yesterday made a declaration of policy to the effect that it intends to establish the iron industry as a State concern. Whilst I agree with that policy up to a certain point, I can see quite easily that it may have grave effects on other States. One has only to familiarize himself with the position of the iron industry to realize that other considerations must be kept in view. There is not in Australia a. sufficiently large market to justify the establishment of more than one up-to-date iron works. The principal customers will be the State Governments, whose railways require iron for their engines, for their rails, for their bridges, and so forth. By the establishment of a State monopoly in New South Wales, controlling this particular industry, the railways in the other five States will be affected. Consequently, although it i? right of the State of New South Wales to create a monopoly in the iron industry, what is a- State right in that instance may become a State wrong, as affecting the other five States. It is quite possible that the State Governments generally will be, at some time, at the mercy of one State Government - New South Wales - for commodities which are required for the working of their railways. Notwithstanding the fact that it is a Labour Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGowen,</inline> who is initiating this policy, I decline to hand over to him, or to any other State Minister, power over the railways of the other States, I hold, therefore, that we should be shortsighted indeed if we said that, because it is the right of one State to establish a monopoly, that is the last word to be said on the question. </para>

                            <para>- With all due respect to your opinion, sir, I think I have a right to show, by means of an illustration, that the power of one State to monopolize or to control an industry, dovetails into the general question of State rights. I wish now to say a few words in reply to a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> when this measure was introduced. The honorable senator said, in effect, that he refused to carry out the duty of what is commonly called "  His  Majesty's Opposition." On that occasion, he donned the mantle' of the prophet. Jeremiah. The message which he had to convey to the country was pitched in a very pessimistic key indeed.  His  tale was one of woe and lamentation. He said that the Senate had ceased to be a deliberative assembly simply because the various proposals which he and other members of the Opposition had made had not been accepted by the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> ought to have recollected that although the end of the session is within sight, and it is desirable to shorten debate as much as possible, nevertheless he and his colleagues have exercised to the full their privilege of debating measures which have been brought before us. It was surely rather late in the day for him to announce that he no longer intended to exercise the functions of the Leader of an Opposition. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell reminds me, on no one occasion has the slightest restriction been placed upon the debating instincts of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> or any other member of the Opposition. Much as we should have liked, on many occasions, to apply some restraint in order to abridge the oratorical propensities of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, nevertheless no attempt whatever was made to restrain him, and every question has been threshed out to the fullest degree. We suffered under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger's inflictions, but we bore our suffering in the spirit of martyrs; and having received martyrdom, it was surely late in the day for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to say that he intended no longer to exercise his right of debate. It seemed to me, moreover, that the honorable senator was guilty of a deliberate insult to the Senate when he charged it with being no longer a deliberative assembly. But I wish to prove beyond all question, that the honorable senator was by no means justified in making that statement. I hold that never during any session of. the Senate has greater deliberation been given to the various questions that have come before us than during the present session. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> cannot seriously blame the Government for not accepting amendments with which they did not agree. It is the duty of a Government to adhere to their own principles and their own Bills rather than accept the ideas and principles of their political opponents. The history of every Parliament in the world, as far as I know, goes to show that every Opposition has had to fight against the majority on the Government benches, and it is surely the duty of an Opposition to continue its work whether it fails in its efforts or not. When the present Ministerial party were on the Opposition benches, vainly fighting against the </para>

But we did not turn round in a petulant, childish fashion, and say, " Because you have not accepted our proposals, we shall no longer exercise our functions as an Opposition." We did not cry, " We will no longer play in your back- yard." I want to show what has occurred in connexion with divisions in the Senate. Never has there been a greater division of opinion than during the present session. After consulting the <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline> of the Senate, I find that there have been ninety-three divisions. In thirty-seven of these, both Opposition and Labour members voted against Government proposals. But there is much more to be said. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I venture to say that in many of these divisions on the side on which Ministerial supporters and Opposition senators voted together, the latter were in a minority. But this does not disclose the whole of the opposition to the Government during this session. Honorable senators will bear in mind that I make this statement in reply to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> that Government business, when introduced here, had been cut and dried and arranged by the Caucus, and that it was, therefore, of no use for the Opposition to discuss Government proposals. When the honorable senator made the statement, it was known to every one here that a party caucus of the Opposition had been held only a few days  before,  and it was under the orders of that  caucus meeting that the honorable senator spoke. The cheek of the thing is transparent when we find an honorable senator carrying out the orders of a caucus meeting of his own party in finding fault with honorable senators on this side on the ground that they are only obeying the orders of their own caucus. </para>

I have already said that there were thirty-seven divisions in which Labour and Opposition senators voted together against Government proposals. I find, also, that there were twenty divisions during this session in which the opposition to the Government proposal was wholly composed of Labour senators. If figures can prove anything at all, these figures show that, instead of the whole of the Government business being cut and dried in the Ministerial Caucus, there are a very great many questions on which there is anything but . unanimity amongst Labour senators. </para>

I think, beyond a shadow of a doubt that the only party the members of which cannot act for themselves is the party now in Opposition in the Senate. The figures I have quoted show that members of the Labour party are the freest members of the Senate. In twenty divisions in this Chamber the opposition to the Government has been wholly composed of Labour senators. </para>

They showed that when, on the 13th April last, they returned the Labour party to power to do certain things. A Labour Government is now doing those things, and the slurs which, in this connexion, have been cast upon the Senate serve only to remind us of the old adage, "It is a dirty bird that fouls its own nest." </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator is referring to something which has occurred in another place, let me tell him that it is only an additional illustration of the independence of the members of the Labour party, and shows again that the. cry about the "pledgebound Caucus party," for whom everything is cut and dried outside Parliament, has nothing in it. The bottom has fallen  out of that story, and even the stupid Fusion party must recognise it by this time. The people declared on the 13th April last that a certain policy should be carried out, and the present Government, in giving effect to that policy, are carrying out the will of the people. With respect to the kind of legislation, we are now asked to pass an opinion upon, I have only to say that much of this legislation introduced in the past has been  a  failure. I have always supported legislation proposed for the control of trusts, with the object of educating public opinion in the belief that there is only one means of settling the matter. This must be brought very vividly before the people before they can appreciate it. </para>

                            <para>- A settlement which I am quite sure the people are prepared for to-day. I desire that this Parliament should possess the power for which we are asking in this proposed alteration of the Constitution. In view of the futility of our past legislation to secure for us control of these trusts, it is idle to propose that we should continue the timorous policy of Conservatism. To do so would be to go on dropping the bucket into the well, and drawing no water out of it. That is a policy with which the people will not be satisfied. </para>

The only way in which we can ascertain whether the people desire that this power shall be given to the Federal Parliament is by submitting the question to them at a referendum. One of the most important things for which we can strive is industrial peace, and every assumed dignity of the State Parliaments must take second place when it is a question of conserving the peace and prosperity of the Commonwealth. </para>

For six years I, in common with Senators Guthrie and McGregor, was a member of the Legislative Council of South Australia, and know what it is. If it were elected on the same franchise as the House of Assembly, it would be in  a  different position to-day, but only about one-third of the people are entitled to vote at the election of its members.

                            <para>- Surely the honorable senator does not want to take advantage of me, when it is with the greatest difficulty that I can speak? I want this Bill to be passed to enable certain measures of the present session to become effective. We desire to appeal to the people who sent us here. What did the Legislative Council of South Australia do in  189 1  ? I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> is not present to hear my remarks. Industrial legislation was passed through both Houses of the State Parliament to benefit some of the workers, but the Legislative Council hung it up for four or five years by refusing to pass the regulations to bring it into force. It is constituted in the same way to-day as it was then, and it is blocking the creation of Wages Boards right and left. Are we to stand by and see that done? The people believe that every man and woman on reaching the age of maturity should have a vote. </para>

                            <para>- I bow to your ruling, sir. The only way to remedy that state of things is, I contend, to hand the authority, over to another Parliament which is more in sympathy with the people. I feel confident that at the referendum the people of Australia will express themselves exactly as they did last April in New South Wales, Tasmania, and Queensland, and every State of the Commonwealth. Why should not the majority of the people prevail ? I came here to-day . at considerable risk, and, as I have said, against the advice of my doctor. I glory in having the power to be present and to speak in favour of this measure, so as to let the people know exactly where I stand and intend to stand. I support the motion. </para>

                    <para class="block">The measure which I have the honour to introduce is one of considerable importance, though in it we propose to deal only with one or two main principles. In the first place, I wish to direct the attention of honorable senators to sections 50 to 56 of the principal Act. They will see that in those sections we take to ourselves considerable powers in the matter of dealing with prohibited imports. For instance, in section 52, we declare that works reproduced without the permission of the owner of the copyright, false money, counterfeit sterling and coin, blasphemous, indecent or obscene works, goods manufactured in prison, exhausted tea, oleomargarine, and all goods the importation of which may be prohibited by proclamation, are prohibited imports. It further provides that - </para>

                        <para>All goods having thereon or therewith any false suggestion of any warranty, guarantee or concern in the production or quality thereof,  by  any persons, public officials, Government, or country, mineral oil and mineral spirits, unless imported under and subject to such restrictions as may be declared by proclamation.  are prohibited imports. The following section imposes a limited form of prohibition upon spirits, opium, tobacco, snuff, cigars, or cigarettes imported, except in packages as prescribed. Then follow certain provisions relating to the importation, of tea. Section 55 provides - </para>
                        <para>All goods lawfully prohibited to be imported into any State shall, as regards that State, be prohibited imports for the purposes of this Act. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Then section 56 declares - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The power of prohibiting importation of goods shall authorize prohibition subject to any specified condition or restriction, and goods imported contrary to any such condition or restriction shall be prohibited imports. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">When honorable senators contemplate these sections they will realize the extent to which we went in 1901 in taking to ourselves power to deal with prohibited imports. To ascertain the powers which we have taken to ourselves in the matter of exports, we must turn to sections111 and 112 of the principal Act. The former reads - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>No prohibited exports shall be exported. </para>
                        <para>Penalty : One hundred pounds. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Section 112 deals with the general exportation of military arms, &amp;c. I have quoted the extensive powers which we have taken/ to ourselves in regard to imports, and I wish honorable senators to remember that every civilized country has adopted similar precautions. Then I ask them to recollect that our exports are the imports of other countries. The provisions in the principal Act, to which I alluded in the earlier portion of my speech, relate to our method of dealing with the exports of those countries. Other countries, I repeat, are doing the same thing in reference to our exports as we are doing in reference to theirs, because our exports are their imports. Since the memorable Chicago meat scandals the severity and scope of the legislation of foreign countries in respect of imports have been increased. I would impress upon honorable senators that the price of the principal products that we export, depends very largely - as does also the sale of those products - upon the reputation which they bear in those countries. What could damage the reputation of any of our chief products more than the dissemination of the information throughout the world that some foreign country, in pursuance of powers similar to the very powers which we have taken to ourselves under our Customs Act, was prohibiting the importation of those products? Take our meat exports to Great Britain. We have to remember that there are powerful combinations throughout the world which are interested in the destruction of the Australian meat industry, and which would stop at nothing if they could deal an effective blow to our reputation in the world's markets. In those markets, too, our leather comes into direct and successful competition with the leather of other countries. The same remark is applicable to our butter. Under the laws of the countries to which we export our principal products, it is becoming increasingly possible - unless we take due precautions here - for our fair name and reputation to be blasted by the exercise of insufficient supervision upon this side of the world- by our allowing a cargo of those products to be shipped to some foreign country, and by that country preventing their importation. If such a thing occurred, the fact would be published throughout the world, and would damage, not merely the firms which had sent the diseased meat or damaged butter, for example, but the whole of our export trade. </para>

                            <para>- Which would be worse for our export trade - that a shipment of goods should be stopped at any of our ports, thus saving the exporter freight and insurance, or that, as the result of lax supervision, it should be stopped at the port of entry, by the importing country ? What are we doing ourselves in this matter? Under our Commerce Act we check the importation of' patent medicines. Where they bear a false trade description we prohibit their importation. Similarly, we prohibit the importation of foodstuffs which are deleterious or which are got up in a deleterious form. We check the importation of textiles which purport to be wool when they are a mixture of wool and cotton, and when, as a matter of fact, they sometimes contain more cotton than wool. We also lay down a standard as regards jewellery. If jewellery purports to be 15 carat gold, we say that it shall be 15 carat, otherwise it shall not be imported. In the first place, all these articles must bear a trade description, and that description must be an accurate one. Other countries are doing precisely the same thing. In these circumstances we ought to realize that the time has arrived when we should safeguard our export trade so as to prevent any person destroying the fair name of our products by sending out of this country diseased, or adulterated, or inferior articles. While what I have said in regard to the Commerce Act is true, all that that Act does is to declare that in regard to any article imported or exported the truth must be told. In other words, if it is inferior, adulterated, or diseased, that fact must be stated. </para>

                            <para>- Not under the existing law.- If there is to be any regulation of our exports that regulation ought to be uniform throughout the Commonwealth. It is obviously idle for any State to declare by legislation that every article exported from it must be up to the required standard. We know that the outside world does not regard our production from the stand-point of State boundaries. It regards them only as being Australian. It is either Australian butter or Australian jam. Consequently, we must deal with this question in a uniform fashion. Manifestly, no Department can deal with it better than can our Customs Department. That Department has its officers at all our principal ports. It is the practice of the Department not to rely entirely on the knowledge of Customs officers themselves in deciding upon the quality of- certain goods. It calls in the services of ex,perts That is the procedure which will be adopted under this Bill. There is another phase of this matter to which I desire to direct attention. It has reference to the protection of our native fauna. At present we have no power to prohibit the exportation of the plumage of non-edible birds. That power will be conferred by this Bill. Then the Customs officers assure us that they .are pretty positive that one of the Asiatic sections of the community is carrying on a fairly considerable trade in what is apparently stolen gold. Under this measure we shall be able to deal with that evil in co-operation with the States, and perhaps we shall be able to check it. We also propose to take power to stop prohibited exports from being transferred from one State to another. That is a very necessary power for us to possess. At present our officers may hold up a cargo of meat or jam or butter and prevent its export, and under this Bill we say that if' a cargo is too bad to permit of its being sent out of Australia, it is too bad to permit of it being transferred from one State to another. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> who brought under the notice of the Senate a case in which a shipment of exhausted tea, which had been held up in one State, was promptly transferred to another and there placed upon the market. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose that we should have to deal with them at the border stations, some of which are still in existence. I come now to the Bill itself. Under clause  5,  which repeals section  167  of the principal Act and substitutes a new section, it is desired to bring about a change of procedure in regard to payment of duty on articles as to which there is a dispute as to the proper amount to be charged. Briefly, the present procedure is this : In case of a dispute, first of all the duty claimed by the Department has to be deposited. Then the importer has to take action within six months. If his action be unsuccessful, the amount is retained as the proper duty. If no action be taken the amount is also retained. Under the existing procedure, the amounts so deposited were required to be paid into a trust fund ; and it is alleged that if the importers had cared to do so, and had come to a common understanding amongst themselves, they could practically have held up the revenue of the Commonwealth by simply claiming that the duties charged on their goods were not the proper duties. At the end of six months they need not have taken action, but in the meantime the Commonwealth could not have used the amounts paid in as part of the revenue of the country. </para>

What is proposed in the amending clause is that the duty shall be paid under protest, and the protest be marked on the entry. Then an action can be taken within six months, and the result will determine what amount of duty has to be paid. </para>

                            <para>- The procedure here proposed is considered to be more convenient for the Government. Another proposal made in this amending clause will be welcomed generally by the trading public. The jurisdiction which was previously confined to the High Court is now to be extended to any Commonwealth or State Court of competent jurisdiction j the jurisdiction, of course, being determined by the amount of the claim. The only exception -will be that the Department, in its own interest, will, where any question of principle is concerned, or any question involving a constitutional issue, take the case to the High Court. Another difficulty was created under the present section in regard to the operation of new Tariffs.. The practice has been that when Tariff resolutions were tabled in the House of Representatives the new duties became collectible. If a protest were entered on account of some duty payable under a resolution it was a moot question whether the six months' period dated from the time of the tabling of the resolution or from the passing of the Tariff. In one case that came before the High Court that .tribunal practically said that the .section, as far as it applied to that particular case, was of little or no value. Therefore the new clause provides that in regard to any duty collectible under a new Tariff the six months' time shall date from the passing of the Tariff and its being assented to by the Governor-General. </para>

                            <para>- The amendment of the law here proposed is in conformity with the judgment of the High Court' and with our own practical experience. We cannot follow a better guide than the judgment of the High Court, which will have to adjudicate upon our procedure in future cases. Clause 6 of the Bill is also important, although practically it only extends to prohibited exports the power which we now have as to dutiable imports. In other words, we already have these powers in regard to dutiable imports, and it is only logical, if we are going to take additional powers with regard to prohibited exports, that we should have the same power with respect to them as we have in regard to imports. Clause  7  extends the power of search in order to carry out effectively the work of the Department. Previously we had the power of search with regard to dutiable articles. This extends the. power. Clause 8 is really a matter of convenience to the Department, and does not interfere with the public generally. </para>

In regard to clause  9,  I wish to draw attention to the fact that we already have the power to arrest persons as to whom there is reasonable suspicion that they are smuggling goods. This clause is an extension of our powers in regard to smuggling, and has been found to be absolutely necessary, particularly with reference to opium smuggling. It' has been discovered that the ways of " the heathen Chinee " are sufficient to baffle the best efforts of the Customs officers. </para>

                            <para>- The Chinaman does not seem to lose any of his cleverness when he becomes christianized. At any rate, some extension of our powers is absolutely necessary in this regard. We therefore propose that any Customs officer or police officer may, without warrant, arrest any person who he has reasonable ground to believe is guilty of committing, or attempting to commit, or of being concerned in the commission of <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> smuggling, <inline font-style="italic">(p)</inline> importing any prohibited imports, <inline font-style="italic">(c)</inline> exporting any prohibited exports, or <inline font-style="italic">(d)</inline> unlawfully conveying or having in his possession any smuggled goods, prohibited imports or prohibited exports. Clause 10 also has relation to the same subject, and extends the powers of the Department in regard to those who connive at smuggling; that is to say, those who use their boats or ships knowingly for that purpose. In the past the Department has found itself in a peculiar position. Although it knew that a person was in possession of smuggled goods, it could not always succeed in prosecuting him. Also, although the Department knew perfectly well that a person was using his boat for the purpose of conniving at smuggling, it could not succeed in an action against him. This clause will enable that difficulty to be got over. It will prevent collusion between owners or masters of ships or boats with those who are smuggling or otherwise endeavouring to defeat the law. We are all desirous of protecting the revenue and seeing that the legitimate trader is not unfairly disadvantaged by those who have escaped payment of the proper duty. If the law in regard to smuggled opium is to continue to be so lax that smugglers can defeat our officers, the honest thing to do would be to remove the prohibition. Parliament, however, is not prepared to do that, and, therefore, we desire to have extended powers in order to prevent the smuggling of this drug. I tell the Senate frankly that we are taking extraordinary powers in proposed new section 233d which is contained in clause 11. Sub-clause 2 reads - </para>

                            <para>- I do not know. Under this measure the onus will lie upon the person in possession of such goods of proving that he did not import them. I have already said that the Customs officials assure us that they are not at present able to stop the importations of opium. In fact, we know from recorded police court prosecutions that Chinamen are frequently found smoking opium.  We know that it comes in. We have irrefutable proof of that, and we find that the imposition of fines has not the deterrent effect we expected, because people are willing to pay fabulous prices for this article. There is one punishment, however, which the section of Asiatics who indulge in the practice of opium smoking dread more than any other, and that is imprisonment. We are assured by those who know these people well that if we substitute imprisonment for fines, it will have a far more deterrent effect upon them. Honorable senators will :notice in these clauses that we make provision for substituting imprisonment for fines in such cases. Clauses 12 and 13 are largely formal. They are intended to bring about a more expeditious procedure for the convenience of the Department. They will not interfere in any way with the opportunities afforded to the importer or exporter to defend an action. Clause 14 is intended to obviate a necessity laid upon the Department by the existing law of publishing <inline font-style="italic">in extenso</inline> in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> all cases in. which they take action. Under this  clause it will be necessary only that the facts as to the action taken shall be published. That is all with which the public are concerned, and it is all that it should be necessary to publish. Clause 15 gives power for the making of regulations for specific purposes. I direct attention to the fact that we propose to take power to make regulations as to the nature, size, and material of ' packages in which imported goods, or goods for export, or goods for conveyance coastwise from one State to another, are wrapped or packed. This is as necessary as the power we are taking to deal with imports and exports themselves. Under this clause we shall be able to deal with the much-vexed question of the size of cornsacks. We have dealt with it partially already, but not entirely satisfactorily. The Customs authorities inform us that sugar is still being imported in large sacks, and also that maize is being imported from Java in large sacks. </para>

                            <para>- If wool is a proclaimed article, we shall, under this clause, have power to deal with the size or the material of woolpacks. But it is to be presumed that the measure will be administered by sane men, who will do nothing to injure one of our staple industries. All these powers are being sought in order to -protect, and not to injure, bur industries, and the measure will be administered in that spirit. We are taking power to frame regulations prescribing the conditions of preparation or manufacture for export of any articles used for food or drink by man, or used in the manufacture of articles used for food or drink by man, and also the conditions as to purity, soundness, and freedom from disease to be conformed to by goods for export. All these powers  ari.  found to be necessary, because, not only are foreign countries taking precautions to exercise a supervision over articles of export, but honorable senators who have been reading the cables during the last few weeks will have observed that a heated correspondence has been going on in the English papers, into which our Agents-General have been drawn, as to the conditions under which  sOme  of our exports are prepared and despatched to the world's markets. The question has been raised with respect to the conditions under which our exports - are shipped, but the people who have interested themselves in raising that question are just as likely to suggest that our meat is prepared for 'export under insanitary conditions. </para>

                            <para>- As I have said, a question has already been raised with respect to one of our exports, that it is prepared here and is shipped to the Old Country under insanitary conditions, and one of our Agents-General has been compelled to meet the charge in the press of the Old Country. A much more effective way of meeting such charges is to be able to point out that we have assumed, and are exercising, a power which enables us to give an absolute guarantee that our exports are prepared under conditions which secure soundness and purity. It may be contended that we might use this power to do this, that, and the other, but the answer to that is that the present Government are fully alive to the fact that if they do anything which would injure the exportation of the staple products of the country, the people to whom they are responsible would suffer. Are we likely to be so foolish or so mad as to use these extensive, but necessary, powers in such a way as to injure the people to whom we are responsible? To do so would be a short cut to political suicide. I have refrained from going into many of these questions as I should like to have done if we were not so near the close of the session, but I wish to impress upon the Senate that the Government are in possession of information which has made the introduction of this Bill at this juncture absolutely necessary. I say that with a due sense of responsibility. Because of certain representations made to us from quarters we cannot disregard, we are convinced that it would be dangerous to the Commonwealth to defer action in this matter any longer. If honorable senators require any assurance of that, I can give it to them, but they will recognise that there are reasons why it would be unwise to make certain statements on the floor of this Chamber. I assure honorable senators that these very wide powers must be given to the Customs Department if some of our industries are not to suffer seriously, and in the very near future. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall not occupy the time of the Senate long in the few remarks I wish to make on this Bill. I am in entire sympathy with nearly all that the Minister has said. Every member of the Senate must recognise that it is essential that, with our large export of primary and other products, we should see that they are placed upon the markets of the world under conditions which will enable us to command the best prices possible there. . The action of a few selfish and short-sighted individuals ought not to be allowed in any way, or in any circumstances, to damage the export trade of this country. I am, therefore, in entire sympathy with the purpose of this measure, and in favour of the extra police powers sought to strengthen the hands of the Department in dealing with those who would seek to break our Customs laws. But, while I agree with what the Minister has said in moving the second reading of the Bill, I have some doubts when I turn to the Bill itself. By interjection  1  indicated those doubts, and though the Minister dealt with the matter to some extent, he scarcely met my objection completely. I direct the attention of honorable senators to clause  4,  embracing the proposed new section  112.  There can be no possible objection to the Government taking whatever power is necessary to see that our exports are prepared and despatched under conditions providing for all that is necessary in the way of sanitation and cleanliness. But the proposed new section goes far beyond that. It proposes, for instance, that - </para>

" There can be no exception taken to prescribing conditions as to purity, soundness, and freedom from disease. We ought not to take power to prescribe anything more than is necessary for the purposes of the Bill. It may be desirable, as I think it is, and as the Senate has frequently said it is, to fix the rates of wages, the hours of labour, and the conditions of employment ; but this is not the right measure in which to do that. </para>

                            <para>- I am prepared to give all the power that is necessary for the purpose for which the Minister said he is seeking power. But I do not see that we are called upon to give him power to do something which he says he does not desire or intend to do. This matter becomes, to my mind, a little more serious in view of the declaration and the efforts which have been made by a certain section to restrain the export of some commodities. It is not long since a deputation asked the Minister to restrict the export of wheat and hides. In the language of the newspapers which reported the interviews, the Minister gave what was termed a sympathetic answer. A similar request was made in regard to the export of ores. When I know that a certain section is seeking to have that view embodied in a Statute, I am entitled to regard with some anxiety such a power as this when it is asked for by a Ministry which gave a sympathetic reply to a request of that kind. </para>

                            <para>-I thought that there would be a sympathetic response to that remark. In the main, I am sympathetic with the object of this proposal, but I would point out that we can allow sentiment to carry our legislation too far. It is today carrying us to a point in which it is constituting a real danger in Australia. In New South Wales, we have had an attempt made to preserve the emu. It is protected - with what result? Damage to the extent of thousands of pounds is done in the State, because the emu has become a pest. I do not know that the Commonwealth Government can do very much in that regard, but I hold that we can carry sentiment to an unreasonable length, as has been done in regard to that bird. </para>

                        <para>.- I think that this is a measure which should meet with the hearty approval of the Senate. The only point on which I felt some diffidence was in regard to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of proposed new section  112,  to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has referred. But after the straightforward statement of the Minister I think that the Senate ought to be satisfied. We all recognise that Australia will become a great exporting country. No precaution we take ought to be considered too extreme to see that our exports shall go out to the world in the best possible condition. We must always expect that a measure of this kind will be administered in a sane manner. It gives very large powers to the Minister, but I feel sure that they will not be used in an extreme manner except when that is absolutely necessary. Cases have come under my cognisance which show that additional powers are required. A great industry in Victoria is suffering from the want of sufficient power of search. I congratulate the Government on bringing in the Bill, antitrust that it will be passed by the Senate without delay. </para>

                        <para>. - The excellent speech delivered by. the Minister has removed some fears I had. I desire to call his attention to clause  5.  which substitutes a proposed new section for section  167  of the Customs Act. I think it is a great improvement indeed on that section, and I am glad to see it in the Bill. I believe that when I was perusing, sometime ago, the Customs Act of the United States, or the regulations thereunder, I noticed a similar provision. It was not contained in the Customs Act of Queensland, and I am glad to find that it is to be introduced into the Customs Act of the Commonwealth. I believe that it will be welcomed by the importers and the public as a fair, just, and satisfactory mode of settling <inline font-style="italic">bonâ fide</inline> disputes between importers and the Commonwealth. With? regard to a large and increasing export, namely, that of meat, I asked by interjection for an example, and the Minister very wisely checked me, stating that if we want to know the reason we can find it. That is always a nice way of dealing with a question of that kind, and once a man receives such an answer he knows exactly where he is. I compliment the Minister on the way in which he checked me. Whilst a great deal is said about the care which we should have for the export of our primary products, it is quite easy to bring in alarmist legislation. The Minister's speech, however, was tactful and cautious. He saw the difficulty and admitted the possibility of excesses. We compliment him in that regard, and now practically give him a free hand. With regard to a good deal that is said about Australian meat, I may say that at the time of the Chicago scandal Australian exporters were to some extent to blame for the retribution which is now sought to be meted out to us. I had it on absolute authority at the time that the Chicago exporters asked Australian exporters not to raise that cry. We all know how it arose. A person wrote a sensational book, and in view of its publication a lot of State and Federal legislation was proposed. While that was being done, our exporters were joining in the cry, until the American exporters asked them to remain silent and to request an impartial investigation of the matter. That information was given to me in writing, and I had complete evidence on that point that the American exporters wished for an impartial investigation. I have only sounded that note now because, while we may pass legislation which in the main I approve of, we have to be very careful not to yield to hysteria. I desire to call the Minister's attention to clause 15 repealing section 270 of the Customs Act, under which - </para>

I had a, good deal of sympathy, as I stated at the time, with so much of our legislation as prevented waterside workers from taking on their shoulders bags containing 3 or 4 cwt. of any article. I think that, to a very large extent, the Minister who moved in that humane direction was right. I believe that if those who objected to his action had to hump bags containing. 250 or 350 lbs. on their shoulders they would be a little more sympathetic. I agree with the intention of this clause, but in the light of the Minister's explanation I see where an injury may be done. Suppose that goods are imported in packages weighing 6, 7, or 8 cwt., or, indeed, 4, 5, or 6 tons. Of course, the </para>

If that provision be intended to prevent men being forced to hump packages upon their backs weighing 3 or 4 cwt., well and good. But if, on the contrary, it is designed to prevent large packages, weighing <inline font-style="italic">6</inline> or 7 cwt., being removed from the hold of a vessel by machinery, so as to enable the men to enforce their claims, it is manifestly unjust. The Minister has stolen a large amount of the thunder which I intended to use in my criticism of this clause. No doubt he will guard this provision carefully by means of regulations. But those regulations will require to be closely scrutinized. I sympathize with the general object of the Minister, and with the efforts of previous Ministers, to extend reasonable relief to our waterside workers. </para>

                            <para>. - I do not think that this clause ought to be agreed to in its present form. It is one of those numerous provisions the effect of which is invariably shown by regulations. Whilst it is true that a little while ago we improved our facilities for dealing with regulations, the fact remains that if regulations under this Bill are framed at the beginning of next year they will remain in force till about next September, without anybody having an opportunity to criticise them. They will become law without any member of this Parliament being able to appeal against them. The clause is an extremely drastic one. Under it, the Minister may materially affect the importation of any class of goods into Australia. It means that there will have to be a delegated Excise officer in every European house from which goods are imported. Otherwise the most minute particulars will have to be supplied to London and the European houses in regard to the nature, size, and material of the packages in which imported goods may come into Australia. Further, all sorts of restrictions may be imposed upon the method of packing such goods, and upon their coverings, and the quality of those coverings. In other words, if the Minister chose to do so, he could absolutely stop importation into the Commonwealth; I see no reason why such extreme powers should be vested in any Minister. There is no limit to what might be done under such a provision. The Government might issue regulations which would practically prohibit the importation of any class of goods. I venture to say that the clause will create endless confusion, because every importer will require to give information to the house from which he imports as to the nature, size, and the material of the packages in which goods may be imported. He will also require to inform it of all sorts of conditions which will be embodied in the regulations relative to the coverings in which goods must be wrapped, and as to the quality and size of such coverings. </para>

                            <para>- With those conditions I am heartily in accord, because they are intended to enforce the observance of honesty. But this clause will give the Ministry power to impose all sorts of embarrassing restrictions. The trouble in regard to this clause is that in consequence of regulation after regulation being made under it, there will be a perfect volume of correspondence between people in Australia who import goods and people in England from whom they import them. There will be a hundred and one vexatious proceedings under it. I admit that the clause is wide enough to meet every possible form of grievance, but it gives such drastic powers, and may be enforced in such extraordinary ways, that it will hamper trade in all directions.

I told the Senate that at present sugar and maize are imported from Java in large sacks, which have to be carried on the shoulders of men. When these sacks get into the country they are used again for the export of wheat. We desire, after giving ample notice, to prohibit the importation of either sugar or maize in sacks of that large size. </para>

It has been found by the Department that the Chapman regulations in regard to the size of cornsacks are defeated to some extent, and we therefore require greater power to prohibit effectively the use of the large sack. </para>

                        <para>- This very important subject is now before the Senate for the third time, and the Bill ought not to go through without some comment. I realize that resistance is absolutely useless, but some criticism should be made, if only with the  object of  asking how far legislation  of this  class is to go. A drastic Act, having for its object the preservation of Australian industries, was passed in 1906.At a later date, an amending Act was passed, strengthening the original measure. It seems to me that the industries of Australia have been undergoing a course of preservation which before we are done with them ought to be sufficient to make an Egyptian mummy green with envy. The matter of Australian industries preservation is being used for political purposes  by  every demagogue or aspirant for parliamentary honours, and the phrase is trotted out like"that blessed word Mesopotamia," in company with phrases about Tories, reactionaries, and others of the kind. I ask the Minister whether this is to be the last of the series of enactments by which Australian industries are to be preserved safely and finally ? After we had passed the Act of 1906, which was a very drastic and comprehensive measure, the cry arose that Australian industries were still unpresented. Indeed, it was said that they were being strangled. Parliament had to preserve them from strangulation. But somehow or other they are still in danger, and another Act must now be passed. We have no sooner finished saving Australian industries from strangulation than still another cry is raised, and this Bill has been introduced in order that they may be preserved again. I should like to know when the Australian industries will have done with this wonderful process of preservation, and when they will be allowed to find their own level, and stand on their own footing. I shall not trouble the Senate by referring to the purpose of two or three of the measures with which we have already dealt, but I shall speak of some of the objects of this amending Bill. It is proposed  by this measure to amend section 4 of the principal Act. That section provides that any person who makes or enters into any contract " with intent to restrain trade or commerce to the detriment of the public " shall be liable to certain penalties. The Government propose to amend the section by leaving out the words " to the detriment of the public." I was glad to hear i"he Minister say that there are some combines whose operations are not to the detriment of the public. But why, in the face of that admission, the Government should propose to prosecute people merely for comi.ning in trade, irrespective of whether their operations are to the detriment of the public or not, I am unable to understand. In this matter I think, and I do not mind saying that I hope, the Government will find themselves just where they were before. It is proposed, under the Bill, that it shall be sufficient in a prosecution for the Government to aver that a contract has been made in restraint of trade, and from the explanation given by the Minister, 1 am disposed to think that the Government will find themselves impaled on the horns of a dilemma, which will be 'created by this measure. I regard clause 2 of this Bill as a standing illustration of the mockery and sham that is behind much of this legislation. The Government propose to amend paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> of sub-section 1, of section 4 of the principal Act, by inserting before the words " with intent to destroy or injure" the words " to the destruction or injury of." And if amended as proposed the paragraph will read - </para>

                    <para class="block">I dare say that this matter will, sooner or later, get to the High Court, and it will be for the High Court, and not for us, to interpret the provision. The Minister has shirked the difficulty, and we have had no attempt at a legal explanation of the difference in effect of the principal Act, as it stands, and as it will be amended, if this Bill is passed. I do not mind saying that when this Bill is passed, we shall be pretty well where we were before. The reason is that this Parliament has not sufficient information on which to. base legislation of this kind, and we cannot get it until some case is taken to the High Court, and we have the final judgment of that Court upon every section of our Commonwealth legislation under which a combine is prosecuted. We cannot get that information.  The course pursued in the United States has been to secure decisions of the Supreme Court in connexion with some of the measures which have been passed in that country. But there is no parallel in the United States, or in any country in the world, for such continuous amending legislation of the same kind to secure a judgment of the High Court as we have here, when the matters upon which we require a judgment have never been brought before the High Court. </para>

                            <para>- There is an important departure proposed in this. Bill, which is probably due to some United States decisions: I refer to the provision for continuous penalties. Under previous legislation of the kind a penalty of ^500 was fixed for an offence, and there it ended; but, under this Bill, it is proposed that for every day during which the offence is continued, from the time the prosecution makes its averment, the penalty is to be repeated. In dealing with the matter, the Minister referred to a case that occurred in the United' States, in which this course was adopted; but he did not tell the Senate that in one big case in which that was attempted the Supreme Court of the United States decided that the whole proceedings were <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of the Constitution. An amendment of section 7 of the principal Act is proposed. The section reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">The burden of proof of intent is to be removed from the prosecution and thrown upon the defendant. I suppose that the Government think that this will be conclusive. There are two classes of prosecution intended under the principal Act - prosecutions for penalties, and in the case of indictable offences. Prosecutions for penal-  ties may, under the principal Act, and under this Bill, be heard before a Justice of the High Court, without a jury; but the number of offences which may be prosecuted before a Justice of the High Court without a jury is enlarged in this Bill. This means, if I am correct in my interpretation, that the number of indictable offences to be tried before a Justice of the High Court, with a jury, is to be reduced. It is a grave question whether the whole form and procedure of trial by jury for indictable offences can be altered by a measure of this kind. A trial before a jury for an indictable offence has a distinct meaning under the Constitution. The intention in preserving under the Constitution the right to trial by jury for an indictable offence was to place a distinct obligation upon the Crown. Yet in measure after measure submitted to, and passed by, this Parliament, we have provided that the obligation of the Crown to prove intent in prosecutions for indictable offences may be removed. I say that, in the case of an indictable offence under the Constitution, we cannot shift the onus of proof. What was the object in preserving trial by jury to the people of the Commonwealth in the case of indictable offences? </para>

                            <para>- That may be so; but I intend to say something on this question. I think it is well worth while to direct attention to this hasty legislation, which, I think, is playing down to the gallery. There is another question to which I should like to refer. I indicated it by interjection when the Minister of Defence was speaking. I mentioned a certain case, and asked how far it would apply. The Bill contains some amendments which deal with discovery. The original Act of 1906, the amending Act of 1908, the amending Act of 1909, and this Bill deal with discovery. There is a case before the. High Court in which that important point came up on an interlocutory proceeding. I wish to know from the Minister whether this Bill is intended to facilitate discovery in a case where it has been denied by a Justice of the High Court. I am aware that I am dealing with a very delicate question. The judgment of a Justice of the High Court has been given on this point, and it is an unfortunate coincidence for the Government that this Bill contains provision with regard to the discovery of documents which may or may not be used in a case which is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> It is very hard for the Minister, and it may be hard for the Crown Law officers, to say exactly how far the Bill may apply when a Justice of the High Court has denied discovery under the Act. What I mean by that expression is that he has denied discovery for the purpose of preparatory proceedings to the trial. I am inclined to think that, so far as the Government seek to enforce the continuing penalties, the Bill probably will not apply to a case which is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> But so far as the procedure under this measure may be used as evidence to convict persons who are before the Court now, it is very difficult to say whether the Crown could use it in order, at the trial, to get those persons, so to speak, within the meshes of the law. If it is intended to be used, or will be used, in order to enable the Crown to get into its meshes some persons whom it thinks it ought to have prosecuted, but whom it could not, when it entered the process under the Act, bring before the Court, no matter who the persons are or what their evidence is, it is treating them worse than any criminal ought to be treated. I draw attention to the judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs, because it is doubtful whether the Crown has brought in the Bill in order to apply it in these circumstances. I do not know if that is their intention. If they choose, possibly they can do so. Even if they make that attempt there will be difficulties in the way. I desire to raise a warning against any attempt at what may be called <inline font-style="italic">expost facto</inline> legislation on this subject. I hope it will be found afterwards that those who are before the Court will remain to be tried and punished by the Acts which we have already passed, and which they are supposed to have broken. I have marked a passage or two in the judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs, because I think it is well, on a matter of discovery, that the public and the Senate should know how jealously these privileges have been guarded in Parliament and elsewhere, and how clearly they have been asserted by  His  Honor. </para>

                            <para>- That is the very point I want to emphasize. I think that there is a tendency in this Bill to destroy the law of evidence.

                        <para>I come now to a question of considerable moment, but not, I think, when carefully examined, attended with any real doubt. The Crown applied for a direction that the defendants should make discovery of documents, lt must be distinctly understood that this application stands apart from any connexion with the particulars. I mean that it was not put on the ground that the particulars asked for could not be supplied, except after the defendants made discovery. The contention was put broadly and plainly that, this being a civil action, the Crown is entitled to get discovery of documents as a substantive right, and the defendants, if they desire to protect any particular documents from production, have to take the objection in the ordinary way, swearing to the tendency to criminate or penalize, as to which the Court would judge. The question is so important to these proceedings, and as a precedent, that I consider it desirable to state my reasons explicitly'. </para>
                        <para class="block">After stating his reasons explicitly he referred to the law of England and quoted case after case. He dealt with the arguments advanced by the Crown for the discovery of documents by which a defendant might criminate himself, and after dismissing them he pointed out that when you are asking for the discovery of documents for the purpose of enforcing a penalty you are not in the position of an ordinary plaintiff in a civil action, nor even is the defendant in the ordinary position of a defendant in a civil action, when the plaintiff, even the Crown, is pursuing a penalty. At the end of his judgment <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs summed up the position in this way - </para>
                        <para>Plainly, then, it is the result to the defendant, and not the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the plaintiff, that affects the determination of the Court, and the statement of the law on the subject, down to 1st March,1910, is thus summarized in Lord Halsbury's <inline font-style="italic">Laws of England,</inline> vol. 11, at p. 41 : " In civil proceeding where the action is brought merely to establish a forfeiture or enforce a penalty discovery will not be allowed, and if allowed may be resisted." Subsequently to that date, in April of the present year, the principle was again relied on by three, probably four, Justices of the Court of Appeal. In <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> a <inline font-style="italic">Debtor</inline> (1910 2 K.B, 59) decided that the petitioning creditor in a bankruptcy petition cannot before the hearing of the petition obtain an order for interrogatories or discovery. Fletcher Moulton, L.J., said - "When the real issue is of a penal nature neither discovery or interrogatories will be allowed." And he considered the loss of civil status was a penal consequence, to which the rule applied. Farell, L.J., and Buckley, L.J., expressly, and Kennedy, L.J., apparently, also agreed with him on this point. </para>
                        <para>In view of these clear and undeviating authorities, I am bound to refuse the application to compel the defendants to give discovery. Two or three references are apposite to the suggestion that the defendants would in fact be sufficiently protected by the subsequent refusal to order production. There is the observation of Lord Lindley in <inline font-style="italic">Martin</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Treacher</inline> (16 Q.B.D. atp. 513), and the similar statement of Chitty, L.J., in <inline font-style="italic">Moxborough case</inline> (1897, 2 Q.B., at  p.  121), that in such a case the proper course is to stop the matter <inline font-style="italic">in limine;</inline> and the other reference is to that of Lord Coleridge, C.J., in <inline font-style="italic">Jones' case</inline> (22 Q.B.D.,' at p. 428), that if the suggested course were taken the very mischief sought to be prevented would ensue. Said the learned L.C.J.- " The whole case for the plaintiff may depend upon his power to trace a particular document into the possession of the defendant, and upon its non-production to prove its contents by secondary evidence." </para>
                        <para>Nothing short of a distinct legislative provision to the contrary can overcome a principle so deeply rooted and consistently enforced, and as there is no such relevant provision, I must take the law as I find it. </para>

You may ask a man to discover documents over and over again, but  His  Honour has stated that in the absence of an express provision in a law that request cannot be enforced.

                            <para>- Then, why did the honorable senator speak? It is very difficult to say what may happen in a case of this kind. The Bill will probably pass without a division. My contention is that, before we were asked to make this drastic alteration of the law, we ought to have had a complete case tried in every portion of its bearings before the High Court, and with a decision from that  body we should have had the law tested from every point of view - from the issue of the writ right through the interlocutory proceedings until the final judgment was given. If that course had been pursued under any one of the very drastic Acts we have passed Parliament would have had for its. guidance something which the Constitution contemplated that it should have, namely, an interpretation from the High Court, whose decision would have enabled us to understand why the law was defective, and probably would have suggested a course of procedure by which we could, supply the deficiency, if we thought that it should be supplied. </para>

                            <para>- Is it not better to delay than to seek to enmesh any of these trusts or combines by treating them unjustly? I recognise that this is a work of supererogation on my part. One might as well beat the air as address these remarks to the Minister. I have only been tempted to make them in order to direct attention to the fact that if the proposed amendment of the law be prompted by a desire to interfere with a case which is at present <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> it is a prostitution of justice and a grossly tyrannical abuse of the powers of a parliamentary majority. I hope that the Government do not contemplate influencing the course 'of justice in the case in question by <inline font-style="italic">ex -post facto</inline> legislation. That is expressly forbidden under the Constitution of the United States. It may be that the Minister will reply that he does not know whether this Bill will, or will not, apply to any case which may at present be before the Court. On the other hand, he may say that the course of justice will not be interfered with by it. If he makes the latter declaration, I shall welcome it. But if the measure be intended to accomplish any other purpose, I have discharged my duty by pointing out the danger of this kind of legislation. </para>

If there are combines or trusts which have broken the law as it exists to-day, let them be prosecuted under that law. But it will be a disgrace to Commonwealth legislation if this Bill be used to provide further facilities foi prosecuting persons who are at present- before the Court, or against whom prosecutions may be in progress. The Minister of Defence, in introducing the measure, said that it was founded, not upon the legislation of the United States, but upon certain judgments of the Supreme Court of that country. In other words, he is importing those decisions into the Bill to enable him to successfully prosecute certain combines. I object to the measure being made retrospective. </para>

                            <para>- I would not touch a dog in the street by <inline font-style="italic">ex post facto</inline> legislation. Those who are familiar with the history of the United States during the past twelve or fifteen years know that many of the prosecutions which have been undertaken against combines there were political prosecutions. They were instituted for the temporary advantage of a political party. Many of them were mere shams. That fact must be borne in mind. I regret that the Minister of Defence went so far as 10 say that as the principal Act, which was based upon the Sherman Act, had proved to be defective, he had actually imported into this Bill some of the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. Has he imported into it the mere <inline font-style="italic">obiter dicta</inline> of the Judges of that Court, or has he imported into it the judgments of that tribunal? I do not expect the Minister to reply to my question now ; indeed, I do not think that even the Attorney-General, if he were present, would care about answering it forthwith. Apparently, the Australian Industries Preservation Act is like " the blessed word Mesopotamia." It is to be used by every reactionary, and is to be made the mere sport of political parties. I welcome the judgment of the High Court on the question of discovery, because it points out what are the rights of defendants, and what have been their rights for a long time when the Crown seeks to enforce the imposition of penalties against them. I again ask the Minister to say whether this legislation is intended to deal with any case which is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice?</inline></para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) [10.9].- At this period of the evening I do not' propose to detain honorable senators by speaking at any great length. Unfortunately, I labour under the disadvantage of not having heard the speech which was delivered by the Minister of Defence in moving the second reading of the Bill. But I recognise that, as we have enacted a law to restrain monopolies and protect Australian industries, it is our duty, if we find that law defective, to endeavour to make it effective. But, in discharging that duty, we should observe the principle which for many years has underlain our system of jurisprudence in the matter of the prosecution and determination of alleged offences. That principle is that no man should be deemed guilty until his guilt has been proved. But we have, in certain instances, departed from that principle by declaring that no man shall be presumed to be innocent until he has established his innocence. The judgment of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. "Justice</inline>
                        Isaacs, which has been quoted by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline>
                        Ledger, shows that the feeling of the Court is not to push these assumptions to the extreme to which some honorable senators wish. Where an attempt is made to commit a man to a term of imprisonment for an alleged offence, it is highly undesirable that he should be convicted unless there is reasonable evidence upon which his conviction can be founded. The mere fact of a man being charged with an offence should not be sufficient to secure his conviction. But, under our Australian Industries Preservation Act, we say that if an offence is alleged against an individual, the onus of proof shall lie upon him. In other words, he has to prove that he is innocent. It is not for the Crown to prove that he is guilty. The judgment which was given the other day emphasizes the danger of such extreme legislation. It shows that if the Crown be vested with extreme powers, the interests of the accused person ought to be as carefully guarded against the inroads of the Crown as they can be within the words of the Statute.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline>
                        Ledger has asked whether it is intended to utilize this Bill to deal with cases which are at present

                        Unquestionably, if those cases are pending when the measure becomes law, it will be possible to take advantage of the powers which are embodied in it. I have no doubt in my own mind that that is the intention of the Government. They find that, as the law stands, they have been prevented from proceeding in the way that they desired, and consequently they are seeking stronger powers. I think that we ought to follow the usual course by providing that, the Bill shall not apply to cases which are at present before the Courts. Whatever offences individuals may be charged with having committed were committed by them under the law which, exists to-day, and it would be manifestly unfair to make the Bill retrospective. Under this measure, the Government are going to create an artificial offence. Fifty men may have committed the offence here created, but it would be manifestly unfair to punish them for doing a thing which was not illegal at the time they did it.

                            <para>- But the question is whether the Government are not causing an act which was formerly legal to become illegal by means of legislation. The British principle in dealing with criminal offences is never to allow legislation which is passed to-day to apply to a matter which took place before the legislation was passed. What is generally meant by an illegal act is one which is contrary to moral principle and common justice. Let me direct attention to another matter. This Bill is intended to amend an Act which was passed " for the preservation of Australian industries and the repression of destructive monopolies." Although the Bill is cited as " The Australian Industries Preservation Act  1910,"  still it appears tome that it contains provisions which are not in conformity with the Act of  1906.  Originally it was provided that any person who engaged in a combination in relation to trade and commerce with other countries, or among the States, with intent to restrain trade and commerce to the detriment of the public was guilty of an offence. But under this Bill it is proposed to omit the words " to the detriment of the public," and to insert the words "in restraint of trade or" before the words " with intent to restrain." So that now it is intended to provide that if an action is in fact in restraint of trade it is punishable whether done with the intention to restrain trade or not. The mere act of restraining trade is to be made an offence, without regard to whether it is to the detriment of the public or not. Can it be said that a monopoly which restrains commerce is necessarily a destructive monopoly, unless it can be shown to be to the detriment of the public? I submit that it is not a reasonable thing to deal with the subject in this way, because many so called monopolies may fairly be regarded as beneficial to the public and not to their detriment. The whole gist and gravamen of the offence is that what is done is to the injury of the public. If nobody is injured, why should the act be punishable? If we are to pass legislation of this description, actions which do no harm to anybody, and which, indeed, may be necessary, may be punished as offences. Surely we are getting altogether beyond what is reasonable. I ask the Minister in charge of the Bill whether he can point to legislation in any country that provides that any act which is in restraint of trade, but not to the detriment of the public, is punishable? It has been left to the imagination of the Commonwealth Parliament to create an offence out of an act which does nobody any injury. I feel sure that we are going too far in this direction. Then, take the clause with regard to prosecutions and fines. It is proposed to add to the principal Act a sub-section providing that it shall be a defence to a proceeding for an offence, and an answer to an allegation that a contract was made or entered into in restraint of trade, or with intent to restrain trade or commerce, if the party alleged to have offended proves that the matter or thing alleged to have been done was not to the detriment of the public, and that the restraint of trade was not unreasonable. The individual proceeded against has to prove that his action was not to the detriment of the public, and was not in. restraint of trade to an unreasonable degree, thus throwing the onus, of proof on him. Section 7 of the principal Act provides a punishment for persons who attempt to monopolize any part of trade and commerce with other countries with intent to control the supply of commodities to the detriment of the public. It is proposed to amend that provision by leaving out the words " with intent to control to the detriment of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> public the supply or price of any service, merchandise, or commodity." So that a man will become guilty of an offence if he monopolizes, or attempts to monopolize, any trade or commerce, although he may have no intent to create a monopoly. _ I admit that the Government have the right to make the law effective, but I deny that they have the right to create an offence out of an action which may not be to the injury of any portion of the community. Here we are unnecessarily and harshly creating an offence, and rendering the law more difficult to comply with. I do not object to proposed new section 14a. which simply aims at doing away with technicalities. I have always thought that it is wise to ride rough-shod over technicalities, so long as the alleged offence charged is definite, and the man charged may know what he is charged with. But I strongly object to the provision contained in proposed new section 146, making a man answer in response to interrogations admissible in evidence against him in proceedings for an alleged offence under the Act. Under this Bill the Government are creating certain criminal offences involving penalties and, .possibly, imprisonment, and at the same time they propose to put interrogatories to the person charged with the object of eliciting from him whether he has committed the offence or not. It is not proposed at present to put the thumbscrew on the individual, but it is proposed to put him on his oath, and to make him understand that he will be liable to a prosecution for perjury if he does not give correct answers to questions which, nevertheless, may tend to criminate him, the purpose of the Government being to obtain from the man himself evidence to bring about his own conviction. That is not just. It may be right to go so far as to administer interrogatories. But it is not right to create an offence and then administer interrogatories to the individual for the purpose of using his replies to obtain his conviction. Honorable senators must realize that this Bill will be a very strong incentive to perjury. We are proposing to tell a man that he must answer certain questions, and that if he tells us the truth in answering those questions we shall punish him for having committed the offence. He may arrive at the conclusion that if he does not tell the truth it will be more difficult to convict him of perjury than of the offence with which he is charged, and we may therefore be unable to get reliable evidence. This legislation is calculated to promote deceit and fraud on the part of the community affected by it. Men subjected to examination under a provision of this kind may be tempted to make statements which they would not dream of making in ordinary circumstances. It is not fair to place any man in such a position. With respect to minutes of the meetings of companies, it is proposed to provide that- </para>

                    <para class="block">The greatest extent to which we ought to go in such a matter is to regard such a minute as <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> evidence only. My name may be inserted in a minute-book as having been present at a meeting in respect of which a prosecution may lie. I may have been  100  miles away at the time, but the insertion of my name in the minute-book will, under this Bill, be regarded as evidence, and not merely <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> evidence, that I was present at the meeting. An honorable senator interjected just now that if any person commits an offence we should adopt every means to prove him guilty of it, in order that he may be punished, or that steps may be taken to prevent a repetition of the offence. But what is the principle of law which every lawyer has learned by rote, and nearly every layman? It is that no man is held to be guilty until he has been proved guilty. The reasons for the adoption of that principle are not fanciful reasons. They are based upon the experience of the administration of the law, from the time when torture was used to extort a confession from a man up to the present. </para>

I have felt that some of the laws which we have passed are unfair and unjust. In the first instance of this class of legislation we were told that we might rely upon the Minister administering the law with discretion. I have lost all confidence in the discretion of Ministers in instituting certain prosecutions. Parliament should be very careful in passing legislation making it difficult for a person to defend himself when charged with an offence of which he has not been guilty. </para>

                            <para>- It is not the remedy which the honorable senator would suggest. I think I can see several ways in which it would be possible to evade some, at least, of the provisions of this Bill. It may require a little ingenuity, but I think it will be found that they can be evaded, and I suppose that the Government will then propose that they should be given further powers. I hold the opinion that in this kind of legislation we are not acting fairly as between the community and the Government of the day. I say that without any desire whatever to shield any individual who has committed a breach of the law as laid down by Parliament, although his action may have been legal before that law was passed. </para>

                        <para>. - I  wish to avail myself of this motion to explain that I was out in the gardens adjoining the building this afternoon when the division was taken on the third reading of the Constitution Alteration (Legislative Powers; Bill, and the bell that usually warns honorable senators that a division is about to take place did not ring. That is the reason why I was not present to record my vote on that very important measure. I wish also to take advantage of this opportunity to explain an incident that has been made a good deal of in Tasmania, in a way which reflects upon the Labour party as a whole. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was speaking the other day he said, amongst other things, that he had little hope of being able to change the opinions of honorable senators on this side. I jocularly interjected that he might change our opinions, but he could not change our votes, and mentioned that he had probably heard that before. My reference was to an old story with which, probably, most members of the Senate are conversant. A Conservative member of the Imperial Parliament who had sat for the same constituency for a great many years was asked if, during his lengthy service, he had never heard a speech from a Liberal member that had made him change his opinions regarding Liberalism.  His  reply was, " Yes, I have heard many speeches that have changed my opinions, but I have never heard one that has changed my vote." My interjection has been used in the press in different parts of Australia to suggest that the members of the Labour party are bound hard and fast. It is contended that, no matter how eloquent and. convincing arguments from the other side may be, they cannot in any circumstances change the votes of honorable senators on this side. </para>

The Constitution lays it down that on any of the matters on which we have authority to legislate the Federal Act shall prevail over any State Act with which it is in conflict. The Defence Bill only applies to persons who are under the age of twenty-six years, because it contains no provision for universal training. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. If a warder happened "to be under the age of twenty -six years he would have to comply with the Defence Act as regards training, unless, of course, he was exempt. If anybody interfered with him there are penalty clauses which could be enforced, and the Federal law could, of course, be enforced, notwithstanding any State law or regulation .or Premier to the contrary. Warders are not exempt from training, but, of course, in time of war they are exempt. As regards my telegram to the. Premier of Western Australia, I have not yet received a reply. I shall take an opportunity when I am in that State to try to get the matter adjusted amicably. </para>

                        <para>- Before I put the question I desire to mention that, so far as the Senate is concerned, there is no bell, and never has been' a bell, in the garden to summon -honorable senators to a division. There is a bell in the garden which, .1 believe, is rung when a division is about to he taken in the other House. I have merely made this statement because I do not wish any honorable senator to be under <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> wrong impression. </para>
