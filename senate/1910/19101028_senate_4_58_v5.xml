            <inline font-weight="bold">-Colonel Sir ALBERT</inline>GOULD (New South Wales) [10.34].- This is rather an important provision with regard to the acquisition of land. It provides that, for the protection of the revenue against undervaluation, certain steps may be taken for the forfeiture of any land which has been valued to the extent of 25 per cent, less than the Commissioner of Land Tax considers to be the unimproved value. It is a very drastic provision, because there may be very many mistakes made with regard to valuations. Since this Bill was introduced I have received letters from gentlemen in Sydney, who point out the great difficulty there is, even with expert valuers, in arriving at a correct valuation. They gave the particulars of a property in Sydney, which had been referred to two of its leading firms of valuers, for the purpose of giving a valuation. One firm valued the property at from , £6,000 to £7,000, and the other at from £10,000 to £11,000. </para>

          <para>- No, they were both acting in the same interest. Their attention was called to the difference in the valuations, and each firm insisted that its valuation did not require any reconsideration. These valuations were not made by little firms which sprung up yesterday, but by two of the leading firms in Sydney, which are invariably employed by the Government for the purpose of making valuations, or, if not by them, by the other side. </para>

          <para>- Both firms are as competent as any valuers in Australia. If either of the firms went into Court and gave a valuation, it would be accepted with little or no question. Of course, if the two firms went into Court together it would be for the Court to endeavour to reconcile the valuations, or find from intrinsic evidence where the mistake had arisen, because clearly there must be some mistake in the case I mentioned. It shows that even in the case of a small property, worth less than £12,000, it is possible for two good reliable valuators to differ in opinion to the extent of fully a third of its value. </para>

          <para>.- It may be that Arbitration Courts do that. I know that a great many persons imagine that a resort to arbitration is only a means of bringing persons together in order to have their difference settled by splitting it, giving a little to each, but the whole to neither. But that is beside the question now. I have only cited the case to accentuate the harshness and unfairness of enacting that, if a man makes a mistake of this character, he shall thereupon be regarded as having committed a fraudulent act, and rendered himself liable to certain proceedings. If a mistake of that kind can be made between two men in regard to a city property, which is worth only  £12,000,  how much more likely is it for a mistake to be made with regard to the valuation of a property worth  £60,000  or  £70,000?  It is a very serious step indeed to penalize land-owners in this way. Under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of the clause, the Commissioner may apply to the High Court for a declaration that the Commonwealth is entitled to acquire the land of a man under this Act, and then the Judge has the right to make the declaration applied for, when the property passes to the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>- Of course he has, for we have not yet reached that stage when we condemn a man unheard, although we are moving in that direction. Is the Minister satisfied that, in any circumstances, the High Court has power to make such a declaration? We know that, under the Constitution as it stands - I do not know how it may stand by-and-by - no portion of a State can be taken away without its consent, and the Commonwealth can only take a property for a public purpose. If it wants to erect a post-office or a fortification, or to provide a drill ground, it is entitled, and very properly so, too, to resume land for that public purpose. But is it to be said that because the Commonwealth possesses that right it should take the power, in the face of the Constitution, to have a declaration made by the High Court that it is entitled to the ownership of land, not for a public purpose, but simply to punish a man whom the Commissioner may consider has attempted to defraud the revenue? If it is possible to enact this provision, and mistakes in valuations are made by the owners, the Government may acquire lands all over the Commonwealth, and do just as it likes with them. </para>

      <para class="block">Under that provision the Government of the Commonwealth may acquire any land in any of the States on which an undervaluation has been made, if they get the order from the Court. If the State Minister says that the State wants the land, the Commonwealth Government may say, "You are entitled to it if you pay the Commonwealth its value, and all the expenses incurred in connexion with it." If the State Minister does not agree to do that, the Commonwealth Government may deal with the land as they think fit. They may devote it to a public purpose, or they may deal with it in any other way they please, and so evade the provisions of the Constitution as to the resumption of lands by the Commonwealth. I would ask, where is the need for a provision of this kind, in view of the fact that, as soon as the debt becomes due, the Crown is in a position to enforce its claim, without resorting to any steps of this kind? By the ordinary procedure upon a judgment the land might be sold in a public auction, through a sheriff of a State, and the Commonwealth Government might recover what was due to them in that way. The constitutionality of this method of the acquisition of land by the Commonwealth is questionable, and it might lead to the Commonwealth being saddled with a number of areas of land for which it might have no use. In my opinion, it would be far better to delete this clause. There are other pains and penalties which, under this Bill, may be inflicted upon a mau who has made an honest mistake. </para>

      <para class="block">It should be remembered that an indictable offence sometimes involves seclusion from the public eye for a term. The penalty provided in the clause before the Committee is ,£500, and treble the amount of the tax, or the forfeiture of the land in respect of which the offence is committed, or any part thereof. Under this Bill, the undervaluation of land to the extent of 25 per cent, is regarded as <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> evidence of fraud. I shall not debate clause 68 at this stage, but I have cited it to show the further steps which may be taken by the Government to protect the revenue against any attempted evasion of the tax, even though it may be due to neglect or carelessness. In view of the terms of the Constitution, I say that we ought not in a Bill of this character to make provision for the compulsory resumption of land, and add to that all the other pains and penalties provided for. I have not a word to say in defence of the man who wilfully and fraudulently attempts to evade taxation. He should have to put up with all the consequences, but the penalty should be commensurate with the offence. But, under this Bill, a man charged with an offence is called upon to prove that he is not guilt}', and the ordinary practice and procedure of the Courts is reversed. And, further, an attempt is made to defeat the Constitution. I am aware that, in the opinion of some people, the Constitution is a figment, and ought to be brushed aside if it interposes any obstacles to the achievement of what they desire; but it would be very much better to try to give effect to the objects of this Bill by adopting a course which would be within our powers under the Constitution. </para>

          <para>. - I cannot understand the necessity for so much red-tape and circumlocution in connexion with a matter of this kind. The Government appear to have adopted the most cumbrous method that could be suggested. If the Commissioner is of opinion that a taxpayer has undervalued his land to the extent of 25 per cent., certain consequences are to follow. How is the Commissioner to arrive at this opinion. Will he send some one to inspect the land or compare the valuation of it with the valuation return for a similar block in the same locality ? It seems to me that it would be possible to do justice to both parties without all this roundabout business, and by the adoption of a very simple proceeding, I suggest to the Vice-President of the Executive Council that where the Commissioner forms the opinion that certain land has been under-valued he should give the owner notice of the fact, and that it is his intention to have a valuation of the land made. If that valuation confirms the opinion of the Commissioner that the previous valuation was an undervaluation to the extent of 25 per cent, the owner should be charged with the cost of the valuation and taxed upon it, but should be given the right of appeal. That would be a- very simple procedure, but under this clause the Commissioner will have to apply to the High Court for a declaration. The owner will be tried on the assumption that he is guilty, and required to prove his innocence, and a number of other things will have to be done when the whole matter could be dealt with, as I have shown, in a very simple way. Why should it be assumed that a man has wilfully undervalued his land to the extent of 25 per cent. I gave an instance last night of what might happen. A man may have purchased land at a certain figure. Land in the locality may have become enhanced in value. The owner of the land next to his may consider that it is worth four times what he gave for it, and yet the first man might honestly believe that his land was worth no more than he gave for it. But if he returned that value as the unimproved value of the land he would be subjected to all this roundabout procedure. He would have to satisfy a Justice of the High Court that the under- valuation was not made with a view to evading the tax. </para>

            <para>- Yes, the owner has to prove the negative. We do not provide that the Commissioner shall prove the taxpayer's guilt, but that the taxpayer shall prove his innocence. What I have suggested would prevent all this trouble, and  1  am surprised that some such course is not adopted. It would save trouble and anxiety to land-owners if they knew that where there was a difference of opinion between them and the Commissioner as to the unimproved value of their lands, an independent valuation would be made. If that valuation confirmed the view that "their lands had been undervalued, they should have to pay taxation on the higher amount and pay the expenses of the independent valuation. I should like the Government to withdraw this clause and remodel it on the lines I have indicated. </para>

          <para>. - I recognise that the matters which are involved in this clause have been previously discussed, and that there is little probability of inducing the Committee to adopt an altered attitude towards them. At the same time, I cannot allow the provision to pass without offering my protest against it. If any justification were needed for the attitude which I. have assumed towards the Bill throughout, it is supplied by the spectacle which has been presented by the Government benches this morning. Until the last few minutes, the Vice-President of the Executive Council has been left with only just sufficient support to enable him to call for a division had the question been put from the Chair. When a party which numbers two- thirds of the Senate can leave matters to be discussed in that way, what hope is there of influencing them by an appeal to reason? I do not intend to deal with the constitutional aspect of this question, .nor with the main purpose of the clause. But I would direct attention to one of its provisions, which compels the Justice, in dealing' with any case of alleged undervaluation, to penalize the land-owner unless he is satisfied that an undervaluation has not been made with a view to evading taxation. The principle which is ordinarily adopted in our Law Courts is to give the person who is charged with any offence the benefit of the slightest doubt as to his guilt. But here, if the evidence be so evenly balanced that the Justice is unable to decide one way or the other, the Bill provides that he shall determine against the land-owner. Is that even elementary justice? </para>

I do not believe that any member of the Labour party would defend such a proposal as is contained in this clause, except in regard to the imposition of a land tax. Their attitude can only be attributed to their intense hatred of one section of the community. As evidencing how difficult it is to arrive at land values, I propose to present a few figures to the Committee. Not long since the Victorian Government resumed the Maribyrnong Estate, and I invite attention to the valuations which were sworn to in that connexion by men who are recognised throughout this State as experts. Their valuations for the same block of land were <inline font-style="italic">£12,</inline> £30, <inline font-style="italic">£40, £50, £60, £55, £]o,</inline> and £75 per acre. These valuations were made by the best land experts Victoria could produce. Some of them were put forward by the Crown, and others by the owners of the land. The valuations of the Crown experts were £12, <inline font-style="italic">£$0,</inline> and £40 per acre. The vendors' valuations were on a higher scale, but they varied just as widely. They ranged from <inline font-style="italic">£50</inline> to <inline font-style="italic">£T5</inline> per acre. </para>

But it is iniquitous to lay on the Judge, when he is unable to decide that there has been a wilful undervaluation, the obligation of giving a decision against the land-owner. </para>

            <para>- I have never said anything of the kind. But we do not expect to get a theoretically and ideally perfect valuation. When there is a conflict of evidence, it is left to the Court to determine what is a fair valuation. But, under the clause, the Justice is not to be allowed to do that, because the Bill practically says to him, " If, having heard the evidence, you are unable to decide either one way or the other, you must find the land-owner guilty." If we said to him, " If you entertain the slightest suspicion that a valuation has been made for the purpose ot fraud, you shall forfeit the land," I would not object. But it has been left to the Labour party in this Parliament to introduce a provision under which, although there may be not the slightest proof of intent to defraud, a man is to be found guilty of it. </para>

            <para>- That might be effective if it were not for the definition clause. As I have already pointed out, under one definition the land-owner is entitled to deduct the value which any improvements may have added to his land. An improvement which cost 5s. per acre may have added <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> per acre to its value. But the Justice may say to the land-owner, " But, under another definition you ought not to have deducted the added value given to your land by improvements, but merely the cost of those improvements." In view of the impossibility of getting any agreement in regard to the value of land, it strikes me as a piece of barbarism to say that we will not allow the Justice to determine whether an owner has attempted to defraud the revenue. What we do say to him in this Bill is, " Even if your mind be like a blank sheet of paper, even if, on the evidence, you are unable to decide one way or the other, we will still lay on you the obligation of finding the land-owner guilty." </para>

            <para>- What these gentlemen may have done whilst breathing the air of Queensland is one thing. Down here, while we are engaged in passing Federal legislation, I ask them to get back to elementary principles of justice. Let us accept it as a principle that a man is held to be guilty unless he can prove his innocence. But surely you have to take into account the circumstances under which you propose to apply that principle. To hold a man guilty until he proves himself innocent in connexion with the valuation of land, seems to me to be carrying the principle to the verge of barbarism. We have to recognise the practical impossibility of any man proving his innocence in the matter of valuing land. I need only refer again to the figures which I have already given. There were men whose interest it was to arrive at a correct valuation, and yet their valuations varied between <inline font-style="italic">£12</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">£40.</inline> Those were not valuators called in by the wicked land-owner, but by a Government anxious to get the land in question for State purposes at the lowest possible price. When valuators employed by a Government vary so widely in their estimate, how can men be expected to prove their innocence when they are charged with making their valuations too low ? The whole question of innocence becomes a matter of opinion, yet the Bill does not leave the Judge with the slightest discretion. He cannot return the verdict to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> has referred. The Judge is powerless. No matter what opinion he may have formed in his own mind, he is not free to exercise it. The facts of the case may convince the Judge that there was no fraudulent intent, but. in spite of that, he will have to say, " I am compelled to give my verdict against the land-owner." Honorable senators can pass this clause if they like, but if they do it will stand as a placard emphasizing every charge that has been made against them of not proposing this Bill for the benefit of the community but to penalize the land-owner. </para>

          <para>.- I know of many cases in which men own land in two or three States. Under this Bill, if a man under-values a piece of land in Victoria - the value of which, perhaps has gone down in comparison with the price at which he purchased it - the whole of his landed property in Victoria, New South Wales, and elsewhere may be forfeited to the Crown. Such legislation is not paralleled anywhere on this earth. A man may value his property honestly and fairly in accordance with what he believes to be correct, but if his opinion does not coincide with that of the Commissioner, the whole of his property may be forfeited. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator WALKER</inline>(New South Wales). £11.22]. - In my second-reading speech I drew attention to the fact,. that under this Bill a person is to be taken as guilty unless he proves himself innocent. I think that in this clause there is room for at least two amendments. There should be an appeal in a matter of such importance. Why should a land-owner be deprived of the opportunity of appealing from the decision of a single Judge to the full High Court? The matter is one of very great importance. Some persons own property worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. Yet if they make a mistake there will be no appeal from a single Judge. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has drawn attention to the fact that two negatives are used in the clause. We must try to convert them into a single affirmative. This Bill seems to have been based upon the assumption that all men are rogues. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> remembers the old Scotch story of the Minister in Fife who was reading a passage from the Psalms, in which occurred the words of David. " I said in my haste all men are liars." The minister stopped and said, " You said it in your haste, David, m' mon j if ye had been here ye might have said it at your leisure." I am surprised that any Government in the Commonwealth of Australia should proceed on such a supposition. All through this Bill there runs the idea that if a man makes a fault he is to be treated as a criminal. I, for one, protest against this method of legislation. I trust that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> moves an amendment in the clause honorable senators opposite will recognise the fairness of it, and, in despite of caucus rule, will insist on doing justice. </para>

          <para>. - After the severe criticism to which this clause has been subjected, I may be expected to express some opinion about it on behalf of the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has hinted at the unconstitutionality of the proposal, and has argued as to the absurdity and monstrosity of the Commonwealth acquiring any land except for public purposes. There is a great deal of difference between the position defined in this clause and the acquisition of land by the Commonwealth Government from a State. Under this clause the Government will not be acquiring land in the ordinary sense. It will be acquiring land as a penalty, and will be paying for it. Land that comes into the possession of the Commonwealth in that manner will not be in the position of Commonwealth property, but will be held just as any other landholder would hold land. The State in which it is situated will have full control over the land, and can tax it or do with it anything that it has a right to do with the land of a private individual. It is further provided that if the Commonwealth does not want the land for any purpose of its own, it may communicate with the State in question, and if the State likes to buy it it can do so. In other Commonwealth legislation similar powers have been taken. Under some Acts we have power to destroy property that we have taken over. We can, for instance, destroy forfeited opium. We can confiscate and destroy prohibited goods. We can seize goods imported under false pretences, and dispose of them in any way we like. We can confiscate goods attempted to be smuggled, and do what w&lt; please with them. </para>

            <para>- Honorable senators on the opposite side are too eager to jump to conclusions. I am stating the case quite accurately. Unless it can be proved that there was an intention to defraud, no proceedings can be taken under this or any other clause. I am sure that all these painful appeals which have been made on behalf of the poor land-owner, who unwittingly might make a mistake, are absolutely unnecessary, because the Commissioner will deal with them all. He is expected to be a reasonable man, and, when he sees that there was no intention to defraud, but only a mistake or a misunderstanding in the mind of the owner, other means will be taken to  ascertain the value of the land. Other clauses provide that the Commissioner may take other steps to ascertain the correct value, and he will do so. This clause was put in the Bill, because in connexion with land tax legislation, not only in the States, but in other parts of the world, many attempts have been made by undervaluation and frauds of that description to evade the burden placed on land-holders. The clause was inserted to induce persons to furnish a fair value of their land, so that the Commissioner may be able to assess them at the rate prescribed. With respect to the cases of the poor widows, poor orphans, and other poor individuals, whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> has taken under his wing, let me point out that if a poor land-holder has valuable blocks in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, and other places, the Bill provides that they shall be valued separately. He may make a mistake in one place, but where he gives a fair valuation in two or three cases, that will be clear evidence that he has made an honest attempt to value the blocks properly, and the Commissioner will take that into consideration. The clause is not intended to be put into frequent operation. But it is intended to be on the statute-book as the policeman is on the street, to prevent landlord larrikinism, or land-owner dishonesty. If the very existence of the provision induces the poor friends of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> to put a fair and honest value on their property, it will never come into operation, but it will be a blessing that it is on the statute-book, because it will enable the Commissioner, in certain cases, to arrive at a proper assessment by the shortest and speediest method. I hope that it will be passed without amendment, because it will be a warning to all those who have a dishonest intention in their mind. </para>

          <para>. - I think that one may say of the clause, or the Bill, what was once said of a Bill which was introduced, I think, into the House of Commons, and which, probably, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> will remember, for his country people have reason to recollect it. It creates artificial crimes, for which it provides Draconian punishments, and pursues its remedies in violation of all principles of liberty and justice. It is abundantly clear from the closely-reasoned speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that honorable senators on the other side are not giving to the land-owner that liberty which he has when he is charged with the most infamous crime against the whole community. It is also clear from his speech that, not only are these honorable senators treating in that way the land-owner when he goes into the box to defend his right to his property, but they are actually taking from the Judge the right which he possesses in the exercise of his criminal and other jurisdiction to say that, unless the plaintiff proves his case, the verdict must go against him. A Judge is bound by law in the case of the greatest criminal to instruct the jury accordingly, if he is of opinion that there is not sufficient evidence on behalf of the Crown to make it clear affirmatively that an offence has been committed. This straight safeguard which die community has is to be taken away as against the land-owner while it is preserved in favour of the criminal. We can have nothing clearer than that as to the attitude of the caucus mind towards land-owners. Every man in the community, however humble he may be, who is brought to the criminal bar is deemed to be absolutely innocent until a case is proved against him. Nothing could reveal more clearly than does this Bill the intense hostility of the Labour party to the occupation and ownership of land. They are asking, or pretending to ask, persons to come to Australia to settle and develop the land, but at the same time they seek to enact a provision that, because of an honest mistake made in a valuation, a man's land may be forfeited to the Crown. What a splendid encouragement it must be to persons in Great Britain to come here, when they learn that this Parliament has passed a measure under which the Government, may, if they make a mistake in a valuation, take from them their land, that is if they have acquired more than .£5,000 worth. How do honorable senators opposite reconcile the sending to the Old Country of glowing, and, to my mind, fairly accurate, descriptions of the attractions and advantages of the lands of Australia with legislation of this kind? It is impossible to do so. Not only are honorable senators opposite reversing the principle of justice which is applied to criminals, but, to my mind, they are striking at the very Constitution itself. In my second-reading speech, I pointed out some constitutional difficulties in connexion with various parts of the Bill. I did not refer to its merits or demerits, because, to deal with the former would be, to my mind, like dealing with snakes in Ireland - there are none. This clause, on its very face - unless some clearer, I had almost said subtler, explanation can be given - is, in my opinion, a direct violation of the Constitution.

        <para class="block">Ave are competent to pass legislation. lt is the High Court, and not merely a Justice of the High Court to whom this final appellate power is given under the Constitution. It is a maxim well known in British law that the right of appeal to the King in Council is established, and continues until it is taken away expressly by the Imperial Parliament. The power of appeal might have been taken away from the individual under our Constitution, but we wished to protect the citizens of the Commonwealth, and so we provided that the High Court should have jurisdiction to hear appeals from all judgments, decrees, orders, and sentences. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council will consult the Attorney-General on the matter, he may be told that an Act of this Parliament can restrict the right of appeal, but it was never contemplated that an Act of this Parliament should take away the right of appeal to the High Court, which the- Constitution guarantees to every citizen of Australia. If that had been intended, it would have been expressly set out in the Constitution. It is not given to this Parliament to pass an Act depriving a citizen of the right of appeal from a Justice of the High Court to the High Court itself. This Parliament has power only to regulate the form and procedure to be followed, but not the power to prevent an appeal. If it had been intended that Parliament should have the power to prevent an appeal, the section might have read - - </para>
        <para>The High Court shall have jurisdiction with such exceptions and subject to an Act of the Parliament to prevent an appeal -  and so on. The people might have ratified such a provision, but they were not asked to do so, and did not do so. Can the Vice-President of the Executive Council reconcile paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of this clause with section 73 of the Constitution ? I am not aware that the question was raised in another place, or that the Attorney-General has considered it, but .the difficulty is one which cannot be lightly passed aside by the vote of a majority. The right of appeal is given under the Constitution, subject only to the power of the Parliament io make regulations as to procedure. How, therefore, can it be held that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of this clause is constitutional ? Before we pass this provision we are entitled to know what is the authority which declares the validity of an Act of this Parliament, which takes away the right of appeal to the High Court, in the face of section 73 which guarantees that right of appeal. </para>

            <para>- With one or two limitations the jurisdiction conferred upon the High Court by the Constitution is to hear appeals from every Court in Australia, and it is idle to say that in a case of land resumption there is to be no appeal from a Justice of the High Court to the High Court itself. I hope the Opposition will not allow the clause to go until we have some attempt made to reconcile it with section 73 of the Constitution. It is possible that the matter has been considered, and surely there must be some authority for proposing this contradiction. There is another complaint I have to make against the Government- </para>

          <para>. - With all respect for the Vice-President of the Executive Council, I may characterize his statement as "Bush" constitutional law. The reference to regulations in section .73 applies to the procedure to be adopted. The Constitution of every one of the States recognises the right of appeal to the Privy Council. That right of appeal is subject to what might be called regulations for the purpose of enforcing justice in an ordinary way, and to secure that the tribunal shall not be abused by frivolous and vexatious suits. There is a power to limit, to some extent, the right of appeal in certain cases, but there is no power to entirely cut off the right of appeal. I am speaking with general, if not with absolute, accuracy when I say that the limitation, and not the prevention, of appeals has reference to cases where the amount in dispute is not above £300 in some States and £500 in others. All these State Constitutions were ratified by the Imperial Parliament. In some cases where the matter in dispute involved a pecuniary value of only £40 or <inline font-style="italic">£50,</inline> but the consequences of the judgment might involve hundreds of pounds, the Privy Council interpreted the limitation in such a way as to permit the right of appeal. There is a difference between regulating the right of appeal to the Privy </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Council or the High Court and absolutely cutting off the right. We cannot say that because we have the power to prescribe rules, orders, and regulations to provide that a case shall proceed in an orderly way, from a justice of the High Court to the High Court, that we have the right to cut off the right of appeal when and how we please. Is the Vice-President of the Executive Council advised by the Attorney-General that we can pass an Act to deprive any subject in certain circumstances of the right of appeal to the High Court or to the Privy Council ? If that were so, we might provide that there should be no appeal from a Justice of the High Court to the High Court itself. Does the Attorney-General advise the Government that we have any such power ? I do not know of any Parliament in the Empire, or anywhere else, that has asserted the proposition, where the right of appeal to the highest Court in its Dominion is secured under the Constitution, that it can step in and say there shall be no appeal, and that the administration of justice in every Department of the Commonwealth shall be confined to a Court presided over by a single Justice. </para>

        <para>There is a clear distinction between the High Court itself and a Justice of that tribunal. The object of making that distinction was to prevent the judgment of a Justice of the High Court upon any subject being absolutely final. That tribunal was constituted in order that an appeal might lie to it from the decision of any single Justice. However, I shall not pursue that branch of the subject any further. </para>

            <para>- I recognise that the discussion of this clause is absolutely futile, except from the stand-point that the opinions which we express may have some weight with the general public. We have had a clear declaration from the Minister of Defence that every time this Parliament chooses to pass an Act, it may insert in it a provision under which the decision of a Justice of the High Court shall be final. It is well that the public should know that section 73 of the Constitution, which has hitherto been construed as giving an unchallengeable right of appeal to the High Court, has disappeared. </para>

            <para>- I do not think that the words, " with such exceptions and subject to such regulations as the Parliament prescribes," which appear in section 73 of the Constitution, should be interpreted in trie way that the Minister of Defence has interpreted them. I showed some time ago that a portion of a Bill which was submitted to the Senate was unconstitutional - that it was " right up " against the decision of the High Court. But there seems to be a reckless intention on the part of the Government to flout the Constitution. In a few weeks I shall be afforded another opportunity of showing what a flagrant violation of that charter of government has been attempted in this Chamber. That is one of those nice revenges which the whirligig of politics sometimes gives a man.  If  we are going to impose upon land-owners the Draconian punishment provided in this clause for undervaluations, a similar punishment should be inflicted upon  the  Commissioner in case of overvaluations. That would be a sort of rough equity.  I  can speak upon this subject from a certain amount of acquaintance with land valuation Courts in Queensland, and with  the  Land Acquisition Act of that State. </para>

            <para>- If the landowner is preventing settlement, let us do what we can to open up the land. But  I  object to allowing a crime to be perpetrated under the pretext that it is being perpetrated in the interests of the community. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> reminds me of Madame Roland's celebrated exclamation, " Oh, Liberty ! liberty ! how many crimes are committed in thy name !" In every law Court the plaintiff who cannot sustain a case has to pay the costs of the other side. In many cases in Queensland where the Land Board through its officers has not been able to sustain land valuations in the Land Courts, it has had to pay the costs. I admit that there would be some justice in this provision if a land-owner could go to the High Court, and, where the Commissioner failed to make good his case, mulct him in costs. How easy it is to make an undervaluation of land, and to da so quite honestly. There have been cases over and over again in which Government valuators have overvalued land. In a case of my own the Government valuator overvalued, and  1  made them pay very heavily for the mistake. They did not object, because they admitted that they had been misinformed. The forfeiture of land is entirely different from the forfeiture of goods or ships. </para>

            <para>- Because the nature of the property is essentially different. I admit that there is fairly strong ground on the other side, but if the. view which I hold is good in law, it is absolutely outside the power of the Federal Government to forfeit land in the sense implied in this Bill. I hold that when a penalty imposed under any law which we make is satisfied, it is not within the power of the Federal Government to take his land from the owner. Our Constitution is limited in its jurisdiction, and we cannot give to it an extension that in other circumstances might attach to it. I do not believe that we have this power of forfeiture. " Forfeiture " in the case of land is a well-known term in English law. I am not aware that the penalty has ever been applied except in cases of felony or treason ; the reason in the latter case being to deprive the heirs of succession. It is quite true that the Federal Government can forfeit imported goods. </para>

It is said that there is a difference between the forfeiture of land and of goods. Why should there be, except in the minds of those who are still labouring under the superstition that the law must be devised especially to favour the land-owner ? A person who imports fencing wire or agricultural machinery into Australia and undervalues the goods may have them taken from him at his own valuation, to which 10 per cent, is added by the Customs authorities. What difference is there between a man who, to defraud the Treasury, undervalues fencing wire or agricultural machinery, and a man who for the same purpose undervalues land ? </para>

If there is a suspicion of undervaluation the onus is thrown not upon the land-owner, but upon the Taxation Department. The Commissioner has to make out a case before the Judge of the High Court. Evidence is to be tendered in favour of the Commissioner's contention. The land-owner is then entitled to be heard in his own behalf. Consequently, the onus is thrown on the Commissioner. </para>

            <para>- If the owner of land can show that he has not undervalued his property he escapes. He is certainly not put to the harrowing experience which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has painted for us. I consider that the clause is very necessary, and is in the interest of those who wish to deal fairly by the Taxation Department and the public Treasury. In the past, under State laws, we have unfortunately been too much accustomed to the undervaluation of land, and taxation has been evaded in the most glaring fashion. It was high time that an effective remedy was applied without being unnecessarily harsh towards land-owners. The margin of 25 per cent, allowed by the clause is ample, and if the land-owner shows that his purpose has not been to escape taxation, he is not penalized in any way. But if he has tried to escape, he ought to sustain a heavy penalty. The clause is quite necessary, and in its operation is more unfavorable to the land-owner than is the Customs Act to the importer of goods. </para>

            <para>- Not unfairly. We have raised a question as to the constitutionality of the clause. I admit frankly that if the Government state that they are advised, as we presume they are, that a provision of this kind can be made in the Bill, nine out of every ten of their supporters will say, "It L« their responsibility. We are not going to set ourselves up as experts in the law, and sa) whether it is constitutional or not." In any case, I recognise that a legislative body is not a properly constituted tribunal to decide whether a matter comes within the purview of the Constitution, unless that is very clear and evident to everybody at once. In this measure, the Government are taking all sorts of drastic powers. In defending the clause, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> said that the landowner is treated very fairly, and that if he does not prove a certain thing he is to be convicted. Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that there is a provision in the criminal law that a man who is seen in the neighbourhood two hours after a house has been burglariously entered shall be held to have committed the crime of burglary unless he proves that he did not. Now, many a man may be alongside a house in which a burglary is being committed, and yet be as innocent of knowledge of the burglary as a child unborn. Yet, under such a law, it would be necessary for a man charged to produce evidence to prove that he did not commit the offence. </para>

            <para>- The Commissioner applies to the High Court for a declaration that the Commonwealth is entitled to acquire the land, and brings forward valuers to prove to the Court that unquestionably there has been an undervaluation. If the Justice is satisfied that the owner has understated the unimproved value .to *e extent of 25 per cent., or more, <inline font-style="italic">prima facie,</inline> the owner is supposed to have committed a fraud. It does not follow, however, that because there has been an undervaluation it is a fraudulent one. This morning I quoted the case of a small estate in Sydney in which the valuations given by two well-known local firms absolutely differed. One valued the property at about  £6,000,  and the. other, at about £10,000. The valuations were required, not for the purpose of litigation, but to inform the owners in England as to what values were placed on the property by the best valuers who could be obtained in Sydney, and the two firms employed were firms of well known integrity and reliability. The case shows how easily an undervaluation may take place, particularly in the case of large areas and valuable properties. Under this clause, the Judge has to be satisfied, not that there has been a fraudulent mistake made, but that the owner has understated the unimproved value to the extent of 25 per cent, or more. </para>

            <para>- No. We know, of course, that logically a negative cannot be proved, but under this clause an owner has to prove that the undervaluation was not made with intent to evade taxation, and if the Judge is not satisfied on the point, he has no alternative but to make the declaration required by the Commissioner. The position would be different if it were provided that the Judge must get evidence to satisfy himself that the undervaluation was made with a fraudulent intent. </para>

            <para>- It can always be proved by circumstances. A man, for instance, may strike another man, not with any intention to do him harm, but by pure accident. The circumstances may all go to prove that. As a matter of fact, the proof of a crime requires an act and an intention to be proved ; a Judge has to be satisfied that they were co-existent at the time the offence was committed. Of course, the attempt has to be judged by the surrounding circumstances. If that is not proved in criminal cases, and in cases where penalties are provided, the law says that the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the accused person. In this clause, however, the benefit of the doubt is not given to the landowner. Even though there may be a doubt in the mind of the Judge, he has to make the declaration required by the Commissioner. If the provision were so amended as to enable the Judge to say, "The case has not been proved, and therefore I cannot make a declaration," that would be fair. That right is given to a man who is regarded as the vilest criminal on the face of the earth. In this clause, the Judge is trammelled and handcuffed in arriving at his decision, but there is to be no appeal from it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has raised a question as to whether the Government are not getting behind the Constitution in denying the right of appeal. It is an essential principle of law that every citizen has the right of appeal from his own Courts to the Sovereign, who, of course, speaks through his Courts. The Privy Council is our ultimate Court of appeal. It is a very serious thing to take away the right which is inherent in every Englishman, of appealing to the highest Court in the realm to have his grievance settled as satisfactorily as possible. It is cruel on the part of the Ministry first to handcuff the Judge of the High Court, and then to allow no appeal from his decision. The individual rights of a man ought to be observed in this legislation, because every person is fallible. Even the best Judge will make a mistake at times. When the right of appeal exists a man has the opportunity to bring to bear on a question the minds of several men. whose decision, I admit, may be wrong. I do not intend at present to argue as to whether we have the power to withdraw the right of appeal. It is a very serious act to take away that right in any circumstances. The constitutional question will not be settled by Parliament, but will remain for determination by the High Court. There are cases on record in which it has been held that in attempting to make a decision final, and without appeal, the Legislature has exceeded its powers. The Minister, in replying to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, cited the case of the Australian Industries Preservation Act, and called his attention to the fact that thereunder a certain matter may be referred to a Justice to investigate and determine, and that his determination -  shall be final and conclusive and without appeal, and shall not be questioned in any way. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </interjection>
        <para class="block">Whether a question has arisen before the High Court as to the constitutionality of that provision or not, I am not aware. I do not think it has. It has only been on the statute-book for about twelve months, and although it may have been passed under the aegis of another Administration, that does not make it any better or stronger, because a mistake may be made on one side as well as on the other. Let us, however, compare the two provisions. In this clause, the Government are taking power to seek from a Justice of the High Court a declaration by means of which they can take away a man's land, whereas the provision in the Australian Industries Preservation Act deals with dumping only. If the Comptroller-General has reason to believe that persons are importing goods with intent to destroy or injure any Australian industry by their sale or disposal within the Commonwealth in unfair competition with any Australian goods, he may certify to the Minister accordingly, and what his certificate shall specify is enumerated. On receipt of the certificate, the Minister may, by order in writing, refer the matter to a Justice for investigation, and the Justice finds according to what he believes to be correct. The provision simply means that a particular class of goods shall not be allowed to be imported in order to be disposed of in unfair competition with Australian-made goods. There is power for the Governor-General in Council to set aside a finding altogether and have the matter re-opened. The position under that Act is very different from that which might arise under this clause. Apart from the debatable question as to whether we can take away the right of appeal as proposed, I think it is only a matter of abstract justice that where either the Commissioner or the taxpayer is dissatisfied with the finding of the Justice, there should be a right of appeal, and I move - </para>

            <para>- He is not given that opportunity under this clause. If the Commissioner finds that he has undervalued his property, the taxpayer is liable to be subjected to all these proceedings. He is not given an opportunity to correct any mistake; the matter must go before the Court. The Commissioner should be in a position to say, " I shall, at your expense, have an independent valuation of your land made, and will charge you taxation upon that, but you will have a right of appeal if you think I have overtaxed you." If that course were adopted it would do away with all this cumbrous procedure, and allay the nervousness and fright which this measure is causing to many people. </para>

          <para>- As the clause stands, it is obligatory on the Justice of the High Court who inquires into any case of alleged undervaluation of land, and who is satisfied that the land has been undervalued to the extent of 25 per cent., to make a declaration that the Commonwealth is entitled to acquire such land. My amendment, if adopted, will allow him some measure of discretion. For instance, be may feel that the circumstances are not of such a character as to permit of the declaration being made without inflicting undue hardship. I wish to prevent the Justice, in such circumstances, from being compelled to do a gross act of injustice. I should like to know from the Vice-President of the Executive Council whether, under this clause, it is contemplated that, in the event of a portion of a land-owner's property being undervalued, the declaration of forfeiture will apply to the whole of his property. </para>

          <para>- Assuming that the statement of the Vice-President of the Executive Council be correct, it is to a certain extent a reply to my objection. But I know that some honorable senators upon this side of the chamber are anxious to learn the interpretation which the Government place upon this clause. The effect of my amendment would be to make the clause a little less harsh in the case of persons who may not be able to satisfy the Justice that they did not make the undervaluation with a view to evading taxation. </para>

          <para>. - We have already had one measure before this Parliament in which the word " may " was substituted for the word " shall " at the instance of the Government themselves. I refer to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, in which it was originally proposed to compel the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court to grant a preference to unionists. </para>

            <para>- That may be so. But I think we should endeavour, as far as possible, to make our laws harmonious in the matter of the language employed in them. The amendment would permit a Justice of the High Court to express his opinion upon the subject of the application. It would endow him with a measure of discretion. We cannot definitely lay it down that a Justice shall do a certain thing. </para>

            <para>- I strongly urge upon the Government that they are embodying in this clause a principle which is foreign to all our laws. They are laying down a rule to control our Justices. Our whole idea of British jurisprudence is that a Justice shall be vested with a certain amount of discretion. But under this clause he will have no discretion. We say to him, ' ' Given certain facts you must <inline font-style="italic">do</inline> so-and-so." In adopting that course we are introducing into our laws an absolutely new principle. We are introducing by a side wind the very principle which caused (he South African war. We are seeking to compel a Justice to express a certain opinion, irrespective of whether he thinks it is right or wrong. If my honorable friends opposite are willing to do that, they, must accept responsibility for their action. </para>

            <para>- Does my honorable friend think that Parliament should be so supreme that it should not be told by a Justice of the High Court that it has done wrong? I entirely agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> that we must have some tribunal which will judge between Parliament and the people. But this is not a proposal to judge between Parliament and the people. It is an attempt to desert all our recognised principles of jurisprudence, and to adopt the method adopted by Napoleon, when he introduced the famous Napoleonic code, which laid it down that any man charged with a crime was to be assumed to be guilty until he could establish his innocence. Hitherto we have proceeded upon an exactly opposite principle. British jurisprudence presupposes that a man is innocent until he is proved to be guilty. But in this clause we say that unless a man can prove his innocence, the Justice must find him guilty. </para>

          <para>. - I should like to crystallize the point of controversy in connexion with this clause. The interjections which have come from the Ministerial side suggest that there is a sort of belief in the minds of honorable senators that justice will hold sway when the clause is put into operation. But this is the way in which it will work out: The Judge, having heard the evidence, has to put to himself this question : " Am I satisfied that this man is guilty?" If he returns an affirmative answer, the man will be rightly punished. But if the Judge is not satisfied, the person charged is still punished. </para>

            <para>- There is more at issue than a negative way of putting the matter. What I object to is that, even if the Judge is unable to satisfy himself that any offence has been committed with guilty intent, he is still to find the accused guilty. The Judge, having balanced the evidence in his own mind, puts to himself a question. If he considers the offence proved, he rightly gives his verdict against the accused. But if he says, "I am unable to see any evidence of guilt; the evidence is so equally balanced that I cannot see the slightest tendency towards crime" - nevertheless he cannot let the accused go free, as he ought to do. </para>

In both of those cases the Judge will be able to make an award in accordance with what he believes to be right.

            <para>- Let us admit that that has been proved. Then the point remains that, having decided that the land has been undervalued to the extent of 25 per cent., the Judge has to determine whether the undervaluation has been made with intent to defraud the revenue. If guilt is established, the offender should be punished ; if it is not established, he should go free; but, as I have already shown, there is a third class of cases in which the Judge may say, " I cannot find anything in the evidence to satisfy me that the accused is guilty; I am in doubt about it." But because the accused is not able absolutely to demonstrate his innocence the clause leaves the Judge no option but to find him guilty. I have too great regard for honorable senators opposite to believe that if they were left in the secrecy of their rooms to devise a code of laws a single one of them would draft a provision of this kind. I am quite aware how measures come before the Senate, and the natural tendency of every honorable senator is, rightly  1  think, to adhere to the proposals of his own party. But in a matter of this kind, where no principle is involved, where the integrity of the land tax will not be challenged, and the revenue will not suffer by a penny, I ask honorable senators not to be a party to such a gross act of injustice as will be perpetrated by this clause if enacted. </para>

            <para>- I am not forgetting that at all. What ought to be provided is that before making the declaration the Justice shall be thoroughly satisfied that the owner has made the undervaluation with a view to evading taxation. The other day, in Victoria, we read of an estate which had been valued by professional men, and which was bought, I believe, at £12 an acre. It was valued by some persons at £7 an acre, and by others at £10, while the Government paid £12. A short time previously it had been sold at £7 10s. an acre. A man came in and valued the land, and £7 10s. must have been the value which the owner a month before put upon it, because he got that amount. Under this clause, however, if an owner values his land at £7 10s. an acre, and a Government valuator values it at £12, it will be forfeited to the Crown. In legislating on this question we should not depart from the ordinary practice. If the case were triable before a jury, the Justice would give its verdict, but in this instance the Justice will be Judge and jury. It is a very hard provision that if the Justice is not satisfied, he must make the declaration applied for. I think it must have slipped in without being noticed. </para>

            <para>- We know that very often the draftsmen make measures very confusing. We know that when a case comes before the Full Court of a State or the High Court of the Commonwealth, a Justice ascertains the meaning of a word before he attempts to interpret the section in dispute. No one but a lawyer could take this clause to mean other than that if. after hearing the case, the Justice is not satisfied as to the innocence of the landowner, he must make the declaration applied for, although he may be in doubt as to whether he is doing right or not; he is left no option in the matter. I do not wish any man to have an opportunity to evade taxation, but we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that it is difficult for two or three men to value a piece of land alike. No doubt, every honorable senator when he has been adjudicating in a Police Court has had cases in which he has been unable to make up his mind, owing to the weight of evidence being equal. What is done in such cases? The accused is given the benefit of the doubt, and the case is dismissed. Under this clause, however, the Justice cannot give the accused land-owner the benefit of the doubt he may have in his mind, because he must make the declaration applied for by the Commissioner. </para>

            <para>- According to the dictionary, " shall " is imperative. Whenever it is used in a legal document it is imperative that the thing in question be done. Suppose, for instance, that a person were brought up for trial, and the law was that if he was found guilty he should be sentenced to two years' imprisonment? The Judge could not pass a sentence of one year and eleven months' imprisonment, but must pass the full sentence, because no discretion would be left to him. In ordinary criminal cases, if the Judge is not satisfied, the prisoner gets the benefit of the doubt. I did not use the word "must" in regard to the language of the Bill, but certainly the word " shall " is mandatory. We are here to legislate in the interests of the people, and to do an injustice to nobody. So long as the word " shall " is retained in the clause, the Justice, if in doubt, must give the benefit of the doubt to the Crown. What justice or fair play is there in a provision of that kind? I do not find fault with the first provision in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> but I do object to the second part, which reads -  is not satisfied that the undervaluation was not made with a view to evading taxation. </para>

I ask honorable senators generally to refrain from noisy interjections, especially when a point of order is before the Chair.

            <para>- It seems, sir, that your ruling is not taken much notice of. I maintain that under this clause the Justice will have no discretion. He must make the order applied for by the Commissioner, even though he is not satisfied that the taxpayer has undervalued the land with the intention to evade the tax. We should not make laws to punish people who are innocent of evil intent. I suppose that the clause will be forced through, as the Government are powerful enough to be able to do that; but I protest against such a provision being made the law of this country. </para>

          <para>. - I have so far refrained from taking part in the debate upon this Bill in Committee. I cannot understand why my antagonist who has just resumed his seat should lash himself into a fury about this clause. He has contended that the Justice of the High Court, who will hear the application from the Commissioner, must make the declaration applied for, right or wrong. The honorable senator supports his contention by the use in this clause of the word "shall." A man is assumed to be innocent until he is proved to be guilty, and I can see nothing in this clause to justify the contention that an innocent man is to be regarded as guilty before he is given a chance to be heard in his own defence. I can recollect the case of a man who was engaged in making the laws of the country in which he was living, and who, when called upon under a Land Tax Bill to state the amount for which he was liable to be taxed, undervalued his estate. He was his own valuator, and sent in a return in which he undervalued his property. The case came before the Commissioner, with the result that the gentleman to whom I refer was fined. If a law maker may be a law breaker, it is not difficult to imagine that some persons will deliberately endeavour to evade this taxation. If the Commissioner is satisfied that an attempt is being made to evade taxation by the undervaluation of a property, he may apply to a Justice of the High Court under this clause for a certain declaration, but the taxpayer will be heard, and the declaration will not be made by the Justice unless he is not satisfied that the undervaluation was not made with a view to evading the tax. Honorable senators opposite have lashed themselves into a fury over this simple matter, and one honorable senator who has taken part in the debate has so far permitted his passion to control him as to become insulting. I have no desire to assist in passing any legislation that would inflict the slightest injustice upon any citizen of the Commonwealth. I remind honorable senators that there are Statutes already in existence under which officials are given as much, if not more, power than is proposed to be given to the Commissioner under this clause. Under the Customs Act a man may be called upon to disclose books and documents and the secrets of his business. This is one of the simplest clauses in the Bill, and will inflict no injustice upon any honest citizen. </para>

        <para>That Act lays down the rule which is to guide the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. But, under this clause, we say that, in certain circumstances, a Justice shall make a certain declaration. The Government will act reasonably if they adopt similar language in this Bill to that which is employed in the Act to which  I  have referred. Our Justices will then be vested with a reasonable measure of discretion. As the clause now stands, if the Justice be not satisfied that an undervaluation was made by a land-owner, with a view to evading taxation, he must make a declaration that the Commonwealth is entitled to acquire the property which has been undervalued. Why not drop the negatives which are employed in the clause? Why not provide that if the Justice be satisfied that the undervaluation was made with a view to evading taxation, he shall make an order? But in this provision the Government have used the word "not" twice; and I venture to say that before long they will find that they are Gordian knots. </para>

          <para>. - Why should we adjourn until Wednesday next? We have been working longer hours than has been the case in any other session, and surely some reason ought to be advanced for abandoning the Tuesday sitting. </para>

            <para>- The Labour newspapers have often commented upon that fact, saying that the aristocrats of Great Britain hung up legislation in order that they might go to a horse-race. Now, we have the business of the Senate being hung up by the Labour party for the same purpose. The only reason is that the race for the Melbourne Cup is to be run on Tuesday next. </para>

            <para>- No matter what the honorable senator chooses to call it, I know that he has been one of the strongest opponents of having adjournments of the Senate from time to time. I have heard it said, however, that when people become wealthy they get a little more conservative, and like to enjoy themselves at the public expense. We ought not to stop the work of the Senate for such a purpose. Towards the end of the session, the Estimates will be rushed upon us, and there will be no time to consider them carefully, because honorable senators will want to get to their homes. I protest against following this course, and shall certainly call for a division. </para>

          <para>. - -There is always a danger of confusing a coincidence with the operation of cause and effect; and it seems to be assumed by some honorable senators that we are asked to adjourn over Tuesday because of something that is going to happen in Melbourne on that day. It is assumed that that event is the cause of the adjournment. Probably honorable senators recollect the story of Mark Twain who, when he was last in London, saw on a newspaper placard the headings " Mark Twain in London: Ascot Gold Cup stolen." There is no more necessary connexion between the Melbourne Cup and an adjournment of the Senate over a particular day than there was between those two circumstances. I would, however, suggest that, in view of the fact that the trains may be running late on Wednesday, the Vice-President of the Executive Council might agree to make the time of meeting  3  o'clock instead of  2.30. </para>

            <para>- I have not the slightest doubt about that. My reason for opposing the adjournment is exactly the reason which the Leader of the Opposition has given for supporting it. I believe that the business of the country is so urgent that we cannot afford an adjournment. At a very early period rf the session, the Senate was asked to sit four days a week. Notwithstanding that we have done so, the business-paper is still loaded with measures, some of which must be passed before the session ends. </para>

            <para>- We are now engaged upon, one of the most important measures that has ever come before this Parliament - the Land Tax Assessment Bill. It must be passed this session.' The Navigation Bill has also to be dealt with. There are seventeen other Bills upon the Government programme which Parliament will have to pass before it is prorogued. In addition to this business, we were some time ago promised- 'that an opportunity would be afforded for discussing the financial proposals of the Government and the census paper. Pressure of business has hitherto prevented those questions being dealt with. Private business has been put on one side altogether, except that one honorable senator was, as an act of grace, last night afforded an opportunity of submitting a motion standing in his name. In addition to all this business, we have to consider the Estimates of the various Departments in detail. I ask those who have had any experience of parliamentary procedure what likelihood there is of the Estimates receiving anything like fair consideration unless we work all day, and every day, from now until the end of the session? There is a plethora of business before the Senate at the present moment ; and, in addition to that, the Government have a programme which they desire to see carried through - unless Ministers are prepared to throw overboard . a number of important Bills. Consequently, the present motion is entirely out of place. No reason has been given by the Minister for the adjournment. It is usual, on such occasions, to give a reason. </para>

            <para>- Of course, we know the reason ; but why was it not publicly stated ? Was it because the Government and members of Parliament are ashamed of the reason ? If it were in any way creditable, would it not be blazoned forth so that every one in the country could hear it? The reason why the Senate is asked to adjourn until Wednesday is because a horse-race is to be run on Tuesday. </para>

I am not such an ass as to believe that at a game in which they are experts I am likely to have a chance with them, and, therefore, I do riot put my money on racehorses. We ought to show an example to the people. I have no doubt there are a great number of honorable senators who respect the Mother of Parliaments. On four successive occasions, up to  1895,  the House of Commons rejected, by a huge majority, any proposal to adjourn over the Derby, and, naturally, no member has the temerity to rise now and propose such a motion as this. Melbourne Cup Day has come and gone, but never until now, has a Government dared to propose that Parliament should adjourn over that event. </para>

            <para>- The Parliament has been sitting. No proposal was ever made before to adjourn over Melbourne Cup Day ; no Government had the temerity to make such a motion. I can remember in the Old Country, when the great mass of the electors used to pass very uncomplimentary remarks about the gilded parasites who sat in the House of Commons, when they were in the habit of adjourning to see the Derby run. I have heard remarks of the same tenor made in Australia. I have often heard it said before I was fortunate, or unfortunate, enough to get a seat in Parliament, that members of Parliament simply played at legislation. We have more play now than ever. We are actually asked to do what has never been done before, and that is to adjourn over a horse race. I suppose that the next thing we shall be asked to adjourn over will be a dog or cock fight. </para>

            <para>- I have just the same objection to adjourning over a garden party as I have to. adjourning over a horse race. All these society functions and ideas ought to be boycotted when we have a Labour Government in power. We are sent here to do the work of the country, not to engage in social functions of any kind or colour. If honorable senators wish to go to a garden party, dog fight, horse race, or prize fight, they are quite welcome to go. But why should we hang up the business of the country for that purpose? I intend to vote against the motion. </para>

          <para>. - Although the holiday on Tuesday next is limited to Victoria, I want to congratulate the Government upon having had the courage to take a definite stand - a thing which no previous Government ever did. For nearly fifty years in Victoria the first Tuesday in November has ;&gt;cen recognised as a holiday, not merely for the purpose of horse-racing, but for the most innocent purpose of Sunday school picnics. </para>

            <para>- It has been ray pleasure to see about twenty-two Melbourne Cups won, and whatever decision the Senate may come to on this motion, it is my intention to attend the next race. I believe that I have been about as regular in my attendance as has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> ; I think that I have done about as 'much work, within my limited powers, as he has done ; but I do not believe that Australia has yet reached that stage when it will loudly applaud representatives who take up a hypocritical attitude, namely, desiring to go to the Cup, in common with the rest of the community, and lacking the necessary courage to vote a holiday to themselves. The Melbourne Cup race on Tuesday will bc witnessed by, I suppose, about  120,000  citizens of Victoria. A similar number will be here, if it is possible for them to come, from country districts to join in the various gaieties of the city. That accounts for practically  250,000  o'f the population of the State. Any holiday which has the support of that number of citizens can undoubtedly be proclaimed, if not a national, at least a State, holiday. I recognise that at the Cup meeting there may be many doubtful characters, but I do not know of any similar aggregation of people in any other part of the world, where doubtful characters will not be found. I believe that, as regards the  250,000  Australians who will be interested in the running for the Cup, their civilization, morality, and standard of life will compare more than favorably with those of any similar number of persons in any other country. I do not desire it to be understood that I am in the habit of following racing. I do not, as a rule, follow that sport ; but I have always taken an interest in the annual Cup meeting, and intend to continue to do so. The employés of the Parliament are employés of the Commonwealth. I do not know of the employés of any other employer in Victoria being likely to be called on to work on Tuesday next. Nor do I know anything connected with the Labour Government which should make them hostile to genuine sport, and if a sport is not properly conducted, it is the duty of the State to intervene. Surely a Labour Government is not going to be the only employer on Tuesday next that will refuse to its employés the right to enjoy a holiday in common with the rest of the citizens? I intend to vote for the motion, and I trust that my fellow senators will have the courage to vote for the holiday, which I know they desire. </para>

          <para>. - I take it for granted that the motion will be carried, as I know that there are not many " kill- joys " in the Senate. I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> however, in asking the Government to fix the hour of meeting on Wednesday next at  3  p.m., instead of  2.30  p.m., because the rule now is to meet at  3  o'clock on the first sitting day in the week. Probably a number of honorable senators will not spend Tuesday in Melbourne, but in other States, and I think on the first sitting day next week we should meet at the usual hour. I ask the Government to consider whether their business would not be just as far advanced by meeting at  3  p.m. as by meeting half-an-hour earlier. It is not too late to make an alteration. </para>
