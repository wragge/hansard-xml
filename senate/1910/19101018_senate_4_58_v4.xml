                LEDGER (Queensland) &#91;3.5&#93;. - In his speech on this very important question
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline>
                stated that 1 was a paid agent of a black labour party. Such statement is only a terminological inexactitude which ought to be accompanied with a more or less unpermissible adjective. I hope that it was made more in ignorance of the fact than with malice aforethought.

            <para>

                LEDGER.- I know that in the honorable senator&#39;s opinion it is so. We should try. to approach the consideration of this important question without regard to fashion or the prejudices of political parties or individuals. The organization with which I had something to do at the time published a manifesto, and in connexion with its issue I had a very prominent part. It was a frank recognition of the policy of a White Australia as laid down by the Federal Parliament, with regard to the sugar question in particular and with regard to its application to Australia generally.

                LEDGER.- With regard to political organizations, ladies can answer for themselves. But may I suggest that in political warfare it is in very bad taste, and is possibly an expression of political cowardice, for a man to try to hide himself behind anybody&#39;s petticoats in order to have a shot at another man?

                LEDGER. - I congratulate myself that I had some connexion with the issue of the manifesto in which the cardinal principle of a White Australia was laid down. I may add, however, that there was a tittle of truth in the honorable senator&#39;s statement, and that tittle of truth reminded me of Falstaff&#39;s pot-house bill, because it contained a halfpenny worth of bread to an intolerable deal of sack. The honorable senator was quite right, probably, in something which he suggested, be-&#39; cause on that occasion I was neither feed nor fed by the ravens, and in my defence, if such be needed, I may quote the hackneyed expression around which oceans of cant have surged, that &#34; the labourer is worthy of his hire.&#34; I come now to matters of policy. I am extremely gratified with the position which the Government take up on this question. During his speech,
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline>
                boldly proclaimed that he was in favour of a protective policy, and with it that necessary consequence, the abolition of the Excise duty and bounty which we are asked by these measures to impose in practically the same form as at present.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator ST.</inline>
                LEDGER. - By inference the honorable senator did in his speech on this question. Every one who was present on Friday will remember that
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline>
                quoted from a speech made by
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline>
                in a former Parliament, and pointed out that if there was any meaning to be attached to it, the honorable senator was relying largely on a Protective policy, even if the Protective policy which he sought to establish round the sugar industry also involved the principle of new Protection. So far as I am personally concerned, I am in entire sympathy with that Protective policy.

            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline>

                LEDGER.- The moment  1  attempt to reply to the honorable senator he shifts his ground. I challenge him to point to any statement of mine, either inside or outside of this Parliament, in which I declared myself in favour of abolishing the protective or the Excise duties upon sugar. Upon every occasion on which I was questioned upon this subject, I distinctly stated that until a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate the vexed question of the bounty and the Excise, it was impossible to say that we were legislating wisely for the industry. It is obvious to everybody that four separate branches of industry are involved in this question - that of the refiners, the manufacturers of raw sugar, the growers, and the labourers in the field. Nobody knows better than does
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline>
                that it is impossible to legislate effectively upon this question until the particular interests involved each by itself and each in relation to the other, is considered. Until that is done it is impossible to put before the country a harmonious scheme which will do justice to all. I wish now to deal with one important aspect of this question, namely, the position occupied by the field workers in the industry. It has been represented that I have deliberately indorsed the opinion that they should be condemned to a wage of 3s. 9d. per day. I absolutely deny that I ever expressed such an opinion. I hope that no labouring man will ever be obliged to work for that wage.

                LEDGER.- As a matter of fact, I was not specially representing any side. I desired that both sides should have a fair hearing. In commenting upon some representations that were made as to the amount of wages which should be paid, the Minister said -
            </para>
            <para>If you contend that there should be no departure from the 22s. 6d. rate, then the contention must be that 3s. gd. per  day  is sufficient? </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator ST.</inline>
                LEDGER. - That is hardly the position. The Act says that the rate of wages shall be determined on what is the standard rate of wages in the district. It is not for us to contend what is sufficient.

            <para class="block">At once the Minister replied - </para>

                LEDGER.- The Melbourne
                <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline>
                in its account of the deputation, reported another expression of mine. The report was accurate, though it did not give all that I said. The

                stated that-

            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline>
                Ledger said that the Act provided for the ruling rate of wages in the district. Personally, he thought that 30s. would not be too much if the industry could afford it.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline>

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator ST.</inline>
                LEDGER. - I had nothing to do with what any member of the deputation contended. Another aspect of the question is, that if the new Protection policy is inaugurated, it becomes a matter of how much the industry can afford to pay, striking a balance as between the legitimate claims of capital on the one hand, and of skilled or unskilled labour on the other. The interests of both sides must be related to the question of whether the industry can be carried on at all under the conditions imposed.

                LEDGER.- The honorable senator had better read the report of the deputation for himself. My object is to clear away, once and for all, the imputation that I individually, or the deputation as a whole, intended to interfere in fixing or determining any man&#39;s wage. That was the Minister&#39;s duty under the Act. Our object was to induce him to make an inquiry, and to see that fair play was done to one of the most important industries in our State, and, indeed, in Australia.

                LEDGER. - Some of the members of it came down to Melbourne to point out to the Minister the effect of the wages fixed by him for men working at a daily or weekly wage. They desired him to make further inquiries, and to assume an impartial attitude. In face of the quotations from the report of the deputation - in face of the remark made by me, which I have quoted from the Melbourne
                <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline>
                - it is impossible for any one to say truthfully that I, or any member of the deputation, endeavoured to set up an arbiter, apart from the Minister, as to what should be done.I say deliberately that the various bearings of this question have been so clouded with misrepresentation that it is almost impossible for anybody to make his attitude clear, unless his views are on all-fours with those of his political opponents. Furthermore, it is hardly possible for a person who assumes a fair attitude on the question to escape political calumny. I will give another instance. Because it was urged by some that, until a Royal Commission had thoroughly investigated and reported upon the sugar industry, further action should be stayed, I personally was accused - as were also other supporters of the late Government - of taking a particular course with the deliberate purpose of handing back the sugar industry to be worked by coloured labour.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator ST.</inline>
                LEDGER.  -  That would not &#34;obviously&#34; have been the effect, because there is not a single man in the party to which I belong who wished to see alien labour employed in the sugar industry, or in any other primary industry in Australia.

                LEDGER.  -  I have never employed cheap labour. I have never paid less than the ruling rate of wage to white labour. I have, when paying over my cheque, sometimes asked a man why so-and-so was the rate, &#34; but I have never objected to paying the ruling rate. But, on the contrary, I could point to examples in the ranks of my opponents upon which very severe comments might be made. What we are desirous of doing now is to secure that in any legislation that is passed every interest connected with the industry shall get a &#34; fair show &#34; as far as we can so provide. But. before we go. any further, let us clear away these misrepresentations.

                LEDGER.  -  My statement may mean to the honorable senator whatever he chooses to make it mean. But when a man in honest and decent company makes a statement on his personal responsibility - and in this case I am making a statement on my personal and political responsibility - it is usual for honest and decent men to accept his word. I repeat again, in answer to the dangerous insinuations conveyed from the other side, that I hope that in every industry in Australia, from north to south, we shall keep our labour white if we can do so. Time alone will decide. When we merely asked for inquiry, we were charged with being advocates of black labour. I find that the

                in this case. There, however, is the report of what he said. At the same time, every man who chooses to inquire as to what was intended to be done with the industry at that time is aware that it was within the scope of the Commission to find out in what way the industry might be more firmly and permanently made a white-labour industry. No impartial inquirer will dispute that statement. Notwithstanding that fact, for party and political purposes,
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Finlayson</inline>
                made the . statement to which I have referred. It was at once contradicted ; and I am not aware that the gentleman who made it has since retracted it. I mention these things in order that I may entreat honorable senators to extend fair play to those interested in this industry, and to consider the question apart from party prejudice. With regard to the wages paid in the industry, I am able to quote from the Queensland
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline>
                of 15th September, 1910, a table supplied by
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barbour,</inline>
                the member for Bundaberg in the Queensland Legislative Assembly. For aught I know, he may be an official of, or be closely connected with, associations of white workers or producers in the industry in the Bundaberg district. In a speech on the subject, he quoted the wages . paid in 1901, before Federation; and I ask honorable senators to bear in mind that in that year there commenced a very disastrous period of drought in Queensland. This is the table of wages paid prior to Federation, 1901 -

            <para class="block">If we add from 10s. to 15s. a week for cost of board, it will be seen that the wages paid prior to Federation to . persons engaged in certain branches of the industry were substantially higher than those fixed by any Minister of a Commonwealth Government.

The figures I have quoted will show what slight claim they have to be so regarded. They show also that the charges made against either those engaged in the industry or we who are in no way dependent upon it must fall to the ground. In view of these facts, I am entitled to ask how long ignorance or prejudice is to prevail in the consideration of this important question? . </para>

                LEDGER.- I have tried it before, and will continue to try it where I think it necessary. The honorable senator knows how much this kind of talk affects me, either here or on the public platform. Let me point out to honorable senators who desire, as I do, that this question should be discussed apart from the influence of party prejudice-

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator ST.</inline>
                LEDGER.- I am astonished at the interjection. The honorable senator implies that we are not fit to deal with a question which is more vital to the safety and development of this continent than to the existence of any party. When an honorable senator on this side frankly expresses his desire to lift it on to a higher plane, honorable senators on the other side should try to help us.
            </para>
            <para>The difficulties which surround the solution of this question may be summarized in four or five different forms. First, there are those who contend that protection alone, and with it the abolition of the Excise and the bounty, will, if adequate, be sufficient. That was, I take it, the object of much, if not of all, of the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> With the information that I possess, and in the light of his speech, I am inclined to think that if the opinion is not wholly sound, there is a great deal to justify it. The second difficulty which surrounds the question is, &#34; Shall we have protection plus Excise and bounty &#34; ? If I understand certain remarks which appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and expressions from the platform which have fallen from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bamford,</inline> who is a member for one of the most important sugar districts in Australia, I infer that, as a modification of that policy, he would require all three, that is protection, bounty, and Excise. Now, how can the public, or we, be said to have the fullest information on this point, when two powerful advocates sitting on one political side claim two things which, as between themselves, are more or less inconsistent? </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline>
                Givens. -  We both take up exactly the same attitude ; we say that until the Commonwealth gets control of industrial conditions we must have the bounty and the Excise.
            </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator ST.</inline>
                LEDGER.- Probably at the conclusion of my speech I shall say something about that matter. Then there is a third party comprising mostly the cane-growers, the manufacturers of raw sugar, and to a certain extent the labourers engaged in the industry. They are contending for different applications of two principles, Excise and bounty. For instance, one party contends strongly that the Excise should equal the import duty. Those who contend that the Excise should be equal to the import duty also contend that when the conditions on which the bounty is paid are complied with the Excise should be remitted to a certain extent for the benefit of the manufacturers of raw sugar, and through them, since so many mills in Queensland are co-operative, of the cane-growers, and further, through them, of the workers in the cane-fields. That is the third aspect of the question. There are four sets of contestants equally interested in the industry, with presumably equal knowledge of its requirements, who contend that the Excise should equal the bounty, and not the import duty, and that after the conditions of the bounty are complied with the Excise should go back to the grower. There you have four or five different solutions - and by combinations they might make more solutions - for the settlement of this great question, each in itself clear, and for its purpose equally emphatic. Each is urging us to bring about that policy, but the reasoning on which their contentions are based are contradictory. Yet, in face of that, we are invited to legislate on a subject on which there are powerful and, in some respects, irreconcilable differences of opinion. I intend to give the strongest proof of the evidence brought forward in . favour of each and every one of the different forms of dealing with the sugar industry. From the
                <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Courier,</inline>
                of the 28th May, 1907, I take the report of a deputation which waited upon

I am giving the testimony of each side in order to educate the Senate and the public as to the difficulties of the question.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator ST.</inline>
                LEDGER. - There is a strong opinion on both sides. I bring further evidence in support of the view that one solution of the difficulty would be advantageous to the cane-growers. I propose to quote some extracts from a letter by a gentleman who was engaged for years in growing cane, and who, to judge from his writings and speeches, seems to understand the question from end to end. In asking this gentleman for information, I inquired whether I should or should not use his name, and he left the matter to my discretion. As the result of reflection, T intend to give his name, because his statements may have an important bearing on the solution of this problem. I refer to
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline>
                A. Cribb, a sugar-grower, who resides at present at Milton, Brisbane, and who has been engaged for years as a cane-grower in the Nambour district. In his letter he disputes the accuracy of some returns on which Parliament is asked to determine a certain line of action. He says -
            </para>
            <para>The total bounty paid to the end of the current year will be &#163;2.330,000, which the sugar-growers will have paid as a net tax to the Federal revenue. </para>
            <para class="block">What he is contending is that the statistical return showing the contribution from the excess of revenue is under-stated rather than over-stated, and he gives reasons which, to my mind, are sufficient. At any rate, whether it is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2,</inline> 000,000 or &#163;2,300,000, the fact is indisputable that the Excise is contributing largely to the revenue, and that some portion, if not every portion, of the sugar industry is making a contribution to the revenue which no other industry is doing. Illustrating his argument, he says - </para>
            <para>This is a preposterous tax on less than 6,000 agriculturalists. The old legislation with the expiring clauses would have remedied this, and the grower would have got more for his cane. But now, by deleting the expiring clauses, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> the professed champion of sugar, is fastening permanently this iniquitous tax upon these few primary producers. Why should the grower of sugar-cane be heavily taxed for revenue purposes while the grower of wheat is free? I do not wish Free Trade. We must have at least <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> import duty if bounty is made equal to Excise, but, if not, we should have at least <inline font-style="italic">&#163;7</inline> or &#163;&#38; per ton import duty if bounty be <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per ton less, as we do not get <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> value of duty now. My contention is that sugar should have a <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> per ton protective duty against outside sugar, and the &#34; new Protection &#34; principle left to Wages Boards on the spot. </para>

His contention is that the grower pays the bounty, and in proof of his assertion he says that if the bounty and the Excise are abolished, the manufacturer will give the grower the benefit of the Excise.

            <para class="block">I do not agree that those who view this question from a different stand-point are the only persons who desire to see the sugar industry conducted exclusively by white labour.

                LEDGER.- On 6th February of the same year,
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline>
                is further reported in
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                as follows -
            </para>
            <para>Since the 31st January last they are entitled to a rebate of 4s. 3d. per ton on 10 per cent, sugar-cane, approximately, ^2 per ton on their sugar. But the Excise duty is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> per ton, and what I desire to know is whether the Government cannot see their way clear to give the whole of that Excise as a rebate upon sugar grown by white labour. </para>
            <para class="block">On the nth February, 1902, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> -said-  1 stated that, in my opinion, the whole of the Excise should go to the white grower, and I believe if the electors of Australia were polled that would be their view. </para>
            <para>In the face of such strong expressions of opinion by the head of the Government, it is somewhat extraordinary that these Bills should be submitted for our consideration.  1  confess that the subject is an intricate </para>
            <para class="block">One,  and that the ordinary student cannot be expected to -grasp it in all its details. Apparently, the Prime Minister entertains the opinion which I hold, namely, that before we can safely decide what shall be the future policy of the Commonwealth in regard to the sugar industry, we ought to be placed in possession of further information. I will now deal with the proposition -that the Excise should be equal to the import duty. A conference which was recently held in Bundaberg, drew up a certain number of resolutions, which make their view abundantly clear ; and it will be equally clear to the Senate that that view is contrary to the views expressed so often by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> and which were so ably stated in the passages that I have read. The first resolution was as follows : - </para>
            <para>Thar this Conference is of the opinion that the protection given by the Excise and bounty system to white growers is not sufficiently effective to keep coloured producers off the land, and that the Federal Government be asked to further protect the white growers. </para>
            <para class="block">Another resolution was - </para>
            <para>That, in the opinion of this Conference, the sugar Excise should be increased to equal the import duty, and that a proportion of such Excise be paid to the refiner on proof that he has paid an equitable price for raw sugars, and that the manufacturers of the latter have, in turn, paid an equitable price for cane to be wholly white grown, based upon its commercial value. </para>
            <para class="block">The cane-growers of Queensland are largely interested in the success of the cooperative mills, which manufacture raw sugar ; and it is to be noted that these cane-growers - many of them, presumably, having interests in the success of the cooperative mills - while, in one breath, they asked that the Excise should be equal to the duty, nevertheless asked that that Excise should be retained in trust, so that such a proportion of it as might be fair should go back to them ultimately. I fail to notice, in connexion with that resolution, that any particular regard was shown for the interests of those who work in the cane-fields. There is nothing to indicate that those who passed it cared whether the labour was white or black, so long as they got their &#34; whack &#34; out of it. The following resolution will probably interest the whole Senate : - </para>
            <para>That this Conference again urges upon the Federal Government the necessity for an inquiry into the affairs of the sugar industry, and requests that when reappointing or reconstructing the proposed Royal Commission, the Government should include two representatives of the growers, one from New South Wales, and one from Queensland, and suggests that all sections of the industry should also be represented. </para>
            <para class="block">I quote that because, although many of the members of the Conference probably differed from the policy which is advocated, even on the Ministerial side of the Chamber, they nevertheless asked for an inquiry. And rightly so, in face of the fact that the public of Australia contribute in some form an immense amount of money, and have a rght to know from reliable evidence whether the continuance of the bounty is justified. In the light of the controversy that has waged for eight or nine years, the demand of the Conference for an inquiry friendly to themselves is as justified as was the attitude of the late Government that, before Parliament decided, the whole question should be carefully looked into. </para>
            <para>There is another aspect of the question around which the most furious controversy has raged, and as to which conflicting aspects have been presented to the Senate. I refer to the relation of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to the industry. I take this opportunity of saying that I hold no brief for the company. As far as I am aware, I do not know a single shareholder in it. I certainly do not know a single official connected with it. I have received no communication from the company, directly or indirectly; and the facts that I shall give are the result of more or less original research of my own. The company is frequently represented as being an octopus preying upon the sugar industry, and which spreads its tentacles, not only over the producers and the workers, but over every consumer of sugar in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> concluded his speech on Friday with an attack upon the company. Most of what he said is ancient history. We who live in Queensland have heard these, statements on many occasions. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company is a recognised target for budding politicians. But it is only fair to say that my information is that the company itself courts inquiry. I also take the opportunity of saying, in the interests of fair play - because &#34; fair play is bonnie play,&#34; and there is an old proverb that we should deal fairly even with his Satanic majesty - that we should be prepared to give to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, at least, that protection which is meted out to the very worst of criminals. We should consider the whole of the evidence and sift it carefully before we condemn or take one sixpence from the criminal. As evidence that the doings of the company are not wholly bad, I quote this extract from a speech by a member of the Bundaberg conference to which I have just alluded - a man who is one of the vice-presidents of the Cane-growers Union. The charge has been made that this was an octopus upon the industry. He said, however - </para>
            <para>The Colonial Sugar Refining Co.&#39;s mill at Homebush treated the growers very well - better than any other mill in the district. </para>
            <para class="block">That is a fair compliment. I hope it is a deserved one. This gentleman went on - </para>
            <para>The growers all liked to get as much for  their  cane as they could. He received 15s. gd. for his cane, and he still felt that he had not got what he was entitled to on the price of raw sugar. </para>
            <para>I suppose that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is not a whit better, nor a whit worse, than any other company or man who goes into a business. He goes into it with the object of taking out of it as much as he economically or safely can. It is perpetually put before the people of Australia that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company exacts a heavy burden upon the consumer of sugar by increasing the price far in excess of the price ruling in other parts of the world, and thereby inflicts a gross injustice. But, as a matter of fact, the high price of sugar in Australia to-day is exactly paralleled by the high price of sugar throughout the whole world. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator ST.</inline>
                LEDGER.- Probably I shall be fairly safe in carrying my proposition a little further, and saying that, notwithstanding the working of this alleged octopus, and its infamous operations, the fact is unchallengeable that the high price of sugar to-day is absolutely dependent upon, and connected with, the high price throughout the world. In proof of the first portion of my assertion, that the high price of sugar is only on a par with the price in other parts of the world, I quote the following figures. On 3rd August of this year first mark granulated sugar stood at
                <inline font-style="italic">&#163;x6</inline>
                18s.
                <inline font-style="italic">46.</inline>
                per ton f.o.b. Hamburg. It we allow for the duty of
                <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline>
                per ton, and also allow
                <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline>
                18s. 4d. per ton for freight, commission, exchange, harbor dues, and landing charges, the price of sugar imported from Hamburg and landed in Australia would be
                <inline font-style="italic">&#163;24</inline>
                16s. 8d. per ton. But the following were the prices of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company&#39;s sugars on the day mentioned : - No. 1 B brewers&#39; crystals, ^23 15s. per ton; No. 1 X, &#163;22 15s. ; No. 1 XD, dried for manufacturing purposes,
                <inline font-style="italic">&#163;22</inline>
                15s.; No. 1 A,
                <inline font-style="italic">&#163;22</inline>
                15s.; No. 2 soft white,
                <inline font-style="italic">-&#163;21</inline>
                15s. ; No. 3 soft yellow,
                <inline font-style="italic">&#163;20</inline>
                5s. ; Millaquin No. 1 and 1 A, ^22 15s. ; Bingera A 1,
                <inline font-style="italic">&#163;21</inline>
                15s. ; Fairy Mead No. 1,
                <inline font-style="italic">&#163;22</inline>
                5s. In every case the Colonial Sugar Refining Company&#39;s price was lower than the price of refined sugar f.o.b. Hamburg.  1  am afraid that the public do not always remember or appreciate sufficiently the fact that sugar has been jumping in price during the last few years. Naturally, when the consumer sees an increase in the price of his sugar, he concludes that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is to blame. That company is made a scapegoat. We have a right, however, to consider the evidence on both sides. So much has been said on the other side that it is only fair that attention should be directed to this remarkable feature in connexion with the sugar markets of the world. On the 1st May, 1907, the price for Tait&#39;s granulated sugar, f.o.b. Hamburg, was &#163;11 18s. On the same date, in 1908, the price was &#163;13 10s. In 1909 it was &#163;12 1s. 8d., and on 1st May, 1910, it had risen to &#163;16 16s. 8d. These figures show a remarkable jump up during the period mentioned.

                - If the honorable senator had gone further back, he would have found that in one year the price was only&#163;6 10s. per ton.

                LEDGER. - Very possibly ; but the figures I have quoted show that the prices rose considerably. If the figures with respect to the prices of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company&#39;s sugars be correct, they show that the company did not take full advantage of the rise in prices. Now, with regard to the relations between the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the raw sugar mills, I take the following extracts from the
                <inline font-style="italic">Australian Sugar Journal</inline>
                of 6th May, 1910: -
            </para>
            <para>The bonus payable by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company under their agreement with raw sugar mills amounted to 43s. at the close of April, 1910. It is now running at the rate of 6s. per month, and should no further change in prices take place the bonus on the year&#39;s crop will be &#163;2 15s. per ton, making the total price to the mills &#163;12 2s. 6d. per ton, as against &#163;11 3s. 5d. per ton last year. </para>

                LEDGER.- The manufacturers of raw sugar are contending that, notwithstanding the bonus paid to them by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company on every advance in price, they are not getting as much advantage from the high prices ruling as they would obtain if their raw sugar went into the open market. That is one of the charges brought against the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and I admit that the evidence in support of it is very strong. To some extent, it seems to me that the charge is a justifiable one ; but the answer of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is this: &#34; We guarantee to you at the beginning of the season the price which we will pay for your raw sugar during the year. If the price of sugar rises we shall give you, in addition, 18s. out of every&#163;1 of the rise in price. We are entitled to get some advantage from an improvement in the market, because if the price falls you will still receive the guaranteed price for your sugar, and you do not insure us against loss.&#34;

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator ST.</inline>
                LEDGER. - I say that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company have a complete refutation of the charge that they are taking everything from the grower and the miller by reason of their monopoly. It is not contended now that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company do this. The only contention urged against them now is that while the market for sugar is high the producers of raw sugar might get a little more for their sugar if they could get to the open market. There are two replies to that contention, if it be correct. The first is that a bargain is a bargain; and when one insures himself against loss, he must take some risks if there is a rise in the price of the article in which he deals. I do not know that I have accurately represented the position.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator ST.</inline>
                LEDGER. - Exactly. Will not the honorable senator discard that halo of Pharisaism, which does not become him? He is usually very frank in the statements he makes. With respect to the suggestion that I am an advocate for the company, I may be allowed to say that I do not know a single soul, shareholder or official, connected with the company, and have not had a single communication from them. But when we are dealing with a company whose influence in this industry is sure to be very strong, we are entitled to treat them to at least the same justice as we would extend to a criminal. If we were dealing with a criminal we should hear the evidence on both sides, and sift it before preparing the guillotine for him.
            </para>
            <para>I shall deal now with another aspect of the misrepresentations hurled against this company. I quote from a newspaper, which has a better opinion of most of the members of the Senate than it has of me. I refer to the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> which in an article appearing on the 7th July, 1910, stated that the stoppage of work at the Australian Jam Factory was the direct outcome of the company&#39;s price for sugar, and that Java sugar could be landed here at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;g</inline> 15s. per ton, or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 7s. 9d. per ton below the Colonial Sugar Refining Company&#39;s price. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Symonds,</inline>
                the Melbourne manager of the company, in a letter which appeared on the nth July. I ask honorable senators to bear in mind that the charge was that the Australian Jam Factory had to close up because of the operations of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. That would be a very serious thing if it were true. I ask honorable senators to listen as impartially to the reply to the charge, which may be regarded as a sample of a number of the misrepresentations and false assertions made concerning the operations of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company.

And yet in the light of this ignorance we are asked to pass these two Bills. </para>

                (Queensland) &#91;4.40&#93;.  - 1  was in hopes that before this legislation was brought down a Royal Commission would have been appointed for the purpose of giving both the Government and the Parliament some idea of the best lines on which to legislate. Last year we were promised that a Royal Commission would be appointed to make an inquiry, but the proposal seems to have hung in the air. We know no more now than we did then. Each member of Parliament is allowed to grope in the dark and to get whatever information he can. Like many honorable senators, I have never had any practical experience of sugar-growing. I have obtained my information on the subject from men who are interested in the industry, and from other sources. If the Government thought it was necessary to bring down a measure this year they ought to have appointed a Royal Commission at the earliest possible moment, and in the light of their report we could have discussed the subject and legislated. After opposing the use of coloured labour for thirty or forty years, I am very pleased to find to-day that there are no persons in Australia advocating a return to its employment. It met with my opposition as soon as it was introduced into this country. I expressed my opinion both from the platform and from my place in the State Assembly. A great many persons who were then strongly in favour of employing coloured labour are now convinced, I am very happy to say, that the sugar industry can get along without its use. Instead of having coloured labour on large plantations we have now some thousands of white farmers, a large number of whom, I understand, are making a comparatively ;rood living. But I am sorry to say we still have a proportion of coloured persons on small areas which are sublet to them by white men. I should like to see that done away with altogether, and, perhaps, before I sit down I may suggest to the Government how it might be done. It is an idea of mine which may be worth something or nothing.  1  have&#34; considered the matter from all sides and tried to find a solution to satisfy myself.

                I do not think for a moment that it would, but it would obtain information which no member of the Senate is able to get. I may speak to a man and hear from him a certain view of the matter, but a Royal Commission would take all evidence on oath, and as a witness would be liable to punishment if he gave wrong evidence, the presumption is that the Senate could rely upon evidence so obtained when it was legislating. Clause 2 of this Bill reads -

            <para>Section three of the Sugar Bounty Act 1905 is amended by omitting therefrom the following words &#34; and before. the first day of January On:thousand nine hundred and thirteen.&#34; </para>
            <para class="block">The object of the clause is, I take it, to extend the bounty to 1913, but we should do more than that. We should put the thing on a firm and lasting foundation. I do not believe in this patchwork legislation extending the aid for a year or two, and giving no idea of stability to the persons engaged in the industry. Hitherto the legislation has been liable to alteration in the course of a few years. Every honorable senator knows that a man who embarks in the industry and clears a piece of land - very often scrub land - has to wait more than three years before he can get a return. It takes him more than that time to get in his first crop. Nearly every Act conferring protection contains no specified period for its operation. It takes a long time to alter a measure of that kind. Long ago we found anomalies in the Tariff, and they still remain, but the sugar legislation will, if not continued, expire by effluxion of time. If the Parliament were to sit tight the Acts would expire. It is obvious to every one that it is much harder to get Parliament to repeal an Act conferring protection than it is for an Act to expire by effluxion of time. That is why I hold that we have not given proper encouragement to persons to enter the sugar industry. I believe that it will not be confined to Queensland and New South Wales, but will be established in some portions of Western Australia, and also on the Roper River and various portions of the Northern Territory, and very likely sugar will be grown before long in Papua. We should legislate on this subject as if we meant real business and desired persons to embark in the occupation. Clause 3 of the Bill reads - </para>

            <para class="block">The Government of Victoria are taking steps to induce the establishment of the beet-sugar industry. That would get the full benefit of the protection of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> a ton just as the cane-sugar industry would do, so that this legislation is not confined to Queensland, as a good many persons seem to think. Sugar may be grown in any one of the States, and I believe that if we give a thoroughly sound protection, not for a few years only, we shall have persons embarking in the industry. Clause 4 of the Bill reads - </para>

            <para class="block">Does not that give the Commonwealth full power to deal with the labour question? Does it not give this Parliament the fullest power to act?

                - I admit that. There are two or three ways of dealing with the matter. I do not think the Minister is so foolish that he cannot find a way out of the difficulty if he wishes to do so. I think I can. In Queensland we have farmers who have established co-operative mills. The State Government has advanced large sums to these farmers, and the industry is extending by leaps and bounds. But the Commonwealth, through not passing legislation which the people have wanted, has handicapped the industry in more ways than one in districts where a certain amount of cane is produced and there is a co-operative mill. Our object ought to be to settle a white population on the land. We hear complaint&#39; about the continued employment of black labour, but in actual practice a great many persons who make them do not give to white labour the assistance which, I maintain, they should. They certainly do not give help by legislation, or in any form which would benefit the people employed. I do not believe that there is a white farmer in Queensland or New South Wales who wants to employ coloured labour. Of course, T know the excuse which was put forward by the advocates of coloured labour thirty years ago. To a certain extent, there was a fair and reasonable ground for their contention. At that time the gold-fields were occupying public attention. One or two rushes were taking place nearly every year, and it was felt that if white men were employed on the cane-fields when the cane had to be harvested, and a rush broke out, the growers would be ruined. Therefore, they decided to employ coloured labour, although it was not cheaper than white labour, to collect the crop. That might have been a reasonable excuse to put forward thirty or forty years ago, when we had few persons in the State, but that is not the position to-day. I am glad to say that I have not heard this matter mentioned for a considerable number of years. Since no white farmers desire to employ coloured labour, we should try to make their conditions as good as possible, and  encourage them to pay even higher wages &#34;than they do. I am a thorough advocate of paying good wages to good men. I believe that every employer who does not pay good wages stands in his own light, because he gets unsatisfactory work.

                The State does not subsidize the sugar industry by one penny. &#34;On the contrary, both the State and the Commonwealth make a benefit out of it, as I shall show later. In Queensland we have three refinery companies, one of which is, I believe, owned by the Queensland National Bank, and we have a branch of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, whose head-quarters are in New South Wales. I am not here to advocate the interests of that company, or of the refinery companies which are backed up by the Queensland National Bank or any other capitalists. From information I have received, I believe that these companies lost a lot of money when they started their operations. Any man who enters into an industry which will eventually absorb millions of capital is bound to lose for some time, but he always looks forward to being recouped. When the shipping companies -started in Queensland, they had to expend large sums. The Australasian United Steam Navigation Company bought some of them out. For years their balance-sheet showed a loss, but as traffic grew they eventually made a profit. The same thing is true of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and, indeed, of every other company. But for that company the sugar industry in Australia would not occupy the position that it occupies to-day. I have conversed with scores of persons in the employ of the company in Queensland and New South Wales, and they all give it the very best of names. Only last year I met a man in Brisbane who had worked for it at Cairns. He had been in the country only about twelve years, and he started with a wage of&#163;1 or 25s. per week. He was a  thrifty man, and as a result of his thrift had saved&#163;400 or . &#163;500. When the company was cutting up some of its land he requested it to sell him a portion of it upon time payment.  His  request was acceded to. The company treated him magnanimously. In effect, it said, &#34; Here is a farm. We will not take a single penny from you at present. Husband your resources to tide you over your first year.&#34; That man eventually paid for his farm, and with his wife was able to take a spell down south. Such a company ought not to be condemned for acting unfairly.

                <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs,</inline>
                there are 4,630 farmers in Queensland who are producing sugar exclusively by white labour, in addition to 320 farmers who are producing it with the aid of coloured labour. Between 1902 and 1910 there has been a rapid increase in the number of white men engaged in the industry. In the former year only 1,521 white farmers were employed in growing cane in Queensland, whereas in 1910 the total was 4,630. These figures evidence that the industry is one which is worth encouragement. In 1902 the sugar produced by white labour totalled 12,254 tons, whereas the estimated yield for 19 10 is 170,684 tons. Why do the Government desire to make a profit out of this industry? The statement that it receives a bounty is absolutely absurd.

They do not want to have passed an Act that will expire by effluxion of time.  If  any one proposed to pass an Act of Parliament for the protection of other industries with the understanding that it should1 expire in  191 3,  how the representatives of the States affected would howl ! Why, then, should legislation of this character affecting the sugar industry be passed ?  I  want to show now what the Commonwealth has made out of the sugar industry since it assumed control. The figures with regard to the Excise and bounty are shown on page  4  of the statistics relating to the sugar industry. They clearly show that the Government has made a profit of over   &#163;2,000,000  out of the industry. What other industry in Australia is there from which the Government has made a profit?

                We all know that ; but the Victorian protected industries also received the advantage of the open markets of the other five States as soon as Inter-State Free Trade was established. What other industry is there out of which the Government makes an enormous profit?

                The advantage of extended markets applied not only to the sugar industry. The honorable senator forgets the great advantages conferred upon the industries in his own State. The Excise collected from the sugar-growers in  1909-10  was  .&#163;548,718,  and the Government gave back in bounty  &#163;4&#176;7&#187;779-  Consequently the Commonwealth netted a profit of  .&#163;140,939.  If, in the same way, the Commonwealth Government levied an Excise duty on wheat, I am quite sure that the South Australians would complain. What would
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline>
                Russell say if it were proposed to levy a heavy Excise on wine, and then pay to the South Australian growers three-fourths of the amount, and call it a bounty? Why should the sugar industry be picked out as the only industry to be treated in this manner? If the money taken from the Queensland growers were left in their pockets, they would be able to pay better wages than they are paying to-day. Let it be remembered that the small farmer, who is able to grow about  20  tons of sugar, has to pay to the Commonwealth  ,&#163;80  in cash before his sugar leaves the mill. The laughable aspect of the case is&#39; that the Commonwealth thereupon pays him a bounty of  &#163;60.  What a nice, kind Government it is ! Yet I am sure that there are thousands of people in Australia who entertain the idea that the Queensland sugar-growers are advantaged by the bounty. They do not know that the growers of cane, before they receive a penny of bounty, have to get advances from the banks on the security of their sugar, in order to pay the Excise to the Government. An entirely false impression is conveyed as to this bounty. As a matter of fact, the cane-grower is net even protected to the full extent of the &#163;6 per ton . which is imposed on imported sugar. The actual protection is only  &#163;5  per ton. The cost of sugar in the world&#39;s markets regulates the price in our markets.

                - I am quite certain that the Federal Parliament cannot interfere with the alleged &#34;monopoly.&#34; All the legislation that we could pass could not rule the markets of the world. It is absurd to use the word monopoly in this connexion. Are the markets of New York, London, and Hamburg controlled by a monopoly in Australia? Some years ago, sugar was much cheaper than it is to-day because of the quantity of beet sugar produced in Germany. Millions of tons were produced under the influence of a subsidy granted by the German Government. An enormous quantity was exported, for which an increased bounty was paid. The market was a fictitious one. The consequence was that the price was very low. It was bounty-fed German beet sugar that brought down the price. To-day, prices are much higher, but that fact has nothing whatever to do with any company operating in Australia.

                That monopoly for a time kept prices down. It is not keeping them down now. It could not be done without the Government subsidy ; and we have now a difference of only  &#163;2  per ton in the price in protected Australia as compared with the price in Great Britain with free imports. Though I have particulars here to a halfpenny, I speak in round figures; and it is quite enough to say that the difference is practically  ,&#163;2  per ton between the cost in Great Britain of sugar grown by cheap and coloured labour and the cost in Australia of sugar grown by white labour, and by - I say this without fear of contradiction - the best paid labour in the world in the same industry. I should like to see labour in this industry paid even better than it is ; and that might be done if the Government would only act fairly by the industry.

                Ledger read the report of the deputation ; and it is unnecessary that 1 should read it again. At present, the Government derive a revenue ot
                <inline font-style="italic">j&#163;i</inline>
                on every ton of sugar produced in Australia ; and since  1902-3  that revenue has amounted to over  .&#163;2,000,000.  Honorable senators say that they do not believe in taxing the primary industries of the country ; but the Government are .proposing that we should continue this tax upon the sugar industry at least until  19 13.  We give the people interested in the industry no assurance that the existing arrangements will not be extended beyond that date. What we ought to do, and what I thought would be proposed in this Bill, is to increase the Excise of  ^4  per ton to &#163;6 per ton, making it equal to the amount of the import duty. That Excise duty might be charged upon every ton of sugar grown by coloured labour, and, even if the whole amount of the Excise of &#163;6 per ton were refunded to the grower of sugar with white labour, the Government might make money out of the business. Is not that a fair proposition? Will honorable senators opposite contend that it is right to put the sugar-farmer in a position different to that of any other farmer in the country? If what I suggest were carried out, there would not be a ton of cane grown in Australia by coloured labour. We should, by that means, completely oust the little farmers employing coloured labour. If it were found necessary, the Excise duty might be made even higher than I have suggested, so long as the whole of the duty were refunded in the case of sugar grown by white labour. Honorable senators opposite profess that they do not believe in coloured labour, but the legislation they are proposing is not in accord with that profession. The Government have the whole matter in their hands, and I do not find any fault with them for taking every precaution to see that no bounty is paid on sugar grown by coloured labour. In section 4 of the Act, it is provided that -

                It has varied a little, but it reached , &#163;7,000 in only one year. What I suggest would be a more statesmanlike proposal than that which is contained in the legislation now proposed, and it is what we have a right to expect would have been proposed by a Labour Government. We had a right to believe that a Labour Government would not propose that the matter should be hung up for at least the next three years, giving no security of conditions to the men engaged in this industry. No man will go into an industry without having some security as to the permanence of the conditions attaching to it. A man thinking of going into the sugar industry to-day will not know when the conditions surrounding it will be altered, and if it were only to encourage people to take up land for the cultivation of sugar, it would be well to adopt the suggestion I have made. I have spoken to people who desire to go into the industry, but they are held back by the doubt that exists as to what the conditions will be. The State Government have been asked to advance money for the construction of cooperative mills, or to increase the capacity of mills already in existence, but are unable now to crush all the cane available. But the State Government have said, &#34; We have nothing to do now with either duty or Excise, and we decline to advance any more money for this purpose until the Commonwealth Parliament does something to put the industry upon a sound and permanent footing.&#34; Why will they not do so? Perhaps some honorable senators opposite know the reason, but I do not. I think that no fairer proposal could be made than that which I have suggested. If there is any difficulty in the way of giving it effect, I should like to be told what it is. If this Parliament can pass a law imposing an Excise duty of &#163;4 with a return of &#163;3 per ton on sugar grown by white labour, it can pass a law fixing the Excise at &#163;6 per ton and returning  &#163;6  per ton on sugar grown by white labour. We should thus do away with the employment of black, labour in this industry altogether. If the professions&#39; of honorable senators opposite are genuine, and they really do not believe in black labour, an opportunity is now afforded them to show that they want a White Australia. At present, 15,000 tons of cane are grown by black labour in Queensland, and some in New South Wales; but if the proposal I make were carried out it would be impossible for those who employed black labour in the cultivation of sugar to make a living at the business. But instead of adopting such a proposal, the Government propose to hang the matter up for at least&#39; three years.

I have already proved that the Government have ample power to prevent any sugar grown by coloured labour coming into the market without paying the full amount of
                <inline font-style="italic">j&#163;6</inline>
                per ton. But I do not want the Government to penalize white growers to the extent of as. per ton, and in some instances a little more. With one voice the Government say, &#34; We are going to help the sugar industry&#34;; but what help will be given when they take  2s.  off every ton of sugarcane which a white grower produces? I am quite willing that he should be hound down strictly as regards labour conditions. 3 feel satisfied that if he is given an extra sum of  2S.  a ton he will be able to pay better wages. But what is proposed ? It is proposed to go on for the next three years exactly as in the past. There has been nothing more scandalous than for honorable senators to come here and make out that the Government were paying a bounty when it was no bounty at all. I notice, sir, that you are looking at me. I suppose you think that the word I used is strong. I would use stronger language when men who profess to abhor coloured labour are indifferent when it is shown to them how it can
                <inline font-style="italic">be</inline>
                done away with in the sugar industry. When it is pointed out to them that they can make the business so expensive that it would not pay even blacks to grow sugar, they are not prepared to protect the white growers, but are content to allow things to go on for three years as in the past. If they do not encourage coloured labour by -their words, they do so by their act. We want to do away with the 300 or 400 sugar- ;growers who are employing coloured labour in Queensland, and to insure that not a ton of sugar shall be grown by such labour in Australia. I am prepared to support any Government which will make the Excise duty high enough to attain that object. But I would return the Excise money to  every white man growing sugar under conditions laid down by the Government. In that way you would soon have no black- ; grown sugar.

                We have heard this afternoon how those persons have cried out about the duty on sugar, and the price of it. When they complain of a duty of about &#163;d. per lb., they forget that Parliament has presented them with a protection of  2d.  per lb. on imported jam.
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline>
                J. Russell has stated that the consumer has to pay tire extra Jd. per lb. on. the sugar. But who has to pay the extra  2d.  per lb. on jam which is imported into Victoria and other States? It is peculiar that an honorable senator can look at a thing with one eye to-day, and shut the other eye when he is looking at the sugar industry. I believe that every representative of Queensland would unanimously support the Government if they brought down a policy such as I have advocated ; but we only number six in a Chamber of thirty-six members. Of course, if we get no support from the other side, or if the Government simply say, &#34; We will not accept your suggestion, but will go on as we have been doing,&#34; they will carry the day. But I venture to hope that better counsels will prevail, and that they will yet see their way not to hang up the sugar industry in the air, as it were, for the next three years. It is not possible to induce men to embark their capital or labour in an industry unless they feel that they have some security. Until this Parliament has put the sugar industry on a sound basis, the Queensland Government have refused to advance more money to cooperative sugar mills. It has advanced thousands of pounds to such mills, and most of them have been successful. A committee of farmers is appointed to manage each mill, and as soon as they repay the loan it becomes their own property. Surely we ought to help these self-supporting, self-reliant persons. Surely they are the men whom we want to occupy our sugar lands and to defend Australia in time of peril. We are spending millions on defence, but where are the people to defend the States, if we do not induce settlement? The more people we bring into the country, the more sugar will be consumed. We need a large influx of population. I expect to see sugar grown in the north-western portion of Western Australia, and also on the Roper River, in the Northern Territory. I hope that the industry will flourish, but, at the same time, I trust that this Parliament will take steps to protect the people who are on the land, will do away with coloured labour, and will certainly pass no measure to practically encourage its employment. I expected a different measure from a Labour Government and from the party behind them, but, to my sorrow, I see that this patchwork legislation is to continue for three years.

I find myself in exactly the same position now as I was when the previous Ministry were in office. We tried in every possible way to induce them to do what we. are asking the present Government to do. They promised to do so, but they went out of power before it could be done. I believe that this country will be disappointed with the work of the Labour Government. I feel certain that the persons who grow sugar will be disappointed with this measure. I hope that before very long this or some other Government will do what is right and just to the people engaged in the sugar industry, without fear or favour, and dispose permanently of the coloured-labour question.

                (Western Australia) &#91;5.35&#93;- - I am glad to have this opportunity to take a share, although my act may be open to suspicion, in extending to the sugar industry that encouragement to which it is entitled. I have assumed that it was necessary for me to begin with that assurance, especially in view of remarks which have been made by some representatives of Queensland. It has been stated repeatedly by Senators St. Ledger and Sayers that it is very necessary that a different course should be adopted in order to drive coloured labour out of the sugar areas.

                has found fault with the effort made by the Labour Government to confine sugar production entirely to white labour. If we turn to the history of sugar production, we find that Queensland alone endeavoured for a long time to rid itself of the employment of coloured labour in her sugar areas. I hear a number of &#34; Hear, hears &#34; from honorable senators on the other side. I am pleased to have that announcement of their conversion, in view of the attitude which they have taken up in the past.

                with the conduct and policy of the Labour Government, if he is not satisfied with the rate of speed attained in getting rid of coloured labour, he must, indeed, be greedy. Does he desire to get rid of it by some sort of supernatural means? The records show that when the industry was brought under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Parliament, no less than 84 per cent, of the sugar produced in Queensland was produced by black labour. But as the result of the policy which was inaugurated by this Parliament - largely owing to the influence of the Labour party-

                I repeat that as the result of the policy which was laid down by this Parliament - largely owing to the influence of the Labour party - within the brief space of nine years the quantity of sugar produced in Queensland by black, labour has been reduced to 8 per cent. If
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline>
                desires more rapid progress than that he must indeed be a whale for. progress. It is obvious that within a very few years, under the benign influence of the policy which Queensland found it impossible to introduce, there &#34;will not be a single black man left in the industry.. Personally, I am perfectly satisfied with the speed which has marked the decrease of coloured labour in the sugar industry. Numerous complaints have been made in regard to the necessity for giving security to the giower in this industry. I agree with the contention of Senators St. Ledger, Sayers and Chataway that the sugar bounty does not come out of the pocket of the taxpayer. The position really is that the persons employed in sugar production give with one hand what they pay back to themselves with the other.

                - The Excise duty of 4s. per cwt. upon raw sugar finds its way back into the pockets of the grower in the form of bounty; so that the persons engaged in the production of sugar actually pay their own bounty.. It is not suggested that these Bills will in any way interfere with the protective incidence of the Tariff. As far as the Tariff is concerned, the sugar-growers have no more reason to complain than have other manufacturers. The boot manufacturers, for example, have as much right to complain as have the cane-growers, because their only protection is to be found in the amount of duty imposed.

                Ledger is unfounded. That honorable senator has made a very  flambuoyant  utterance, in which he expressed the desire to see the industry conducted exclusively by white labour. I do not know whether he is a recent convert to that policy.  His  assertion that he desires to see the best conditions possible obtaining in the industry is difficult to reconcile with his former attitude upon this question. Both he and
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline>
                have professed themselves anxious to see the best possible conditions obtaining in the industry, and only white labour employed in it. Yet they were members of a deputation which waited upon  a  former Minister of Trade and Customs, the object of which was the very reverse. At that time, the wages of labourers in the field during the slack season had been fixed at 22s. 6d. per week. When it was found that that wage was utterly inadequate, the Government of the day thought it wise to increase it so as to enable the workers to participate in the profits of the industry. Consequently, it was proposed to establish if at from 22s. 6d. per week upwards.

Senators St. Ledger and Chataway were members of the deputation in question ; and by their presence, they encouraged the belief that 3s.9d. per day was a fair wage. Some of the members of that deputation even went so far as to declare that it was too much.

                This League calls itself national.&#34; What crimes are committed in the name of nationality ! As far as hiding behind a hedge is concerned, I repudiate doing anything of the kind. I consider that when these ladies leave their domestic surroundings, come forward into the light of day, and take an active part in political affairs, they abandon their entrenchments, and ought to be just as much exposed to .public criticism as if they were men. They choose to take an active part in shaping the political destinies of the country, and there is no reason why one should be particularly delicate in criticising them. In fact, they rather court criticism. A conference of this League was held in Melbourne in 1907. Queensland was represented there, and the important subject of coloured labour came up for discussion.

It has been shown by evidence produced before this Parliament that the bounties granted for the benefit of the growers have not reached their pockets as intended, but have gone into the coffers of the company.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price,</inline>
                wished to encourage the farming industry by making a remission of railway rates. Upwards of , &#163;30,000 was remitted with the object of benefitting the wheat industry. Yet a Parliamentary Committee found that the benefits had been intercepted by the middle men instead of reaching the farmers. The same sort of thing is being experienced in Queensland, where the bounty of , &#163;3 per ton on sugar has been intercepted by those engaged in the manufacture of sugar.

                Ledger. Those concerned in the sugar industry give a very different aspect to the position as it affects them. Lately, at a meeting of growers held at Bundaberg, it was shown that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company very effectually intercepts the benefit intended to be conferred upon the growers by the import duty of &#163;6 per ton.

                Yes, &#163;5 per ton to growers of sugar by white labour. To show that the benefit intended to be conferred upon the growers by the duty of &#163;6 per ton does not reach them, I quote  the following opinions expressed at a meeting of growers in Bundaberg on 19th February, 1909-

It seemed impossible at present to get at the values of their cane ; he would like to see the industry nationalized, but the next best thing to that was to have a refinery of their own. They were at present giving their best to the refiner, who was making enormous profits.

                - I have little more to say about the opinion of the growers of cane in Queensland as to the way in which they have been treated by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in the past. At a meeting of growers in Bundaberg a pamphlet was issued in which the position is tersely summed up in the following paragraph :-
            </para>
            <para>According to statistics the average analysis of cane throughout the sugar areas of the Commonwealth rarely falls below 7 per cent, p.o.c.s., which means possible obtainable sugar contents, and that the density for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company appears to be based on sugar maintaining an average value of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;20</inline> ros. per ton. The average value of cane would, therefore, be not less than <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> per ton.  The  Colonial Sugar Refining Company claim to extract more than 90 per cent, of the possible obtainable sugar contents. The average of other mills must be well above 80 per cent. When the grower therefore is only getting an average of &#163;1 per ton, or less, for his cane, including Government rebate, it is very evident that the profits of the industry are nearly all going into the millers&#39; section of the business, and that under existing conditions the benefits of the protection afforded by the import duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> per ton are merely building up and strengthening a  huge  monopoly. </para>
            <para class="block">The sugar-growers in Queensland contend that the protection of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> per ton given by the Parliament of the Commonwealth goes entirely into the pockets of the shareholders of a private monopoly. </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline>
                Stewart. -  Not entirely, surely?
            </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator LYNCH.</inline>
                - I have no wish to improve upon the statement put forward by those who are most intimately concerned in the business, and I repeat that they say that under existing conditions the benefits of the protection afforded by the import duty of &#163;6 per ton are merely building up and strengthening a huge monopoly. It would take very little inquiry by any person anxious to satisfy himself to ascertain how this is done. In the same pamphlet a statement is made of the prices offered by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to the sugar farmers of Queensland. The prices offered for sugar-cane of varying density, from 6.5 to 16 per cent. of sugar contents, are given. It is not necessary to refer to them all, but I may say that 9s. 6d. per- ton is paid for cane of an average density of n per cent. It takes 9 tons of this cane to make a ton of sugar, so that the raw material required to produce a ton of sugar of average quality costs
                <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4.</inline>
                5s. 6d. In this pamphlet it is also laid down that the cost of producing raw sugar in Queensland, according to the Queensland Auditor-General&#39;s report, was in 1905-6
                <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline>
                18s. 7d. per ton. In 1906-7 it was
                <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline>
                14s. 7d. In 1907-8 it was
                <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline>
                17s. 4d. The average cost of the manufacture of raw sugar during the three years mentioned was only  &#163;2  16s. rod. per ton. This includes maintenance and renewals of mill machinery, tramways, &#38;c, cost of wages, salaries, rations, fuels, mill supplies, horse feed, sugar carriage, and all other expenses as well. In the case of the Nerang Central Mill, which works only a single shift throughout the season, and handles about  10,000  tons of cane annually, the cost of making white sugar averages
                <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline>
                15s.  per ton.
            </para>
            <para class="block">
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline>
                -  That mill is obsolete.
            </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator LYNCH.</inline>
                - That only strengthens my argument. I have shown that the cost of the raw material required for the manufacture of a ton of sugar is
                <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline>
                5s.
                <inline font-style="italic">6d.,</inline>
                or  9s. -6d.  per ton of cane, and the cost of manufacture is
                <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline>
                15s.  per ton on the basis of the cost in the Nerang obsolete mill. This gives a total of  &#163;9  os.  6d.  as the cost of a ton of sugar, including the price of cane and the cost of manufacture. It is clear from this that the consumers of sugar throughout the Commonwealth, where it is a necessary of life in almost every household, are being charged an extraordinarily high price for sugar. They are paying at the present time about
                <inline font-style="italic">&#163;21</inline>
                per ton, although it is shown by this pamphlet that it costs only  &#163;9  os.  6d.  per ton to produce it.

                - In a two hours&#39; harangue this afternoon the honorable senator had not a harsh word to say about the company.

                - I am taking the average quality to show what could be done if we had not the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to contend with, and to rake in profits on a colossal scale. It is easily explained how it is doing this thing. One expedient which the company resorts to in order to hide its enormous profits is mentioned in the Sydney
                <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline>
                of June,  1908 -
            </para>
            <para>At the date of the last balance of the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. (March 31), there was a sudden jump in the amount of disclosed profit available for reserves; and, as seemed likely at the time, that was a hint of a further pending issue of shares. The proposed issue is, however, larger than was expected ; it is intended to send out no less than 17,500, paying for them by transferring , &#163;350,000 of reserves to capital. The present paid capital is , &#163;2,500,000 (disregarding a few pounds still unpaid in respect to the last issue of shares), so the new issue will bring the total up to , &#163;2,850,000. </para>
            <para>The authorised capital is , &#163;3,000,000, so there will still be&#163;150,000 to deal with in the future - and no doubt it will be dealt with in the same good old way. The present new issue will not, of course, add a penny to the co.&#39;s available capital. It will, however, have this effect : a 10 per cent, dividend, instead of absorbing  &#163;125,000 per half-year, will for the future absorb&#163;142,500. There are not many co.&#39;s that are worried about how to dispose of their profits ; but the C.S.R. Co. is one of the few there are. Or, really, its trouble is to dispose of its increasing profits without putting its dividend higher, and thus drawing attention to its affluence. </para>
            <para>The new issue of shares - seven for every existing 50 - will wipe out nearly all the reserves. But, as frequently pointed out here, the C.S.R. Co.&#39;s reserves arc not to be taken very seriously. For years past hardly anything has been added to them ; only just enough profit has been disclosed to pay the dividend. The unknown surplus - assuming that there has been a surplus - has been applied to the writing down of assets. In other words, the reserves have been internal, which is the polite way of saying hidden. </para>
            <para class="block">It is clear that by the favourite dodge of watering its stock, and applying the annual profits towards the writing down of capital, the company has been able to solidify its financial position enormously, and to pay  10  per cent, on its inflated capital year after year. That is the secret of the illustration I have given - paying such a small price for the raw material on the one hand and charging such a high price to the consumer of sugar on the other.

                - I do not intend to argue the question of a wage of  3s.  od. a day. It is quite sufficient for me to show that the three elements which are concerned in sugar production are dissatisfied. A wage of  22s.  6d. a week in Australia is nothing short of scandalous. It is a wage which the workers in the sugar industry should not be called upon to accept, but which is forced upon them by the cruel exactions of a company which is at present fostered by, and has apologists in, honorable senators who have come from Queensland. I desire to refer to a remark made by Senators Sayers and St. Ledger about the way in which the producers of wheat, wine, and other products are favoured by the Tariff, whilst the producers of sugar in Queensland have nothing to thank this Parliament for.

                - When we recall the action of these three honorable senators who made themselves notorious in fighting for the highest duty on every product grown in Queensland, and stopping short of extending like protection to the products of other States, they are certainly the last who ought to complain about any remarks which may be made concerning Queensland products. They consistently refused to grant similar treatment to the products and industries of every other State.

                Best and some Protectionists who proclaimed that they were Himalayan Protectionists.

                Quite so. If the honorable senators from other States had acted in that grossly selfish spirit, what sort of a national Tariff should we- have had ? It stands to the credit of the Senate that other honorable senators did not look at items from the stand-point of their respective States, but considered every item from a wider outlook. In that way we arrived at a Tariff which, in addition to giving Queensland its due, gave sufficient protection to every struggling industry in every State in the Commonwealth. I have no cause to complain about the action of the representatives of other States, because they have behaved reasonably towards Queensland, having overlooked the selfish action of three of its representatives, and given to its chief industry the protection to which it is entitled. I voted for the protection which has been accorded to Queensland products, and would do so again, but if I were actuated by the paltry motives of the honorable senators to whom
                <inline font-style="italic">I</inline>
                have referred-
            </para>
            <para>The  PRESIDENT.  - Order. The honorable senator is not in order iri making that statement. He must withdraw it. </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator LYNCH.</inline>
                - I withdraw the word &#34; paltry.&#34; I would not have referred to the matter but that the charge has been reiterated that the representatives of other States, and particularly of South Australia, are averse to extending consideration to Queensland industries. My own observations have led me to believe that the representatives of South Australia are quite capable of looking beyond the geographical boundaries of their own State. In that respect, they are unlike the three honorable senators whom I have mentioned. My desire is to secure to the white race the production of sugar in Australia. But I recognise that there are difficulties ahead. The only way of solving those difficulties, and of doing justice alike to the growers, the consumers, and the workers, is by giving effect to the policy of the cane-growers themselves. They have come to the conclusion - and tightly so - that the only way in which the burden can be lifted from their shoulders is by the Commonwealth establishing a refinery of its own so that it will be in a position to take the raw product from them, and to give them a higher price for their cane - whilst treating its employes better - than does the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. After all, that is only the natural course of development. Experience teaches us that wherever the State has interfered in industrial matters, and by its activity has supplied services which private individuals have been supplying, the gain has always been on the side of the community. In my own State, the establishment nf Government crushing mills on the gold-fields has had the effect of reducing the price of treating ore from 25s. to ros. per ton. In South Australia, too, numerous examples can be found in which Government intervention has proved beneficial. I support the motion for the second reading of the Bill in the hope that when an attempt is subsequently made to regulate the conditions of employment in the sugar industry, it will have the support not only of the cane-growers of Queensland, but of the people of the Commonwealth.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STEWART</inline>
                (Queensland) &#91;8.30&#93;. - T do not intend to say very much in connexion with this measure, nor do I propose to discuss the very vexed question of the division of profits between the refiners, the millers, the growers, and the workers. No doubt the present state of- affairs is very unsatisfactory. The refiners, I think, get very much more than they ought to get. There is no doubt that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is making huge profits, only a comparatively small portion of which is disclosed. It is building up very large reserves, and every two or three years is watering its stock. In short, as I have frequently pointed out in Queensland - it is taking to itself the very cream of the industry. But we have not power to deal with it at the present time. We propose to ask the people to grant us that power by means of a referendum. The present Bill is open to three very strong objections, though perhaps I ought not to seek perfect legislation upon a vexed question of this kind immediately. But I think that the measure might approach a little nearer to perfection than it does. My first objection to it is that it does not propose to give the sugar grower the full protection of &#163;6 per ton, which is ostensibly granted by the Tariff. We all know that the measure of effective protection granted to the industry is only
                <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline>
                per ton. I think that it is entitled to the full
                <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline>
                per ton. Seeing that a duty of  &#163;6  per ton upon sugar is the law of the land, I cannot understand why the present position should be continued. The time has arrived when the industry ought to receive the full amount of the protection granted to it under the Tariff.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STEWART.</inline>
                - We are dealing now with the sugar industry. When we come to discuss the question of tobacco I shall be as ready to express my opinion upon it as I am to express my views upon the sugar industry. I repeat that this Bill does not extend to the industry the full measure of the protection ostensibly granted to it under the Tariff. Another objection to the Bill is that it proposes to continue the protection of &#163;2 per ton to sugar grown by coloured labour. If the people of the Commonwealth realized the situation, I do not think that they would agree to that. Nobody is anxious to protect, an industry which employs coloured labour largely, and which pays extremely low wages. Last year between 13,000 and 14,000 tons of sugar - which probably is equivalent to  140,000  tons of cane - was grown by black labour. When honorable senators reflect that a protection of  &#163;2  per ton upon sugar represents  4s.  per ton, upon cane, they will realize how unfair it is that this protection should be continued. I cannot see any reason in the world for continuing it. Those persons who employ black labour have had years of warning to cease the practice. But evidently a number of them find it profitable to continue it.

                - I am not dealing with that question just now. This Parliament set out with the idea of making the sugar industry a white industry. Yet it is now continuing it as a piebald industry. I venture to say that if the protection of  &#163;2  per ton which is at present accorded to sugar produced by black labour were abolished, the kanaka&#39;s would lie driven out of the industry within the next twelve months, because nobody would find it profitable to employ them.

                ought to be flattered by the attitude which
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline>
                and other honorable senators are taking up to-night. They are converts to the cause. I think that the time has arrived when the protection accorded to sugar produced bv coloured labour ought to be abolished. I cannot see a single reason for continuing it. My third objection to the Bill is that under it the Treasury will obtain  &#163;140,000  per annum from the sugar industry. I do not believe in taxing sugar for revenue purposes. I believe in imposing a duty upon that article for the purpose of encouraging its production in Australia. But I look in other directions to obtain money with which to carry on the government of the country! I recognise that every farthing obtained from this industry makes it less necessary to resort to direct taxation. The remedy for the present position of affairs is to equalize the Excise and the protective duties. If that were done, and the whole amount thus collected were returned to those who produce cane exclusively by white labour, the employment of coloured persons in the industry would be immediately stamped out. That would represent the first gain, and those engaged in it would benefit by getting the full measure of the protection which is accorded to it under the Tariff. I do not know whether the Government is prepared to take a step of this kind, at the present moment, but I think it is extremely desirable that what I have suggested should be done. In that way the grower would get the full benefit of the protection, and .the employment of coloured labour in the industry would be completely stamped out. At the same time, the Treasurer would have to look for  &#163;140,000  in some other direction, which also, I think, would be a very good thing. I have listened with much interest to the excellent speech delivered by
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline>
                but I cannot allow his statement about the cost of cane to pass unchallenged. He has not counted the rebate in his estimate; for it is not a bounty, but a rebate.

                The company has to pay in the first instance  9s.  6d. per ton of cane, and then gets the money back from the public. But, in addition, about  5s.  per ton is obtained from the Government. Where do the Government get that money from? The Government get it from the miller, who has to pay an Excise of &#163;3 per ton.

                That is very low. On an average, throughout Queensland, it would take about  10  tons of cane to make a ton of sugar, but in the north it takes about 8 tons. The cost of milling, according to

                They ought to get 2s. per ton more ; that is to say, they would be entitled to that. There is no doubt that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is in a position of great strength. It has practically a monopoly. To all intents and purposes, it controls the production and distribution of sugar in Australia. There is not the slightest doubt that it extracts the last possible farthing out of the miller . The miller in turn passes it on to the growers, and they pass it on to the workers.

                - Every man who has come in contact with the industry knows that there is a continual struggle between the workers and the growers, between the growers and the millers, between the millers and the refiners, and between the refiners and the public. Next year, I hope the people of Australia will have wisdom enough to give the Commonwealth Parliament power to deal with the refiners, and with the whole industry on a satisfactory  basis. My own belief is - and I have expressed it on many a platform - that under proper conditions we ought to be able to produce sugar and sell it to the public pounds per ton cheaper than is the case at the present moment, and at the same time pay all those engaged in the industry, whether workers, growers, millers, or refiners, better than any of them are paid at present, except the shareholders of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. But to begin with, I think we ought to purge the industry of coloured labour.

                - I am merely pointing out the fact. I am not blaming the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. It is not in business for the good of its health, but to get as much money out of the people of Australia as it possibly can. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company knows that its existence is precarious, and that a  few years may see an end put to its present operations. I have not the slightest doubt that it is taking full advantage of the present opportunities.  1  do not blame it. But I shall blame the people of Australia if, when the opportunity is offered them, they allow a monopoly of this kind to extort money from them any longer. That is my position in regard to the m&#39;atter. I think that the Government might very well make the Excise equal to the duty, and return the whole of it to such growers as employ white labour. They would stamp out coloured labour immediately by so doing. Of course, I do not suppose that the Government will accept any suggestion of the kind, but it is worthy of consideration.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline>
                and others to score off the political parties that practically brought about the salvation of the sugar industry, and that turned it from being a black-labour industry into a white man&#39;s industry. Honorable senators opposite are the lineal descendants of those who brought black labour to Queensland. They stand cheek by jowl at election times with the party that was always associated with black labour in that State. They are the political associates of men who, if they had their way, would never have allowed this legislation to be placed upon the statute-book. I resent, therefore, the statements we have had from them, which would make it appear that they are better friends of the industry, and of the white growers , in it, of all people, than are those who are directly associated with the political parties who were the first to enunciate the White Australia policy, and to apply it in the teeth of strenuous opposition.

                and his associates, I can assure him that those of us who have been fighting for this legislation - who fought for it against the late

                and others in the first Parliament: - are not to be deceived by this kind of. talk. We can see through it. It is merely indulged in with the object of making the people of Queensland believe that honorable senators opposite are prepared to out-herod Herod, now that they see that this policy has come to stay - that they are prepared to go even further than anything that we have proposed.

I can see what the proposal is, and it must be clear to most members of the Senate. We have been asked why we did not propose to raise the Excise duty to the full amount of the import duty and refund the whole of it to the growers of sugar by white labour. In the first place, we could have no guarantee that the grower would ever get the money. We have a pretty good indication that he would not get it, and that the extra &#163;2, instead of going into the pockets of the grower, would go to swell the already too big dividends of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. They are the masters of the situation. The money must filter through their hands before it can reach the grower, and it rests with them to decide how much of the money of the public, as
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline>
                has properly described it, shall go into the growers&#39; pockets and how much shall go into their own.
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline>
                tried to make us believe that by some kind of financial legerdemain those engaged in the industry find the money to pay the bounty.  1  could not quite understand whether he meant to suggest that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are finding the money, or that the industry as a whole is finding it.: But he thought he scored a tremendous point on

                J. Russell when later he admitted with the greatest frankness that the consumer is paying the whole of the duty. If that be so, it is only a question of how the money which, according to
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline>
                is taken from the general public is divided.

                It is true that under the existing arrangement a certain amount of revenue is derived by the Commonwealth, but we cannot shut our eyes to what has happened in the past, and we cannot consider this question without recollecting the history attached to it. What is that history? First of all, a series of measures were proposed with a double object ; one to provide that Australia should produce her own sugar, and the other that it should be produced by white labour. There was a third important object which I have overlooked, and that was to rid Australia of a stain upon her national escutcheon due to the operation of a system of semi-slavery. These were measures providing for an import duty on sugar, an Excise duty on sugar, and a rebate of the Excise in certain conditions, and, further, the Pacific Island Labourers Act intended to secure the deportation of kanakas from Queensland. These four measures were treated as parts of one policy. The idea was to continue the Excise and rebate or bounty during the period in which we were taking from those engaged in the industry the cheap labour of the semi-slave. The Commonwealth agreed to provide some oil for the wound, as it were, in the shape of a rebate&#39; of the Excise where sugar was grown by white labour. This was to encourage growers to employ white labour . in the place of the kanaka. We decided to give- a rebate on sugar grown by white labour, and to impose the full Excise duty as a penalty upon those who continued to employ any form of coloured labour. That policy was continued, and I say now with the greatest pleasure and pride, as one who took part in that legislation, that those measures have been an unqualified success. When &#39; we remember that in the year in which that policy was introduced 80 per cent, of the sugar grown in Queensland was grown by black labour, and that now, nine years later, only 8 per cent, of the sugar grown in Queensland is grown by black labour, that only about 1,000 Polynesians now remain in the Commonwealth, whilst thousands have been returned to their islands, and that the stain has been wiped off our national escutcheon, those who have the audacity to stand up here and say that the Federal Parliament has not dealt with this question all&#39; round in a thoroughly successful manner must be blind or must shut their eyes to the facts. Now that we have reduced the quantity of sugar grown by black labour in the Commonwealth to 8 per cent, of the total, and propose, without any limit as to time, to re-enact legislation which is surely but slowly crushing black labour out of the industry, and must, within two or three years at most, completely abolish it, the proposition is put forward that we should go further, and should impose an Excise duty amounting to the full import duty, and hand back the whole of the Excise in the shape of a bounty.

                thinks that this is not a matter worthy of consideration; but the Government do not view it in that light. We have irrefutable proof that this policy will accomplish what
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline>
                says he desires. It will entirely crush out the black labour still employed in the industry.

                On the other hand, it will not tend to further fatten the already over-bloated monopolistic company now controlling the industry. I say, therefore, that the safe course to adopt is that proposed by the Government. We ought not to run the risk of making a present of more money to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and the legislation now proposed will certainly abolish the employment of black labour in the industry.

            <para class="block">Nothing could make more clear the necessity for proper nomenclature in describing this legislation than the remarks which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has just made. Honorable senators will remember that, in the first instance, a proposal was made to levy an Excise duty on sugar, and to allow a rebate of that Excise in certain circumstances. Measures were passed with that object in view, and later, when, though the matter was not decided by the High Court, it was thought that these measures were unconstitutional in view of the fact that the Constitution provided for a return to the States of three-fourths of the revenue from Customs and Excise, a measure was passed in the following session substituting a Sugar Bounty Act for the Sugar Rebate Act. I think we are all agreed that the Excise is levied upon the industry. That is to say, the renner, who charges the public &#163;22 per ton for sugar, has to hand over &#163;4 of that price to the Treasury. The result is that the refiner pays less to the miller, and the miller less to the farmer. The farmer gets a rebate of &#163;3 per ton from the &#163;4 per ton Excise duty in the form of a bounty paid on cane grown by white labour. The matter should be put in a way which would be clearly understood. This legislation does not resemble the legislation we passed here, in 1907, for the payment of bounties upon certain products. In that case, a direct levy was made upon the Treasury to defray certain bounties upon the production of cotton, coffee, rubber, and other articles. Honorable senators will remember, also, that in the case of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act, a rebate of Excise was provided for the purpose of regulating labour conditions in that industry. The Excise duty levied under that Act was declared to be unconstitutional, but did Parliament alter the duties on harvesters? We know that it did not. Parliament passed an Act to levy an Excise duty of so much per harvester, and those who carried out the necessary labour conditions were not to be called upon to pay any Excise at all. In the case of the sugar industry, however, they take up quite a different attitude. The object in that industry is exactly the same as in other industries, namely, to regulate labour conditions. They say, &#34; We will levy, an Excise duty of &#163;4 a ton on the sugar, but if you carry out proper labour conditions we will give you a rebate of &#163;3.&#34; Speaking not very long ago, the Minister of Trade and Customs, who is really the Minister in charge of this Bill in Parliament said - </para>
            <para>The term &#34; bounty &#34; is a misnomer. It  is  not a bounty in the sense in which we ordinarily understand the word. The position is that before any sugar-grower in Australia can receive a bounty he must have paid <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> per ton Excise.  As  I said in  1905,  if any of us had to give <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> away and receive only <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> back, he would not consider that he was receiving a bounty of  ^&#39;3.  but would rather think that he was losing <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> over the transaction. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick here interjected : &#34; It is a rebate under the name of a bounty,&#34; to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> replied, &#34; That is  so. The growers are getting back  &#163;3  out of the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> which they pay in, provided that they comply with certain stipulations as to the employment of white labour and as to labour conditions.&#34; </para>
            <para>I do not propose at the present stage, unless I am drawn into it later, to argue as to whether the Excise should be equal to the bounty, or anything of that sort. What I am arguing is that the word &#34; bounty &#34; is a misnomer, and that there is no reason why we should not use the word &#34; rebate,&#34; and so properly interpret the intention which was expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> just now, when he referred to the rebate. Besides the reference by the Minister of Trade and Customs, the Prime Minister, as far back as February, 1902, expressed the opinion that if we levied an Excise of &#163;4 a ton and gave a rebate of only &#163;3 a ton, the growers should get the greater portion of the &#34;rebate.&#34; I do not intend to quote the passage in which he used that word, because I wish to do so later, if necessary. My amendment, if adopted, will not interfere in any way with the wording of the measure. It will not make any difference in that regard, but it will give a large amount of satisfaction to those who are engaged  in  the industry, and who feel that so long as the Government deliberately levy a tax on the industry in order to pay a certain amount back, to call what they give back a bounty, is not a true description of the financial operation. </para>

                (Western Australia - Minister of Defence) &#91;9. 15&#93;. - Perhaps
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline>
                could not have mentioned a worse case to assist his argument than the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act of 1906. If ever a warning was given to us not to associate labour conditions with Excise it was given when the High Court ruled that Act unconstitutional, so far as it related to labour conditions. The effect of this amendment would be that whilst the Excise would be leviable, all the labour conditions would be rendered null and void.. I do not know whether
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline>
                wants to effect that, but I warn those who may be thinking of supporting the amendment that that would be the effect of it. It is not merely a question of terms, but a question of changing a measure which, in the eyes of the law, relates to the payment of bounty. Honorable senators may argue if they like, as the Minister of Trade and Customs argued, that, in effect, the bounty is the same as a rebate. In law, it is a measure relating to the payment of money, and not to the withholding of the payment of Excise duty. That seems to me to be an overpowering reason why the amendment should be rejected by all those who want to see fair labour conditions associated with this payment, or, if
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline>
                likes to so call it, with this rebate. Furthermore, he was most unhappy in his facts regarding the Act which he did mention, because, as a matter of fact, the import duty on agricultural harvesters is &#163;12, and not

                No; but the honorable senator was arguing that we ought to have treated the sugar industry in precisely the same way as we treated the agricultural harvester industry, and trying to make out that we were far more generous to the latter than to the former, though, as a matter of fact, we were not, because we  gave the manufacturers of harvester machinery no bounty, and the Excise amounted to one half of the import duty. In this case, however, we . propose to give back the bulk of the Excise in bounty. If we accepted the amendment, we should be going back upon an alteration which was made practically with the consent of every friend to this particular legislation. In the. first place, it was a rebate of Excise; but, on advice,
                <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline>
                Turner came to the conclusion that that was unconstitutional. Until the expiration of the Braddon section on the 31st December next, the constitutional position will remain. Since that decision was arrived at, we have had an additional reason supplied to us as to why we should not associate labour conditions with Excise and that is the judgment of the High Court. For the reasons I have given, I trust that the Committee will not accept the amendment.

                LEDGER (Queensland) &#91;9.21&#93;. - I only rise to point out the effect of the Minister&#39;s argument. What he says is that, so long as the word &#34; bounty &#34; stands in the clause it is constitutional ; but if the word &#34; rebate &#34; is substituted, it will be unconstitutional. He is advised that that is the effect of the judgment of the High Court in the Harvester case. But what it decided was that the Parliament cannot do indirectly that which it has no power to do directly. I would not insult the intelligence of any Court by contending that if I altered an Act by the mere preservation of a form of words, I should make it constitutional or unconstitutional.

That is,  1  think, a flimsy argument to put forward. The honorable senator dealt with my suggestion that the whole of the Excise should be returned. I shall not quarrel with him about the words which are used, if he will agree to return the money paid in Excise. I do not care what the payment is called, so long as the money is . returned.

                - Any one outside would laugh at that statement, because the price of cane rises with the price of sugar. I do not suppose that the cane-grower would get every penny of the 2s. per ton, but he would receive the greatest portion of it, and would be able to pay better wages and give better accommodation. Will the Minister say whether he is willing to return the money paid in Excise to the white growers, and retain the full
                <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline>
                a ton on black-grown sugar? The Vice-President of the Executive Council must recognise that his statement is not logical, and cannot be borne out by facts. I do not object to  a  tax of
                <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline>
                per ton being levied upon sugar produced by black labour, but I desire that  the white grower should get the full benefit of his labour. I do not desire the Government to benefit to the extent of 2s. per ton upon cane thus produced.

He had proposed to omit a word from the clause. I was waiting to hear his reasons for the amendment. As the point of order has been raised,. I may intimate that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> would not be in order in discussing in Committee what he had intimated that he wished to discuss. He had given notice of an amendment which, as he stated, would not be in order. If he desired to give reasons why that amendment should be made, he would be doing in an indirect way what it would not be in order for him to do directly. </para>

                (Queensland) &#91;9.51&#93;. - I desire to point out that the cost of administration of the Sugar Bounty Act, averaging a number of years, comes to &#163;6,300 a. year. During quite a number of years - probably as a result of the Braddon section of the Constitution - a sum of, roughly speaking, &#163;2,000,000 has gone into the Commonwealth or State Treasuries. That is to say, that sum has been taken out of the pockets of those concerned in the sugar industry, and has not been repaid to them. In. other words, a much larger sum has been taken out of their pockets than they have received.

                No matter whether we are concerned with a box of matches or a
                <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline>
                the cost ultimately comes out of the pockets of the consumer. But if you levy an Excise inside of a protective duty, both the Excise and the Customs duty do not come out of the pockets of the consumer. The main point, however, is this. Is it the intention of the Government to perpetuate the old system under this proposal, which provides that certain rates shall be repealed? In connexion with those rates, under the Act of 1905, it was provided that certain sums of money should be paid back to the producers of white-grown sugar-cane. An estimate prepared by the Government, and tabled during this session, showed that during the current season the Commonwealth will collect &#163;802,756 in Excise on sugar; and if every ton of cane grown in Australia is produced by white labour, the total amount of Excise to be paid back by the Commonwealth will be &#163;602,067. Consequently the Commonwealth Government will make a profit of &#163;200,000. We know, as a matter of fact, that 7 or 8 per cent, of the sugar produced in Australia is grown with the aid of coloured labour, and the Government will pocket the whole of the &#163;4 per ton Excise paid on that sugar. In urging that the Government should take into consideration the advisability of amending the provision with respect to the rates, I point out that on the 6th February, 1902, when the original Sugar&#39; Rebates Bill was before this Parliament,
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline>
                the present Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, said, speaking of the cane- growers -
            </para>
            <para>Since 31st January last they are entitled to a rebate of 4s. per ton on 10 per cent, sugar-cane  - approximately <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> per ton on their sugar. But the Excise duty is &#163;3 per ton, and what I desire to know is whether the Government cannot see their way clear to give the whole of that Excise as rebate upon sugar grown by white labour. </para>
            <para class="block">A little further on he said - </para>
            <para>I suggest that instead of 1st July the date should be 1st June, and that 6s. should be substituted for 4s. </para>

                I shall not try your patience any further, sir. I say that the facts I have put forward suggest excellent reasons why the Government should take into consideration the advisability of reviewing this provision and altering it in such a way as would increase the rebate or bounty paid to the growers, allowing for a sufficient revenue to cover the cost of administration. The Minister, in the course of some rather heated remarks, explained that the danger was thai if we increased the amount to be &#34;paid by way of bounty the money would get into the coffers of some gigantic corporation. The honorable senator forgets that if that is a good objection to the proposal it applies with equal force to the Bill as it stands.

                Then I shall put it forward as a supposititious argument of my own. If I were to contend that to increase the bounty would be to put money into the coffers of a big corporation, I should be guilty of declaring that the bounty payable under this Bill would also go into the pockets of that corporation.
