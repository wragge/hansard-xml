                        <para>- It has already been pointed out that such questions as have been asked by the honorable senator on this occasion ought to be made the subject-matter of returns, because they involve a good deal of trouble, and also affect members of each House of the Parliament. I feel certain that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> would be the last to strike from behind, and is always prepared to come out in the open. If a return were moved for, the motion could be discussed, and such statements or reasons might be given as would explain it. If the honorable senator will move for a return the Government will do all they possibly can to furnish him with the desired information. </para>

                    <para>. - The amendment is one which I think honorable senators will readily agree to. It provides a guarantee that when the Government think it well to exercise their powers under this Bill, the obligation is laid on the Minister, to notify to each House, within seven days from the issue thereof, if Parliament is in session, and, if not, within seven days after the reassembling of Parliament, the issue of any proclamation under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of proposed new section 112. I, personally, heartily support the amendment, but I take advantage of this opportunity to direct the attention of Ministers to the desirability of devising some means by which honorable senators may have put before them promptly any amendments which they are asked to consider. The Government have at their disposal all the machinery of a big printing office, and it is surely possible for them to have circulated to honorable senators copies of these messages from another place before they are asked to agree to what is proposed. I cannot believe that honorable senators are prepared to take these things for granted - to buy a pig in a poke - without knowing what it is they are being asked to do. In this case, the amendment proposed is a very simple one, but a similar difficulty might arise in connexion with a very complicated amendment, and I again appeal to Ministers to take such steps as may be necessary to put honorable senators in possession of a statement of any proposal they are asked to accept. </para>

If the amendment now submitted were of a vital character, we should not have insisted upon going on with it as we have done. The amendment is so simple that, in view of the fact that it is so desirable that we should get on with business, we thought it as well to consider the House of Representatives' message forthwith. In future, every effort will be made to place honorable senators in possession of the information they desire in connexion with any business brought before the Senate. </para>

                    <para>That this Bill be now read a second time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator ST.</inline> LEDGER (Queensland)  [3.19].  - This Amending Customs Tariff Bill is merely a display of fiscal fireworks. It contains nothing but blank cartridge. If there were any doubt on this point, the speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 0'</inline> Keefe must have dispelled that doubt. The honorable senator gave certain reasons why the Government have not, consistently with their platform promises, brought forward a comprehensive measure for the rectification of the alleged anomalies in the existing Tariff. There is not a member of this Parliament who does not perfectly well understand the position of the Government in the matter. Nor is there a single Protectionist in Australia who does not understand it. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> ought not to be complimented for his audacity and candour in respect of this matter. But certainly both his audacity and his candour have been indorsed by the <inline font-style="italic">Vice-.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">President</inline> of the Executive Council. The former declared that the reason 'why the Government had not undertaken a comprehensive revision of the Tariff was that the people of Australia were not going to be " fooled " again. He affirmed that any such revision of the Tariff was to be contingent on the electors, at the forthcoming referendum, empowering the Commonwealth to control industrial conditions throughout Australia. But I intend to deal with the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> that "'we had been fooled." </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator could not have meant that, because he used the term " we." Evidently he was speaking for the members of his own party._ He declared that the Government were justified in refusing to enter upon a complete revision of the Tariff until they had ascertained their constitutional position. The expression " fooled " as used by him had no reference to the conduct of the previous Government or of the ex-Prime Minister. Who was " fooled " in this matter ? Nobody. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> urged that the High Court had determined that the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act was unconstitutional. That is the " fooling " to which be referred, and I object to allowing his expression to pass unnoticed. </para>

                            <para>- At the time the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act was under consideration in this Parliament, many members of the Opposition pointed out that in all probability it would be declared unconstitutional. Their speeches - as will be seen by reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> - reveal that. Everybody was aware of the risk which was being incurred. In order to emphasize the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe,</inline> when he spoke of " fooling," was referring to the action of the High Court, I need only point out that during his speech he inquired " Who was -it assailed the constitutionality of that Act?" To his own question he replied that it was the Chambers of Manufactures and the Federated Employers Association. Does he suggest for a moment that there was anything wrong in either the manufacturers or the Employers Association testing the constitutionality of that Statute? </para>

Let me illustrate how hard driven are the Government when they urge an objection of that sort. Suppose that a landlord who has more land than he can till agrees to let a portion of it to a tenant, and that a dispute arises between them as to the terms of that agreement. Is there anything wrong in either party asking the Court to determine the exact position ? Such an argument will not hold water for a moment. </para>

                            <para>- The whole tenor of the honorable senator's argument was in the direction which I have indicated. For him to endeavour to place the fault upon the ex-Prime Minister is an afterthought. This Bill is intended to correct and to legalize the decisions, and it may. be the indecision, of the Customs Department - no more and no less. It is not designed to develop any fiscal policy - either Free Trade or Protection - but is intended to assist the Customs officials to interpret and administer our Customs Tariff Act. In other words, it is purely a departmental measure. When we come to consider it in Committee, we shall find that its enactment will only make confusion worse confounded. But I do not intend to pursue this aspect of the question, although a great deal might be made of the disappointment which Protectionists must experience when, they look at the provisions of the measure. There are no less than a dozen rectifications in this Bill, which, instead of being in the interests of the industries that are springing up in various parts of the country, are absolutely prejudicial to them. The Bill has been built up, not with an honest and intelligent desire to rectify anomalies and assist industries, but is from top to bottom a Bill made by officers of the Department of Trade and Customs, and put into the Minister's hands to submit to this Parliament. The Minister has become a second " rubber stamp" in this Government. Protectionists and Free Traders alike will rage at some of these amendments. What probably happened was this : The Minister said to his officers, "For a long time you have had some difficulty in administering the Tariff. For goodness sake frame a Bill to facilitate the working of it, and to legalize your decisions and your indecisions. Bring the Bill to me.  1  will put the rubber stamp upon it, and submit it to Parliament." I sympathize with the disappointment experienced by Protectionists in both Chambers of the Legislature, and throughout the country. </para>

                        <para>. - I suppose that no Tariff that could possibly be passed could be expected to be perfect. Certainly the last Tariff passed by this Parliament has revealed many anomalies. That is as might have been expected. No doubt it is the duty of Parliament to rectify anomalies as they become apparent. One of the prominent planks in the policy of the late Government was a promise to rectify anomalies from a Protectionist stand-point. But in that Government there was the shadow of Free Trade. A scare on Free Trade grounds was raised in the country ; and some of those who at one time were prepared to support the late Government, including many manufacturers, and even the Chamber of Manufactures, were scared because of the fear of Free Trade influence in the Cabinet </para>

Some manufacturers, who first of all assisted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> into office - one man in particular has been referred to in the Senate as having a good deal of influence in that respect - afterwards assisted to turn him out, for the reason, as I have said, that they were scared. Manufacturers and workers alike were persuaded that they would secure a rectification of Tariff anomalies from the Labour party, not from the Fusion Government. That was the cry that went out. all over the country during the late elections. </para>

                            <para>- This Bill is said to be for the purpose of the rectification of anomalies. But. as a matter of fact, it creates more anomalies than it rectifies. It: is simply a pistol held at the heads of the manufacturers and the industrial workers of Australia. The Government say to them, in effect, " Carry these referenda or there shall be no Tariff alterations ; give us power to control all industries, or there shall be no Tariff reform. Anomalies may remain and industries may languish, but you will get no relief from these evils until you carry the referenda." That is the meaning of this Bill. In fact, the Minister who introduced it in another place said distinctly and frankly - and I always admire a man when he speaks straight out - that the Tariff is not going to be touched until the referenda are carried. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. Here, then, is a pistol held at the heads of the manufacturers and industrial workers. No fewer than four questions are submitted to the electors at the one referenda. The Bill before us will do no more than help the departmental officers to administer the existing Tariff. But, at the same time, it will inflict a very heavy blow on certain industries. It will gravely injure the box-making industry throughout the Commonwealth. I speak about this matter because, while I am not in any way interested in the box-making trade, I happen to know something about it, and if one has knowledge with regard to a subject I think he ought to make his fellow-senators acquainted with it. I believe in protecting industries. If there is an industry that has been established, or can be established, I am prepared to give to it a full amount of protection, but I do not believe in giving protection to one industry at the expense of another. </para>

                            <para>- That is what is being done by means of this measure. Take the matter of boards referred to in item 356. I admit that there has been some little difficulty, but it is one which might very easily be overcome. The opinion is prevalent, I think in every State except Victoria, that the Australian Paper Mill has the Trade and Customs Department by the wool. I am told that it has made a boast to that effect, and that it obtains practically whatever decisions it wants in regard to these matters. That ought not to be possible; there ought to be some better method of deciding the questions. If the mill makes strawboard, brown .paper, and paperboard, give it all the protection it wants in regard to those articles, but why kill other industries in that attempt? That is what is being done in this Bill. The Australian Paper Mill does not produce pasteboard, cardboard,  manillaboard, woodboard, leatherboard, or greyboard for box-making. I am quite willing to admit that there may have been a little confusion in regard to the classification of grey- board, because years ago, before the box-making industry came into existence, the' greyboard of commerce was practically a second-class millboard, and, therefore, some regulation might have been needed to define the matter, but there need not have been any difficulty in that regard, so far as I can see. </para>

                            <para>-  Yes, it does.  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator VARDON.-</inline> Tt is not difficult to find out what a board is. Here, for instance, is a sample of pulpboard. Everybody knows what it is. It is used for many purposes. It is used very largely by picture- framers as well as by boxmakers. There is no difficulty about that board. Here, again, is one class of greyboard. The refuse of box-making materials is ground into a pulp, and made into a board of this character, being a good deal stiffer and tougher than an ordinary pulpboard. It could be easily ascertained what it is. </para>

                            <para>- It is simply called leatherboard because of its colour and toughness. It is not the leatherboard which is used in the shoemaking trade, but it is a board which is known well to all boxmakers, and might easily be known to the trade itself. Here is a sample of greyboard, which the Minister can see if he wishes. It is made out of newspapers, which are pulped up. It gets its grey colour simply from the ink which was used on the paper. There would be no difficulty in identifying a board of that character. Yet all the manufacturers are called upon, improperly I think, to pay duty on these boards. </para>

                            <para>- Here is a sample of a board said to be made by the Australian Paper Mill. It is called a paper- board, and would probably be called by some persons a pulpboard. It can be seen that it is different from other boards. Simply because a mill in Victoria makes this board, why should the whole of the trade be subjected to a duty to protect that mill ? The raw material of the men who make boxes is subjected to a duty simply to protect an article like that. It is not right that that should be done. </para>

                            <para>- There is already a duty of is. <inline font-style="italic">66.</inline> per cwt. on this strawboard, and the mill has all the work it can possibly do, and more, I think. I am not complaining about the duty on strawboard. It is proposed to raise the duty on the manufactured article by about 10 per cent., but the manufacturer has to pay a duty of 5s. per cwt. on the whole of his raw material, including all the waste, so that the duty is probably 115 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> Here is a sample of another article. If this is imported with printing on it, it lias to pay a duty of 6d. per lb. If, instead of bearing print, it comes in without anything on it, and a wrapper can be put round it here, it is subject to a duty of 35 or 40 per cent. But the raw material is taxed up to <inline font-style="italic">Â£5</inline> per ton, which is equal to nearly 120 per cent. Is there any sense in that? Why should we penalize manufacturers in this way? It is said that the Government have raised the duty on the manufactured article. While the duty on that article has gone up 10 per cent., the duty on the raw material has gone up over 100 per cent. Here is another sample which is dealt with in exactly the same way. It seems to me to be the height of folly to pretend that we help our own manufacturers when we raise the duty on the manufactured article 10 per cent., and tax their raw material 100 per cent., or more. </para>

Yet we are told that this is a Bill to rectify anomalies, or better our definitions. It will not do anything of the sort. I want to know what justification there is for dragging in all the boards which are the raw material of our own manufacturers, and which are not made here. These are not and will not be made here, and why impose this duty when its only possible effect will be to raise the price of the article to the consumer? With regard to cover papers, I believe that the mill here makes one line of cover paper. I have been in business a good many years, but I have never had one of their travellers call' upon me and show me any article they make. There is in the Tariff no definition of a cover paper, but because the local mill makes one particular line every other kind of cover paper is to bear a duty. There are what might be called cover papers on the weekly papers issued in Australia such as the <inline font-style="italic">Australasian.</inline> They are really coloured printing papers, but they are used as cover papers, and might be charged duty under this proposal as cover papers. I am told that the mill here makes carpet felt paper, but that if you "want it you must go to the mill and take it away on a lorry yourself. Apparently those who are running the mill are not particular whether it is asked for or not.

I should like to ask how much coating is done here, and to know whether the machine that is here was imported for coating boards at all, or whether it was brought out for coating paper and was found to be a failure.

                            <para>- I believe that is the idea. There would be in 12 x 48 inches 576 inches, and in 20 x 30 inches, the ordinary size of double crown, there would be 600 inches. That, I suppose, would come in free, because it would be the equivalent of the size in the proposed subparagraph 1, but all of a smaller size is to be dutiable at 15 or 10 per cent. The item of tags has to be considered in this connexion, and under the item 3561 the duty on tags will be raised 10 per cent. There is a duty of <inline font-style="italic">Â£5</inline> per ton on the paper from which tags are made. Tag paper is manilla paper, and if it does not come up to 80 lbs. to the reel of 20 x 25 inches, it has to pay a duty of <inline font-style="italic">Â£,s</inline> per ton. The man who imports tags will have to pay an increased duty of 10 per cent., while the raw material is to be taxed at about no per cent. I ask the Minister to say whether he thinks there is any reason for a proposal of this kind. I certainly can see none. I do not know how it can be contended that it will help us from a Protectionist point of view. It may assist one or two firms to secure a kind of monopoly, but it will not help the general community. There is an item 258 in the Tariff, " Bottle stoppers, n.e.i. ; also glass bottle stoppers, free." We all thought we knew what a bottle stopper was, but, as honorable senators can see from the stopper which I produce, which is used in bottling up milk, it is an article that could be manufactured here by the million, and in the simplest possible way, and yet, because it is called a " bottle stopper," it is admitted duty free. That is one of the anomalies which, I suppose, the Government do not intend to rectify. Item  364A  is " Pens, n.e.i., without holders, or not including holders, <inline font-style="italic">ad vol.,</inline> 5 per cent, and free."

                            <para>- Are we to pass this proposal without a definition of what a fancy box is? Nearly all pens are packed in boxes of this character. The point is that if the pens are imported in what is described as a " fancy box," they are to be dutiable at 30 or 35 per cent., and if they are not in a fancy box they are to be dutiable at 5 per cent, or free. It is necessary, in the circumstances, that the Minister should give us some explanation of what is to be considered a " fancy box." </para>

The same objection applies to item  364B,  which it is proposed to amend in such a way that inkstands, fountain-pens, pencils, n.e.i., and rulers, when imported in fancy boxes, shall be dutiable at 30 and 25 per cent., but if they are not imported in fancy boxes they are to be dutiable at 5 per cent.' or free. We are being asked to legislate in the clark, when we are given no definition of the terms used in the Tariff, and we have no illustration of what a fancy box is. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps, when we get into Committee, the Minister will be able to explain these matters. It seems to me that, instead of remedying anomalies, we are creating more, and that for the sake of one or two firms. We are putting an increased tax on the manufactured article of 10 per cent., while we are taxing the raw material to the extent of from 100 to 120 per cent. How are we to encourage our industries by legislation of this character? I hope the Minister, when we get into Committee, will be prepared to accept some modification of the schedule. There has been a good deal of correspondence of one sort and another with regard to these items. In connexion, for instance, with greyboard, I may say that it was being admitted free, and then suddenly a duty was charged upon it. When an importer threatened to take action, the Department backed down and refunded him his duty, with costs. One firm in South Australia that I know well, and which is in a somewhat large way of business, on seeing that the duty had been removed, in all good faith immediately cabled to London for 500 tons of this greyboard, but the duty was shortly afterwards again imposed, with the result that when the paper reached Australia it was dutiable, and the firm in question had to pay the full duty on their order. I do not think that kind of thing ought to be allowed. This firm took all the trouble they possibly could to assure the Department of their <inline font-style="italic">bona fides.</inline> They sent in samples of their board with an indorsement by the following well-known firms - </para>

I do not know that I need trespass upon the time of the Committee any further. But I do say that, before the Minister inflicts a great hardship upon the boxmakers of the Commonwealth, he should obtain true definitions of pasteboard, cardboard, pulpboard, leatherboard, and Manillaboard. I have here a sample of Manillaboard, which any person would be able to identify. Here is another sample of bendingboard, which contains a grey filling, and is pulped on either side. The Minister ought to experience no difficulty in securing expert information which would enable us to adopt a proper classification of these boards, with a view to imposing a fair duty upon those which are produced here, whilst admitting free others which are the raw material of our manufacturers. We ought not to penalize Australian manufacturers by imposing a duty of 120 per cent, upon their raw material. I hold in my hand another sample of board which is made of very thin 4-ounce strawboard. It consists of several rolls of that paper, and is dutiable at 35 or 40 per cent., whilst the raw material is dutiable at no per cent. I have in my possession another sample of the same material. In its present form it is dutiable at 6d. per pound, but if the label were taken off it, it would be dutiable at no per cent. We ought to see that all our industries are fairly treated. </para></speech>

                        <para>.  - This is a Bill which is intended to rectify anomalies, but it seems to me that its effect will be to create more. I am not in a position to say what is the difference between strawboard, leatherboard, Manillaboard, and other boards. But I have received letters from all parts of Australia protesting against this proposed alteration of- the Tariff. One of the writers states that its adoption will mean an additional expenditure by him of ,Â£400 per annum. It seems to me that we are being asked to legislate purely for the benefit of Victoria. I have visited the place in this State where strawboard is made. I have also examined the samples of other boards which are in the possession of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> and I say that to distinguish by the touch between the boards which are produced at the factory which is established within 30 miles of Melbourne and those boards a Customs officer would not require to be a very intelligent man. </para>

                            <para>- But the proposed duty is only intended to protect the mill which has been established in Victoria. I take it that the people who are engaged in the trade understand as much about this question as does the Honorary Minister, notwithstanding that he is a printer. I repeat that the board made in Victoria is easily distinguishable from leatherboard and other boards. Although I am a Protectionist, I believe in that form of Protection which will benefit the people of Australia, and not merely a section of it. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 0'</inline> Keefe was speaking of the woollen industry on Friday last, I interjected that certain woollen mills did not desire the benefit of higher duties. That statement is perfectly true. When the Tariff was last under consideration Parliament increased the duty upon woollens. Yet to-day I know of one manufacturer who is charging 2d. a yard more for his goods than he did previously. If it can be shown that the difference between the wages paid in Australia and those paid upon the Continent is 15 per cent, or 30 per cent., I am prepared to accord that measure of protection to our Australian manufacturers, in order to place them upon a level with their outside competitors. But I am not willing to increase duties for no purpose whatever. When the Tariff was being considered we were assured that, under Protection, our revenue would decrease, whilst the cost of living would not be increased. But what do we find? Our revenue is increasing by leaps and bounds; and only to-day I read of a meeting of clerks in the fifth class of our Public Service who are demanding increased salaries, upon the ground that the cost of living has been increased by the Tariff. Where is this sort of thing going to end? Are we always to foster the industries of the towns as against those of the country? Time after time we are asked to increase our Customs duties, but the primary producer is never considered. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> we are now invited to increase a duty from 10 per cent, up to 100 per cent. If we continue to act in that way, manifestly the workers will not be able to live, unless they are granted an increase in their wages. The more wages are increased, the higher does the cost of living become. In every vote which I recorded upon the Tariff, I adopted the principle of extending a reasonable measure of protection to our manufacturers, for the purpose of enabling them to pay fair wages to their employes. At that time I knew manufacturers who did not desire the imposition of higher duties, because they recognised that such duties meant an increase in the price of their manufactures. When an article which for years has been retailed at is. id. per yard is increased in price to is. 3d. per yard, the consumers feel the disability under which they are placed very acutely, ls that the object of a Tariff? Certainly not. Yet that has been the effect of our Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- When the duties were raised from 25 to 40 per cent., the natural result was to increase the cost of articles manufactured in the country, because the competition from outside was decreased. Take the case of woollens manufactured in Tasmania. The manufacturers were perfectly satisfied with the fair and reasonable duty which they formerly had. But Parliament altered the Tariff. Let any honorable senator ask a business man what he pays for his pink -or grey flannel now as compared with what he previously paid. The reply will be that he pays 2d. per yard more. </para>

                            <para>- I also have done business with him on behalf of people on the mainland, but I do not on that account put myself up as an authority. If the duty had not been increased, does any one suppose that the price of Tasmanian flannel would have been raised 2d. per yard? Of course, when the retailer has to pay more for his goods, he raises the price to the consumer to an extent greater than the extra amount which he has to pay. The greater the price he has to pay for his goods the more profit he requires. The consequence is that retailers are selling now at is. pd. a yard flannel which they previously sold at is. 6d. So that the consumer is handicapped in every instance. Is that what our Tariff was intended for? Why is it that every association, every union, that is concerned with wages, is agitating for an increase? I noticed the other day that the men engaged in the railway yards in Melbourne were asking for increased wages on account of the increased cost of living. The Judge of the Arbitration Court, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, has applied the same rule. It has been applied in the . mercantile marine. In all directions it is being stated that the cost of living has gone up. What is the reason for that? </para>

                            <para>- It seems strange to me that some honorable senators should assume to know more about these matters than do people engaged in the trade. Numbers of people have informed me that these increased duties on strawboard will make it very difficult for them to conduct their business. One man tells me in a letter that the alteration of the duty will make to him1 a difference of ^400 per annum in reference to the cost of manufacturing boxes for tailors and milliners. Why should we impose this extra duty, except the Government require it for revenue purposes? It cannot be a protective duty, because the goods are not made in Australia. It is true that there is a mill for making strawboard in Victoria, but it does not make the class of board required for the manufacture of tailors' and milliners' boxes. Yet we are asked to increase the duty on these goods by no per cent. Is that Protection? I say again that this is a revenue duty pure and simple. We were promised a Bill for the rectification of Tariff anomalies, but the only rectification proposed by the Government is that contained in this Bill. There are hundreds of other articles enumerated in the Tariff as to which rectifications are required. We were told that as soon as the Labour party secured command of the Treasury benches these rectifications would be made. </para>

                            <para>- What is the reason for using this kind of language? The reason is to try to frighten people into voting for the Government's proposals at the referenda. That is the only conclusion' to which I can come. I was speaking the other day to a Melbourne manufacturer, and he said to me, " We really do not know where we are. We believe that if the referenda are carried against the Government, duties are going to be reduced. If they are carried in favour of the Government, we do not know how we shall stand." I do not think that an attitude of that kind is worthy of any Government. Ministers are not justified in holding a threat over the electors, and saying to them, " Unless you comply with our wishes now, we will punish you somehow ; if we cannot do it directly, we will do it indirectly." Surely we are not here to legislate for the benefit of one class. In my own State, for one manufacturer there are hundreds of consumers. Are we here to legislate for the one manufacturer regardless of the interests of the consumers? I am prepared to give manufacturers a fair and legitimate amount of protection. If the Government can show me that goods that are made in Australia have to compete with goods manufactured in Europe, or in America, where wages are 25 per cent, lower than they are here, I am prepared to vote for a duty of 25 per cent. But I am not prepared to give any manufacturer a duty of 40 per cent. These men are only human, and the higher the duties that we give them the more they will make out of the public. They will use the Customs Tariff to fleece the consumer. Already the general public are crying out about the cost of living. Deputations have waited upon Ministers, and unions of employes are applying to the Arbitration Court for increased wages. In all cases, the cause given is the increased cost of living through increased duties under the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>.- I have listened to the speeches of mv Honorable friends, especially that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon.</inline> I have received letters from some large manufacturers regarding the duty on strawboards. I confess that I am not conversant with the business at all. But I think that the writers of these letters have made out a very good case. I would urge the Government not to adhere to a course which will be hurtful to these manufacturers who look upon the Tariff us a legitimate aid in the prosecution of their enterprise and the making of a living. I am more than ever convinced that the Parliament ought not to deal with Tariff details, because it is not composed of experts. It would be far better to allow all these questions to be threshed out by a Board, such as the late Government proposed to create. That is, I think, the only satisfactory way to deal with Tariff minutiae. It is a great pity that the present Government did not submit a proposal of that kind before they introduced this measure. I hope that when the duty on strawboard is reached the Government will see their way to do justice to persons who use that article in a large 'way. I trust that our appeal will not be made in vain. </para>

                        <para>.- I did not intend to speak to the motion, but ;is certain statements made by a senator on the other side, particularly in connexion with the Labour party, call for rebuttal. I am aware that the senator considers himself an authority on most matters, and looks upon those who dare to disagree with him as either impertinent or as not knowing what they are talking about. That is an attitude which ought not to be exhibited in our debates. A senator who tries to make noise serve the purpose of argument does not throw any light on the subject under consideration. Roaring like the bull of Bash'an is not argument. I trust that on another occasion, when an interjection is made to help the honorable senator to elucidate his argument, he will not regard the interjector as trying to trip him', and accuse him of being impertinent, etcetera. </para>

                    <para>I do not make a claim of infallibility. I prefer to be a little more modest than some honorable senators. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> has referred to a woollen mill in Tasmania, and argued that the cause of its increased prices is the protection which it gets. That is not so. The fact is that the woollen mills in Tasmania are turning out an article of exceptionally good quality. They have to compete with the mills in the Commonwealth, but they have the advantage of exceptionally good water, and their machinery will not adulterate - it will not weave cotton into wool - and, therefore, the pro ducts are excellent. I am sorry to admit that certain employers have turned out good products and made very satisfactory profits assisted by the devious method of underpaying their employes. One of the reasons which have enabled them to compete with other mills has been the regrettably low rates which they have been paying to their employes. I hold in my hand a copy of the report of the Royal Commission on wages and wage-earners in Tasmania, which every honorable senator should consult if he wishes to know the conditions obtaining in that State. It was compiled by gentlemen who went very exhaustively into the whole subject. Regarding the woollen mills, they commented on the evidence in these terms - </para>

                        <para>The two establishments engaged in the woollen industry at Hobart were investigated, and it was there ascertained that the female piece-workers at one factory earn from 14s. to 30s. per week, while girls on day-work are paid, from 7s. to 15s. weekly; male workers receive from 15s. gd. to <inline font-style="italic">Â£2</inline> 10s. per week. At this factory the usual number of hours worked is fifty-two per week, but as part of the mill is worked with two shifts it necessitates some hands being employed six nights a week, a total of sixty-five hours. </para>

The extra price is obtained by reason of the good article which they produce, assisted by the lower cost of production.

                            <para>- The Tariff has certainly assisted the woollen mills in Tasmania. In this case it has not forced up the price of the article and increased the cost of living, as has been asserted so often by honorable senators on the other side. We in Tasmania hope that we shall get the new Protection before we increase the duties. I have heard a good deal about letters being received from various States urging an increase in duties. </para>

                            <para>- I have received only three letters from persons in Tasmania asking for the imposition of higher duties at present. During my visits to the State,  I have heard of dozens of industries which have admitted that increased protection is required. But at present some of the manufacturers do not ask for an increase of protection, because they recognise that when the people have empowered the Parliament to impose the new Protection they will be able to put forward a very fair claim for increased duties. </para>

I am not a thought-reader, and, therefore, do not intend to read the mind of this Parliament six or eight months hence. It will be quite capable, I think, of dealing with the question then.

We do not intend to make a secret of our intention. The Labour party will appeal confidently to the people, and place the issues before them. I feel convinced that we shall obtain the majority which we seek, and shall be empowered to give effective protection to the whole of Australia, and, better still, protection to all the people who are engaged in industries, besides those who own the industries and make the profits. </para>

                        <para>[4-55J- - Some honorable senators have expressed regret that this Bill is not a more comprehensive one. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> said that, in respect of one industry, there exists at present a very grave anomaly. The honorable senator referred to the banana industry. He pointed out that under the present Tariff there is a duty of 2s. per cental on green fruits, and a duty of only is. per cental on bananas. He told us that a banana is a fruit, and we all know that; but I remind him that the Customs officials have no difficulty in distinguishing bananas from green fruit. When Parliament dealt with the Tariff, it understood exactly what duty it was imposing on green fruits and on bananas. There is no anomaly in these duties, and the question raised is one which should be dealt with on a general revision of the Tariff when that is proposed next session. </para>

The duty to be imposed upon bananas is one which should be considered in connexion with a general revision of the Tariff. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has exhibited three samples of cotton goods, and said it would be impossible to distinguish one from the other. Some cotton goods contain silk, or stuff representing silk. </para>

                            <para>- Mercerised cotton, or imitation silk goods. Cotton goods are on the free list, while silk goods are dutiable at 15 or 10 per cent. Although it may have been impossible for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> or the firm that imported the cotton goods he exhibited, to distinguish between those which are dutiable and those which are not, I may inform the Senate that, in all such cases, the departmental officers send samples to the Government Analyst, and he has no difficulty whatever in discovering whether there is mercerised silk, real silk, or imitation silk in the samples. That is the course which is invariably followed when the departmental officials are in any doubt regarding the character of such importations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> referred to the amendments proposed in connexion with the items covering certain paper boards. Under the existing Tariff, Parliament decided to give a fair amount of protection to those engaged in the pulpboard industry. It was considered an industry deserving of encouragement, and Parliament imposed a protective duty of 20 and 15 per cent. It was naturally thought that the effect of the duty would be to encourage the local industry to the fullest extent, and that importations, which seriously affected it, would be reduced. As a matter of fact, it has been found that the industry has received little or no assistance from the Tariff, because almost every kind of board, and in many instances pulpboards, have been introduced as leatherboard, greyboard, Manillaboard, or other kinds of boards, which are dutiable at  5  per cent., or free. </para>

If they had played the game fairly, and acted as men in other spheres of commercial life have acted, under the Tariff, honorable senators can depend upon it the Department would not have proposed to move in the direction in which we are asking the Senate to move now. This proposal is made because serious danger is threatened to an existing industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> has admitted that there is such an industry in Australia. The statement has been made that it is bordering on a monopoly. If it is a monopoly profitable to those engaged in it, that is an admission that there is something in the industry worth protecting from an Australian viewpoint. Â« </para>

Therefore, the statement that this industry is to-day bordering on a monopoly, and is paying substantial dividends, is not an argument against the alteration here proposed. </para>

                            <para>- Unless the alteration proposed is agreed to, this industry will not be sufficiently protected. All that is asked for here is the protection which Parliament intended to grant under the 1908 Tariff. It was granted in order to reduce as much as possible the importation of boards that came into competition with those manufactured by the local industry. A case recently came under the notice of the Department in which strawboards had been dyed to the colour of leatherboards, classified as such, and so brought in under the item dutiable at 5 per cent., or free. The importers went to the extent of dyeing the boards the colour of leatherboard, in order that they might be introduced at the lower duty. </para>

                            <para>- I am giving the information supplied by the departmental officers. In introducing the Bill, I said, as I say now, that I considered that there is nothing of any great importance in the proposed schedule. In a few instances the duties will be slightly, increased, but these increases are imperatively necessary, in order to properly carry out the intentions of Parliament in passing the 1908 Tariff. The amendments proposed are necessary for the convenience of the Department to make it absolutely certain what duties shall be imposed on different goods about which, under the existing Tariff, there is much difference of opinion and doubt as to the item to which they properly belong. They are, also proposed for the convenience of many importers and manufacturers. </para>

                            <para>-  I would direct your attention, sir, to what occurred very early  in  the history of the Senate, when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Baker was  President.  An effort was then made by way of request to increase the duties upon certain items in the Tariff schedule, and, I believe, to include fresh items. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Baker then held that it was quite competent for an honorable senator to do that. What recalls the circumstance so clearly to my mind is that it created this anomaly : that, whilst honorable senators were in a position to act in that way, the members of another place were not at liberty to move for an increased duty upon any item. </para>

                            <para>-  I know that the other Chamber did not agree to it as an act of grace. It may have taken notice of  it.  But the Senate held to the view that it was entitled to make those requests, and that it was for the other branch of the Legislature to say whether or not it would assent to them. The question of whether it is competent for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> to move an amendment to a Bill which is, in itself,  an  amending Bill, was decided by  SiT  Richard Baker when he filled the office of  President.  He affirmed that any amendment was in order which sought to touch only that por-tion of the main Act which the amending Bill sought to amend. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> seeks to insert an amendment in the schedule of this Bill, and it is the schedule of the main Act which it is proposed to amend. Therefore, I contend that his proposal is in order. </para>

                            <para>-  Irrespective of what may be our opinion upon the merits of this proposal, I think that honorable senators upon both sides of the Chamber are %'ery much in earnest in their desire to uphold our rights and privileges. If we cast our minds back to the time when the first Tariff battle was being waged here, we shall recollect that upon that occasion the Senate took up a very decided stand, and emerged triumphantly from a trying ordeal. We differed from another place, and, if my memory serves me accurately, we determined that certain duties should be increased. The other branch of the Legislature would not agree to our requests. They were sent back to us, and we returned them to another place, where they were finally accepted. Having established our position, it would be a mistake to forego any of our rights. I make this statement without any consideration as to the side of the Chamber upon which I sit. I view it purely from the stand-point of the Senate. 1 hope that you, sir, will stand by the decision which was given on that occasion, and which was arrived at after prolonged consideration. In my judgment, the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is perfectly in order. </para>

What the Government are now saying to us is this - that the Customs Tariff pf 1908 shall be amended in certain particulars; but that it shall not be amended in respect to any item which they themselves have not proposed to amend. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> contends that we have a right to request an amendment in any other item, if we please. That, of course, does not involve the assertion that we have a right to compel the House of Representatives to accept our request.

                            <para>-  I do not see that standing order 327 has any bearing upon the present situation. No matter what the Government may say, the whole Tariff has now been thrown upon the table, and I contend that we have full power to deal with it as a whole. The Tariff contains a number of anomalies which we desire to see removed. The  Chairman  rules that our discussion cannot go beyond the lines laid down by the Government. If that ruling be assented to, we are placed in this position - that the Senate, as a whole, is inferior to the members of the Government, and can only deal with such business as the Government submit, with the limitations which they choose to impose. Here we have a Bill laid before the Senate. It proposes to amend a number of items in the existing Tariff. We may desire to see a number of other amendments made. </para>

Under previous decisions of the  President,  which have the force of Standing Orders if they have been accepted by the Senate, it seemed to me that I should not be in order in accepting his proposal. My ruling was obviously not based on the merits or demerits of the case. I was simply carrying out, as far as I could, the procedure of the Senate, as it has been laid down from the Chair, on questions which seemed to me to relate to this issue. On page 6 of <inline font-style="italic">The Decisions of the</inline> President, 1903  to  1908,  you will find a decision which appears to have a very close relation to the question under consideration, and which obviously, has been accepted by the Senate, otherwise it would not appear in this book. </para>

                    <para>The .  Chairman of Committees. -  Undoubtedly. It is not my place to give a new decision. I take it that if I had accepted the request it would have been tantamount to annulling the decision of a previous  President.  It is for you, sir, to say whether I am right in contending that this is similar to the case in which a certain decision was given, and, if so, whether or not that decision shall stand. </para>

                        <para>-  It seems to me that the question before the Senate presents itself in two ways. First, is it competent under the Standing Orders for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> to submit this request; and, second, even if the Standing Orders permit that to be done, would it be constitutional? I submit that the honorable senator was quite in order in submitting his' proposal at the present juncture. Standing order  327,  which deals with instructions to a Committee of the whole, has no bearing on the present point.  Hitherto it has been competent for an honorable senator to submit any amendment to an amending Bill which covered a section of the principal Act which was being amended, but not to propose an amendment of any portion of the principal Act which was not covered by the amending Bill. </para>

                            <para>- Suppose that, instead of being a Bill to amend schedule A, it was one to amend a section of the Customs Tariff Act. Would it be contended that we were not competent to amend any portion of the section, and that the only portion which we could amend was that specifically referred to in the Bill? Previous decisions from the Chair have been that any portion of an existing Act which was brought under review by an amending Bill could be amended in other directions if the Bill permitted. A schedule stands in the same position as a clause of a Bill. On that point, I submit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has not contravened the Standing Orders. But a more serious matter arises, and that is whether the request, if in order from the stand-point of procedure, would exceed the powers conferred on the Senate by the Constitution. I need hardly remind you, sir, or the Senate, that here we are on much more delicate ground. If we make a mistake in regard to the interpretation of our Standing Orders, that affects nobody but the Senate ; but if we make a mistake in the exercise of our constitutional powers, the other House might, and I think ought to, call us to account. The case quoted by the  Chairman  of Committees is not quite on all-fours with the present case. Then, the proposal was to introduce a new item into the schedule to an Excise Tariff Bill, but now the introduction of no new item is proposed, because, the whole of schedule A to the Customs Tariff Act is under review. On the contrary, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is seeking to amend an item in the original Tariff, which I submit is brought under review by the Bill. On the occasion referred to by the  Chairman,  the Senate was dealing with the whole Tariff. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> moved to insert as a new item, " Confectionery containing glucose, paraffine wax, or plaster of Paris, per lb., 2d." The  Chairman  ruled that the request was not in order; his ruling was dissented from, and referred to the  President,  who, on page 507 of the <inline font-style="italic">Journals,</inline> gave this decision - </para>

                        <para>The Senate could not ignore the provisions of the Constitution, which limited the powers of this House to requesting amendments to, or the omission of, items already in the Bill. The proposal to which exception had been taken was not an amendment of any item in the Bill, but rather a request for the insertion of a new item. He, therefore, upheld the ruling of the  Chairman. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">It is clear from that decision that had a new item been proposed, it would have been beyond the power of the Senate - in other words, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> proposal would not have been in order. The whole question hinges on the point whether or not the whole of the Tariff is brought under review by this amending Bill. If it is not, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is clearly out of order according to previous decisions, because what he proposes would become a new item. But if the existing schedule be brought under review by a Bill which proposes to amend it, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> proposal becomes an amendment of an item already there. That being the case, the decision I have just read, which affirms the right of the Senate to move amendments upon any item already in the Tariff, whilst limiting the right of the Senate as to the introduction of new items, having been followed in the past, ought to be followed now. </para>

The Bill states clearly what it is. It is " A Bill for an Act "- </para>

I maintain that we have no power to alter the Bill in the way proposed, or to make it, as some honorable senators would like to do if they had the opportunity, an all-embracing, comprehensive Tariff Bill. If &gt;ve have the power to add one new item to the schedule of this Bill, we must have the absolute power to consider the existing Tariff <inline font-style="italic">de novo,</inline> and deal with it from A to Z. Such a power was never contemplated in connexion with an amending Bill, and especially in respect of the Tariff. </para>

On the same line of argument it might be contended that the Senate has the right to move any amendments in connexion with any Act which' a Bill is introduced to amend, although not covered by the amending Bill itself. That has been always ruled to be not in order. We have made special provision in our Standing Orders in reference to cases of that description. We provide that an honorable senator may, after the second reading of a Bill, move that it be an instruction to the Committee to consider certain amendments. </para>

                            <para>-But if honorable senators could move amendments upon every item contained in the original schedule, this could hardly be called an amending Bill at all. In the first place, it would open up the whole of the Tariff question, and would be altogether outside the methods adopted on the introduction of this Bill. Apart from that, I consider that the case quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> applies equally to this Bill as to the Bill which is now the principal Act. Here is a Bill introduced with a certain object, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> endeavours now to include an item which is not in the Bill as presented to this Chamber. That is what was attempted to be done by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> in the case quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> ; and' in that case the proposal was ruled to be not in order, not because it was not altogether in order under the Standing Orders, but because under the Constitution it was not competent for the Senate to consider a matter of that description. According to section 53 of the Constitution - </para>

                            <para>-  The schedule to this Bill contains the amendments desired by the Government of the day, but those amendments may not seem desirable to certain members of the Senate. They may wish to cut out a number of them, to add to them, or to deal with them in any manner they may think proper. I hold that the ruling involves a limitation of the rights of the Senate, to which honorable senators ought not to agree. It is a serious limitation of our powers. If we agree to a thing of this kind, we shall simply place ourselves in the hands of the Executive for the time being. If the Executive say that there are to be no amendments of a particular measure, but such as they submit, and this ruling is upheld, it will simply mean that representative government, as we understand it, is a farce, and we shall have government by the Executive instead of government by Parliament. Every member of the Senate will agree with me that it is government by Parliament that we want. Setting all party views aside, and taking our stand upon the broad principle of representative government, and upon the rights, duties, and obligations of the Senate, I think we can only come to the conclusion that when a particular section of an Act is submitted to the Senate for amendment the Senate can make any. amendments in that section which it pleases. If it does not assert its right to do so, I maintain that it will place itself deliberately in hobbles. It will chain itself up. </para>

If he . does not abrogate his rights as a member of the Senate, I am not going to snatch' them from him, or to attempt to take them away from him. But I say that if the honorable senator upholds the ruling of the  President,  he will deliberately abrogate a right, a function, and a duty. I am sure that will appeal to him as a member of the Senate. </para>

                            <para>-  Schedule A to the Tariff Act of 1908 is now before the Senate for alteration. I say that, that being the case, every item of the Tariff schedule is open to amendment, and not merely- such items as the Government for the time being choose to submit for amendment. I direct the attention of honorable senators to the fact that on the schedule now before us for amendment we have a choice of two courses. We can confine ourselves to the amendments tabled by the Government, or we can say, as I think we have' a right to say, and ought to say, that, since the schedule to the principal Act is before us for amendment, we shall, if necessary, amend it throughout. I hope that we shall make such requests for its amendment as we may deem desirable from end to end. </para>

                            <para>-  I feel that there is an obligation on the part of every honorable senator, not merely to assist you, sir, in the conduct of business, but <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> help the Senate to carefully pick its steps, in view of the possibility of a conflict with another branch of the Legislature. Upon the merits of the general proposition I expressed myself some time ago, and I see no reason for departing from the view which I then held. But still, I am influenced by the fact that you, sir, take a different view of the matter. In the circumstances, therefore, I would suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that he should not persevere with his motion. If we are to enter upon a conflict with the other Chamber we want to be sure that we push our rights only so far as we can stand by them. I should not like the Senate to take up a position from which it might have to retire. As your ruling, sir, has influenced me in this matter, I would suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> should allow the matter to drop until it crops up again - as it probably will at no distant date - when we shall he free from the dual difficulty which has been created by your decision and by our Standing Orders. </para>

                        <para>. - I would seriously suggest to the Honorary Minister that the further consideration of this Bill should be postponed. It is quite evident that, although the Department has had years in which to determine what should be classed as anomalies, it has failed to present its recommendation in a satisfactory form. Even after the Bill was introduced in another Chamber, the Minister came down with a printed list of further amendments ; and now the Honorary Minister has brought forward still another amendment. If the debate upon this measure were adjourned until to-morrow, I am quite sure that some more amendments would be forthcoming. </para>

                            <para>- We were assured that the proposals contained in this Bill related to office anomalies, the rectification of which was required by our Customs officers. But the amendment which is now proposed is not one of that class of amendments. It has been secured by the importunity of some persons who live - where? Some exception was taken to a remark made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> It is obvious that when amendments are proposed on the floor of the Senate, without there being time to. get them into print, the people interested, whose ready lips are near to the Minister's ear, are not living at the other end of Australia. If this Bill be intended merely to deal with anomalies, let it be confined to them. But if the Government are going to give relief to certain industries and individuals, and to remove anomalies which are troublesome to some firms, we ought to go further, and take the whole of the anomalies into consideration. But the only anomalies which the Government are prepared to deal with now are those affecting Melbourne businesses. </para>

Let it go forth to the world that any firm that can get near to the Minister's private room can secure an amendment in the Tariff. Let it be generally understood that, the Government, having put off certain people with the assurance that while they have full sympathy with them, time does not permit of dealing with matters- in the Tariff affecting their industries, and that the only thing they propose to deal with are those anomalies the removal of which will permit of a smoother working of the Tariff, nevertheless, finds time and opportunity to extend kindly consideration to the interests of some lucky individuals who may happen to have approached the Minister within the last hour or two. </para>

                            <para>- The Government have not brought in this Bill as a contribution to Protection. They have shirked that portion of their obligations. They say they have brought forward the Bill to remove certain anomalies in the working of the Tariff. Representatives of the Government have said time and again, " We are not attempting to deal with the Tariff as a whole; all that we want to do is to get a little of the sand out of the departmental machinery." But this amendment is unnecessary from that point of view. The officials of the Department have not asked for it. If they had done so it would have been included in the Bill originally. This is merely another instance of the success of importunity. The  Government are going to allow that importunity to succeed. They are going to allow a few people to have their grievances redressed whilst the rest of the people of Australia are to remain unsatisfied. </para>

                        <para>.- In the course of the debate the Minister in charge of the Bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> stated that amendments affecting this and other items of the schedule were not in print because they were only decided upon very recently - in fact, that amendments have been brought under the notice of the Government within the last hour or so. I interjected that that was accounted for by the fact that Melbourne people could get their grievances objection whatever to the Minister receiving deputations from people engaged in business up to the last minute, and if he finds that a mistake has been made or that an injustice is being perpetrated, I quite agree that he ought to rectify it. He adopts the proper course in doing so. But why should representations made from one State be attended to whilst representations made from other States receive no attention? Have other representations received equal consideration from the Minister? Nothing of the kind. We are told that this is a perfectly innocent measure intended merely for the rectification of departmental anomalies. In looking through it I find that it is a great deal more than that. In some cases it removes items from the free list and puts them where they will be subject to a duty of 25 per cent. That is a great deal more than the rectification of an anomaly. I have no objection to it. If a local industry was suffering hardship through importations being on the free list, it was quite the right thing for the Government to make this proposal. </para>

I say that my statement was absolutely true, as proved by his own words that up to an hour or two before the time when he was speaking the Government listened to representations made by people in Melbourne, whilst people in Tasmania, Queensland, or Western Australia had no opportunities of making representations affecting them an hour ago. Furthermore, I point out that whilst it appears that the Government were willing to accept representations from outside people up to the last moment, they are absolutely unwilling to listen to - in fact, they resist - the demands made by representative people from other States. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know anything of the sort. I have absolutely no people be singled out for this treatment whilst others are allowed to go hungry without securing any rectification whatever of the anomalies that affect their industries? That is what I want to know. A deputation of fruit-growers made representations to the Government with regard to the anomaly that exists between preserved fruit in the form of jam and tinned fruit. Nearly every State in the group is interested in this matter. Yet the Government tell us that they cannot do anything. I venture to say that if a Victorian industry were suffering, the Government would jump at the chance of rectifying the anomaly in question. </para>

                    <para class="block">South Australia. The salt industry of South Australia enjoys a protection of 200 per cent. If there is any other industry that; gets an equal percentage of protection I should like the honorable senator to tell </para>
                    <para class="block">Hie  what it is. The wine and olive oil industries of the same State are also well protected. Good luck to South Australia. I do not grudge, her that protection. South Australia is also interested in the growing of fruits. So is Victoria. But there are two States which are especially interested in the fruit trade- Tasmania on account of her temperate fruits, and Queensland on account of her tropical fruits. Why should a Tasmanian, if he buys a ton of fruit and a ton of sugar, boils the two together in a copper to the consistency of a pulp, puts them into tins, and seals them up, get the advantage of a certain protective duty, whilst if he puts the same fruit through another process he gets no protection whatever ? Surely that is a gross anomaly. Then there is the case of bananas, cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> We have been told that the banana-growing industry mainly affects the Chinese. So it did for a long time, and while it was chiefly a 'Chinese industry I was not much concerned about getting a duty for it. But now it has come largely into the hands of Europeans. Further than that, if we are to refuse a protective duty to bananas because the trade is largely in the hands _ of Chinese, why should we give a protective duty to the Melbourne furniture industry, which is almost entirely in the hands of Chinese? When I first came to Melbourne, and did not know my way about as well as I do now, I went to a shop to buy some furniture. Under the Victorian law, furniture made by Chinese has to be branded as Chinese made. I went to a reputable house, and asked to be supplied with European-made furniture. But when I got it I found that one article, right away back in one of the drawers, was stamped as made by Chinese. There is no more reason why the industries that I have mentioned should not receive fair consideration than why the industry in which the Government are now so keenly interested should be picked out for special treatment. I have no objection to any Australian industry receiving consideration. I will vote for the highest duty being imposed for any industry conducted in this Commonwealth. But when I find that right up to the present hour the Government are open to receive representations' - and to be influenced by them - with regard to industries conducted in Mel bourne, I am entitled to ask why industries carried on in other States have not an equal right to that privilege? I shall continue to urge that argument until I receive some satisfactory reply. </para>

                        <para>. - I quite agree with what has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> The position is this : The Government are giving protection to the ear, while they deny it in fact. They told us that they intended to rectify anomalies. A Bill was brought down to remedy certain defects in the Tariff, discovered by officers of the Department of Trade and Customs. The Bill did not profess to deal in any way with the general principles underlying Protection and its incidence. The Government profess to have only one end in view. They told us that the Bill did not alter the incidence of taxation. But in that respect the Government are not treating us fairly. Later on, .there are certain other points to which I shall direct attention, where they are not rectifying anomalies, but creating them. I think that the Minister ought to tell us plainly whether the Government intend to carry out the promise incidentally made in another place that they will rectify mistakes which have been made in proposing to alter duties. </para>

                        <para>. - I cannot understand the attitude of some members 'of the Opposition. In the past they have complained that every measure has been cut and dried, and that it was impossible to induce Ministers to entertain a suggestion for an alteration. Here is a measure on which there can be a difference of opinion regarding each item. I recognise that it is wrong for a man when he introduces- a measure to  take up the attitude that there can be no alteration made, no matter what information may come to hand. I cannot blame the Honorary Minister for the attitude which he is taking up on this occasion. If, since the measure was considered in another place, he and the Minister of Trade and Customs have learned that certain alterations are desirable, why should they not be made? So far as I can understand the position, the Bill, if passed in its present form, will create anomalies. Surely the Ministry are to be commended for taking prompt steps to prevent such a thing. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly, and I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> that people in the distant States have not the same opportunity to approach the Minister as have people in Melbourne. But is that any reason why we should perpetuate wrong decisions which have been come to in another place? I do not think it is.  1  regret that people in Western Australia have not an opportunity to bring their grievances before the Parliament, and to get them dealt with as effectively as have people in Melbourne. But that is no reason why I should take a course which will put the latter at a disadvantage. I hope that any proposal which may be made regarding the measure will receive due consideration, no matter from which side it may emanate. </para>

                        <para>. - I am surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> asks that question at this juncture of the proceedings, because, when I submitted the request some time ago,  I  gave reasons which I thought would convince those who were interested in the encouragement of Australian industries that the words should be eliminated. I pointed out that their retention will inflict a great hardship on a number of men engaged in the tailoring industry throughout Australia, whose purchasing power is limited, and give an advantage to big men as against little men. </para>

                            <para>- Probably we are. Honorable senators state, and keep on repeating, that the Government have yielded to representations made by Victorians in respect to the amendments proposed in the Tariff. Whilst in a measure that is true ive must not be unmindful of the fact that the whole of the items in this schedule appeared in telegraph form in nearly all the leading newspapers in the capital cities, together with the reasons why they were proposed. Since" their publication business men in different parts of Australia have had time to consider the amendments. Certain persons have pointed out to the Minister that an injustice will be done to some persons if these words be retained in item 106A Surely no honorable senator desires that the Minister shall close the door to deputations in respect of this or any other matter. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not think that it has ever been my lot to hear a more extraordinary statement from a Minister than that which has just been delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley. Senator Vardon</inline> has asked, and I am sure that other honorable senators desire, to have an explanation as to the effect of deleting, these words. The Minister has simply stated that certain representations have been made to the Government that, unless the amendment be made, an injustice will be done to somebody. The Committee should be informed as to the way in which an injustice will be done. I am sure it will not be slow to act if it is pointed out that a legislative proposal is likely to act injuriously. Surely we ought to have something more than the vague statement of the Minister that he is convinced that it is in the interest of the Protectionist policy of Australia to delete the words, and that unless that be done an injustice will be inflicted on some person because that person has told him or the Government so. That is no reason why we should vote for the request. I suggest that he should tell us clearly what difference will be effected by the omission of the words. I am surprised that he cannot see what the Committee wants. He has taken part in too many Tariff debates not to know exactly the kind of reasons which are sought. When the item of corsets was under discussion, he gave very cogent reasons, and showed how the duty proposed would work out if retained, and he fought against it, not only strenuously, but successfully. We desire to hear similar reasons on the present occasion, and not vague statements. </para>

                        <para>. - The only information I can gather from the discussion is that if this alteration is made it will mean only more revenue. So far as  our  information goes no attempt is made to manufacture these articles within the Commonwealth. The proposal of the Government will only have the effect of increasing the duty on them from 15 and 10 per cent, to 25 and 15' per cent., and if that be so I cannot support it. If the alteration meant that there would be a probability of these things being produced in Australia, I should willingly vote for it. But, so far as we can learn, that is not so, and the alteration is proposed merely in the interests -of departmental officers, who find some difficulty in classifying ribbons and things of that sort. There should be no such difficulty in the way of men who are, or ought to be, experts in these matters, and if that is to be the only reason given for the proposal, I shall be unable to vote for it. </para>

                        <para>. - This proposal merely means a little added cost to the general public. The only reason given for it by the Minister is that the officers of the- Department have some trouble in dealing with this matter under the existing Tariff. Surely Parliament does not alter a Tariff to save trouble to departmental officials ? What are the officers of the Department appointed for? We know that no attempt has been made to make ribbons in Australia. They are imported into this country from France and from England. Of what use is it to attempt, in the name of Protection, to increase duties which can only act as revenue duties, and which must add to the cost of the articles to the consumer ? If the duty is increased on these articles, people who use them in making dresses will have to charge more for their work. Staunch Protectionist as the Minister is, he will not claim that it is necessary to make this alteration for the purpose of Protection. The officers of the Department cannot tell him that these articles are made,  or are likely to be made, in the Commonwealth in our time. </para>

                        <para>.- I take it that we are not here to reduce the duties imposed upon anything that can be manufactured in Australia. If these articles can be manufactured here, and the Government proposals will assist those engaged in their manufacture, I shall have no great objection to the consequent increase of duties upon them. But if they a re not made here, I do not think it can be contended that we need an increase of duties for revenue purposes, or to facilitate the work of the Customs Department. This proposal will not assist any industry here, and will only increase the cost of goods, in connexion with which these articles are used, to the extent of the increase in the duty. I refer honorable senators to another part of the same item, in which it is proposed to add after the words "lace for attire," " Lace flouncings,"- " millinery and dress nets," and " embroideries in the piece," the words "exceeding 18 inches in width." A gentleman in the trade showed me some of these things, and  explained that the narrow widths below 18 inches are used by the poorer people. I take it that it is not the desire of honorable senators that the poorer people should have to pay more for these articles than they already have to pay under the existing Tariff. 1 understand  that  the proposal will not affect people who are sufficiently well off to be able to afford to get these goods 18 inches or more in width, whilst it will make a difference in the case of goods of a less width, which are now used by the poorer people. That being so, 1 cannot see any justification for the proposed alteration. </para>

                        <para>. - I cannot understand the attitude of Ministers with regard to the part of the item affected by the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger. I understand that the Department has experienced considerable difficulty in differentiating between the item now under review and ordinary trimmings. That being so, it naturally desires to bring all these articles under one heading, and to subject them to the one rate of duty. With that desire we all sympathize. But in order to secure that uniform classification, the Ministry now propose to levy a higher rate of duty. As these articles are not made in the Commonwealth it is quite clear that that duty will be in no sense a protective one. But it <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> happens that these very articles are the raw material of the dressmaker. I have no knowledge of the dressmaking trade, but I can see at once that if we increase the cost of the raw material pf the dressmaker, we shall, to that extent, grant her a lesser measure of protection against dresses which are imported. Do the Government desire that? Is that the position to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> the apostle' of high Protection, has been reduced ? Surely there is a way out of the difficulty. If he wishes to bring ribbons and galloons under a uniform duty, as neither of them is made in Australia, he should subject them to the lower rate of duty. That would produce the desired uniformity without in any way lessening the protection which is extended to our dressmakers. </para>

                            <para>- In other words, the honorable senator would prefer duties of 15 per cent, and 10 per cent, upon all the trimmings enumerated in this request as against 25 per cent, and 15 per cent. He says, in effect, that whilst there may be difficulties in the way of departmental officers differentiating between certain kinds of trimmings, he does not desire to do an injustice to those persons who are engaged in a particular line of business. Neither do the Government nor the Department. But it is doubly difficult for the Department to differentiate between certain classes of trimmings and trimmings which are being manufactured in Australia. A little while ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger asked where trimmings are being manufactured in the Commonwealth. From inquiry, I have since ascertained that they are being manufactured in Melbourne and Sydney. Because they are being manufactured in Australia, we wish to give the industry as much encouragement as possible. .Under the present Tariff they enjoy a protection of 15 per cent, and 25 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- We do not desire to do an injustice to an Australian industry. In some of the States the importers probably get ribbons and galloons- admitted at the lower rate of duty, whilst in other States they have to pay the higher rate. In Victoria the practice has been for the Department to insist upon payment of the higher duty whenever a doubt has existed in respect of any article. But that rigidity has not been observed in other States. We desire uniformity in order that all may be placed upon the same plane. </para>

                        <para>. - The Minister has now definitely declared that these trimmings are being made in Australia. A. little while ago he was extremely doubtful on the point. It is quite clear that in the balancing of the industries which the Ministry seek to advantage by the Tariff, they are more inclined to study the interests of the manufacturers of trimmings than the interests of our dressmakers. In proportion as we impose a duty upon ribbons and galloons which cannot be produced in Australia, we increase the cost of the raw materials to our dressmakers, and cut into that measure of protection which has- hitherto been extended to the finished article. There is <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> escaping the logic of that position. This great </para>

                        <para>. - When the Tariff was under consideration in this Chamber the Honorary Minister constituted himself the great champion of those persons who make up clothes in the Commonwealth as against the importers of ma'de-up clothing. He declared that every protection should be extended to them. I do not know why he now seeks to deprive them of that measure of protection. Apparently he wishes to reduce that protection by 5 per cent, or 10 per cent. Merely because an individual proposes to manufacture trimmings in Australia, is he to be protected at the expense of the thousands of women who are employed in the dressmaking trade? Surely we are not going to that extreme. This particular manufacturer has not yet materialized. But because a small quantity of trimmings may be' manufactured in Sydney and Melbourne, are all the dressmakers of the Commonwealth to be penalized? Why is it proposed to do this? Simply because the Department wishes it.  But is the Department to rule the Commonwealth ? I hope that the Minister will accede to the request, which is a reasonable one. </para>

If we are going to amend the Tariff by rectifying anomalies, we should admit free of duty articles which are not made in the Commonwealth. If we cannot do that we should defer their consideration until such time as we are able to undertake- a comprehensive revision of the Tariff. There are three classes of adornments, namely, lace flouncings, millinery and dress nets, and embroideries, in respect of which an arbitrary limit of 18 inches in width has been fixed.

The Minister now proposes to make a lower rate of duty apply to the more costly fabrics, whilst the higher duty will affect those which are used by the poorer classes. I do not know whether the Minister, intends that that should be the result of the differentiation. </para>

                        <para>.- Apparently the proposed amendment is to affect only embroideries, but the same argument applies to the paragraph which deals with laces. I have before me a specimen of lace which is largely used by the white workers for goods which, are purchased by the poorer classes. I am informed that if the Bill goes through in its present form, these goods will pay 25 and 15  Der  cent. I have before me also another kind of lace, which is made in widths exceeding 18 inches. It is used for a rather attractive and delicate kind of dress. Under the Bill, this superior kind of lace will be dutiable at 15 and 10 per cent. Surely this differentiation does not benefit the poorer classes. The Minister is proposing to remove the anomaly with regard to embroideries, but not with regard to laces. </para>

                        <para>. - The observations of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger are calculated to leave the impression that there is a desire on the part of the Government to impose burdens on the poorer classes of the community. We do not desire to do anything of the kind. The reason for the differentiation in the case of laces is this : There are in Australia many women, some of them in  poor  circumstances, and some of them rather better off, who are busily engaged in the making of laces which are utilized for the manufacture of apparel. Laces over 18 inches in width will be dutiable at 15 and 10 per cent. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger innocently pointed out that that would give an advantage to members of the better placed section of the community in that they would be able to have nicer flounces on their dresses than could persons in less happy circumstances, he spoke beside the question, because the duty neither affects the quantity nor the quality. If a person with not a very large purse wishes to purchase lace over 18 inches in width, she will be able to do so on the same terms as any one else. </para>

                        <para>. - The longer the debate is continued the more surprised I am becoming, and I venture to say the more is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> losing that foothold which he, as a Protectionist, has held. I was surprised to hear him state that it is beside the question whether the duty is going to affect the rich or the poor. It may be beside the question so far as he is concerned, but I hope that is not the case with the Committee. Surely that is one of the factors which we ought to take into consideration when it is not a matter of protecting an industry. The Minister does not pretend that these articles are made in Australia, and, therefore, this is simply a revenue duty. It is not beside the question when we are asked to consider whether we shall put a higher duty on poor people, and a lowe duty on rich people, or reverse the process. </para>

                            <para>- -How many 18-inch flounces does the Minister see on the dresses of poor persons ? He knows well the section of persons who use the wider laces. Of course, the value will determine the rate which will be paid, but he knows 18-inch lace is not to be found on the dresses of those who have least of this world's goods. It is used almost exclusively by the wealthier section of the community. Therefore, it is idle to say that the question of rich or poor does not enter into the debate. If the amendment be carried the effect will be that the cheaper narrower laces which are worn by the great masses of the people will be dutiable at  25  and  15  per cent., while laces  18  inches wide and over will be dutiable at only  15  and  10  per cent. </para>

                            <para>- No. It cannot be denied that the bulk of the narrow laces are worn by the less- wealthy section of the community. There can be no question here about easing the work of the Department. It is not a question of inability to differentiate between  6-inch  lace and  18-inch  lace. It does not need an expert to do that. It can be done by a boy or a blind man with a foot rule. What can be the object of this reclassification, except to place a high duty on laces which are the more largely worn, and which, therefore, will yield a larger revenue? If, under the pretence of rectifying anomalies, the Minister wants to impose a revenue duty, the bulk of which will necessarily be paid by the less wealthy section, he should have been frank with the Committee, and admitted his object. I understood, when I was asked to consider the measure, that it was primarily introduced for the purpose of easing the work of the Department. Will any one tell me that a public Department can find any difficulty in determining the width of lace? Do they really claim that they wish to be relieved of the difficulty of measuring these goods ? That argument will not hold water for a moment. If the Minister does not want to establish the reputation of one who seeks to impose revenue duties on the poorer section of the people, he should deal with this item as he did with- the last one, and allow the articles to fall under the lower rate of duty. No question of Protection is involved, because the goods are not made in Australia to-day. </para>

I hope that the Government will withdraw this proposal to increase the duty on common insertions and common laces, because it is a revenue duty pure and simple, and in no way a protective duty. These laces are made in factories with- a very expensive outfit. And what is more,, they are used to the extent of millions of yards throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- It cannot be made here until up-to-date factories are established, and, therefore, it must be imported. On whom will this heavy duty fall ? Not on those who can best afford to pay, but on the workers - the Democracy of Australia. I, as a good Protectionist, cannot support what is undoubtedly a revenue duty. Because a few lace manufacturers, who make a better class of lace than that which I hold in my hand, and who probably make a very superior lace and insertion, want protection, are we to penalize the thousands of persons who use the cheap insertion, and cannot do without it? No. I cannot support for a moment a proposal to take money out of the pockets of the workers. I hope the Minister will see fit to withdraw it. Were there a factory in existence, or any chance of producing the article locally, I would not take this stand; but, as things are, it must be imported. </para>

                        <para>. - It is quite apparent to me, unless I am making a very serious blunder, that this item will bring in revenue- without securing any advantage. Prior to this anomalous attempt to remedy anomalies in the Tariff, lace goods could be imported as piece goods, at 5 per cent, and free. But by this measure they are removed from item 123, and subject to duties of 15 and <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> per cent, if they measure 18 inches and over in width, whereas lace goods under 18 inches wide are .removed from the item under which they were dutiable at 15 and 10 per cent., and made "dutiable at 25 and 15 per cent. I regard this as an extraordinary attempt, not to rectify an anomaly, but rather to increase the revenue through the Customs. These two qualities of lace which are now admitted duty free, would, under this proposal, be dutiable at 10 per cent, and 15 per cent., and the duty on laces of less than 18 inches in width would be increased. I hope that the Government will retire from the position they have taken up in connexion with the item. </para>

If I thought this proposal would be protective in its incidence, I should support it. When the existing Tariff was before this Chamber, I supported every item which would give protection, and as consistently opposed every merely revenue item. </para>

                            <para>- I have seen superior Irish lace made by girls in Sydney, but it was for exhibition purposes. It is quite impossible just now to put in the costly plant necessary to establish lace-making as a commercial success in Australia. If I thought it would be possible to secure the establishment of factories for the manufacture of this lace, whether 18 inches in width or less or more, I should be prepared to support this proposal. The Committee is called upon at the request of the Government to remove anomalies in the existing Tariff, but if we accept this proposal we shall create a worse anomaly than at present exists in connexion with these items. The majority of the people of Australia are to-day using these insertions, and a proposal to penalize them by increasing the duty upon them by 10 per cent, is one which it is impossible for us to entertain. It might have been wiser for the Government not to have brought down any proposal affecting the Tariff than to have proposed to remove anomalies in this way. My ideas of Protection may not be as Himalayan as those of the Minister in charge of the Bill, but I should advise him to agree either to recommit this item or to delete it altogether. </para>

                        <para>. - I believe that this proposal is not only one for revenue duties, but is anti-Protectionist. No one can say that these laces are being made in Australia. Though a better class of lace is being made as a pleasant occupation by young ladies in various parts of the country, it is not being made on a commercial scale anywhere in Australia. It is proposed to increase the duty on this class of goods very considerably, and I ask what we should accomplish by that? The white workers of the Commonwealth engaged in making up dress materials, underclothing, and such things, require these goods as their raw material. If we increase the duty on their raw material, we shall be giving them so much less protection against made-up garments which are imported from abroad, and in which these materials are used. There is no proposal in this amending schedule for increasing the duties on made-up garments in which these materials are used, and yet it is here proposed to increase the duty on the raw material used in the manufacture of the madeup garments here. By adopting this proposal, we shall be progressing like the crab - backwards. We who claim to be Protectionists wish to progress forwards. It is strange that we have had no adequate explanation from the Government for the  proposed alteration. The whole item appears to come under the same category, and, instead of rectifying, it will create, anomalies. I ask honorable senators to refer to the paragraph dealing with braids. It is proposed to lift them out of the free list, and put them into the list dutiable at 25 per cent. What will be the effect of that? One can go into any draper's shop in Melbourne and see samples of plain braids, and of braids made up into fancy patterns. Under this proposal, the duty on plain braids and braids made up into fancy patterns would be the same, and the result will be that, instead of the patterns being worked in plain braids on the materials by Australian workers, braid would be imported made up in fancy patterns, and all that would be necessary then would be to tack it on to the dress materials. I repeat that this proposal is not only a revenue Tariff proposal, but is absolutely an anti-Protectionist proposal. Yet we have a Government asking a presumably Protectionist party and a Protectionist Senate to accept them. I, for one, am not prepared to do so, and shall vote against the item. </para>

                    <para>I wish honorable senators to understand that specially hardened steel containing a percentage of chromium or manganese is admitted free. The Government now pro- pose to limit that provision by inserting after the word " containing " the words not less than 2 per cent, of." So that, under their proposal, manganese or chrome steel parts would have to contain not less than 2 per cent, of chromium to be admitted free. Yet what is the actual position? It is that in the hardening of steel, nothing like that percentage of chromium is used. Would the Honorary Minister be surprised to learn that one one-hundredth part of  1  per cent, of tungstic acid is required to make steel of the hardest and toughest kind? Does he know that the highest analysis of chrome steel now used in the biggest works of Australia is only six-tenths of  1  per cent. I hold in my hand a telegram from the general manager of the Mount Morgan mine - -Captain Richard - who is one of the best Protectionists in Australia. He is known as one of the most ardent Protectionists in the Commonwealth. Every item of machinery which could be made in Australia has been installed in the Mount Morgan mine.

                        <para>. - I hope that the Committee will pay serious attention to the remarks . of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> The effect of the proposal of the Ministry would be to increase the cost of the wearing parts of machinery to every mine in Australia which is engaged in crushing hard ore. This matter was discussed very thoroughly when the Tariff was previously under consideration, and it was then recognised that instead of any particular percentage of chromium being required in steel, if only a trace of it were present, it should be admitted free. But the Government now propose to increase the amount of chromium necessary to enable steel to .be admitted free to 2 per cent. What does that mean? It means producing steel of such hardness that it would be unfit for any practical purpose in mining. According to an authority which I have here, steel which contains 2 per cent, of chromium is used only for making projectiles, and tools of trade of the hardness of an emery wheel. As no attempt has been made to produce steel of that quality, and as no attempt is likely to be made to produce it on a commercial scale, the Government proposal would merely add to the cost of mining throughout Australia, without the compensating advantage of establishing an industry here. In addition to the testimony of the manager of the Mount Morgan mine, we have the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Agnew,</inline> the manager of Bewick, Moreing and Company, in Western Australia. He stated before the Tariff Commission that' the task of renewing the wearing parts of the machinery which is installed in the Lake View Consols mine is very considerable. He added that the authorities had. tried steel parts manufactured in Australia as substitutes for those which had been obtained abroad, and that the former lasted only three months as against the nine months' wear of the latter, which came from Huddersfield, in England, and from Krupp's factory in Germany. We have also to consider the loss that is sustained by bringing machinery to a standstill for the purpose of enabling worn-out parts to be replaced by new ones. When that has to be done three times as often in the case of Australian manufactured parts, it is a very serious matter. I hope that the Minister will listen to the appeal that has been made to him on the subject. There are many mining companies that are tottering on the verge of insolvency, and have been so for a long time. The Lake View Consols Mine employs 400 men, and the yield is so small, comparatively, that the manager has to toss every sovereign in the air before determining to spend it. It has not been paying any dividends, and if any increase in the cost of wearing parts is incurred, it may mean closing up the mine. Is it worth while to incur these risks for the problematical chance of establishing an industry in Melbourne? If there were a good chance of establishing an industry of the kind, I should have no hesitation in supporting the Government ; but it is well known that the manufacture of chrome steel is not even a patent. Those who manufacture it in the Old Country are doing so by virtue of their long and varied experience. In the Krupp mills there is in operation plant of very great strength for crushing the balls, and there is specially-devised and heavy machinery for turning out this particular kind of steel. Such machinery is not in use in Australia at 'present. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Agnew,</inline> in his evidence before the Tariff Commission, stated that he is always anxious to give preference to Australian manufactures, but in this case there is no chance of doing so. The duty will place an unnecessary handicap upon the mining industry, without giving any compensating advantage to a steel manufacturing industry. It is peculiar to find the present Government reversing the policy of the last one in this respect. Why they should do so I cannot understand. In the interests of those mines which are on the verge of closing down, I hope the Government will see the necessity of retracing their steps in this particular. With a view to enable me to move that the paragraph be struck out, I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> to withdraw his motion temporarily. </para>

But, incidentally, he said that if this item were carried, it would mean the imposition of a duty of an oppressive character on some mining machinery. That, however, would not eventuate. Every part would be charged alike. Machinery would be dutiable at 25 and 20 per cent. The honorable senator desires that the percentage of chromium should be fixed at J. I may point out, however, that there is a departmental rule at present to the effect that the percentage of chromium in chrome steel should be not less than \. That rule has not modified the present position as affecting our manufacturing industry. Parts are being manufactured from chrome and manganese steel in Australia at present; but the item in the Tariff as worded has seriously interfered with the industry on account of the heavy importation of parts containing a very small percentage of chromium. We desire to give every possible encouragement to those engaged in the manufacture of machinery, whether that machinery is used for mining or any other purpose. There is no reason why mining should receive more consideration under a protective Tariff than any other line of industry. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> desires to give as much protection as possible, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has expressed the wish to have the item deleted. If that were done he would seriously hamper those who are engaged in the manufacture of many kinds of machinery.

                    <para>How can the Minister say that it was such a complicated and difficult matter that it ought to have been moved for as a return ? That was  a  mere clouding of the issue. The real trouble was that if the questions were answered, they, together with the answers, would appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and the public would know something which they have a right to know. But, if the information is issued in the shape of a return, it will be buried in the Parliamentary Papers, and the public will never have access to it. That was the real reason why the questions were not answered. I protest against that sort of fencing on the part of the Government. They have no right to fence with a matter of public importance, which the people have a right to know. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> said to-day that he did not desire to answer the questions in a bald way, without offering some words of explanation. I invite him to get up now and make the necessary explanation. I have said all I want to say on the matter at the present juncture. </para>
