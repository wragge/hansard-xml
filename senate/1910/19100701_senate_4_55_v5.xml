                    <para>. - I have a peculiar pleasure in rising on this occasion to offer you, sir, my congratulations. I hope also that you will receive the congratulations of the whole Senate on your elevation to the very high office which you now occupy. As a representative of Queensland, it is an especial satisfaction to me to be able to congratulate another representative of that State on having been elevated to the highest position which it is within the province of the Parliament of the Commonwealth . to bestow upon any citizen of Australia. I think that you, sir, have reason to feel exceedingly proud that, after a long term of parliamentary service, you have attained, by such a large majority of this Senate, to such a very exalted position. I believe, from my long personal acquaintance with you, from my knowledge of your familiarity with the Standing Orders and with parliamentary procedure, that you will be able to fulfil the duties of the office- with satisfaction to both sides of the Chamber, and in a manner that will do the utmost credit to yourself. On behalf of the Senate, I think I can offer you the undivided assistance of every member of it in carrying out your duties. It will, I am satisfied, be the pleasure of every member of the Senate to assist you to the best of his ability, in order that you may worthily occupy the position. Personally, it will be my endeavour to help you to the very utmost. I hope also that honorable senators on the opposite side will do their utmost to assist you, and that, so aided, you will be able to maintain the best traditions and the highest standards of the Presidentship of this Chamber. I have nothing further to add, except to offer my personal felicitations to you on the exalted position that you have been called upon to occupy. </para>

                    <para>. -On  behalf of honorable senators upon this side of the chamber - and I desire also to speak for myself - I have much pleasure in tendering you, most sincerely, my congratulations and their congratulations upon your elevation to the highest position within the gift of the Senate. You, sir, are probably more conscious than is anybody here of the very high honour that has been conferred upon you, and that you will endeavour to the best of your ability - which has been marked at all times - to justify the confidence which has been reposed in you by those who have placed you there, is not only your avowed intention, but our hope and belief. You may be perfectly assured on entering upon the difficulties of your position of the hearty co-operation of all sections of the Senate. Apart from the turmoil which Occasionally arises in politics, there is in the hearts of us all a sincere and earnest desire to uphold the best traditions of parliamentary government. That can be secured only by impartial administration, such as you have promised us, and by the hearty assistance and co-operation of all sections of the Senate. That will be forthcoming to lighten the serious duties which have been cast upon you. Wishing you every success in the position to which you have been called, and looking to the present session to afford you further opportunities to demonstrate your capacity for useful service to the public, and again adding my own personal felicitations, I leave the matter at that stage. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Colonel Sir ALBERT</inline>GOULD (New South Wales) [11. 16]. - Before the proceedings close I should like to have an opportunity, as retiring  President,  to offer you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> my congratulations upon the very high honour that has been conferred upon you by this Chamber. I trust, that you will be able to discharge the duties of the office to which you have been elected in the  way  that - you desire, and in the manner  in  which the Senate desires you to discharge them. I wish also to thank those honorable senators who supported my  Candidature for re-election, and at the same time to tender my sincere thanks to the Senate for the loyal way in which the members of the Senate supported me whilst I  had  the honour of occupying the position of its  President.  That the same loyalty will be displayed towards my successor I feel perfectly sure, and I trust that it will be the means of enabling business in this Chamber to be transacted in the orderly, dignified, and satisfactory way in which it ought to be transacted. The Senate occupies a very high and important position under the Constitution of the Commonwealth, and the public look to it to exercise its powers and' to discharge its duties with fearlessness, with candour, and at the same time,  with'  dignity. Whatever may be the future of the Commonwealth I trust that the Senate will always be regarded as  a  House in which legislative work will be well done, and in which business will be conducted with that high sense of public duty which ought to belong to this Parliament. I again congratulate you, sir, upon your election to the position of  President,  and I trust that you will find your occupancy of the office genial and satisfactory alike to yourself and to honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>. - I rise to second the motion, which I am sure the Senate will adopt as no mere formal tribute to one who occupied the position of ruler under our political system. On the contrary, I believe that the Senate will adopt the motion recognising that in the death of King Edward VII. the nation has lost a wise chief, that a humane heart is stilled, and that a great worker in the cause of peace and civilization has been called upon to cease his labours. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, no</inline> tribute which we can pay, either by voice or by pen, no monument of sculptured marble, can pay such honour to his memory as that which he has secured by his own efforts in the title which came to him ere yet the grave opened to receive him - the title of the Peacemaker. By his efforts as a worker in the path of peace, he secured a place in the hearts of not merely the people of the Empire, but the people of the whole civilized world, as was made manifest by the title to which I have referred - a title which, in my judgment, will represent the greatest achievement in a long and useful life. May we hope, sir, that his labours will hasten forward the time when an enlightened civilization will beat" the sword into the ploughshare and the spear into the reaping hook? </para>

                    <para>. - By leave of the Senate, I desire to make a short statement, which I believe will have the effect of simplifying the transaction of business. I wish in the first place to announce officially that the members of the present Government are as follow :  - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> Prime Minister and Treasurer ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> Attorney-General ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor,</inline> Minister of External Affairs; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas,</inline> Postmaster-General; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> Minister of Defence; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor,</inline> Minister of Trade and Customs ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O'Malley, Minister of Home Affairs ; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> Vice-President of the Executive Council; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frazer</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> Honorary Ministers. I may add that after the lapse of nine or ten years, and after the expression of a desire by the Senate on several occasions, we now have the Government represented by three Ministers in the Senate. The arrangement which we have made with respect to the allotment of business in the Senate is as follows : I myself shall undertake the work relating to the Departments of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Attorney-General and Minister of External Affairs. The Minister of Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> will take charge of business relating to his own Department and the Department of Trade and Customs. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> will undertake work relating to the Department of the Postmaster-General and the Department of Home Affairs. Honorable senators who wish to make inquiries or to address the Chamber on any criticisms affecting the Departments will now know to what Ministers their remarks should be addressed. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to ask for a little information. We have listened to a long and interesting list of Bills, which have received the assent of the Governor-General. We know what fate has befallen those  measures. But no message has been sent to us showing the fate that has befallen the Financial Agreement. I think we ought to have something placed on record to show what fate has befallen the two very important Bills that embodied the financial policy of the previous Administration. </para>

                <para class="block">I am very sensible of the honour conferred upon me in being asked to submit this motion, because the Parliament assembled to-day differs in "vital respects from those which have assembled in -the Commonwealth in the past. The present Government stand as no other Commonwealth Government have stood. They have a mandate from the people to place upon the statute-book certain Acts of Parliament. They have been sent here with a majority in both Houses to do the will of the people. Their programme was recently indorsed by a very large majority of the people of Australia. I am sure that other members of the Labour party, in common with myself, are delighted that in this Parliament we should occupy the position we do. Those who are opposed to us should also feel some little gratification, because for years they have been clamouring for a return to the two-party system of government, and on that memorable " Thirteenth " the people- of Australia gave it to them. It has been brought about by no fusion, but by the will of the people  expressed at the ballot-box. It is the function of Parliament to carry out. the will of the people. The programme of the present Government has been explained by all lbc members of the Labour party. They have for years been spreading 'the glad tidings throughout Australia, and the principles of the party are now very well understood. Our opponents have heard so much of them, that they must understand them, even though they do not desire to accept them. The will of the people has decreed that they are to be accepted; it is the duty of the present Government to see that they are placed on the statute-book, and they will be placed there. Previous Ministries in the Commonwealth Parliament have been, kept in power by parties holding different opinions. The present Government seek no assistance from any party holding opinions differing from their own, because they have a sufficient majority to carry out the will of the people as expressed at the general election. The policy of the Labour party is a policy of progress, a policy for the bettering of the conditions of the toiling multitude. Every Act they desire to place upon the statute-book has for its object the betterment of the conditions of the  people who  create the wealth of Australia. Their; policy is one which will give every  man and woman  .an opportunity to earn a fair and reasonable wage, and will make adequate provision for them in the declining years-.; of 'then-- lives. Many explanations have been  given  ' of Labour's great victory in Australia-, but there is only one explanation of it, and that is that the young men of Australia, and the young women too, I am pleased to be reminded, are imbued with a great national spirit that must tend to the prosperity of the country. They do not care who makes the laws, so long as those laws are in keeping with the national sentiment, and are such as will enable Australia to take her place amongst the nations of the world. We want to break down the caste spirit which has made its appearance in this fair land, and which has proved detrimental to the progress of older nations. We wish to see our Australian sons fighting shoulder to shoulder in defence of this great nation. We have no desire that they should be divided by party differences, as they have been in the past. We wish that they should be united in the fighting line, and the legislation to be proposed by the present Government will tend to place them in that position. The son of the wealthy man, the curled darling of Toorak, or of Potts Point, will be asked to stand shoulder to shoulder in the defence of the country with the humblest . worker in the land. That is the policy of the present Government, and of the people, and it gives expression" to the sentiment we 'desire to encourage in the young population of the Commonwealth. We desire that Australia should take her place amongst the nations of the world, remembering, at the same time, that the States we come from have certain rights. I stand here as an Australian, and the father of Australians; and my object in life is to better the condition of ' the Australian people, and to prevent them from becoming, as many in older lands are to-day, the victims of misery hard to conceive. We know that in our own Fatherland, of which we are so proud, the want of better and fairer laws in the early days of its existence, brought about a state of affairs which we have no wish to see repeated in Australia. Young Australians have sent us into this Parliament for the express purpose of framing laws which will prevent that kind of thing in this country. We do not pretend that as a result of the advent to power of the present Government,. Australia will be saved in a- few weeks. Some of our opponents have said that the working men were looking for the benefits to follow the success of the Labour party on the Monday morning following the date of the elections. But they know better than that. The time has arrived when the people will not be led by the journals which have led them in years gone by. They have pronounced for a united and democratic Australia, and I verily believe that there are persons in this community and journals circulating in the Commonwealth who would prefer to see Australia's progress retarded for years than to see the Commonwealth forging ahead under Labour rule. They remind me of the story of the old lady who was invited to witness the trial trip of the first locomotive. When she saw the mass of iron, she said, " It will never go." When steam was got up and the locomotive began to get warm, she still said, " It will never go, it will never go." But when it started with a bound, the old lady said, " It will never stop, it will never, never stop." That is how Labour legislation is regarded to-day. The people of Australia have charged us' with' the making of laws to better' the conditions  of the toiling multitude. It is not the desire of the Labour party to interfere with legitimate trade, but if any combination uses its power to crush out of existence any citizen who desires to compete with it, we think it right to interfere in the interests of the people, in order that they may obtain the products of the land at fair prices. We have seen the foodstuffs of nations gambled with by speculators who care nothing for the lives of the people, and whose only desire is the accumulation of wealth. Referring to the Governor-General's opening speech, I should like to -say that in the reference to the death of King Edward VII., whose labours on behalf of the world's peace and civilization will long the remembered, I think the Government have sufficiently expressed the views of the whole community. The items of the Government programme are numerous and of very great importance. On the subject of finance. I cannot help a feeling of keen satisfaction with the result of the recent referenda, and with the fact that the proposal which the Fusion Government advocated has been rejected, and that which the Labour party supported has received the approval of the people. It was said that the Labour party, if returned to power, would not keep faith with the States. I am glad to be able here to-day to give that statement a denial. I am glad to note the intention of the Government to carry out its pledge, and that for ten 3'ears, at any rate, the States are to receive 25s. per head of population as agreed upon between the States and Commonwealth Governments. The proposal to introduce a Bill to provide for the issue of State notes is one which has my hearty approval, because I was always of opinion that the national authority should have charge of the currency. We have been ridiculed by the press and by prominent men who have spoken of the failure of the proposed system in other lands, but they have not referred to the failure of the present system in Australia. They have not told the people -that to-day suffering working men who, a few years ago, placed the whole of their savings in some of our banks, have them locked up to this day. They have said that in a certain country under such a system <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> notes were worth only 13s. 6d. each, but I am able to say that deposits in a certain bank in Sydney are to-day worth only 13s. 6d. in the <inline font-style="italic">£1.</inline> I believe that if the national authority takes charge of the currency, it will give the people very great satisfaction. They will have confidence that if they deposit their money in such a banking institution as that which is to be proposed by the Government, they will have some guarantee that they will be able to get it again when they require it. It is a heartrending sight to witness old people clamouring for their money at the counters of the bank to which I have referred. Men, bowed with age, and who" have scarcely sufficient to live upon, have found that their deposits in that bank are now worth only 13s. 6d. in the <inline font-style="italic">£1.</inline> Our opponents do not tell the people these things, but we are aware of them. I trust that the people will no longer be fooled by the stories told of the failure of State note issues in other lands. Our opponents do not tell the people that a State note issue has been a success in one part of Australia where it has been in operation for over seventeen years. They say nothing of that. If it has been successful under the management of the .Government of a State, it will .certainly -be a success under the management .pf the  ..National  Government. , The' proposal - is . one which has my hearty -sympathy; an.d support. No matter what opposition- may- be offered, we are prepared to show that the State note is a safe and sound currency to adopt. At any rate, we intend to give it a trial, and I am not afraid of the result. - When I was travelling through New South Wales I asked the people to give the Labour Government a trial. That they are doing, and I have no fear of the result. The Government will place upon the statute-book legislation which will be creditable to them. The bogy that the Labour party desired to confiscate and rob was burst on the memorable 13th April. Now I come to the plum of the Government's proposals. Throughout Australia there "will be the greatest satisfaction at the Government's declaration of its intention to lower the age at which old-age pensions shall be. payable to women, and to make provision for the payment of invalid pensions. That intimation will bring joy to thousands of homes in .Australia, and show the world what to expect from a Labour Government. For a number of years I have been a worker in Sydney, and no one knows better than I do the awful sufferings of our poor. It will be a glorious thing for a woman - for instance, a widow who has brought up a family, having, 'perhaps, been left destitute in early life- to know that when she comes  to the age of sixty years she will get assistance from the Government to help her in her old age.' Let me cite the case of a woman being left with two crippled children, who have now reached the age of forty years. She has toiled and slaved to keep her lads from being placed in a charitable institution; but now she is laid low, and the neighbours take turns in keeping her family alive. The poor people in the neighbourhood have denied themselves some of the necessaries of life in order to provide for these destitute persons, but, because the widow is sixty-two years of age, she cannot ;receive Government assistance. As one of the workers in the community, I have known the trials and struggles of these unfortunate fellow-creatures, and I am thankful that the Government intend to reduce the age from sixty-five to sixty. The invalid pension is on a par with the old-age pension. In a letter which I have seen, a blind man, who held a position in Melbourne for many years, pleads* with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> to try to do something for * him, as he had been tipped into what he called " the human rubbish heap of Australia." Under the Old-age Pensions Act he is not yet old enough to receive Government assistance, and he pleads with, the Parliament of Australia to bring its invalid pension provisions ' into force by proclamation, so that he can receive some assistance. When these awful things are occurring in our land, and so many persons are laid low with poverty, we ask the Parliament of Australia to do something for their relief. We are not desirous of taking from any persons what they possess. But we hold that this land is rich enough in mineral and agricultural wealth to provide for every man and woman therein. That is all that we desire - that is what we are" going to do, and to do as quickly as possible. I do not intend to say much more, because we have other work to perform to-day. I would have liked an opportunity to speak a little longer, and to deal with other matters, because I speak from my heart in my own simple way. When, with my comrades, I addressed the people of New South Wales, we were boycotted. We could only speak to the few around the hotel balcony. But I believe that to-day an opportunity is given to myself and my comrades ' to speak to the people of Australia. I am speaking to them from my heart. I believe that we have a majority with us who think that something- should be done for the great toiling multitudes of Australia. With reference to the land tax proposals, I would like to say a few words. We know that the best lands of Australia are locked up, and are not giving their full value to the nation. Recently, it took me eight hours on one day to drive through one man'sland, and the next day it ,took me the same time to travel through another man's land. On these estates there were only a few cattle, whereas there should have been a thousand families. Needless to say when a man owns a vast tract of .country, his name generally begins .with "Mac." We are desirous of breaking up. these huge estates, because to the people this wealth belongs. We desire to make room for people. We, as well as any other party in this or any other Parliament, want Australia to be carrying its millions of population, but we are anxious to see them provided for before they leave their homes in other countries. We want the land to be made available. With a graduated land, tax, it will be necessary for the owners of big estates to break them up and let the people have an opportunity to win the wealth which lies therein. I shall, refrain from saying any more. I was desirous to speak at greater length, but I have been reminded that certain business has to be transacted to-day. I have very much pleasure in submitting the motion to the Senate. </para>

                    <para>.- In seconding the motion so admirably moved by my honorable friend,  I desire to set an example to honorable senators. I intend to be brief, because I think that on a motion of this kind a good deal too much time is spent in making speeches. One of the most' comprehensive and progressive policies which have yet been placed before the people of Australia is, I submit, embodied in  His  Excellency's speech, and I trust that honorable senators will devote their entire attention to placing upon the statute-book, as soon as possible, the various. measures foreshadowed therein. You, sir, have probably heard of the Persian philosopher who said, " Blessed are those who make short speeches, for they shall be invited again." Being a great supporter of that philosopher's belief, I intend to try to carry out his teachings. Quite recently one- of the biggest political struggles in the history of the- Commonwealth took place. From that struggle there emerged, as my 'honorable friend stated, a decisive majority .of members pledged to one definite policy. I can quite understand that our honorable friends on the other side will support the return to the two-party system. </para>

                        <para>- We claim that, inasmuch as the members of our party were elected on one policy, there is no such thing as a three-party system in the Senate to-day. A little while ago we had a fusion of two parties who were diametrically opposed, and the people of Australia have indicated what they think of that kind of procedure. At any rate, I feel sure that honorable senators opposite will help us to pass some of the legislation which is so much needed in Australia. I am pleased to note, sir, that it is proposed by the Government to carry the Financial Agreement into effect for ten years. The States are to receive 25s. per head of their population for that period, and the objectionable feature of the agreement - that is its insertion in the Constitution - will be entirely removed. The people have, I think, given a very decisive verdict on that subject. In Tasmania my colleagues and I had to fight the Financial Agreement to the death. It is therefore very satisfactory to me to be able to state to-day that it is not to go into the Constitution, and that this, the National Parliament, is not to be dictated to by six or seven State Premiers, who represent only a certain portion of the people of their States. I believe that, owing to the policy of the present Government, the cry of State rights will gradually diminish ; that under a Labour Administration we shall hear less of that often-voiced feature of elections, and it is a very objectionable feature too, and less of State members decrying the Australian Parliament, taking an interest in the Federal elections, stumping the country, and endeavouring, by every means in their power, to belittle that great Parliament. I hope that it will retain its supremacy, and that the decisive vote given on the 13th April against the Financial Agreement will result in enhanced prosperity for the Commonwealth. I desire to refer now to one of the most important items in the Governor-General's speech, and that is the proposal to tax the big estates, with a £5,000 exemption. Many of us fought our campaigns primarily on that great issue. As Cardinal Manning once expressed himself, in a letter to Earl Grey, we believe that there is a natural and divine law superior and anterior to any human or civil law, by which people have the right to the fruits of the soil upon which they were born, and in which they will be buried. </para>

                        <para>- Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof." We do not need to concern ourselves too much about future generations. We want to concern ourselves with practical politics ; and that I claim the Labour party can do, and is doing. We have high ideals. We have often been attacked by the other side in reference to our policy " in the clouds"; but I think that the policy enunciated in the Governor-General's speech is one which is eminently practical, one which is right down on the earth. I feel sure that that policy, if put into practical effect, will result in a much better condition of affairs for the whole of the people than that which now obtains.

But let me add that my State - the smallest State of the Commonwealth, the flower of the flock, so to speak, the State with the finest climate - has, perhaps, most to hope for from this policy. The sneer has been cast at us that we "go to sleep over there. But I think that on the 13th April we showed that we were not  so sleepy as we were supposed to be. My honorable friends opposite, at' any rate, will agree with me in that contention. </para>

                        <para>- Judging by the empty benches which I see opposite to me, I should say that they have. In Tasmania, 1,400 people own nine-tenths of the alienated land; that is to say, 1,400 people own nine acres out of every ten. We in Tasmania, therefore, certainly want to see the speedy imposition of a land tax. I hope, too, that the Commonwealth will make its own valuations. I believe that it will. It is absolutely necessary that it should. I contend that the Federal Government should have its own complete staff of valuators, because the land valuations at present are not at all accurate. They are not so high, in many instances, as they ought to be. Under our present system in. Tasmania, we penalize those landholders who are most industrious by taxing them at a greater rate than we tax those who do not improve their lands. The more a man does to improve -his land, the more the kind and beneficent State of Tasmania makes him pay. In Victoria much the same condition of things prevails. Even under that system the under-assessments are notorious. Many of our large estates are so valued that there is no chance of buying out the owners under the present assessments. Quite recently the Government of Tasmania decided to make revaluations. But that is not the point at present. The point for us is that the States of the Commonwealth have refused to tax land values adequately. They have had their opportunity. Year after year the party with which I have the honour to be associated has worked and battled in this cause. We have now been intrusted by the people of the Commonwealth with the duty of giving effect to it in definite legislative form. It is probably owing to the Legislative Councils in some instances that the States have refused to tax these enormous monopolies. </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid that the explanation is that there are too many large land-owners in the Legislative Councils. Those bodies were too conservative - perhaps that term best describes them. At all events, the States having refused to tax large estates adequately, the National Parliament is now going to do so. We are about to undertake the duty which the States have refused to take up. I believe, from the point of view of policy, that the land tax alone will be of such great benefit to the people of Australia that the members of the party to which I belong will still be in power in six years' time. </para>

I am very pleased to see on the Government programme a proposal to establish, for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, an' adequate Defence Force. We of the Labour party are not Jingoes. We do not go about wearing beautifully coloured neckties for the purpose of demonstrating our loyalty.  We are not continually crying " God save the King." We do not consider it necessary to do so. We can prove our loyalty in better and more practical ways. We believe in cultivating a national Australian sentiment, and we have set about our task in that direction in an eminently practicable manner by proposing to establish an Australian Army, which will be effective for the defence of our country. </para>

                        <para>- We, as I am reminded, were the first to do so. At present we have a force of 20,000 men. But our present system has been condemned by one of the highest military authorities- in the civilized world, namely, Field Marshal Lord Kitchener, as wholly inadequate for the defence of Australia. For an expenditure of double the amount of the present outlay, we hope to secure a Defence Force of considerably over 100,000 men instead of 20,000. We of the Labour party do not believe in war. We regard war as cruel, as brutal, as debasing, and as calculated to bring out the very worst instincts of mankind. But we do believe, as good Australians, in efficiently defending our shores and preserving our hearths and homes. I believe that the Bill for the defence of the country, when it comes before Parliament, will be seen to be an effective one. I hope that it will be brought into effect- speedily, so that a start may be made in training every able-bodied man in Australia, under the age of twenty-five, to take up arms in defence of his country if called upon. I should have been pleased, as a Tasmanian representative, had I seen in the Governor-General's Speech an allusion to a proposal to make a special grant to 'my own little State. I mention this matter without the slightest ' hesitation. Although I claim to be a Nationalist, yet I should have liked to see some step taken in that direction, because Tasmania is undoubtedly suffering severely. I do not intend to pursue the point at the present stage, but later on - at the proper time - I intend to say more about it. ' I trust that honorable senators on both sides of the chamber will make up their minds to devote themselves to public business. There seems to be an idea abroad - and rightly, too - that too much- time is spent in talking in our Australian Parliaments, and, indeed, in every other Parliament. </para>

                <para class="block">This measure is one providing for the granting out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of a sum for the services. of the Commonwealth for the year ending  30th  June,  191 1.  In submitting it, I desire to make a brief statement with respect to the financial position of the Commonwealth at the present time. We' are now asking for one month's Supply, amounting to  £.744.-33t-  Everything provided for in. the Bill is based upon last year's Estimates. "It will be remembered that the late Treasurer anticipated a deficiency at the end of the financial year of  £1,200,000.  I am pleased to say that, owing to the prosperity that has been shared in by almost all the ' people of Australia, the receipts from Customs and Excise have exceeded the estimate of the previous Treasurer by  £800,000.  Of that sum,  £200,000  was an increase in the share of the revenue that was to be participated in by the Commonwealth. &#62; I. may also state that the estimate of revenue by the previous Postmaster-General has ' likewise been exceeded by  £180,000.  I may also state that, from various causes, the actual expenditure has fallen short of the amount anticipated by a previous Treasurer by  £370,000.  Adding these sums together, it will be seen that they represent a total of  "£750,000.  Deducting that sum from the estimated deficiency of  ,£1,200,000,  there remains a deficiency of  £450,000.  Seeing that we are faced with a deficit of only ,£450,000, in lieu of an estimated  deficiency of £1,200,000, I think that everybody has reason for congratulation. So far as the administration of the present Government is concerned, I think we may be credited with having made an effort - and a successful effort - to enter upon the current financial year with that deficit without borrowing money from any quarter, either inside or outside the Commonwealth. That is all that I desire to say at the present juncture. I know that honorable senators are anxious to see this Bill carried .rapidly through all its stages. I may add that we hope, in the future, to afford them ample opportunity of discussing the Administration, and the proposals of. the Government on the various Bills and the Estimates which will be submitted for their consideration. </para>

                    <para>. - The figures which have been put forward by the Vice-President of the Executive Council - and for which, personally, I desire to thank him- seem to reveal a slight error, and I should like him, before the debate closes - if my view be correct - to rectify that error. I understood the honorable gentleman to say that there had been a reduction in the expenditure of £370,000, and an increase in the revenue to which the Commonwealth is entitled of £200,000, thus making the Commonwealth £570,000 better off than had been anticipated. </para>

                        <para>- I thank the Vice-President of the Executive Council for his explanation. I was under the impression that the total improvement in the revenue was covered by the £200,600. Under the circumstances, I think that the Government are entirely justified in asking honorable senators - even without affording them an opportunity of looking into the Bill - to pass it. We all know that, owing to circumstances arising out of the alteration effected in the date pf the general elections, it was - almost impossible for the Senate to meet before 1st July this year, otherwise we should have been confronted with a number of honorable senators who, although legally entitled to take their seats here, would not have been qualified to act on behalf of the electors. Consequently, the Government have done what was right. But I do not think that their action on the present occasion ought to be regarded as a precedent. What is being done now is being done by the grace of the Senate, owing to the peculiar circumstances in which the Government have been placed. I wish now to draw special attention to one item, namely, the Treasurer's advance. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has stated that, in this Bill, the Government merely ask for supply for the ordinary month's services. In making that statement, he was scarcely correct. The advance vote to the Treasurer contemplated under this Bill is larger than has ever been asked for previously. </para>

                        <para>- The Government are not asking - as is usually done - for an amount sufficient to cover the ordinary expenditure for one month. They are asking for a cheque for £250,000, to be expended as they may think fit. I would like the Vice-President of the Executive Council to give us some idea of the purposes for which this large amount is required during the present month. There must be some reason for it, and I invite him to state what the reason is for the information of the Senate. </para>

Honorable senators will recognise that within ' the last year or two we have embarked upon an entirely new policy. That policy has been indorsed, not only by the people of Australia, but also by the Imperial Government. I refer to the construction and maintenance of a naval force of our own. In giving effect to that policy, there has recently been laid in Great Britain the keel of an armoured cruiser for Australia-, and it is because of that fact we are now asking for a larger sum than usual on account of the Treasurer's advance. </para>

                        <para>- I was coming to that. Within the next few days, I understand - probably, by Monday or Tuesday - we shall require to pay an amount of £70,000. Before a second Supply Bill can be passed, it will be necessary to pro- vide for the payment in London of an additional £140,000. It is to enable the Treasurer to meet these obligations that we are asking for a sum of £250.000, by way of Treasurer's advance - an amount £50.000 in excess of that which has ever been asked for previously. Honorable senators know that in almost every Supply Bill introduced at the commencement of a session, a sum of money has been voted on account of the Treasurer's advance, and that sum has included provision for the whole year. Seeing that these large amounts will be required in connexion with naval construction, I have every reason to believe that the Senate will vote the sum which we seek. I would have made this statement at an earlier stage, but that in order to convenience public servants and honorable senators, I desired the measure to be put through all its stages as speedily as possible. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">-Colonel Sir ALBERT</inline>GOULD (New South Wales) [4.25].- I listened attentively to the explanation of the Vice-President of the Executive Council in regard to the large amount which it is proposed to vote by way of Treasurer's advance. It will be perfectly within the knowledge of honorable senators that Parliament has from time to time voted a sum of money under this heading for the purpose of meeting unforeseen expenditure. Indeed, the Treasurer's advance is strictly intended to meet unforeseen expenditure only - that is, expenditure which cannot be forecasted at the time the money is voted. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has told us that £70,000 out of the £250,000 which we are asked to grant to The Treasurer will be a progress payment towards the construction of a man-of-war to which the Commonwealth is committed. Personally, I think it would have been very much better had the Government included that item in the -schedule. </para>

                        <para>.- I am well aware of that. But I would point out that there still remain eleven months within which the Government can come down to Parliament and ask for an appropriation of £50,000 or £150,000 byway of Treasurer's advance. Whatever we may do in the matter of the expenditure of public money, we ought to do by a specific vote. I repeat that the Treasurer's advance vote should be used only to meet expenditure which cannot be forecasted at the time the grant is made. If a contract has been let for the building of an ironclad for Australia for .£2,000,000, there is no doubt that that contract contains ah indication of when the money needed in connexion with its payment will be required. That being so, the Government should have adopted the course of coming to Parliament and pointing out when its commitments would fall due. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">-Colonel Sir ALBERT</inline>GOULD. - By that means, we should exercise a better control over the finances of the country than can be exercised if we grant 'the Treasurer enormous sums of money, which may or may not be expended in the way we desire at a particular juncture. Of course, I am not imputing motives to the Government in regard to the expenditure of the £250,000 . which is proposed by way of Treasurer's advance. No doubt the statement of the Vice-President of the Executive Council that £70,000 will have to be paid for naval construction within a. few days, and within a little time, possibly, another , £70,000, is perfectly true. But why should not honorable senators know the purposes for which they are asked to vote this money? In the interests of good government,' Parliament should be permitted to exercise the fullest possible control over the finances. By placing such a large amount at the disposal of the Treasurer, opportunities are afforded to Governments to enter into' obligations to which Parliament might not care to see the country committed. This £250,000 may be expended in any way that the Ministry may think fit. For instance, they may enter into another contract, and pay £50,000 as an instalment upon it. The Parliament could not then turn its back upon the Government; and it becomes particularly the province of Parliament to be careful in such a matter when, as in the present case, the Government have a large majority behind them. The majority might be supporting the Ministry upon great matters of principle which they regard as vital to the welfare of the community, and they would not be likely to condemn them, even though they should disapprove of a vote of this kind, since they might regard it as a matter of small moment when compared with the importance of continuing in office a Government prepared to carry out' a certain general policy. </para>

It is right and proper that, in the circumstances, a Supply Bill should be introduced at this stage; but I have thought it well to direct attention to what I believe to be the initiation of a very dangerous precedent in the voting of money without adequate control by Parliament.
