<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 11 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That on the 10th December 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted and proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which declares that, 'Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration . . .' (Article 2) that 'Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives . . . The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or equivalent free voting procedures'. (Article 21 (1) and (3)).</PARA>
<PARA> Elections for Senators meet all requirements except one. Senators are elected periodically, by secret ballot, with universal franchise, and the quota- preferential method of proportional representation ensures that the vote values within States are equal as nearly as can be.</PARA>
<PARA> However the provision of the Electoral Act that compels voters to show preferences for ALL candidates on the ballot paper interferes with the free expression of the will of the voters, and is unjust.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia, as a Member State of the United Nations, is pledged to achieve observance of Human Rights and Freedoms.</PARA>
<PARA> We, the undersigned citizens of Australia, therefore humbly pray that the Senate will fulfil the pledge of a Member State of the United Nations and take steps to remove the compulsion from the Electoral Act in order to allow freedom of expression for everyone who has the right to vote for Senators.</PARA>

<TITLE>Plant Variety Rights</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth concern over Plant Variety Rights (PVR) legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> We agree that:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) PVR will aggravate the free exchange of genetic material for plant breeding .</PARA>
<PARA> (2) PVR will not enhance Australia's access to improved plant varieties developed overseas but will encourage the dumping of unsuitable varieties on the Australian market.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) PVR will restrict the public plant breeding program to basic research for exploitation by private enterprise and discourage breeding for disease and pest resistant varieties.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) PVR will lead to the domination of the seed industry by foreign interest not responsible to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The proprietary rights granted by PVR will encourage the introduction of seed distribution and marketing monopolies and lead to seed price increases.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that Parliament:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the last three or four months, I think, Mr Kennett's remarks have been the subject of much debate and, indeed, several questions in this place. On each occasion that I have risen to answer questions on the subject I have made the same kind of point as was made by the Treasurer in the remarks referred to by Senator Button in his question. It is pretty clear that there has been a substantial growth in the total amount of money for housing throughout Australia and in particular in Victoria. As Senator Button would acknowledge if he cared to look up the Hansard reports of previous discussions on the matter, the amount of increase compared with previous years is quite substantial. The exact figures are not in my mind, but I understand that the total amount of money made available for welfare housing last year throughout Australia was of the order of $660m. That was a growth, I think I am right in saying, of something like 15 per cent compared with the previous year. Taking all that into account, it is fairly hard to agree with the sorts of implications in the question from Senator Button. Of course, I support the remarks of the Treasurer in this matter. As to the general proposition in regard to Victoria, I would need to check out the information in Senator Button's question to ensure that he is on the right track.

On 17 January the Minister for Transport made a statement in which he set out some of the specific details. He said, as Senator MacGibbon indicated, that conditions had worsened in the last six months. He pointed out- I think he referred to demurrage alone-that these disputes would cost Australia an average of almost $1.5m a day. Of course, the disputes would cost much more than that in the loss of trade; they could damage trade semi-permanently. I think that there has not been a single day completely free of disputes affecting some sector of shipping. A great deal of congestion and a failure to load has come from the failure of particular governments to provide proper port , coal loading and other facilities. This has added to the congestion. The Government regards the picture of the shipping disputes as one of the most serious that can confront us.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister representing the Treasurer advise whether it is a fact that, generally, sales tax falls upon the final point of wholesale for non-exempt goods; that is, at the point where the goods are sold by the manufacturer or wholesaler to a retailer or the consumer? Will the Minister please define the exact meaning of 'point of wholesale'? Is it true that the component of freight between the manufacturer or the wholesaler and the retailer should legally attract sales tax only when the carrier of the goods is an agent of either the manufacturer or the wholesaler; that is, the wholesale price is increased by the amount of freight? Further, is it true that taxation officers frequently assess sales tax on components of freight which should not legally attract the tax and that officers are instructing retailers to apply sales tax as the last item on the invoice which, in effect, would mean that tax thus collected would include the tax on the retailer's mark-up and surcharges?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I recall a number of questions and comments that have been made on this subject. I think it could be said that in the generality of cases where goods are sold by wholesale-that is, a sale from a wholesaler to a retailer-the sale value upon which the tax is payable in respect of the sale is the amount for which the goods are sold. The amount for which the goods are sold is usually fixed by contract between the vendor and the purchaser . The question of whether charges for items such as freight, insurance, packing charges, engineering fees, et cetera, form part of the sale value of goods depends upon whether those charges are a constituent part of the price for which the goods are sold. If the sale of goods is ex-warehouse, freight charges may be the purchaser's responsibility and not part of the price. If the sale takes place upon delivery to the purchaser's premises, the delivery charges form part of the price.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sales tax is charged on the last wholesale sale, not on retail sales. In certain special circumstances the retailer may hold tax-free stocks so that where he sells the goods by retail he is required by law to charge tax on the fair market value of those goods if sold by wholesale. This means that tax is not payable on the retail mark-up or on any charges relating to the retail sale such as a delivery charge from the shop to the purchaser's home. Certain manufacturers do no discriminate between wholesale and retail sales so that the same price is charged for both. In such cases the wholesale and retail prices are the same and tax is correctly charged on the amount for which the goods are sold. Except in special circumstances just outlined, officers of the Australian Taxation Office would have no cause to give advice to retailers on how to charge sales tax. In fact, retailers are not required to-and generally do not-show sales tax as a separate item on invoices. The liability is with the manufacturers and wholesalers except in certain special situations touched on above.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Probably Senator Georges is a bit concerned because he does not get overtime for all of the hours he works in this place. I think the matter of taxing overtime falls broadly into the category that where income is taxable the operative rate is applied to that income. In some cases this may take a person into a higher tax rate. But I think in most cases the standard rate of tax is the one that applies to a great majority of taxpayers. I can understand what is suggested by Senator Townley. Perhaps it has been considered as a way of reaching people with an incentive for working overtime. I cannot say it is a matter currently receiving very active consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>

In August 1981 the Fraser Government decided to axe the existing Community Youth Support Scheme but because of public pressure was forced to retain CYSS in a watered down version. I ask: Why were most of the 80 recommendations of the CYSS Task Force ignored?

When will the Government begin giving the young unemployed some hope for the future?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I do not think much of what was said in the question is a statement of the position of the CYSS program. In the Budget of 1981 changes were proposed with regard to CYSS. I think it is now well known that the Government continued to fund the CYSS program until February, during which time the Government consulted with a wide variety of organisations and individuals. I think the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs will very shortly-perhaps even today-be making a statement on the continuation of the CYSS program. As I understand it, about 95 per cent of the CYSS projects will receive continued and, in many cases increased, funding. It is not a matter of severely reducing CYSS. It is a matter of having looked at the scheme and having established further or different guidelines under which projects may apply for funding. The great majority of those projects are expected to be continued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The last part of the question concerned the young unemployed. I think it should be said that there a number of training programs within the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs, the Department of Education and in other places that give opportunities for education, training and retraining for people who are seeking a wider range of employment opportunities. It was said at the time that we discussed the CYSS projects that these were perhaps a type of project that filled a gap not covered by other training programs. In linking the continuation of CYSS with the training, retraining and other educational opportunities given I think it could be said that a good deal of attention and support is being given to the young people who require training and opportunities for employment. Basically what I want to point out is that the whole basis of the question ignores these facts. Perhaps in the mind of the honourable senator there is some confusion with regard to just exactly what is being done.</PARA>

<PARA> Does the Minister agree that the persistent and serious nature of human rights abuses alleged in the report are in violation of basic human rights, contravening international human rights and the 1973 Pakistan Constitution? Have any representations yet been made to the Pakistan Government concerning the allegations made in the report? What assistance, civil or military, have the Australian people contributed to the Government of Pakistan during the last two years? In accordance with the Government's concern for human rights and in order to secure the effective protection of human rights in Pakistan, what action will be taken by the Government, including any reduction in assistance, in order to bring pressure to bear on the Pakistan Government?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Government is aware of the report that was recently issued by Amnesty International on human rights in Pakistan. We are aware also of the legal and other restraints on political activity within that country. On 18 February my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed the Government's concerns over these issues to the Pakistan Ambassador . Our embassy in Islamabad has also maintained contact with principal opposition figures in Pakistan. Australia provides economic assistance to Pakistan in the form of food aid projects and technical co-operation and training. The total value of this assistance in 1980-81 and this year is approximately $11.5m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Military contacts with Pakistan have been minimal. Two senior Pakistan Army officers were in Australia last year. One attended a staff course. Other than visits and training, no military assistance is provided to Pakistan. Australian naval ships occasionally call at Karachi in the course of routine independent deployments in the Indian Ocean. We are keenly aware also of the special difficulties which Pakistan is now facing as a result of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. We have supported Pakistan's attempts to find a lasting political settlement to the Afghan crisis. As a result of Soviet activities in Afghanistan , Pakistan has had to provide refuge to two and a quarter million displaced Afghan people. To ease this burden on Pakistan, in 1981-82 we provided food aid valued at $6.1m for the Afghan refugees in Pakistan. Australia looks forward to a return to a situation in which free political expression is permitted under a democratically elected government in Pakistan. We shall continue to encourage progress toward that goal, bearing in mind the special difficulties that Pakistan is now facing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I think we would all agree that there is great resentment in the Australian community against those who seek to avoid paying tax. I think there is additional resentment against blatant advertisements promoting tax avoidance schemes or seeking clients to engage in such schemes. As we have said on a number of occasions, the Treasurer has taken a number of steps that have minimised the evasion or avoidance of tax and we will continue to do this. I do not know whether the Treasurer has any particular attitude with regard to the advertisements which were placed recently by Mr Peter Clyne, but if he has any reaction or response to them I am sure that he will make the appropriate statements. However, I think all Australians would support whatever efforts the Government makes to minimise the avoidance or evasion of tax so that there is a fair sharing of this responsibility amongst the Australian people who are able to contribute towards the revenue of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; A number of those steps have taken the form of amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act. I think a number of steps are still to be dealt with in legislation. But the Treasurer has announced that from certain dates certain schemes would no longer be regarded as eligible for the taxation treatment for which they may have been designed by those who wish to perpetrate them. I am not in a position to give a catalogue of those schemes but I think those who have been in this place for some time would know that during the term of office of the Treasurer, John Howard, a number of amendments have been made and steps taken that have had the desired consequences. As I have said , he will continue to act in this way. I think a lot of people have been given fair warning that the schemes that do seem to emerge in a continual way are quite against the whole spirit of the Income Tax Assessment Act and its intention to raise revenue for the purposes of public expenditure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Over a period of two or three years my predecessor and I have had correspondence and representations from the Australian Federation of Travel Agents. I think both he and I have reported to that organisation that it is not appropriate for Federal Government travel to be undertaken in a way that may be within the scope of the representations that it has made to us. The most recent brochure that I have seen contains some statements that could not be substantiated. Perhaps it ought to be said that, to the extent that we could use group bookings or purchase the cheaper advance air fares, we do so. If a government department knew that it had a conference, that a number of members were attending that conference and that it was possible to use a group booking, there is nothing that precludes it from doing so. But the nature of government travel is such that it is not normally conducive to these arrangements. It is more likely that we would have either an individual officer or a small number of officers travelling at short notice to suit the needs of their own departmental work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think most people in this place would accept that there is no particular expertise required to make an air travel booking on a domestic airline in this country. The airlines handle this very satisfactorily. There is no particular service that the travel agents could offer to us that we are not able to undertake with our own resources. In most departmental cases it would not result in any diminution of staff required for the general purpose of departmental work . As far as government departments are concerned the present system is simple and efficient. Transferring in some cases to some new arrangement and using travel agents in a general way would not result in more efficient activity for the Government or a very wide cost saving. For this reason we directly book our travel. If it is possible to use group bookings and to get reduced fares, this is certainly not precluded. What has been said in the most recent brochure adds nothing to the debate that has been going on between the former Minister for Finance and me and perhaps other Ministers in recent years. I think direct bookings suit the needs of the Commonwealth Government at present.</PARA>

<PARA> Clearly the last six years has been a period of significant fall in the real income tax burden.</PARA>
<PARA>Higher unemployment, higher divorce, higher social security</PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment in Australia and world wide increased in the six years with the stagnant world economy. Despite migration, unemployment in Australia rose only marginally fron 5.0% to 5.4% in the six years to November 1981, an increase exacerbated by the higher benefits obtained by the employed population. An increase in single parent families and in divorce with their associated problems followed the passing of the Family Law Act in 1975, although the latter was considered a progressive step by many. The increased support given to the disadvantaged persons is indicated by the increase in the number of persons receiving government benefits (Excluding family allowance) from 1.6m to 2.6m in the six years to 1980, or from 263 per 1000 workers in 1974 to about 400 in 1980 .</PARA>
<PARA>Earlier retirement</PARA>
<PARA> The percentage of people in each age group in the workforce was higher in 1981 than in 1975 at all ages under 55 but significantly lower above 55, presumably due to earlier retirement.</PARA>

<PARA>Better health</PARA>
<PARA> In the five years 1974-1979 the expectation of life for both males and females increased by 2.4 years and the expectation of future life at age 60 rose 1.5 years. The infant mortality rate fell 34% in the six years 1974 to 1980. The number of doctors per 1000 persons in the population has risen about 25% in the six years 1974 to 1980.</PARA>
<PARA>More education and educational resources</PARA>
<PARA> The number of students enrolled at universities and colleges of advanced education was 22% higher in 1981 than six years earlier, although the population only grew by 8%.</PARA>
<PARA> The number of students per teacher of both primary and secondary schools was reduced by over 16% in the six years to 1974 to 1980.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. There was a trade deficit in January of $208m, the eighth successive monthly deficit. For the first seven months of 1981-82 the trade deficit totalled $1, 929m compared with a surplus of $133m in the corresponding period of 1980-81.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. With net invisibles of $490m the January deficit on current account was $ 698m. Capital inflow fell back to $291m and asset revaluations cost $100m so that overseas reserves fell $448m in the month to $3,912m, the lowest level sine October 1979.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Of the $4,007m 'portfolio investment and institutional loans' which came into Australia in 1981 only $327m or 8% was for corporate equities.</PARA>

<PARA> 5. It has been decided to close the Mary Kathleen uranium mine in which the Federal Government has a 41.6% interest costing $7m.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. In a series of announcements Australia's major mining companies have reported big profit falls brought about by lower prices, weak markets and strikes affecting production.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. The 302 exploratory oil wells to be sunk in 1982 are almost double the number and, at $848m, double the cost of the wells sunk in 1981. Two-thirds of the cost involves exploration in W.A. and Queensland. A further $1,573m is to be spent on developing oil and gas projects making a total expenditure of $2,421m.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics forecasts a fall in the value of rural exports in 1981-82 of $910m to $7,250m.</PARA>
<PARA> 9. Sales in Australia of major petroleum products have dropped to their lowest annual level since 1976.</PARA>
<PARA>10. Export prices overall remained unchanged in November 1981 and were at the same level as in November 1980.</PARA>
<PARA>11. The ratio of prices received to prices paid by farmers is expected to fall 7 1/2% in 1981-82 after falling 6% per cent in 1980-81.</PARA>
<PARA>12. In 1980-81 46% of exports were from agriculture, fishing and forestry, 28% from mining and 26% from manufacturing.</PARA>
<PARA>Miscellaneous Items</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The CPI rose a high 4.2% in the December 1981 quarter making the increase for the year 11.3% compared with 9.1% for the year to September 1981. The increase for the quarter would have been 2.9% instead of 4.2% if medical and hospital services had been excluded. CPI increases for other countries in the year to November 1981 include Japan 3.6%, Germany 6.6%, U.S.A. 9.6%, U.K. 12.0%, Canada 12.2%, France 14.3%, N.Z. 15.4%, Italy 18.6%, The OECD average at 10% was lower than Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Interest rates have risen steeply. A rise of 0.1% in government and semi- government rates have brought the 6 year Commonwealth bond rate to 15.1% 4-9 year semi-government to 15.6%, 10 years and over to 15.8% with corresponding private issues yielding 15.9% and 16.1%. Treasury notes jumped over 1% to an average 16.7% for 26 week notes and 16.1% for 13 week notes. Citicorp, CAGA, General Credits, AGC, Custom Credit and CBFC all offer a top debenture rate of 16%. UDC and Direct Acceptance offer 17%.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The interest rate beyond which stamp duty becomes payable on loans has been raised in N.S.W. from 17% to 17 3/4%.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The average mortgage approved by the N.S.W. Building Society equals 61.75% of the price compared with 74% two years ago.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. A study shows that 40% of people with skilled training in the metal trades had left to go to other occupations.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. The AMA claim that 900 doctors ''through gross abuse of the system'' were costing the community $100m per year. A Department of Health report claims 2,500 doctors should be investigated for possible fraud or over-servicing.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. The High Court has decided that in damages cases future income should be discounted at 3% p.a. to allow for growth of income with inflation, investment earnings on the lump sum and taxation.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. The all-ordinaries index fell to 532 on February 11, its lowest level for two years. The fall so far this year exceeds 10%. The metals and minerals index is nearly down to one half of its 1981 peak.</PARA>
<PARA> 9. The investment return on ordinary shares in the year to 30 September 1981 for funds in the IMS survey was minus 7.9%, after positive returns of 63.9% and 34.0% for the two previous years. The subsequent fall in stock exchange prices suggests that further negative returns must be expected.</PARA>
<PARA>10. In the general insurance field Prudential and Cornhill who recently merged are now to merge with Phoenix.</PARA>
<PARA>11. In 1981 only 83,000 new jobs were created compared with 170,000 in 1980; yet there was no significant change at the end each year in the number unemployed from the figure at the end of 1979. The reason is that only a net 25,000 left the workforce in 1980, whereas 143,000 left in 1981. This is a critical factor in unemployment changes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I am not aware of the incomplete auditing which was referred to by Senator Robertson. If internal auditing within departments is being curtailed the Minister concerned could draw attention of that matter to the Department of Finance or to me and the matter could be dealt with as one of the essential activities of government. If there is some particular problem in any specific department we would be glad to hear about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other comment concerned the more regular scrutinising of departmental expenditure. I think what has been said in more recent days is that, perhaps on a monthly basis, it would be appropriate to look at the levels of expenditure of the departments under the votes which have been appropriated for them. Whilst this is always done in the Department of Finance so that the monthly statement can be prepared, it may be that some further or more active discussion needs to be undertaken with departments to see that their spending rates enable them to stay within the appropriated amounts and not seek substantial funds in the Additional Estimates. As I said earlier, if some particular problem with regard to the internal audit or the Auditor-General's Department is drawn to the attention of the Department of Finance the matter could be reconciled. Where an essential activity is to be undertaken there is a mechanism by which consultation can ensure that there is no difficulty in adhering to that course.</PARA>

The Government is not denying the authentic right of industrial trade unions to strike over authentic industrial trade union matters. What the Government is opposing is the militant left wing extremist unions taking action on all sorts of pretexts for political reasons to disrupt this country. They are two totally different things . We are supporting the right of the people in Poland to strike. No legislation of the Fraser Government can be claimed to restrict the authentic right of a trade unionist to strike over authentic industrial matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been talk of union bashing. Let me remind the Opposition that in the last three Federal elections a majority of members of the trade union movement must have voted for the Fraser Government in order for it to hold office. Indeed , we can claim that we have a mandate from a majority of trade unionists to govern in their interests. The fact of the matter is that the ordinary, decent trade unionist in this country wants to stop being bashed about by political union leaders. We are trying to stop the bashing of trade unionists by their leaders and the bashing of the community.

It stated that the South Australian construction industry faces a drastic slump which could wipe $180m from its annual value within five years. I remind the Minister of the Press release of 25 September 1980 by the then Minister for Administrative Services in which he gave details of a $22m Commonwealth office development in Adelaide. The then Minister, who said that tenders would be called in September 1982, pointed out that the building would greatly improve the availability of Commonwealth services to the public in Adelaide and would provide economies through rental savings. The Minister said further that the development would provide a stimulus to the local construction industry. Given that Adelaide is the only State capital which does not have a recognised Commonwealth centre and the alleged parlous state of the building industry in South Australia at present, will the Government reconsider its Review of Commonwealth Functions decision to defer the building of the Adelaide Commonwealth offices for several years?</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not think it is fair to say that any downturn in the construction industry in South Australia is due to whether a particular Commonwealth building will be constructed. The construction of the building would not necessarily change the situation. The Government has taken significant steps in Adelaide to assist the construction industry with a number of major projects that are either under way or planned.

The new building will consolidate the offices of a number of Commonwealth departments in one place. A number of other projects are being considered subject to necessary approvals. I am advised also that there is at present an excess of office space in Adelaide. I am advised that Commonwealth departments are reasonably accommodated and that there is a surplus of office space in buildings such as Adelaide House, which is owned by the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund Investment Trust.

Even Senator Carrick has tried to cajole me by saying that honourable senators will not always be called on to ask a question in two days of sittings. There is something radically wrong with priorities when one has not asked a question since last Wednesday. Mr President, I sympathise with you because many laborious questions are asked, but it is not good enough. I doubt that any other honourable senator has gone for three days without being called on to ask a question. I am sure you will be able to give--</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McIntosh-I have.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Mulvihill-If Senator McIntosh is in the same situation there is justification for a new formula being drawn up for the asking of questions. Mr President, you might produce those statistics tomorrow. This might motivate the powers that be to improve the system. Previously honourable senators were called on to ask a question at least once in two days. There is something wrong if each of the 64 senators cannot ask a question at least once every third sitting day.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One must congratulate Senator Rae on a good try at forestalling this debate but I wish to make it perfectly clear that my matter of public importance refers to the standard of living of families and pensioners who are on low incomes. Anyone who reads Professor Pollard's article will realise that he makes it quite clear that he is not referring to just that group of people. In fact he is not referring to them at all; he never does in his articles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In one form or another this broad matter of public importance has been proposed for discussion on many occasions during the life of this Government. It is quite clear from the number of honourable senators who want to be on the speakers' list today that it is a matter which many people still consider to be of public importance. It is put forward today to bring to the attention of the Senate the Government's failure to maintain the standard of living of low income earners and pensioners and to highlight the fact that if we continue in the directions that we are the trend towards a declining standard of living for these people will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last 10 years or so there has been much discussion on future directions and where things have gone wrong in our treatment of welfare in this country. But in the meantime the number of people in poverty remains high and the relative position of certain groups, particularly low income earners and some pensioners, continues to fall. Many distinguished and learned people in the community are concerned about the situation. For instance, Professor Russell Mathews, a respected academic and government adviser, at the Summer School of the Australian Institute of Political Science on 30 January last, said in part:</PARA>
<PARA> I suggested that the Australian taxation and social welfare system, far from contributing to greater equality in the distribution of incomes and wealth, has become a major instrument for redistributing incomes from the poor to the rich and from wage and salary earner to other income recipients, as well as a major cause of the budgetary problems of all Australian governments and a source of growing social, business and economic instability. </PARA>
<PARA>It is this redistribution from poor to rich, from wage and salary earners, plus failure to maintain the real value of payments to those in need of government support and to adjust our economic and welfare systems to changing circumstances which has led, I suggest, to the present situation. If we add to this the uncertainty and insecurity in the minds of people on government income supplements and a feeling of lack of direction in policy, I believe we have a most unsatisfactory situation, a situation which should not apply in a country which has rich resources and riches potentially capable of supporting all its citizens in a satisfactory standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the basic reasons which leads to this state of affairs arises out of the ideological hangups of the present Government. It is the conservative philosophical approach which believes that public participation and expenditure is always bad and to be avoided at all costs and that private expenditure and participation is always good and needs to be stimulated and assisted at all costs; and that public subsidy to encourage private accumulation of wealth is considered good, but public assistance to maintain a basic standard of living is somehow considered bad. For more than five years we have had a series of policies which are in keeping with this philosophy. I suggest we may well ask where it has got us. For instance, the investment allowance has provided hundreds of millions of dollars to private industry with the aim allegedly of increasing growth and reducing unemployment. Yet unemployment has risen and growth is not considered satisfactory by anybody, even the Government, according to its own statements. </PARA>
<PARA> Tax cuts which have been given have directed income to high income earners and little or no income to low income earners. In 1978, honourable senators will remember, some $600m was directed to the upper 10 per cent of income earners. Kowtowing to supporters of a system of private health and in particular to the health insurance industry has led to a situation in which too many people can ill-afford access to health care or are forced to pay out too high a percentage of their income to gain access to health care through private health insurance funds. The running down of expenditure on housing has led to an expenditure in real terms this year which is one-third of what it was five years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Together with high costs and interest rates this has led to enormous pressure on an already overburdened public housing sector and has increased the need for shelter and emergency accommodation. This has been a matter of some debate in the senate and the subject of public inquiry by a committee of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time the Government has had an overall view that at all costs, as long as certain special groups are looked after, the best means of controlling our economic problems is not to adjust our taxation and welfare systems, not to make reforms but, alone and with a heavy hand, to control-that in the view of this Government is to reduce-public expenditure wherever possible. For instance, Professor Mathews said that policies had been directed almost wholly towards the control of government spending, when the real problem which had emerged was one of restoring control over government revenue. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The lack of distributional equity arising from the failure of the taxation and social welfare systems to operate as intended; the relatively heavy taxation burden imposed on wage and salary earners and the consequential inflationary pressures caused by compensatory wage claims; the chronic liquidity problems faced by business enterprises; the unnecessarily high interest rates associated with low levels of taxes and charges, with their adverse effects on home-buyers, business investors and government borrowers alike; the shortage of capital for development; the reckless running down of the already inadequate public sector capital stock; and the unnecessarily high levels of unemployment, especially among the young, induced by public sector expenditure constraints. </PARA>
<PARA>In his analysis of the situation he alerted us to the fact that there are many victims in our society of this narrow-minded and single-minded approach to public expenditure, this failure to recognise that there are spin-off effects in providing the disadvantaged and poor with adequate facilities to live decently. One may add that the cost of failing to assist or do something, both social and economic, about these groups frequently offsets the cost of providing basic support. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not need to go into details in this debate-time would not allow me to do so-about the fact that we as a country are not, by international comparisons, a generous country as far as welfare expenditure is concerned. The Treasurer, Mr Howard, has repeatedly pointed out in recent months that on the figures of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development only four countries, three of them poor by our standards-Greece, Portugal and Spain-have lower tax burdens than ours. Yet we still face the problem of the disadvantaged and how to handle them. We argue about gross expenditure rather than about the equitable distribution of wealth in this community. It is this inequitable distribution of wealth and the economic burden borne by the disadvantaged that is raised in this matter of public importance. I daresay that some people who follow me in this debate will use more statistical evidence than I but I will refer to some. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the standard rate of pensions and benefits the parameter which people on both sides of this House use to judge their level is the comparison of these payments with the average male weekly earnings. Since 1976, when automatic indexation to the consumer price index was introduced, the level of the standard rate of pension has fluctuated around 23 per cent of average weekly earnings, as Senator Chaney said in answer to a question the other day. At one stage, in 1978 , it was almost 24 per cent. But since early 1981 there has been a consistently downward trend. By June this year it is anticipated, by the research section of the Parliamentary Library and others, that it will be down to approximately 21.6 per cent of average weekly earnings. It is heading down to the level at which these pensions and benefits were in 1972 and at that time there was general acceptance in the community that the level was far too low. The married rate, at 36.8 per cent, is lower than it has been since March 1975. The single rate for unemployed beneficiaries is even lower. These people have not benefited from automatic indexation in recent years and, in fact are worse off. If we add to this the fact that the allowances for pensioners' children have not kept up with inflation and that all family allowances for the first and second children have not increased at all since their introduction-most people in the category referred to in this matter of public importance have only one or two children- then we have a clear picture in money terms of the increasing burden on low income families in the community. Food price increases have exceeded the consumer price index average and essential costs for these groups-costs that they cannot avoid-have increased. The Government actually intended to increase sales taxes on some essential items. All these things add up to the fact that we have a picture of seeming unconcern for this important group. </PARA>
<PARA> If we use the other parameter commonly used in debates, the updated poverty line as produced by the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty under Professor Henderson-I suggest that we have no other parameters to use; the Government's committee's attempt to come up with another guide of this type has not succeeded so we seem to be getting no nearer any other satisfactory line to judge than the poverty line-we find that in December 1981 families with more than one child and with a disposable income of $180 a week were below the poverty line. The more children people have, the further below the poverty line they get. Those with four children or more are more than $40 below the poverty line. In fact a family with four children needs a disposable income of $240 a week before the poverty line is barely reached. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House have brought up this fact repeatedly over the years. We have referred to the tables which are regularly produced by the Parliamentary Library, much to the distress of Senator Chaney and some of his officers. We have pointed out that there is a continual drop in the position of these people relative to the poverty line in this community. The poverty line is a useful parameter in judging the relative positions of people and we will persist in using it until we get a better one. </PARA>
<PARA> The single parent pensioners, as was found by Professor Henderson in his report , are particularly badly off. They are consistently below the poverty line. For single parent pensioners with more than one child, even an extra $20 a week income would not get them up to that line. I wish to table statistics produced by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library Statistics Group. I table them so that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), to whom I inadvertently have not shown them although he has seen them many times in the past, can peruse them . I do so in the hope that later on I will be able to incorporate them in Hansard even though I thought that Senator Carrick had set a new precedent and that we could incorporate material without having to do this sort of thing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. These figures do not tell the whole story, as, of course, no individual figures do. They do not take into account the cost and scarcity of private rental accommodation and the increasing desperation of people trying to find public accommodation. They do not demonstrate the absolute impossibility of most parents getting the sort of assistance that many of us expect our children to get. For instance, one can think of orthodontic care. They do not demonstrate at all the difficulties and the harassment that people face in using inadequate public transport to get care when it is needed, the unavailability of child care and the unavoidable costs of education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I repeat that the position of these people relative to the poverty line has diminished and they deserve better. If the Government persists in giving maximum encouragement to those patently not in need and paying for it by depriving those in need; if it persists in the view that the poor have always had to accept more than their share of the economic burden and prevents them from getting out of their poverty by failing to increase their allowable income levels or their fringe benefits cut off points-as the Government does, and I am sure other people will talk about this; if it modifies the means test to favour those with large assets, holdings or cash holdings as against those with small, fixed incomes, as it did in 1976; and if it then procrastinates in correcting the anomaly, for fear of offending vested interests, by announcing, as it did in the last Budget, firm proposals to do this by 1 November, throws away suggested levels of what would be adequate income to be left in fixed deposits of $2,000 or $3,000, and then finds in November that it is not ready-in answer to a question asked by Senator Giles today it was suggested that it is not ready now and may not be ready in this session; if it leaves people in that sort of uncertainty and leaves that anomaly in existence then I suggest that it is not doing the right thing by the groups to which I referred in the original matter of public importance. </PARA>
<PARA> It is accepted by the Government and the Minister that there are in the vicinity of one million people living in poverty in this country. It is sad to realise that the same groups identified by Professor Henderson and his colleagues as people in poverty in the early 1970s are the same groups that feature there now. Of course, one group is the Aborigines for whom one makes a special case, but the other groups are the fatherless families, the families with an unemployed breadwinner, large families and particularly the single aged. The only group which has improved relative to the poverty line since then is made up of the large intact families, and the position of that group has not improved in line with increases in the cost of living. It has improved only because of the changes made initally to the family allowances scheme. But worse, if we condemn the poor for their poverty, as some members of the Government have done in recent weeks, if we cast doubts on their worthiness to assistance in the manner of nineteenth century advocates of the political economy, we will indeed soon have a society which is more divided on itself than it is now. </PARA>
<PARA> I am suggesting that while we talk about it and discuss it and while the Government is trying to make up its mind how on earth it gets a decent welfare system within the ideological guidelines within which it finds itself, this Parliament and this Senate should at least insist that we maintain the real income of the groups concerned. These include in particular the pensioners and the low income families and those who have to bear the costs of parenthood in times of high inflation. The disabled and the disadvantaged will be able to get out of their disabilities through the provision of income and services at a reasonable level. We need reform and we need debate, but in the meantime we cannot neglect these groups patently in need. To improve our system, it needs reform, redistribution and more imaginative and just methods, but we need more than just public expenditure restraints of the types talked about by Professor Mathews applied in a discriminatory manner. In fact, we need to use the system that we have now to correct the anomalies that are so obvious to us all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome debates in the Senate or elsewhere on means of improving the social security and social welfare system of Australia. Unfortunately, the debates which have taken place in the Senate since I took this portfolio-there have not been many of them -have tended to be fairly light on in terms of suggestions as to how the system might be improved. I regret that, because I would not wish to be in a position of denying that the system could be improved. There is a continuous search, both in the Government and in the Department that I head, for methods of improving the operation of the social security system. I think it would be helpful if those honourable senators who contributed to these debates were as specific as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is room for concern when we realise that there is a view that there are substantial numbers of Australians who live at a standard which is unacceptably low. The statistics show that over the very brief period from 1971-72 through to 1981-82 expenditure under the heading 'Social Security and Welfare' has increased in money terms from $1,597m to $11,357m. I do not have an immediate conversion of that figure in real terms, but I think that it is of the order of an increase of 150 per cent. In other words, social security and welfare expenditure in Australia over that period has increased to a level where it is two and a half times as high as it was 10 years ago. Yet we still have complaints that the system is not delivering the goods in a way which is adequate and satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there are two levels at which the argument can be conducted. Members of the Opposition can come before the Parliament and say that expenditure should be substantially increased, that more money ought to be raised from taxpayers to remove the inadequacies of the system. Alternatively they can say that the system is spending the money in the wrong place and the money should be redirected. Either contribution is a valid approach to the problem. If members of the Opposition are seeking redirection, again I invite them to be quite specific in their suggestions as to how this might be done, from which areas of social security and welfare expenditure it might be taken in order to do a better job in the areas where they say that there are deficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> It ought to be common ground that it is not a matter of being locked into economic theories; it is a matter of being locked into the reality that money spent has to be raised. Whilst it is possible for Senator Grimes, as a shadow Minister, to skate over that essential fact, it is not something which the members of the Australian Labor Party were able to do in government once the reality of government had seized itself upon them, and it is not something that they were prepared to do when they went before the people in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the essential factors that has to be taken into account in determining what can be done in the welfare area, as in other areas, is what the economy can pay and what the taxpayers can afford. It is instructive to look at some of the comments of the now Leader of the Labor Party, Mr Hayden, in August 1975 when he brought down the last Labor Budget. He referred to a whole series of economic issues which have to concern us as a government and which do, to some extent, restrict our freedom of movement. I shall quote a couple of passages from that Budget Speech because I think they help us to understand that this is not a matter of being doctrinaire; it is a matter of facing up to reality. Mr Hayden said:</PARA>
<PARA> If wages and salaries continue to outstrip productivity increases, the productive capacity of the economy will decline and we shall all eventually be worse off. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a statement which could just as easily have come from Mr Howard. It is a statement of considerable validity. It is a statement of importance today. Mr Hayden also said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to provide more and more government services or transfer payments from the Budget without ultimately having to pay for them through cutting back after-tax earnings via increased taxes. It is not possible to get quarts out of pint pots. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, I suggest that is an unexceptionable statement of the practical difficulty which faces all governments. Words which struck a responsive chord for me were made in that same Budget Speech when Mr Hayden said:</PARA>
<PARA> Many articulate groups in the community champion their favourite causes and I know that we will soon be hearing from them. I hope that, when we do hear, they will help the Government and me by indicating what alternative expenditure cuts might have been made or what tax increases they would be willing to bear. </PARA>
<PARA>I issue that invitation to the Opposition. I invite members of the Opposition to tell me what increased taxes they think we should impose. I invite them to tell us what benefits should be reduced to enable us to make the changes that they advocate. Finally, with respect to this aspect of the matter, I refer to what Mr Hayden had to say in his policy speech when he went before the people in 1980. Referring to the question of welfare, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in these six broad areas of family programmes, is a policy we announced last May to give higher family allowances to those families who need them most. Family allowances have not increased for more than four years. They are now worth almost half their value when the scheme was introduced in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then inflation has gone up well over 40 per cent, while taxes increased more than 90 per cent. Given the cost of our other programmes, we cannot responsibly propose a general increase in family allowances. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not put that up in a spirit of criticism; I say that that is a simple acknowledgement of the reality within which we all live. That is a problem which is faced by any government in determining what can be done, whether it is for families or for any other group. I will read some more quotations from the policy speech of Mr Hayden. He seems to have said a number of things in relation to this area, of which I heartily approve. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I now want to say something about general welfare programmes. What we can do immediately in the welfare area is enormously restricted by the extent of our other programmes, and what we can responsibly spend. </PARA>
<PARA>I say amen to that. There was some confusion in the view that was put forward by Senator Grimes. At the end of his speech he talked about the importance of maintaining the real income of groups about whom we are concerned. One of the major initiatives of this Government has been to ensure that for very significant groups and, in particular, pensioners real incomes have been protected. Senator Grimes, in the early part of his speech, concentrated on comparative incomes; that is, compared pensions with average weekly earnings. I will seek leave to incorporate a table showing those figures over the relevant period. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the real income as against the comparative income of pensioners, one of the most significant steps taken is to ensure that by the twice-yearly indexation of pensions the real income of pensioners is maintained. Of course, it is true that in a period in which wages increased by an amount in excess of the consumer price index pensioners will see their relative position deteriorate . That is a simple matter of arithmetic. As they see their comparative position deteriorate they will find that difficult to bear and, indeed, that will give rise to a feeling of hardship and, in some cases, to a reality of hardship as prices increase. But I stress the commitment of the Government to maintaining the real income of pensioners at very considerable cost; at a doubling of the cost of assistance to the aged since we came to office, a doubling in money terms. That is a firm commitment of the Government which is aimed at the problem Senator Grimes brought forward today. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate in these matters is, of course, brief but I want to touch quickly on the importance of the maintenance of a healthy economy and the control of inflation if we are to do the right thing by the groups that are the subject of this matter of public importance. The fact is that the general welfare of the Australian community is dependent not upon the social security system but upon the maintenance of employment and a healthy and growing economy. Indeed, our ability to provide a proper level of social security support for those Australians outside that economic system-through age, invalidity or whatever-is directly related to our ability to maintain a healthy and growing economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I make no apology for saying that it is a very high priority of the present Government to restrain inflation for both social and economic reasons and to ensure that we, as best as possible, maintain employment and a growing economy. Those priorities are directly related to welfare and are not in conflict with the ideal of welfare. I think the quotation I gave from Mr Hayden's Budget Speech in 1975 and his attitude prior to the 1980 elections give further support to that view. </PARA>
<PARA> There was debate in this place during Question Time today-although debate is not supposed to happen in Question Time-over the success of some of those Government policies. Let me quickly touch upon some of the achievements of the Government which are directly relevant to the welfare of virtually every Australian. It is surely an accepted fact that in the mid-1970s under the Labor Government we had a rate of inflation which was far in excess of those of our trading partners and which was extremely worrying. In 1975 it was getting up to 15 per cent and there was concern about that among many supporters of the Australian Labor Party. It was cut back to 8.8 per cent in the last financial year. It has, in recent years, been well below the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development average, and one of the key points is that our rate of inflation has been lower than that of our major trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some upsurge in inflation over the last few months, and in the December quarter there was a high figure of 4.2 per cent. That took into account some Government decisions-the indirect tax decisions and so on and the new health arrangements. They added to that figure, but adjusted for that the rate for 1981 as a whole was 9.5 per cent, which again is below the OECD average. In the context of that surge of inflation at the end of last year, the pensioner and beneficiary population is in the main protected by the the operation of indexation. The fight against indexation is delicately balanced and it would be disastrous if at this stage we injected vast amounts of Federal money into the economy. We have no intention of behaving as the Labor Government did in 1975, with the greatest good will in the world at that time I have little doubt, but with such disastrous economic and social effects. We have no intention of repeating the mistakes of those years. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of what general economic effect our policies have had, the fact is that we have had real growth in the non-farm gross domestic product for the last couple of years. In 1979-80 it was 2.6 per cent. It was 4 per cent in 1980-81, and is predicted to be 3.25 per cent this year. This is far higher than in almost any comparable country and is a measure of the real production of wealth in this country and, hence, of our ability to do other things. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have time to speak at any length on the economy but I refer to the creation of 375,000 new jobs over the last three years, the fact that unemployment for most of 1981 was under 6 per cent and on a monthly basis the figure was below the figure for each corresponding month of 1980. I refer to the fact that in such key areas for the health, prosperity and safety of this country, such as mineral and petroleum exploration, we had a buoyant and successful period as against the disastrous situation that applied when we came to government. The position therefore is that in a difficult world and in a world of considerable uncertainty this Government has been able to maintain a very steady course for Australia. Australia has had a period of growth and increased real earnings-a period therefore when the general welfare of the community has been protected. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the measures taken to try to assist those who are not often able to assist themselves and who require the assistance of their fellow citizens for their protection. I have already referred to the innovation of automatic twice- yearly indexation of most pensions and benefits. That is a major and costly reform which provides basic protection to the value of most pensions and benefits. I refer to the increase in supplementary assistance in the recent Budget. This is the sort of area which ought to be explored by the Opposition if it is concerned to isolate those groups in the community who need additional assistance. The advice to the Government has been that the pensioner paying a high private rent is the pensioner who is likely to be in need of assistance, hence the increase in supplementary or rent assistance which was provided for in the last Budget, and hence the redirection of that assistance in favour of those pensioners who are paying high private rents. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is by that sort of measure that we can do something to chip away at the areas of hardship which exist in the Australian community, and I invite specific suggestions of that nature from the Opposition. I refer to increases in mothers and guardians allowances, the 1980-81 rise from $4 to $6 a week, the extension of Commonwealth support for sole parents to lone fathers in 1977 and, of course, the general assumption of responsibility by the Commonwealth for sole parents in 1979. In the context of the general assistance which is given to pensioners, I seek leave now to incorporate in Hansard a table which was prepared not by the Parliamentary Library but by my Department. This table shows the figures from December 1971 to December 1981, the rates of the standard pension and the married rate, and compares them with average weekly earnings. It also gives them as a percentage of average weekly earnings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall refer to that table briefly. It shows that the highest point the single pension reached under the Labor Government was 23.3 per cent of average weekly earnings. The figure then, according to the changes to the pension and variations in average weekly earnings, went to a peak of 23.8 per cent and 23.9 per cent during 1977 and 1978 and then began to drop. The last figure shown on the table is 22.6 per cent for June 1981. With the wage explosion, the drift is against pensions as a percentage of average weekly earnings. Again, that is something which trade unions which are seeking wage increases above and beyond increases in both productivity and the cost of living might bear in mind when they are putting those claims forward. They are not claims which provide any sort of support or assistance to the less advantaged people in our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main area of concern raised in this matter of public importance is with respect to assistance to families. Of course, we inherited from the past, including the Labor past, a system which provided more assistance to the better off in our community than to those with less. The reason for that, of course, was that the system of assistance to families which had applied for many years combined relatively small payments to families with respect to children with a system of tax deductions. This was succeeded in 1975, I think, by a system of a tax rebates introduced by Mr Hayden. The fact is that the major change was made in 1976 by the Fraser Government with the introduction of family allowances. Those allowances had the great virtue of providing the same level of assistance to all families with children whatever the income. In other words, one moved from a regressive form of assistance to one which was providing equal assistance to the low income family. Of course, that was of major benefit to low income families. It is true, of course, that apart from adjustments of 50 per cent made in the Budget last year, for third and subsequent children in a family there have not been adjustments. Hence, the real value of assistance to families through the family allowance has been reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact also that if one looks at the position from March 1976 to March 1982 one sees that low income families with two or more children have in fact, improved their position. It is only in the case of the minimum wage earner with one child that one finds a percentage decrease in the amount of assistance provided in a period when there was an estimated movement in the consumer price index of 78.5 per cent. Again I do not have time to go through the table in full . I seek to incorporate in Hansard a table showing assistance for children in low income families in March 1976 and March 1982. It shows the minimum wage earner, the married pensioner/beneficiary and the widow pensioner or supporting parent beneficiary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance which has been accepted by the Senate for debate mentions the maintenance of standards of living for families and pensioners on low incomes. In fact, the text of the matter of public importance which is being debated states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Government to maintain the standard of living of families and pensioners on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA>As I listened to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) I heard of a number of areas where he has admitted that the Government is not maintaining the standard of living of some families and some pensioners on low incomes. I point out that we are debating not only a matter in the area of social security but also a number of the policies of the Government. Certainly, social security has a major impact in this area. But there are a number of other policies too where the Government is taking steps which are causing the standard of living in these areas to decline. I will outline some of these shortly. As I was listening to the Minister for Social Security I was reminded that it was perhaps once possible to call Australia the lucky country, and for certain fortunate people it still is. But more and more Australians, however, are regarding the lucky country label as nothing but a myth. I will outline shortly how some of the living standards are declining. It is absolutely shameful to see that this is happening. It is happening because of not only social security problems but also some tired and failed economic policies of the Government. It is made even worse by the lack of appropriate remedial action in the welfare area. </PARA>
<PARA> One of Australia's major social problems receives little attention. I refer especially to the poverty in our midst. Perhaps too many look the other way and prefer to think that poverty does not exist; but it really does exist in our community. It would probably be revealing to determine when each honourable senator last visited a soup kitchen to talk to the people who have to go there for a meal or when honourable senators last went to visit people who were using accommodation for the homeless, and talked to them about their problems. It is very easy to overlook the poverty in our midst, but it is certainly there. It is difficult, of course, to obtain a precise measure of what the level of poverty is in Australia. I was listening to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Grimes, who mentioned that there are probably a million people in Australia who are in poverty. But what could be called an independent body has calculated that our poverty level is at an even more alarmingly high rate. The Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace reported that almost two million people in Australia live in severe poverty and that they are worse off than poor people in many other developed countries. In most cases these two million people , such as aged pensioners, unemployed persons, Aborigines, recently arrived migrants and single parent families, are on social security benefits. It is hard to reconcile figures on poverty like two million or even one million, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, in view of the wealth and the natural resources that we have in Australia. In fact, poor Australians face particular hardships because they are experiencing poverty in a seemingly wealthy society which tends to deny the presence of extreme poverty in its midst. </PARA>
<PARA> Low income families in Australia are facing even further difficulties. I mention some of the difficulties that they are facing which are not necessarily pertinent to the social security area. I talk of galloping interest rates, rising inflation and the increased costs of housing and of health. In addition to that we now have Government attempts to victimise further the poor with new and increased indirect taxes which hit hardest at those who are least able to afford them. Fortunately, it looks like some of the Government's latest assaults on the poor by way of sales taxes will not succeed. But when one sees these increases being brought in or proposed one wonders whether there is any real care from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I will examine some of these factors that I mention. First, I talk of interest rates. Interest rates have skyrocketed recently and even the Government admits that they will continue to do so-so much for election promises that interest rates would fall and so much for the hopes and aspirations of low income families which once dreamt of owning their own homes. Inflation was mentioned by the previous speaker, Senator Chaney. He said that there had been a surge in the rate of inflation in the recent quarter. Well, whether or not there has been a surge, inflation is at an all time high for this Government after six years of a Fraser economic blueprint which was supposed to bring inflation under control. Policies in relation to inflation have been pursued at the expense of employment opportunities and economic expansion. But there has been no halt to the inflationary spiral which further erodes the standards of living for low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned the cost of housing. The cost of housing at present is at record levels. The dream of home ownership was probably abandoned long ago by low income earners, but now even rents are becoming an impossible burden to many people because of the cost of housing. I will mention supplementary assistance later in relation to this area. I refer also to the cost of health. I can well remember how in the 1975 election campaign the current Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) trumpeted that Medibank would be retained. Since then the health policies of the Government have been chaotic and confusing. About the only thing that is clear is that health care costs more. These problems which I have mentioned are significant for low income earners; they are significant for pensioners. But for a while I will concentrate on particular problems of pensioners, and this is certainly in the area of social security. </PARA>
<PARA> I was fascinated to read shortly before Parliament resumed that the Minister for Social Security made comments in Sydney that pensioners were better off than they were 10 years ago. I was not surprised-although I must admit that I was not too happy about it-that the Minister was hissed and booed by outraged pensioners for the implication that his Government had improved the standard of living of pensioners. A careful examination of pension payments over the past 10 years clearly indicates that increases have occurred in the real level of pensions. However, the rise occurred during the term of the Whitlam Labor Government. During that period pension increases of a real nature occurred. From 1972 to 1975 the real value of single and married rate pensions increased-the single pension by 29 per cent and the married rate pension by 24 per cent. Since 1975, however, when the Fraser Government came into power, the real value of single and married rate pensions has remained static. Certainly, pensions have increased in line with the consumer price index increases but they have remained static in real values. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Grimes, and I think Senator Chaney, pointed out, in terms of average weekly earnings the pension rate has recently been falling dramatically. I do not consider that it is satisfactory to be able to say that the real value of pensions has remained static, that pensions have been kept in line with increases in the consumer price index, if they have not increased in some respects in line with average weekly earnings. This indicates that if there has been an increase in prosperity in the community which has allowed average weekly earnings to increase, and if pensions have not been kept in line with that increase, the pensioners are not sharing in that prosperity increase. The Minister indicated that prosperity increases had occurred in the economy by pointing to increases in non-farm product. He mentioned that there had been increases in which wage earners in the community had been able to share but that the pensioners had not been able to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only were the pensioners disgusted at the Minister's twisting of the facts at the Sydney Town Hall-I refer to his suggesting that increases had occurred over the last 10 years when real increases had occurred over only three years- but also one of the Minister's Liberal predecessors claimed that the Minister's statements were 'misguided and misleading'. Mr Bill Wentworth was quoted as accusing the Government of trying to divide the community by putting the aged against the taxpayers. He said that the real problem was that it had made 'one hell of a mess of the economy'. The victims of the mismanagement, of course, are the pensioners and the other low income earners.</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make some comments about what I have recently heard referred to as ' granny' bonds. I do not particularly like the word 'granny' because these sorts of bonds could probably be used by other than grannies. I have commented in this place on a number of occasions that perhaps we should be considering the introduction of something which I call inflation adjusted bonds-bonds that are available for pensioners or retired people and perhaps even for young people who want to save their funds. I mention this matter because one of the problems that pensioners bring forward quite often is that of the maximum income they may have before they lose some of their pension. If they were allowed to have something like inflation adjusted bonds and if the interest on these bonds were kept at a fairly low level but the amount of principal that they had in the bonds were raised in line with consumer price index increases, they might be able to get around this problem. The allowable income is $20 for a single pensioner and $35 for a married pensioner. If pensioners exceed their allowable income they lose some of their pension. </PARA>
<PARA> When supplementary assistance changes were made recently I mentioned that anybody who had an income of even $1 a week would lose some of his or her supplementary assistance. I shall indicate how this system is now working. Last week I was contacted by a very angry young woman. She was protesting on behalf of her mother, who is receiving a widow's pension. The pensioner maintains a bank account simply to have her pension paid into it, drawing the pension out a day or so after it is paid in. She was astounded recently to discover that on the basis of her convenience account she was deemed by the Department of Social Security to be earning 15c a fortnight bank interest. As a consequence she has now received a letter from the Department of Social Security stating that her supplementary assistance will be reduced by 10c a fortnight. Of course, 10c a fornight is not much but it is the principle of the thing that is important. This incident serves as an example of the depths of disgraceful pettiness to which the Government will stoop in its dealings with pensioners and low income earners. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are considering a matter of public importance in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Government to maintain the standard of living of families and pensioners of low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA>One immediately would like to ask: 'How low is a low income?' I have not yet met a pensioner out painting the town red. I assure the Minister that I am not in the habit of painting the town red, but that is not why I have not met a pensioner who is doing so. Nor have I seen parents of families with a number of children doing such a deed. It is a question, of course, of those people being under real pressure. One thinks in particular of those pensioners who do not own their own home but live in rented accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> A good deal has been said about pensioners thus far during the debate and I think it would be wise for the Government to take these matters on board. But I wish to address myself to what I see as a slide and a decline in the standards of all families within Australia. Although I say 'all families', affected to a greater degree are those on very low incomes, particularly pensioners. I consider that we have reached a stage where it can truly be said that the Australian family is under threat. Consider the obstacles that our society places in the path of an ordinary couple seeking to pursue their ideal of a family, which, after all is the basic institution of our society. Honourable senators should forget for a moment the devastating effect of a number of other policies and influences, including amendments to the Family Law Act and deviant- type views on marriage by the pushers of drugs and pornography, because the matter of public importance with which we are dealing is concerned with the failure to maintain the standard of living of families. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the less obvious, but nevertheless subtle and significant obstacles of an economic character relevant to this matter: The dismal prospects of a newly-wedded couple obtaining suitable accommodation; the inability of many one-income families to meet mortgage repayments; the economic pressure to postpone having children; the struggle to maintain living standards in the face of inflation; dwindling employment opportunities for school leavers; lack of support for the family in times of sickness, crisis and old age. Statistical details are not available as to how many families are coping with the sum total of those obstacles and how many families are pushed into a second choice position and into second-best solutions. However, I draw the attention of honourable senators to certain features of contemporary society, including some statistics, which will illustrate that it is becoming harder for families to achieve their desirable objects in the face of those obstacles. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take the deposit gap as an example. It has increased dramatically. The average mortgage required in Sydney is now $53,000. In Canberra it is $35,000. Just after World War II a one-income family in Sydney on average weekly earnings was paying about 17 per cent of its income in mortgage repayments for an average loan on an average house. Today, assuming that it could raise the loan and/or that it already owned the block of land, the interest payments would eat up twice the proportion of income. Naturally, such couples are not in the race. They cannot afford the loans and they cannot afford the land. In the past six years the consumer price index has risen by around 80 per cent. While the net income of an average family has gone up by 86 per cent, net tax paid by that family has risen by 156 per cent. I am not dealing here with the increase in health costs. Because of the rise in the consumer price index, the real value of family allowances-despite the January increases-has fallen by 21 per cent for a family with four children. As a proportion of household disposable income, household debt outstanding has risen from 23.8 per cent in 1960 to 43.4 per cent in 1980. In other words, to survive Australian families are putting themselves into hock. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of these and other factors some very disturbing trends have emerged and they require the reflection of the government and ourselves, the Parliament. The quarter of an hour that is at my disposal does not permit me to detail and to enumerate all of those disturbing trends, but I will refer to one or two of them . The other day we heard some faceless member of the back bench-highly criticised by his colleagues, I understand-make the ludicrous statement: 'Why should anybody have children and expect the man next door to pay for them?' One of the disturbing features of the trend I have mentioned is that the number of births has fallen from a record 276,362 in 1971 to 225,530 in 1980. If the trend continues there will not be enough children to pay the fat pension of that particular member of Parliament when he retires. We have to be aware of that trend. The pressure is coming not only from government policies but also from lending institutions. Last year a national newspaper found that finance companies were favouring married couples where the woman was prepared to be sterilised. If present trends continue, it has been estimated that Australia will soon have the highest proportion of sterilised couples in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> As a reflection of the reduced value of a single income, the proportion of married women in the paid work force has risen from 29 per cent in 1966 to 43 per cent in 1980. I agree with Senator Colston: The situation can be attributed directly not only to the support and welfare policies of this Government, but also to the policies of successive governments which have also caused some of these problems. I refer the Senate to the 1978 report entitled 'Families and Social Services in Australia' which spelt out some eminently reasonable housing objectives for families. Of course, I await the results of the 1981 census to see how these objectives are being met. The report described current community values concerning family dwellings as including: Each family to have a separate dwelling if it so wishes; children other than infants to have a bedroom separate from their parents; children of different sex not to have to share a bedroom; an individual bedroom for each adolescent and adult child; and playing space for children. They are not unreasonable objectives, but I ask honourable senators: How many families are able to achieve those objectives in view of the factors that I have enumerated? They cannot even get to first base. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to other aspects of the problem. Late last year a survey conducted in Western Australia revealed that many couples prefer to cut their food bill and put off having a family rather than give up owning their own home. Of course , this shows up in statistics whichever way we look at them. In 1968 the median duration of marriage at first confinement was 17.5 months; in 1974 it was two years; and in 1980 it was 29 months. Looked at in another way, of all the first confinements to married couples, the proportion of couples having their first child after five years of marriage rose from 10.9 per cent in 1975 to 18.1 per cent in 1980. These trends have occurred despite the fact that the latest perinatal figures released earlier this month reaffirmed that the lowest perinatal death rate is in the 25 to 29 years age bracket. Clearly, the two most significant factors restricting couples to a second choice situation are family income and housing. </PARA>
<PARA> According to Mr Russell Prowse, the former general manager of the Bank of New South Wales, the number of jobs available has grown by 35 per cent over the last 15 years while the population has grown by only 29 per cent. But in that same period three-quarters of a million married women have entered the paid work force and a great many of those are forced to do so through economic circumstances, government policy and otherwise. Family income is a major factor behind this increase in the proportion of married women in the work force. This has been confirmed by a number of surveys, including the most recent one done by a lecturer at the School of Economics at La Trobe University, commissioned by the Federated Clerks Union and published only this month. The survey reveals that 52.3 per cent of those surveyed indicated that they would withdraw from the paid work force if suitable financial support for families was forthcoming from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned on a number of occasions, this issue raises deep questions not only of social justice but also of basic equality. Moves for increased family support are often painted as attempts to force women back into the kitchen. Nothing could be further from the truth. The right of women, whether married or not, to enter the paid work force is not ever in question. The principle is that no family should be forced to have both spouses in the paid work force because of the inadequacy of one income. All indications are that if families were given a true freedom of choice, many married women would happily leave the paid work force. One result would be more jobs in the paid work force for those people currently unemployed and in receipt of unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue is whether, in a period of high unemployment, governments should continue policies which force people to stay in the paid work force who have good reasons to be out of the very jobs which could be taken by the unemployed. I do not say that the current Government is solely to blame, but I ask it to look at the slide which has been shown in statistics over the last five or 10 years and to agree with me that action needs to be taken to stop that slide so that the threat to the very existence of Australian families can also be stopped . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish firstly to establish the areas that we are debating. The matter of public importance reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Government to maintain the standard of living of families and pensioners on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA>Speakers in the debate today have talked about families and pensioners in all areas, not just those on low incomes. If we look at statistics that give us the percentage of pensioners who have no other form of income we find that the supporting parents are the ones who are worse off. Only 10.1 per cent of age pensioners have no other outside income. But 72.3 per cent of supporting parents have no other income. They appear to comprise the group within the pensioners system that needs our first concern. I agree with Senator Harradine that the other group which needs our concern is single income families with a greater than average number of children. Social welfare data supports this view. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been told by previous speakers, particularly Senator Grimes, that the standard of living for people in these groups has fallen. Perhaps we can look at what this Government has done. I do not think there would be anyone left in Australia who has not heard that our main emphasis is to fight inflation in order to assist these groups of people. It has been said over and over again throughout our whole period of government. That policy is perhaps a little difficult for many people to understand. They still see the prices in shops going up and they wonder what the Government is on about. Let us look at four commodities-bread, butter, milk and tea-to see what happened to their prices in the last year of the Labor Government from June 1974 to June 1975 and the last year of our Government from June 1980 to June 1981. Those commodities are basic foods that have to be purchased by low income families and low income pensioners . The comparison of prices will underline the need for a continuation of the Government's emphasis on fighting inflation. Between June 1974 and June 1975 the price of a milk loaf went up by 32 per cent. From June 1980 to June 1981 it went up by 11 per cent. Between June 1974 and June 1975 the price of 500 grams of butter went up by 17 per cent. From June 1980 to June 1981 it went up by 16 per cent. In 1974-75 the price of delivered milk went up by 34 per cent, whereas in 1980-81 it went up by 14 per cent. In 1974-75 the price of a packet of tea went up by 46 per cent, whereas in 1980-81 it went up by 4 per cent. Price increases affect all low income families and all low income pensioners. I believe that this Government would be irresponsible to alter its course in any way. Yet we get nothing but derision from the Opposition whenever the Government's main policy is talked about. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the three groups I have mentioned. What has the Government done for the low single income families? We have increased the dependent spouse rebate to well above the inflation rate and the indexation increases. In December 1975 the rebate was $400; it is now $830. That is the sort of thing we have done for the single income families which Senator Harradine is primarily concerned about. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was from a low base. We have more than doubled it. I believe that is an area in which we have created some justice within the tax system. The family allowance is another area in which we have assisted large single income families more than any other group, except for single mothers to whom I will refer later. The Australian Labor Party admitted at one stage that the family allowance was of great assistance to low income earners. Those families that were not getting enough income to pay the amount of tax on which they would normally have got a rebate now benefit considerably. Senator Chaney incorporated in Hansard a table which gives all the details. Another means by which we have assisted low income families, over and above the family allowance, is the latest increase payable for the third and subsequent children. The Labor Government proposed increasing the allowance, but it made such a muck of it that it would have resulted in small families receiving a benefit while larger families on the same income would have been denied it. This proposition was put forward by the Labor Party prior to the 1980 election as its main social welfare policy for this group. It made such an awful hash of it that it withdrew it fairly quickly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at what we have done to assist single parents. The family allowance helped this group in particular because the majority of single parents were below the tax threshold. That assistance resulted in their getting the full family allowance. This Government also increased the sole parent rebate from $ 200 in 1975 to $580 in 1981. That was well over the inflation rate and the indexation increases. We also extended the allowance to include not only single mothers but also single fathers, which I believe was very justifiable. One of our most important decisions was to extend the eligibility for fringe benefits to single parents. They were not previously eligible. Single parents are now able to get all the Commonwealth fringe benefits, and, as honourable senators will know, many of the States have tied their benefits to the Commonwealth pensioner health benefits card. We also removed the six months waiting period for single mothers to become eligible, which requirement previously was a great hardship to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Only 10.1 per cent of age pensioners have no income apart from the pension. Let us see how that group has benefited. The Opposition has said many times that as a percentage of average weekly earnings pensions have deteriorated. But if we go through the December figures since 1972 we see that in December 1972 when the Labor Government came to office the rate of pensions was 21.4 per cent of average weekly earnings, in 1973 it was 19.9 per cent and in December 1974 it was 22 per cent. In December 1975, after this Government came to office, the figure was 23.2 per cent. Since then the figure has been maintained roughly in that area. In December 1976 it was 23.1 per cent; in December 1977 it was 23.8 per cent; in December 1978 it was 23.9 per cent; in December 1979 it was 23.7 per cent; and in December 1980 it was 23 per cent. We do not yet have the figures for December 1981. So the percentage has been maintained. I deny categorically that the Labor Party can prove that that rate of pension has decreased in any way at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Grimes told us that we had no right to abolish the assets means test. He told us that there was no justification for people being allowed to have numerous assets and still get the pension. He forgot, of course, that Mr Whitlam in 1972 promised to abolish any means test on all pensions. The Government at that time did so for those pensioners over 70 years of age, but not for pensioners below that age. Senator Grimes has told us very clearly in this place many times that he did not approve of that. He still does not approve of it. This policy is not now part of the Labor Party's platform. He was instrumental in taking it off that platform. This Government did introduce an income test instead of a means test. That enabled people to get a pension rather than having to sell their assets. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important achievement of this Government in the area of pensions was the automatic twice-yearly adjustments to pensions in accordance with the consumer price index. This has resulted in a 50.4 per cent increase in real terms in pensions. When this Government came to office the standard rate of single pension was $38.75; it is now $69.70. It is not a political football any longer. This Government has not allowed the situation in which at every Budget all pensioners hold their breath to see whether their pensions will go up. Pensions have gone up automatically, twice a year. This has given dignity to pensioners. It has enabled pensioners to plan ahead and to know that if food and clothing prices and rents go up their pensions will go up. I believe that this is something that this Government has every right to be proud of. I believe that pensioners do acknowledge that. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been told that the Labor Party has promised that it will increase the basic rate of pensions to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. I am interested to know where members of the Labor Party have decided to get the money to pay for this. They have not said where they will get it from. Indeed, the Labor Party has made all sorts of comments about where it will get that money from-from a capital gains tax. But suddenly, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden, has decided that capital gains taxes might be a bit unpopular. From that promise in a Lowe by-election speech we have seen a brawl developed between Mr Hayden, Mr Hawke and the unions. Mr Carmichael has said that it will be introduced. Of course, Mr Carmichael has great influence on Mr Hayden because the Labor Party obtains its finances from Mr Carmichael's union. So we will probably see a capital gains tax introduced willy-nilly whether Mr Hayden likes it or not. </PARA>
<PARA> The maximum total income before fringe benefits are excluded is $99.70 for a single pensioner and $167.46 for married pensioners. This enables single pensioners to invest $14,000 at 15 per cent and still qualify for the fringe benefit card and their pension. Married pensioners can invest up to $23,000. So previous questions asked in this place-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The inability or the failure of the present Government to maintain what we would all like to see as a sufficient or adequate standard of living for families on low incomes and for pensioners is a topic of deep concern to a large number of Australians, and with very good reason. The plight of people on pensions and low incomes is appalling. Through no fault of their own, they face financial hardship, loss of dignity and self- esteem, real loss of control over their lives and, in many instances, are deprived of all those little things that make life in Australia worth living.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Harradine mentioned that they were not able to paint the town red. I argue that, very often, these people are unable to send their children on school camps, which these days are becoming necessary items in school agenda, they are not able to afford family visits to the theatre or to the cinema and they cannot afford a box of chocolates, a bottle of wine or even a good novel. Their lifestyle is hardly extravagant; their standard of living is hardly high. These people include nearly 115,000 people, both men and women, on single parent benefits; over a million families whose total income is less than the average weekly wage, and over one-third of those families have two or more children in them; aged and invalid pensioners, and particularly the disabled who are also aged; the unemployed, especially those in their middle years who have been made redundant with no hope of future employment; and low income superannuitants. All these people suffer considerably from the fact that their standard of living is dropping considerably. </PARA>
<PARA> Pensioners may not, as the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) asserted in a letter published in a number of newspapers this week, be literally on fixed incomes. But they are on incomes which are below the poverty line and at an all-time present Government low of just over 21 per cent of average weekly earnings. Furthermore, even with indexation, they are never in a position to keep up with inflation since their twice-yearly increases are paid six months after the consumer price index rises which have provoked them. As a result, they are always half a year behind inflation. They are half a year behind the eight ball. In the intervening period, of course, the cost of normal items has increased for them as it has increased for everybody else and they are forced to meet that cost. </PARA>
<PARA> I will provide to the Senate today a good example to illustrate the plight that a lot of ordinary people are finding themselves in. It relates to a constituent of mine who contacted me a week or so ago. She is a widow with two children aged 22 and 17, one of whom is unemployed and both of whom have been living with her for the last few years. When she wrote to me she said that she realised that it was not going to be possible for me to do anything about her particular case. But she said she did want me, if I could, to use the figures that she was making available to me to urge the present Government to review fully the plight of low income earners such as she in the hope that after this review some appropriate increase of assistance to them would result. The lady is typical of many Australians who are suffering financial hardship at the moment. She is not a layabout nor does she want to be dependent on charity from voluntary organisations. As I said, until very recently, her children were fully dependent on her. </PARA>
<PARA> She is still sufficiently determined to make the best of her situation to seek help from the budgetary advisers of the South Australian Government's Department for Community Welfare. The result of that visit is interesting because that Department came up with the following fortnightly budget. She is in the process of buying her own house. Her house repayments are fortnightly-all these figures are fortnightly-and are $77.50. That is not excessive for house mortgage repayments and it is certainly less than she is likely to be paying for rental. Council rates are $3, engineering and water supply $2.60, electricity $14, heating oil $2, telephone $10 and food and groceries-this is for herself alone-$ 50 a fortnight. House insurance is $4 and car registration, running and insurance costs amount to $26 a fortnight. I point out in case people think that that is excessive that she lives in an outer Adelaide suburb not well provided with public transport. She spends another $5 a fortnight on newspapers and magazines. The Royal Automobile Association costs her $1 a fortnight. The DCW people have kindly allocated her $2.30 for personal expenses each fortnight though I am not sure what she could get for that. She also pays an ambulance subscription fee of $6 a year. The total cost, exclusive of that ambulance amount, is $197.40 a fortnight. Of course, she qualifies for free health care for which, I imagine, she is eternally grateful because I do not see how she could possibly afford to pay for it herself. I think the Senate will agree that this is not exactly a profligate budget, nor is the standard of living indicated by her budget excessively high. Her pension is $139.80 a fortnight. It does not take an arithmetical genius to work out that this leaves a shortfall of $57.60 between the amount in pension that she receives and the amount that the Department of Community Welfare officers maintain she needs simply to exist for a fortnight. Even if she earns the allowable $40 a fortnight before her pension starts to decrease she still has a shortfall of $17.60 to make up. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I remind the Senate that of all groups seeking to enter the paid labour force, women, in this lady's position, are the worst off. They have limited educational qualifications, negligible job experience and are over 40 years. They are the hardest group of people to find places for in the labour force. The DCW officers, having no other assistance to give her, advised her to go to charitable voluntary organisations for help-though I am bothered to see what they can do for her other than perhaps pay her telephone bill. Nevertheless there seemed to be no other assistance that could be given to her from some sort of State department. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt a great many people in the same or similar position to this woman are deeply anxious about their financial predicament and are just as deeply resentful at what they see as lack of understanding of their plight by the present Government. I do not think they are remotely interested in what Mr Hayden was or was not planning in 1974-75. What they are interested in is what Mr Fraser is planning for them in 1982-83. Actually they would rather have had it in 1981-82.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Which is probably nothing, as the honourable senator said. Senator Sir John Carrick apparently feels justified in making the statement he made earlier today when he said 'Australians have never had it so good'. I think we really seriously ought to consider the question about which Australians he and the author of that article are referring to. They are certainly not the sort of people exemplified by the woman whose situation I cited today. Neither are they the people in Victoria who sought relief from voluntary agencies in such numbers in 1981 that $5m was spent by these organisations in providing emergency relief; not regular assistance but emergency relief. I point out too that 75 per cent of the people seeking aid from these voluntary agencies in Victoria alone were those on social security benefits or pensions. A significant proportion of those people are likely to be men and women on supporting parent benefits. Very clearly the Government's strategy of holding pensions and benefits to the minimum level is placing an extraordinary strain on welfare agencies. Quite clearly too the Government's allocation of, I think, $500,000 in grants to Victorian agencies I referred to a moment ago is just not sufficient to help them carry on. In fact they should not have to be doing what they are doing. In a country of the sort to which Senator Sir John Carrick referred this morning in which its inhabitants have never had it so good, one State's emergency relief bill for voluntary agencies should not have gone up from $2m in 1978 to $5m in 1981.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Something is obviously very wrong somewhere with somebody's definition of a lucky country because we are very clearly not all able to partake of the riches of this so-called lucky country. Sure the Lang Hancocks, the Thiesses, the Holmes a Courts and Alan Bonds of this world have never had it so good. They are on the lucky end of the spectrum. They are on the approved end of the spectrum as far as this Goverment is concerned. But if honourable senators ask my constituent from Adelaide how she feels about it I guarantee the answer she will give is not that she has never had it so good. If honourable senators ask any supporting mother whose husband is ignoring maintenance orders and is therfore forcing her, against her preferences certainly, to go on to social security she will say she has never had it so hard. If the honourable senators ask a recipient of a low fixed superannuation payment or ask somebody on unemployment benefits-particularly if they have a family to maintain as well-they will not receive much joy in the reply they get. If honourable senators ask another of my correspondents, this time somebody from Queensland, what he thinks about the situation and how well off he thinks he is they will get the following response. In a letter sent to me recently he concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> Remember the people in our age bracket-</PARA>
<PARA>He is referring to people on age pensions-</PARA>
<PARA> Fought the wars, went through the depression and suffered from poor wages and conditions, and maybe you people would not have had it so good but for the work, fighting and suffering of these people. </PARA>
<PARA>I think he has a point. I think he expresses the opinion that a lot of people in his predicament hold. They ask why they should have gone through what they did for a country which appears to be putting them very low on the list of priorities. The Minister in his rebuttal of Senator Grimes said that it is about time that people who get to their feet and complain about the standard of living , the level of pensions or incomes or whatever, came up with something positive. Overlooking the fact, of course, that we on this side of the House are not in any position to indicate anything particularly positive or to institute it, I suggest one or two things: Perhaps the Minister could suggest to his Cabinet colleagues that they make some sort of attempt to increase their actions against tax evaders. If we believe Victorian Ministers and others there is an enormous pool of money going begging from the people at the approved end of the Australian social strata. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the Minister and his colleagues do something about instituting a stronger enforcement of maintenance payments because a lot of supporting mothers who are taking social security benefits do not want to be dependent on the State . It is the responsibility of both parents, whether they are together or separated, to share the costs of bringing up their family. If neither of those things appeals to the Minister I suggest that he put some thought into considering a scheme discussed in the early 1970s which suggested that a national portable contributory superannuation scheme be introduced. At the moment the average 20-year-old on average weekly earnings over an average working life of 40 to 45 years will contribute in excess of $165,000 in taxes to this country. Surely it is not too much to expect that for the last 10 years of his average life following his retirement he should get a reasonable pension or superannuation. </PARA>

<PARA> The failure of the Government to maintain the standard of living of families and pensioners on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA>The first question which must arise is whether that is a statement of fact. Although there has been some discussion of the matter it would be well for me to refer to what Professor Pollard is quoted in today's Sydney Morning Herald as having said in a paper published in the February edition of the Australian Economic Trends newsletter. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . in the six years to 1981, average household income had risen in real terms by 5.4 per cent, while the purchasing power of average weekly earnings had risen by 6.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>He was talking of real terms with adjustments being made for inflation. According to him there is an improvement in the position of the average household and in average weekly earnings. He went on to demonstrate that a husband and wife who had two children and earned approximately $18,000 a year would pay 18.7 per cent less tax proportionately than they would have six years earlier. On the face of it these are encouraging figures and indicate that Australia's prosperity is improving. But it is important for us to recognise the fact that that does not necessarily answer the question in relation to low income families and pensioners. So whilst there is every reason to say that the Government's economic policies have been successful in improving the overall position of the average Australian, we need to look a little further to see what is the position of low income families and people who are in receipt of pensions and dependent upon pensions. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, and Senator Walters have given to the chamber this afternoon a series of figures which indicate that, whilst in some cases there has been some improvement in the position of people, in other areas we have done no more than maintain a basic position. I think the summary of the figures which were incorporated in Hansard would indicate that the Government has achieved basic maintenance of the position, while acknowledging that in some cases there has not been a significant improvement in the position. But the question which then arises is: Is it good enough for a country such as Australia merely to maintain the position of the needy, the underprivileged and, in economic terms, the weaker members of our society? I believe that living standards are and should be a true reflection of the capacity of the economy of a nation to provide. But it is also very obvious to the world at the moment-it is being increasingly debated and discussed-that we are living in a world of economic reality. When somebody in the United States of America coughs the rest of the world tends to get the cold. Whatever we can do at any time must be tempered by world trade, world economic management and particularly events in the United States which dominate the world economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has an increasing percentage of aged people. We have an increasing number of persons receiving unemployment benefits. We have what has been referred to this afternoon as the huge blowout in the number of supporting parents-approximately a 50 per cent increase between June 1980 and June 1981. All of this has increased the demand upon the welfare budget. I think it is quite wrong for Senator Colston to suggest that the Government has failed to increase the allocation of resources to welfare. What the Government has not been able to do is keep down the total number of people who share the vastly increased allocation of welfare resources. The individual participant is not getting a vastly increased share of what has become an exceptionally great increase-certainly from 18 per cent to 28 per cent-in the Commonwealth's total welfare budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Colston was not grappling with the real problem. The real problem is: How long can we continue to provide adequately for an aging community, a community in which large numbers of extra claimants are entitled to and in many cases are in need of some form of welfare benefit or assistance? I believe that the only responsible way to provide for these needs is to ensure adequate growth in the economy. Failure to ensure growth guarantees-I emphasise the word ' guarantees'-that there will be a reduced capacity particularly when we have inflation. It is no answer to adopt the approach which the Whitlam Government adopted in the period 1972 to 1975 when there was a huge increase in the money supply, when very large amounts of money were printed, when inflation was aggravated by huge increases in the money supply and other factors and when, as a result, although increased benefits were made available, the growth in the rate of inflation was such as to reduce the real benefit of the improvements that were made by that Government to a wide cross-section of welfare recipients.</PARA>
<PARA> One is impelled to ask whether merely raising the question of the hopes, aspirations and hardships of the weaker and economically less fortunate members of society is not a low grade political practice. It is so easy to say what those people already know, that is, that they are neither getting the assistance that they would like to receive nor getting as much as they need to live at a standard which is comparable with the average within the community. It is much harder, but I suggest far more responsible, to say how these hopes and aspirations will be met and how these hardships will be alleviated; that is, answer the question: Where will the money come from? That question is inevitable , I believe, when the Australian Labor Party starts on its proposals. It is not a matter of political point scoring to ask: Where will the money come from? It is a fundamental question at any level of national and community life. If a wife in a household says: 'Let us buy a new washing machine' the natural question is: Where will the money come from? If the husband says: 'Let us get a new car' the natural question is: Where will the money come from? I believe it is not a matter of poor political point scoring to raise the question: Where will the money come from? Obviously, greater expenditure in welfare must involve either the curtailment of expenditure in other areas or, an increase in revenue, or both. It can come about only as a result of such action. Therefore it is legitimate to ask: Who will pay the increase in taxes? Who will lose from the curtailment of other expenditure?</PARA>
<PARA> This afternoon other speakers referred to the cost of various increases in areas suggested by the ALP. What is not clear is whether those increases will come from personal income tax, resources taxes, capital gains taxes or other taxes. I believe that, as Senator Chaney said, there is some duty for those who say there must be increases to indicate how they would provide from them. I support what the Minister said when replying to Senator Grimes. Perhaps the Australian Labor Party would respond to the challenge by stating the full program it proposes, not only in relation to how it will respond to the obvious needs of our community but also where the money will come from to do so. I believe huge inequities exist in the Australian nation. There are distortions and imbalances in the allocation of resources. These are problems which must be solved if we are to achieve what I believe to be the ambition and aspiration of all political parties in this Parliament; that is, a just, equitable and adequate provision for the needy members of the community. To do this we must have growth in real terms. But our trading position is continually jeopardised by what could only be regarded as irresponsible industrial action such as that which caused Premier Neville Wran in New South Wales to say recently:</PARA>
<PARA> Some unions have introduced a tinge of lunacy to the industrial front. </PARA>
<PARA>Repeatedly one finds that Australia's trading opportunities are adversely affected by our reputation for unreliability in relation to delivery because of industrial disruption. That is one form of selfishness in the community, as is tax evasion, which Senator Haines mentioned. Tax avoidance is another form of irresponsibility which is rampant in the community. Although I pay tribute to the work which the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Government have done already in the field of trying to clean up the tax evasion problems, quite obviously it is an area where much more work has to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> Another of the urgent problems which has to be cleaned up is that of superannuation. Huge disparities exist between some forms of superannuation, other forms of superannuation and no superannuation at all. This afternoon while the debate was going on I was interested to receive a report entitled 'Social Welfare Policy Secretariat-Report on Alternative Strategies to Meet the Income Needs of the Aged'. This report has just been tabled. The report could well be the subject matter of a debate in this chamber. Possibly such a debate would be far more useful than the continual regurgitation of the one point by Senator Grimes which I have heard debated in this chamber half a dozen times in the past 12 months, with almost the identical speeches being made on each occasion. It might be a little more positive for Senator Grimes to be putting forward some more constructive proposals for reports, such as the one to which I have just referred, to be debated, so that we can endeavour to reach a stage where we can look at how we can overcome some of these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish briefly to quote an example. If, in seven years, because Trans Australia Airlines did not make any provision for its superannuation liability in respect of its employees entitled to Commonwealth superannuation, the relatively few thousand employees of TAA caused there to be a debt of $140m run up, can one imagine what would be the total liability of the full Commonwealth superannuation scheme which is unfunded? We just cannot go on spending today what we have not yet earned and what we might hope to earn tomorrow. It is this balance which I believe needs to be achieved. Some people are enjoying incredible privileges as far as superannuation schemes are concerned, from the point of view of the degree of their contribution as op-posed to the degree of return which they get from it. </PARA>
<PARA> There are problems in relation to housing rates and the proposals of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System which I have not time to refer to. There are a number of matters to which specifically I hope the chamber could pay a little more direct attention. It is not disputed that we should all aspire to the elimination of poverty but sound economic management, real growth and responsible and equitable allocation are required before short term vote-catching gimmickry. I now move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are continuing the debate on the reintroduction of Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) 1981 [No. 2] ( 1982) which last year were twice returned to the House of Representatives. Although the Australian Democrats acknowledge that the Senate has power to reject such money Bills, all members of that party gave repeated assurances, through statutory declarations and public utterances, that this power would not be exercised. Senator Chipp is reported as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . not even in 'reprehensible' circumstances would we ever block supply or impede a money Bill to prevent a democratically elected Government from governing. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously these statements were made in the interests of maintaining the stability of a properly elected government in the lower House. Yesterday evening , before the Senate adjourned at 10.30 p.m., I was stressing the point that if the Australian Democrats wished to portray themselves as a new ray of hope, inspiration and credibility, they must raise themselves from the indulgences of their party leader in his frequent attempts to crucify the leader of the Government, Mr Malcolm Fraser. Unless they do so they will subvert the party's very high ideals to base and personal motives. Unfortunately, I think the Australian Democrats must be seen as a party that has sacrificed the principles for which it fought so strongly at the last election. Instead, regrettably, it has opted for the easy political solution, what we might term 'political opportunism'. Despite repeated assurances about not blocking supply-I quoted one such assurance earlier-and the great facade of the statutory declarations, the Australian Democrats have done the great about face which in future will be as immemorial as the 1975-type fiasco. They have done this at a time of overrun of Government expenditure and of falling revenues. They have really attempted to put in the boot at a time when the electorate would least expect that sort of behaviour. After all, this sales tax package is an integral part of the Budget strategy of the Federal Government. The Australian Democrats are attempting to completely knock that. People listening to this debate must recognise that the Australian Democrats are denying ordinary pay-as-you-earn taxpayers the opportunity of getting full and complete tax relief. Last night I quoted figures which showed how the pay-as-you-earn taxpayers were having to bear an increasing burden of the total tax bill. Our Government is attempting to change the tax mix so as to try to provide some relief for people who have no opportunity of entering into tax avoidance schemes and undertakings. It is in this area that I think some relief is necessary. What do we find? The excuse that is given is that it was an error of judgment. An error of judgment on matters of principle are, indeed, a serious indictment on what I might term the first real test of their credibility. Have they come through with flying colours? Unfortunately they have not. They have not had the backbone to be true to their word. As I mentioned last night, this is an essential requirement of any political party if it is to have any credibility within the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> In politics one has to make decisions. Sometimes these decisions have to be hard economic decisions. They may be perplexing to some but, based on the results of those decisions, the electorate makes a judgment. But the situation will become increasingly clouded for the electorate to make this judgment. In future-in fact perhaps for the next six years we could have this instability as a result of the vacillations of the Australian Democrats who hold the balance of power-it will be very difficult for any government to form a Budget strategy. This party that holds the balance of power henceforth must be regarded as not only unreliable but also vacillating to temporary and sectional whims and, therefore, will be completely unpredictable so far as the electorate and any government party are concerned. I submit that these displays by the Australian Democrats in overturning their solemn and sincere undertakings do not make it a creditable party which should hold the balance of power. I support the nine Bills. </PARA>

It is hypocrisy for the Government to place this legislation before the House again. It is a denial of any political honesty before the people of Australia. This Government went to the people of Australia in an election campaign but made no declaration of its intention to increase sales tax and to put it on to goods that currently have no sales tax applied to them. The Government brought in the legislation to do that and it has the hypocrisy to cry about the Australian Democrats changing their minds in relation to some statutory declarations that they signed which stated they would not oppose this legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. They have thought about the problems which will be created in the community, the problems that this Government will create by imposing indirect taxes on the low income earners of this nation. The Democrats have rethought their situation and have now decided to vote against this legislation which is being introduced for the second time. I believe that is reasonable. They should be commended for their action. When this legislation is rejected again by this House, the people of Australia will be able to reassess the dishonesty of this Government which has tried to introduce into the Senate and the House of Representatives taxation measures which it did not say anything about prior to the election campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other important matter to be remembered is that it is the intention of these reintroduced Sales Tax Amendment Bills to place tax on goods that up to now have not been taxed. The government talks about it being an indirect tax. In actual fact, it is a direct tax because it directly affects the low income earners, the pensioners and the single mothers in this community. This Government has no thought for what is happening. It has simply sat back. In Question Time today I asked a question on tax avoidance. The Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), who represents in this place the Treasurer (Mr Howard), said that the Treasurer had taken a number of steps but could not specifically say what those steps were. </PARA>
<PARA> In yesterday's Australian Financial Review is a copy of an advertisement which sets out a statement by Peter Clyne in which he says that he will teach people in Australia how to avoid their responsibilities to the taxation system this Government holds up to every one in this House. It has no way in which to combat that sort of tax avoidance. That type of advice is being given to taxpayers throughout the Commonwealth of Australia. What is more, this Government has no initiatives towards stopping tax avoidance. It wants to put sales tax on to a number of items to allow the small income earners, the people of Australia, to pay for the tax avoidance of the big companies, the big income earners and the speculators throughout Australia. If the Government were to do something about introducing a speculation tax, perhaps the revenue going into the coffers would be increased so that there would not be a blowout in the Treasury Budget deficit to the present extent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government says that it is not imposing a direct tax on food but that it is taxing packaging. How many goods on the shelves of the supermarkets throughout this nation are not packaged and will not have that indirect tax applied to them ? This means that people who buy their week to week commodities at the supermarkets with the pension payments given to them by this Government will be paying a direct tax, not an indirect tax as this Government claims. </PARA>
<PARA> One should mention the fact that the Government wants to tax books and magazines. The Government has said that there will be some deductions in that educational authorities and people in the educational field might be able to apply for some exemptions from the taxes which it seeks to apply to books and magazines. Again, this Government has completely neglected this area. What about the hundreds of parents, single parents and pensioners affected and the children who are attending the schools? What about the parents who have to buy educational books and who therefore have to pay that so-called indirect tax on those books bought for their children attending schools? Of course, there is the opportunity to make an application--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator would not understand because he does not have the sorts of problems of the people I am talking about. Let us take a person on $200 a week who pays somewhere in the vicinity of $70 a week rent. This leaves him with $130. He needs $100 a week for groceries and the normal things he needs to keep his house going. He has $30 a week left to educate and feed his children and to transport himself to and from work. If that $30 a week does not pay for the things he wants, he has to take a certain amount out of what he allows for the education or upkeep of his family. So if it costs him $40 a week to do that, he will have to take $10 out of the $100 a week which he has allocated for keeping the family.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. They do not worry about taxation. As I said before , it was not my intention today to refer to the amendments to the sales tax legislation; I wanted to speak on another matter. But I believe we need to say something because of the dishonest way in which the Government brought this legislation back to the Senate and the way in which it has attacked the Australian Democrats. However, I intend to take this opportunity to speak on behalf of a group of people within our society who have very little chance of speaking out for themselves. The Government's policy of cutting funds to children's services has not only affected all children in the community but has had a drastic effect on the ethnic community children and child care centres for migrant families. Cuts in funding will have disastrous consequences on thousands of struggling migrant families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Migrant families are among the most vulnerable in this situation. A total of 47 .6 per cent of unmarried women in the work force are migrants whose income is vital for the survival of the family. The psychological stability and the productivity of these women depend on the availability of adequate child care and the knowledge that their children will be well cared for. Because child care or adequate facilities are not available stress builds up within the family. This stress, along with the pressure brought about by migration, cultural difference and cultural conflict, builds up problems which can result in child abuse developing in parts of the ethnic community. The Government needs to understand and to recognise the problems facing migrant families with young children. The special stresses on migrants need to be investigated. Cutbacks in child welfare funding by the razor gang have created problems and stress within ethnic families and their children. This development of stress has brought about a position in which child abuse exists within the ethnic community in Australia. The Government and the community should try to recognise some of the related factors, the problems facing migrant families with young children-some of the factors that lead parents to become involved in physical and emotional abuse of their children. I refer to stress caused by migration, cultural differences, cultural conflict, lack of child care and lack of day long child care facilities from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major reasons for families migrating to Australia is economic advancement. This carries with it a strong belief in the opportunity for a good education and better life for their children. From the post-war period to the early 1970s Australian governments encouraged large scale migration to Australia . However, little planning was carried out to assist the new settlers to integrate into the Australian society. Migrants were expected to assimilate. Their special needs were overlooked. In the early 1970s assistance such as interpreting, English classes and welfare services for ethnic communities was commenced. This was followed by the development in the mid-1970s of institutional changes, including the establishment of bodies such as the Ethnic Affairs Commission of New South Wales and the ethnic community councils. In addition, conferences dealing with specific issues such as migrant women, health and refugees began to focus attention on the specific needs of migrant communities and on the problem of family stress and the impact on children. Matters of child abuse and punishment are recent developments in the Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have copious notes. Attention to the impact on the migrant community is only now beginning. Migration brings upon families many unexpected results which create varying degrees of stress. Stress is caused by the lack of English. This isolates men and women in the work force and in society, and communication with children becomes difficult once children begin to speak English. There is also the loss of extended families which could usually be relied upon for support in child rearing and social life. The changed lifestyle, with both parents often working long hours doing manual labour in a factory, also creates stress. Isolation is felt by many women who stay at home. Role reversal is becoming as common as unemployment. The number of work accidents increases amongst migrant men. Women are assuming the responsiblity of being main bread winners in the family, causing serious stress for the men.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying before the suspension of the sitting, unexpected reasons create varying degrees of stress. Many of these stresses remain hidden in the family and are not accessible to the community and welfare workers. In many cases of child abuse the existence and relevance of these factors have emerged only after considerable investigation of the family's way of life. One of the real needs for migrant families is support in child rearing and assistance with social life. When other cultures come into conflict with our Australian way of life it is the migrant and the Aboriginal cultures that are left with feelings of shame, doubt, resentment and inferiority. Despite the rhetoric of multiculturalism it is always clear to the migrants that the pressure is on their values and traditions. This is borne out by the evidence. It shows the importance and the need for child care facilities to this section of the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Examples of need are shown by the problems that have been created. There are many instances where migrant families leave children in their beds or in the home alone while the parents are at work. This occurs not because the parents have no understanding of the need for child care or are punishing the child deliberately. The lack of child care facilities, the high cost of the existing facilities, little knowledge of alternative services plus the lack of extended family support lead to these choices. Is this abuse or a deficiency in our social structure? This problem begins to develop before the migrant leaves his own country. It is brought about by the wrong information being given to prospective migrants. Pamphlets issued in Spain recently by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs carried, and still carry, the information 'that Australia has adequate child care facilities'. Another information pamphlet entitled 'Education in Australia'-I think the first edition was printed in 1968- states:</PARA>
<PARA> In Australia in most of the highly populated industrial cities there are many varieties of child-care places such as pre-school centres, creches, family day care centres, full day and part-time centres and even holiday houses.</PARA>
<PARA>In actual fact there is a desperate shortage of all kinds of child care facilities and particularly those that cater for working mothers.</PARA>
<PARA> For some families the choice is extreme. They send their children home to relatives overseas. Recent statistics are not available but research by a Turkish community worker found that between 1970 and 1972 of more than 600 Turkish children born in New South Wales at least half had been sent back to Turkey. Nazli Munir, a social worker in New South Wales, said that in the early 1980s there was evidence of the disastrous effects that this separation could have on families once the children again were united with their parents. Children become attached to their grandparents and relatives overseas. At the most crucial stage of early development it is a relative and not the parent who becomes the dominant figure in the child's life. All of a sudden the children are separated from their relatives whth whom they have built a strong bond. They are united or reunited with their parents, brothers or sisters whom they do not know. They have no knowledge of English and have to adjust to a life in a totally new country. Whatever the age of the child, adjustment to a new country and family while grieving the loss of relatives overseas causes much emotional stress. Often parents do not understand the process of change. Their image of a loving child may be shattered.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of one Turkish family the first-born-a girl-was sent to Turkey when she was two months old. When she was almost two years old her mother gave birth to another daughter. Having decided that the mother would give up work to care for the child the father went to Turkey to bring back the first child, the daughter. The daughter got to know her father over a few months before leaving for Australia and became attached to him. She grieved for her grandparents, uncles and aunts in Turkey. But she showed little feeling towards her mother and was extremely jealous of the baby. Within the first month of her arrival in Australia the family sought help. The mother was feeling desperate that she could not make her elder daughter love her and at times came very close to hitting her. She felt also that she did not have the same amount of feeling for the first child as she had for the second. Her solution was a determination to send the daughter back to Turkey.</PARA>
<PARA> In a number of counselling sessions the mother was asked to be a little more patient. It was suggested that perhaps her daughter could be put into a family day care centre for a few days a week to give her mother the necessary break. The mother was warned that if she sent the child back to Turkey she would be jeopardising any hope of building a mother-daughter relationship with the child in the future. It was pointed out also that if her daughter was then brought back to Australia she could suffer serious emotional trauma. The effects of the separation from her grandparents were clearly visible in the child's behaviour- she needed attention and cried if the person paying her attention left. A second such dramatic separation would cause only further distress. The family then decided to send the child once again to Turkey. It is over two years since she left Australia. Since then, her mother has gone back to work and the family has bought a house. The mother is planning to bring the daughter back to Australia again. The mother, I might say, is not an abuser but a victim of our social system-a system that encourages and often forces mothers to work to survive but provides no decent system of child care for the majority of working women.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been a drop in the number of families sending children overseas. There has been a number of factors, none of which is adequate child care. I believe families have been able to become a part of the community's network. Increased unemployment leads to women being left at home to look after the children. What happens overseas does not help the conflict that has been built between the children and the mother. Conflict in Lebanon, economic conditions in Turkey and the problem of families not being able to send money overseas have not helped. Because of economic conditions people have had to try to find other solutions. I am informed that further research carried out last year shows that of 40 Turkish mothers who had pre-school children two were considering sending their children overseas because it was the only alternative they saw to the child care problem. The razor gang cuts have decreased child care funding further. This makes it more difficult for migrant families in Australia. So, the problem of sending children overseas will become an even worse problem. Extra finance is required, not less.</PARA>
<PARA> For migrant families the long day care centres are vital. One cannot put a child into a child care centre when it is open only from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Long day care centres are required. I think the Government needs to provide the sort of finance that would allow the provision of these sorts of centres. That would allow migrant families to place their children in centres that are open from 7 a .m. to 4 p.m. at least and allow the parents to work and obtain care for their children so that the parents can gain the economic responsibility and growth that they know will come to them by working hard in this country of ours. I think it is unfair that the Government has not provided those sorts of facilities for the migrant children in this country of ours.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the first reading of the Sales Tax Amendment Bills. I offer no apology for speaking in this first reading debate on the Bills but I intend to speak on them in relation to questions of principle. I hope that in due course I shall get an opportunity to speak in the second reading debate on the same subject, when I shall deal at some length with the allegations which have been made here from time to time that these Bills are regressive and a terrible punishment for the low income earners of Australia. I hope that I will be able to persuade the Senate that that is absolute nonsense, that in fact, quite to the contrary, the Bills are not regressive but impose a decent tax on those who have large incomes and spend them and that the poorer income earners of Australia will not suffer anything like the punishments that allegedly will be inflicted by this legislation. That is not the subject with which I wish to deal in this first reading debate. I wish to talk of questions of principle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, I turn to the Australian Labor Party. After the 1975 election we heard long speeches being repeated by various members of the Labor Party, both within and outside the Parliament, about the alleged reprehensible conduct of honourable senators on the Government side of the chamber-in other words, the senators who voted against the money Bills in the Senate. Let me make my position quite clear. I think they did the right thing. I have no doubt whatsoever that the Senate has the power to reject money Bills. That is laid down in the Constitution. I might say that I would like the Constitution to be altered so that if the Senate does reject money Bills the Government will have the opportunity to take the Senate, not just the House of Representatives, to the people. But that is another matter. The speeches from 1975 to 1980 about the alleged reprehensible conduct of people on our side of the chamber were continued with much ferocity. In fact, the ALP pledged itself to seek constitutional amendment to ensure that the Senate would have no power 'to reject, defer or otherwise block money Bills'. I repeat the words 'money Bills'.</PARA>
<PARA> After the election of 1980, the ALP, of course, as it always does when it is defeated in an election, went into a state of shock. About six months after the election we started to hear a different tune. We started to hear ALP leaders talking like what I would call devious lawyers about some fine distinction between so-called money Bills and Supply Bills-between major Supply and Appropriation Bills on the one hand and so-called lesser money Bills on the other hand, between money Bills which are crucial to the survival of a government and those which are not. I could not help being reminded of the allegations that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) had changed his tune between 1974 and 1975. It was quite clear to all those who were following events that the Labor Party was in the process of changing its tune. In fact it was trying to find some way to justify the blocking of Supply. Let us look at some of the things said by Senator Evans, for example. I shall quote from a speech which he made to the National Conference of Labor Lawyers as late as July 1981, when he advised against blocking Supply. </PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the fact that constitutional and democratic principles were torn up in 1975-</PARA>
<PARA>I do not agree with that statement, of course, but that is apparently what he believed-</PARA>
<PARA> is no excuse for anyone doing it again . . . I believe that our credibility and self-respect as a movement depends on us being more principled than our opponents . . . </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, that statement was made as late as July 1981. Then we saw Senators Evans beginning to back down, no doubt under the influence of various members of the Caucus. He is reported in the Hansard for 20 August 1981 as having said:</PARA>
<PARA> The relevant distinction that we have been talking our way through-</PARA>
<PARA>They are interesting words, Mr President. It is clear from the use of the word ' through' that members of the Labor Party were trying to talk themselves through to a particular position. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The relevant distinction that we have been talking our way through . . . is that between . . . on the one hand Bills which are crucial to the survival of a government . . . and, on the other, those which do not satisfy that description.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to talk about lesser money Bills and Bills which were essential to the survival of the Government. The people of this nation are not fools. They know what the Labor Party was trying to do. It was trying to find some way to justify a change in its position, the position which it had claimed was based on one of those principles which it had been protesting about throughout the period from 1975 to 1980. Senator Evans, in that speech of 20 August 1981, said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . whenever I or anyone else has used those kinds of expressions-</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to expressions such as 'blocking of Supply', 'blocking of money Bills' and 'blocking of Budgets'--</PARA>
<PARA> in all the debates that have taken place since 1974 and 1975 we have been using them in the context of the events of 1974 and 1975 when what was at issue was a particular category of Bills . . . which were on any view crucial to the continued survival, the continued existence of the Government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that he was saying: 'We are now talking about something different'. I was reminded of what Humpty Dumpty said in Alice through the Looking Glass. ' When I use a word', Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone, 'it means just what I choose it to mean-neither more nor less'. One can see the scornful Senator Evans making just such a distinction and saying: 'When I use a word it means what I mean and not necessarily what it means in the dictionary and to everyone else'. Having made his fine distinction, Senator Evans went further and started to renege even on those commitments which he had made. He was reported in the Age of 11 November as having said at a news conference:</PARA>
<PARA> I wouldn't want to put a time limit or try to identify the circumstances which might lead us to change our mind. All I can say is that there is considerable pressure within the party-in the parliamentary and the Labor Party at large-to adopt a more robust attitude on these issues, to pick a head when we see it, to do unto others precisely what they did to us in 1975 and not to accept any of the limitations of principle that we have accepted so far. </PARA>
<PARA>Surely that is a devastating admission. Later in the conference he was asked whether he would rule out the possibility of Labor being prepared to reject Supply in the life of this Government. Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am not either ruling it out or accepting it. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly the ALP leaders have irretrievably compromised themselves and their so- called principles. Senator Evans set himself up in this chamber as a constitutional authority of principle but in fact he has now been exposed as a hack lawyer on Caucus decisions who is able to pick up a brief on either side of the debate and put some sort of a front on it, throwing all his so-called principles to the wind. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. There is no question about that. Senator Siddons asked: Does the Liberal Party believe in blocking money Bills or not? There is no question about that. I stand right behind what Mr Odgers, the former Clerk of the Senate, said in his book about that. Let there be no doubt about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the Australian Democrats. I was terribly tempted to talk with regard to the Democrats about political opportunism at its worst. That has been suggested by many, both within this Parliament and outside it. Really, I say sincerely to the Democrats that that was my first reaction when I read what Senator Chipp was saying: 'We are now going to vote against these Bills'. At first I could not believe it because I have always thought that Senator Chipp is a man of principle. Then I thought: 'He is now exposed as a political opportunist of the worst kind'. I find that extremely difficult to believe because I have seen Senator Chipp within the Liberal Party for many years. I was associated with him on one or two committees of the Liberal Party and I have seen him in this chamber. I just could not believe it. </PARA>
<PARA> But last night, when Senator Siddons was talking in this chamber, the penny dropped. I must say that I offer to the Democrats my sincere sympathy. The answer just came to me last night. When the Democrats were elected to this chamber they were saying: 'We are not going to say what we will do about any matter in particular. We will listen to the arguments and be persuaded'. When that is first said one thinks that is a reasonable thing for the Democrats to do . It sounds simple. But once one realises what happens in the Parliament one realises that the real problem is that they have opened themselves to the lobbyists. That means that if the lobbyists, who want to be able to work on them , can send them enough correspondence, enough petitions and enough materials, the lobbyists will win the argument. It became clear to me that since the Democrats decided last year to defer this legislation and said: 'We will deal with it again when it is brought up in February', they have been inundated with lobbying material. I feel sorry for them because I know what it is like. Of course, I feel even sorrier for them because of what the future will bring. Until now they have been lobbied only by people from one side, those who are against sales tax, and, of course, everyone is against any sort of tax. There is no doubt about that. But wait until they are lobbied by the social reformers. The social reformers will lobby them all around the clock from all sides. They will be lobbied by those who are totally in favour, those who are moderately in favour, those who are slightly in favour, by those who are grey, those who are black and white, those who want this change and those who want that change. Truck load after truck load of letters will be delivered to them as they go into the matters which this Parliament will be debating in due course. I offer to the Democrats my sincerest sympathy. I can understand. Let us listen to what they had to say. On 26 August 1981 in this chamber Senator Mason said-and who would doubt that he was genuine:</PARA>
<PARA> I am one of those who regrets the events of 1975. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Mason says: 'I still do'. I continue to quote Senator Mason:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was something that should never have happened. The reason for making our pledge is that we do not want to see it happen again. We know that the people of this country do not want it to happen again. They do not want any meddling or messing around which will produce the slightest likelihood of its happening again. </PARA>
<PARA>Later in the same speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I return to the question that arises: Can we mess around with the Budget a little . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Those are interesting words. Can we just knock off a little bit of a money Bill? We are not sure what a little bit is. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA> Can we mess around with the Budget a little and if so, how much? Clearly, to reject Bills which would cost the Government a billion dollars would be going too far. </PARA>
<PARA>So, he puts a limit on it. A billion dollars is too far. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA> I assume that Labor senators would agree with me; I do not know . . . It really comes back to a matter of degree, does it not? Clearly the Senate has the right to alter the Budget a little. It has an equal right to alter it a great deal. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that it has neither of those and that in fact it has a right to reject . To continue:</PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the difference is merely quantitative. That is a dangerous path that would lead the way to the re-enactment of the events of 1975 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Later, in the same speech, Senator Tate put to Senator Mason:</PARA>
<PARA> You can reject it when it comes back here. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what we are on about tonight; it has come back here. Senator Tate put that proposition to Senator Mason and Senator Mason responded:</PARA>
<PARA> True; I will go on to that. We are facing that one. We are not dodging that one . True to our word, if the Government takes the reprehensible step of rejecting that request the Australian Democrats will not oppose the passage of that Budget legislation through the Senate. That is definite. It is a considered decision. That is the way it is going to go. Sorry chums, that is the way it is. Undesirable though these sales tax increases are, damaging though their impact may be--</PARA>
<PARA>It is recorded in Hansard that honourable senators were then interjecting. It is clear that they were honourable senators opposite. Senator Mason said:</PARA>
<PARA> Listen to this, senators, it is my bottom line. Those on the Labor side in particular should listen to this. Undesirable though the sales tax increases are , damaging though their impact might be, the consequences of the Senate meddling in or unilaterally rewriting a Budget seem to us too horrifying to contemplate. </PARA>
<PARA>Let there be no doubt that by rejecting these sales tax amendments that is precisely what they are proposing to do, rewrite the Budget, because, according to them, they are going to give some sort of tax rebate to those who would be buying the goods which are the subject of these sales tax amendments. Senator Macklin was good enough to tell the people of Queensland, and ultimately the people of Australia, what he thought in a letter which he wrote to the Courier- Mail in Brisbane and which was published on 2 September 1981. Senator Macklin said this:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats Senators acted properly in refusing to join the Labor Party's attempt to defeat the Budget legislation on sales tax, even though under considerable pressure. </PARA>
<PARA> The widespread criticism with which the sales tax lifts were greeted put us in a position to gain much electoral popularity by heading them off. </PARA>
<PARA> The sales tax provisions have many disturbing effects-on the building industry, first home buyers, low-income families, and they would introduce an unwarranted new tax on information-but the legal advice we have received is that they are part of the Budget parcel. As such, no Senate has the right to reject them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats were elected under a promise never to use our power in the Senate to block Supply-and rightly so. Nobody should want a repetition of the events of November 1975. By referring part of the legislation back to the Lower House, we have steered away from this possibility and at the same time we have given voters an opportunity to register their disapproval. </PARA>
<PARA>They were opening themselves in this letter to the lobbyists, and apparently recognised and welcomed that. The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> By taking the stance it did last week Labor-also pledged not to block Supply- has abandoned all pretence of political principles. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Labor did; it abandoned all pretence of political principles. I will skip a little of his letter; it is not really important for this matter. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Irrespective of the potential electoral backlash to the Democrats, we will not follow the Liberal and Labor parties in breaking election pledges. We could hardly claim to keep either of the old parties honest unless we are honest ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Democrats said. As I said, at first I was drawn to the conclusion that they were political opportunists of the worst kind in doing precisely what Senator Macklin said they would not do. But I have since come to realise that during the past five months they must have been subjected to an enormous amount of lobbying. During that same period I suffered very little lobbying. I probably had 20 letters over the whole five months. I have spoken with many of my colleagues. Very few of them have had any lobbying because the Liberal Party made its position clear. We said that these were Budget Bills and we intended to put them through. On the other hand, the Democrats said that they were open to argument, so they have been inundated with lobbying. They believe that somewhere along the line there is some political capital to be gained. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know what the Democrats' principles are. I do not know whether there is anyone anywhere who can say what the members of that party stand for. If they are open to persuasion on any Bill and may change their minds about it, who can say what they stand for until such time as they vote? It seems to me that after they vote apparently they frequently change their minds. I think that some of them wish that they had not voted the way they did at a later stage. This party has no principles at all. It once said that it had a principle, and its members were chosen at the last election on the basis that they would never reject Supply. It is now perfectly clear that they have no principles because they are open to persuasion on any Bill, whether it is a money Bill or not. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators have given examples to this chamber-Senator Missen last night gave an example-of the sorts of money Bills that the Democrats may reject. Last night Senator Siddons said that the decision which the Democrats made to reject the sales tax Bills was taken because they did not intend to increase a burden on the family, a burden on the housing industry and other burdens on the people of Australia. Therefore, they intend to reject the Bills. Where are their principles? They are open to persuasion for these reasons in relation to these Bills. What reasons will they accept in relation to a future money Bill? Clearly , the Democrats accept the proposition that they can reject any Bill which is presented to this chamber. Let me draw their attention to an editorial which was published in the Canberra Times last Saturday. The Canberra Times is not really known as being a newspaper which supports this Government. The editorial was headed 'Acrobatic Democrats'. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The decision by the Australian Democrats to oppose the sales-tax Bills in the Senate, repudiating their previous pledges to the Government and mocking their own pretensions to constitutional integrity, would be tragic if it were not farcical. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial then discussed matters, which I will raise later during the second reading debate, about the legislation before the chamber. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA> In theory, Australia has an equitable and efficient taxation system based on progressive income taxation with not much indirect taxation. In practice, the system is neither fair nor efficient. Income tax has become pretty much a discretionary tax for people not dependent for their income on wages and salaries, and for those in receipt of large salaries. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial gave some figures. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The figures are not up to the minute, but they give an idea of the magnitudes involved: a couple of years ago Labor's spokesman on economic affairs, Mr Willis , pointed out to Parliament that during 1977 and 1978 wage and salary incomes rose by 17 per cent and income tax on wage and salary incomes rose by 21 per cent. By contrast, non-wage and non-salary incomes rose by 37 per cent in the same period but income tax on them was down some 5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>They are interesting figures. The editorial continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Again, last year Professor Russell Mathews, of the ANU, pointed out that wage and salary-earners were paying two-thirds of income tax 15 years ago but were now paying four-fifths of it; that if non-wage and non-salary-earners were paying the proportion of income tax they paid 15 years ago they would be paying $3,000m more. The extent of avoidance and evasion implied by those numbers simply is outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA>I have been a very strong opponent in this chamber of avoidance and evasion but that is not the subject of this debate. There is a problem because the income earner who does not come under the pay-as-you-earn system in Australia is paying such income tax as he wishes to pay. We must raise revenue from those people. That is what the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and this Government have been saying repeatedly. We must broaden our base of revenue. To suggest that this will impose a burden on low income earners quite frankly fails to understand what sales tax is all about. It is not a regressive tax because there is no sales tax on food, rent, power and rates. It is clear from statistics which have been taken out around the nation that these are the major items on which low income earners spend the vast bulk of their incomes-purely and simply on living. They spend their money on food, rent, power and rates. There is no sales tax on those items. They are the basic necessities. Sales tax comes in on the luxury items. Let us look at them. People can buy clothes. There is some sales tax on clothes. But the lower income earners pay sales tax on lower purchase prices because they do not buy such expensive clothes. They can buy $30 or $40 dresses and pay much lower sales tax than would be paid by someone who wanted to buy a $300 or $400 dress. It is ridiculous for the Opposition to talk about the terrible burden on low income earners. The lowest income earners of all are the pensioners. Let there be not the slightest doubt that, as a result of this increase in sales tax , the consumer price index will increase. As a result of the increase in the CPI pensions will increase and pensioners will recover--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have heard one of the most extraordinary speeches in the Senate for a long time. It was easily the most negative speech that I have heard in either House for a number of years. There was absolutely nothing positive in it about the Sales Tax Amendment Bills. I hope the Australian Labor Party does not get upset that Senator Lewis denigrated it for only 10 minutes of his speech when he denigrated the Australian Democrats for 15 minutes and spent the remaining five minutes saying that sales tax is not a tax on the basic necessities of life, that clothing and footwear are not basic necessities. People can, in fact, go around barefoot. There is no law against anyone doing that. I do not know the extent to which people can go around naked. I think there are some laws about that. Senator Lewis and his ilk have a thing about the naked form, male or female. I imagine that they would be very upset if people walked around without clothing. How he can deduce that clothing is not a basic necessity of life continues to confound me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me be brief in dealing with Senator Lewis. The greatest crimes of the Australian Democrats seems to be threefold. Firstly, we listen to people. What a dreadful thing it is for a political party to do, to expose itself to lobbyists! Senator Lewis seems to have some thing about lobbyists and about people who choose to make representations to political parties. I have said time and again- during my time in the Liberal Party-that there are not enough lobbyists in Australia. There is too much apathy. The more that housewives, single parent groups, pensioners and trade unions lobby members of parliament the better democracy will be served. Senator Lewis accuses us of being open to lobbyists. The second crime, flowing from that, is that we are available to have our minds changed. I say to Senator Lewis-this will be entirely foreign to him-that I am very proud when I sit in this chamber and have my mind changed either by the lobbyists whom he despises or by the logic of debate from one side or the other. I say, quite unashamedly, that on several occasions I have had my mind changed on issues by the force of argument in this chamber. In fact, I had my mind changed today on a matter that will arise tomorrow. Senator Evans, a man for whom I have enormous admiration, changed my mind on the deportation of a certain person. I had an idea about it but I was persuaded to change my mind by the logic and the compassion that Senator Evans put to me. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that any member of parliament who has the arrogance to say that nothing that is said in this chamber will change his mind-that is exactly what Senator Lewis said-is flying against the whole force and thrust of the Westminster system of government. Does he not know what the meaning of 'parliament' is? The derivation of the word 'parliament' involves speaking, listening and being persuaded. Senator Lewis is notorious as one of the 12 Liberals on the opposite side of the House who will do without question anything that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) instructs him to do. His name is always mentioned in relation to that. Thirdly, he says that we are saving ordinary people a decent tax. He opened his remarks by describing this tax as a decent tax. The kind of logic that forces that adjective into his description of this tax astonishes me. I confess to Senator Lewis that we have been inundated with representations from all over Australia, from all sections of the community, about this iniquitous sales tax on the necessities of life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge Senator Lewis's interjection only for the purpose of having it recorded in Hansard. His inanity exposes him for what he is. One phrase of Senator Lewis's speech which I did understand completely was when he said that he has not been inundated by any representations. He said he has not received any letters at all on this sales tax on the necessities of life. There is a perfect reason why Senator Lewis has had no letters. One of the best kept secrets in Victoria is that Senator Austin Lewis is a senator for that State. That is the simple reason why he has not had any representations. Senator Lewis should come to my office so that I can show him a few files. Maybe he could read a couple of my letters. I will share a few with him. I have had more representations on this issue than on any other issue since I became a member of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate is debating nine sales tax Bills, most of which place a 2 1/2 per cent sales tax on what the Democrats describe as the basic necessities of life. This is the first time that a tax is to be levied on footwear, clothing and on the rest of the items that we mentioned. Most of the items covered are essential goods which no family can escape buying, notwithstanding Senator Lewis. I refer to items such as clothing, footwear and food wrappings. Senator Lewis mentioned that food will not be taxed. Has he been to a supermarket recently and noted the number of food items that are not wrapped? I am sure that Senator Florence Bjelke-Petersen will agree with me in a flash that an unnecessary and undesirable trend in our shopping is that everything that we buy is wrapped in foil or whatever. These Bills are the thin edge of the wedge in taxing food because they will tax food wrappings. They will tax magazines and newspapers. Apart from those items being necessities of life, placing a tax on magazines and newspapers for the first time philosophically is a dangerous precedent because it is placing a tax on knowledge. </PARA>

<PARA> If these Bills pass the Senate they will bring in $53m to the Government in the rest of the financial year. I got that figure from the second reading speech of the Minister for Finance, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. However, covered in the Bills are a number of items which the Democrats describe as non-essential items such as building materials for commercial enterprises. There are some forms of drapery which, I agree with Senator Lewis, are not essentials of life. Other materials covered include cleaning materials, machinery for the repair of cars and the like. The tax on these items would account for something like $12m out of $53m of lost revenue. The Democrats, and I am reasonably sure the Australian Labor Party, would be prepared to pass in minutes legislation imposing a new sales tax on those non-essential items. If the Government is sincere in its lament that the refusal of the Senate to pass these Bills is exacerbating its deficit blowout, it has staring it in the face $12m that could be collected from a sales tax on these items. It could pick up $12m in this way. I say that in the presence of the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government wants $12m to help its Budget it could begin collecting these taxes by introducing new legislation tomorrow. The Senate's rejection of these sales tax Bills on the necessities of life involves less than 0.2 per cent of the total income in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I support Mr Eric Risstrom, the Secretary of the Australian Taxpayers Association. He said that $53m, the subject of these Bills, is petty cash in the total context of a Budget of $40 billion. It is sheer humbug to say that it is anything different. I mention these figures because in latter days Mr Fraser and Mr Howard have led and orchestrated an exercise which can be described, even with prevailing charity, only as a tactic of deceit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal-National Country Party Coalition partners, whose one of few claims to fame is that they are good managers of the economy, have suddenly found out that they have a disaster on their hands with the current Budget. We have heard Mr Fraser and Liberals such as Senator Lewis who say: 'You don't have to like us . We are Liberals. Yes, we are conservative. No, we don't care to much about the environment. Yes, we will sell uranium. Yes, we do all those nasty things. But we are good economic managers'. That is always used as the one excuse as to why people should vote for them. Their Budget has palpably failed to estimate receipts and expenditure, one of the first requirements, I would have thought, of a Budget. It has fallen miserably short of stemming inflation, reducing unemployment or halting interest rates for home builders. They have done something even worse. They clearly led the electorate to believe that if the tax base was broadened by the imposition of additional taxes, such as a sales tax, reductions in income tax could be expected. I challenge anyone on the Government side to deny that that was the expectation the Government raised in peoples' minds if the Senate agreed to the increase in sales taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> All that stategy I have outlined is now in tatters with the Government's estimates of expendiure and income in catastrophic disarray and hopes of tax cuts dissipated. The Government's Budget estimates are over $1,000m astray. But as late as yesterday Mr Howard was claiming: 'It is not our fault. We are good managers. It is the fault of those beastly strikers in Bass Strait and those nasty Democrats'. I know figures are hard to absorb so I will present just a few . The Budget esimates an income of about $40 billion. The action of the Democrats and the Labor Party will deprive the Government of about $53m this financial year. I leave it to the common sense of Australians to conclude whether Mr Howard and Mr Fraser are telling the truth or telling lies when they say that we are responsible for the deficit which is now running at over $1,000m . If one wanted to use stronger language one could well say--</PARA>

But the Treasurer and Mr Fraser, together with the grand parade of non entities which the Government trotted out last night and tonight in the Senate debate, have tried to add more mischief to that untruth. They have stated that the action of the Democrats will now make it impossible to grant income tax cuts. This has been said by Mr Fraser several times.

<PARA> I have chosen my words on personal tax cuts carefully all the way along--</PARA>
<PARA>I rest the case there. This charge would be amusing if it were not being made by the Treasurer of this country. I refer to the charge that if it were not for the Democrats' action income tax cuts would be possible. The Treasurer by his own admission stated that the Democrats have saved people $53m of sales tax this year. Let us assume that we pass the Bills tonight or tomorrow night and that we can believe Mr Howard that after passing the bills the $53m extra would be given straight away in income tax cuts. Is the Senate aware of how much per person that would represent in income tax cuts? I have divided the number of taxpayers, roughly six million, into $53m. That would result in a tax cut of 17c per taxpayer per week. That shows the total absurdity and the total deceit of Government members who say that the $53m we are denying tonight is precluding the Government's giving tax cuts. Surely Mr Fraser or Mr Howard do not expect people to believe this. Although these Bills apply a tax of only 2 1/2 per cent to basic essentials, I know what governments do. People listening to this debate know what governments of any complexion do. Once this legislation this year applies a tax of 2 1/2 per cent to the necessities of life next year by the simple stroke of a pen the rate could go up to 7 1/2, 10 per cent or 12 per cent , and so away it goes. We believe it is just another addition to the long list of increased hardships imposed upon the Australian family. I will instance just the last 12 months. These figures were taken out for me today. I say that I find them shocking even though I am a politician and live with these things daily. The following are the increase in costs for the average Australian family for the last 12 months. I am sure my friend, Senator Florence Bjelke-Petersen, who is listening attentively to this debate and who cares desperately for the Australian family, will be fascinated to hear what I am about to say. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last 12 months health insurance has increased by $7 a week. As a result of the sales tax that we have already passed in this Budget another $2.20 a week has been added. According to Mr Risstrom another $18.20 a week is added to the price of petrol because of the reneging on tax indexation. There have been two increases. Someone who drives a car about 400 kilometres a week pays 60c a week extra. Taking an increase in mortgage interest rates of only one per cent on a loan of $30,000 and extra $6 a week is added. The average family is now paying $ 34 a week more than it was 12 months ago for those sorts of things. Yet this Government and people such as Senator Lewis want to add to that burden and put another 2 1/2 per cent sales tax on the necessities of life. Of course, that list does not include price increases on food, clothing, electricity, postage and telephones. The rate of inflation is again 10 per cent and unemployment is 6 .4 per cent. The number of new jobs created in the economy has been halved from 160,000 to 80,000 this year. Does anyone who is listening believe that wages and salaries have increased by equal amounts? Does any Government senator allege that wages and salaries have increased more than the increases I have just read out? Yet there is astonishment amongst Government senators when there are industrial stoppages, when trade union militants can appeal to the trade unionists to strike. They wonder why it is and conclude that it can only be communist influence. Mr Risstrom says:</PARA>
<PARA> For the majority of Australians their wages have increased 88 per cent in the last six years. During the same period taxes and charges for health care have increased by a staggering 240 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that in the last six years wages have increased 88 per cent and taxes and health care charges have increased a staggering 240 per cent. Mr Fraser and Mr Howard blame the Democrats for preventing tax cuts because we have saved families $53m this financial year. Yet the Democrats, together with the Labor Party, have already given the Government ample room to grant income tax cuts if it wishes. We have already given the Government approximately $1 billion more in this Budget in the form of further sales taxes. Together with the gains from reneging on tax indexation, this should give the Government room to manoeuvre. Notwithstanding this record by the Government of punishing changes in the economic and social circumstances of average Australians-put aside for a moment the proven deceit of the Government's Ministers as to the reasons for their mismanagement-the Democrats are the first to admit that conflicting principles are at stake in their actions to block the sales tax Bills. </PARA>

I advise him not to be recorded too much in Hansard tonight because my speech will be circulated far and wide to those people who believe in Senator Missen's so-called principles on blocking Supply. Our action in no way offends the pledge taken by Democrat senators before the last election 'not to block Supply or interfere with money Bills in a manner which would prevent the majority party from governing' or which 'might bring down the Government'. The astonishing thing is that Senator Walters in a question the other day and Senator Lewis tonight showed that they do not know the difference between a Supply Bill and a money Bill. A Supply Bill is a Bill which spends money; it is an Appropriation Bill. It is the kind of Bill that Senator Missen voted against in 1975, although he said that he did not. I will explain that in a moment. A Supply Bill enables money to be spent. A money Bill gathers money. There is a vast difference between the two and I hope that one day Senator Walters might learn that. These are money Bills and nobody is seriously suggesting that the denial of $53m out of $40 billion in a government's Budget could bring a government down. Is anyone suggesting that? However I frankly say that the Democrats would have preferred and would still prefer these Bills to be amended in the proper place, the House of Representatives. On that I agree with my friend Senator Missen. They should have been amended in the House of Representatives. I am worried-I have said that I have been worried-that the Senate is taking action to amend a Budget. I have said it is a precedent which I do not relish and I will say it again.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not care whether the honourable senator gets personal. If he ever likens us to the Democratic Labor Party I will sue him for every cent that he has. I think that in what he said he was hitting below the belt. Let me refer to Senator Missen's principles. On 23 September last year he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a view which I held in 1975, which I hold now and which I will continue to hold. I hold the view that it is not for this chamber to alter the Budget Bills of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>That is recorded in Hansard page 943. I turn to page 1241 of Hansard on 16 October 1975. The Senate was not dealing then with a small money Bill such as these Bills. Before it was the whole damned Appropriation Bill (No. 1) introduced by a Labor Government. Senator Missen was in Opposition. Senator Cotton, a Government senator, moved that the Bill be not further proceeded with. I can now look at the division, and who do we see voting aye? Surely we would not expect to find Senator Missen's name there, but there it is. Yet this man comes into this chamber and talks about principles on a money Bill when he voted against Supply in 1975. Now he has the effrontery to tell us that we are breaking some principle by voting against Bills involving $53m. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept the criticism levelled at me and the Democrats by editorials in newspapers that the Senate should not amend Budgets. I am deeply concerned at the implications of the 1981 Budget for future Budgets. But we believe that in these circumstances and in regard to these Bills people are not too keenly interested in esoteric and/or erudite arguments about constitutional propriety. The fact is that they have been savaged by a government for too long and want the Senate to take action. </PARA>
<PARA> Another major matter of the principle that we all ought to have regard to is that politicians should be responsive to the people in their electorates. That is one of the basic principles in a democratic society. I pay brief tribute to Mr Goodluck in the House of Representatives for at least paying homage to that principle. I believe that the intentions and actions of the Government are quite obscene. It now has the capacity to grant income tax cuts, but the intention clearly is to build up a secret kitty from which immediate tax and pension sweeteners can be extracted quickly in case of a politically opportune early election. If the Government wants to call an early election that is its business . But it has no right to play around with the people's money and store it up for its own sordid political purposes. That is why the Democrats will again keep this Government honest when it tries to validate the great petrol rip-off. The Government can try to bring in its petrol rip-off Bill and see how it goes. Mr Fraser promised categorically in Launceston three days before the last election that increased revenue from world import parity petrol pricing would be returned to the people as a first priority. That is another promise on which the Government has openly, blatantly and arrogantly welshed. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that these Bills have been a contentious matter. I ask Government senators to realise that in opposing them every one of the five Democrats has put his or her future on the line. We have put the future of the party on the line. We are prepared to do that, cop the flak and cop the lies that are told about us. If the Liberal Party wants to do that we have given the ground to accommodate it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bills be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bills that I now reintroduce into the Senate will impose sales tax of 2.5 per cent on a range of goods that are at present exempt from the tax. The measures represent the last of three groups of sales tax changes proposed as part of the 1981-82 Budget. The other two-an increase of 2.5 percentage points in sales tax rates and the correction of a number of anomalies and inconsistencies in sales tax classifications-are now law, operative on and after 19 August 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> I have previously drawn attention to the clear advantage that lies in effecting some change in the mix of direct and indirect taxes. I spoke then about the potential that such a change generates for desirable reductions in direct taxes, particularly personal income tax, as economic and budgetary conditions permit. The prospect of doing that depends very much on a broadening of the indirect tax base. In particular, the measures in these Bills must be brought into effect. One simply cannot discard measures designed to raise some $300m a year without jeopardising the capacity to accommodate other desirable measures in the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> Despite some things which have been said against these Bills, the Government, after full consideration, is of the view that there is a clear balance of advantage in proceeding with them, and I therefore resubmit them for passage. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators know, it is for constitutional reasons established practice to enact nine separate Acts when imposing sales tax. Constitutional consideratons also lead to these Bills being in exactly the same form as the Bills of the same title that failed to be passed by the Senate last year. The delays in their passage means that it will not be practicable to adhere to the planned commencement date of 1 January 1982 and, as the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has already indicated, a new operative date of 29 March 1982 has been set. It is the Government's intention that, as soon as these Bills have been passed by both Houses, a further Bill will be introduced to change from 1 January 1982 to 29 March 1982 the date on which these Bills will come into operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The approach in each of the nine Bills now before the Senate is to impose tax of 2.5 per cent on goods that are identified by reference to items in the First Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act, and which at present exempt the goods from tax. The technical effect of the Bills will be to levy the tax on goods that are at present exempted by items 51, 53, 54, 58, 60, 82 to 90F inclusive, 96, 105, 107, 113F, 120 and 120A in the First Schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> The broad classes of goods concerned are books, magazines and newspapers, building materials, packaging and wrapping materials, hand tools, clothing, footwear, drapery, soft furnishings, manchester goods, motion picture films, servicing equipment and construction equipment. I emphasise that goods falling within any of these categories will still be exempt from sales tax if they are sold in circumstances in which an overriding exemption in the First Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act applies. By way of example, where a school entitled to exemption under item 63A purchases books for the school's use, the books will remain exempt from tax. Similarly, where a manufacturer purchases hand tools for use as 'aids to manufacture', as defined, the tools will remain exempt under the 'aids to manufacture' head of exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> An explanatory memorandum covering technical aspects of the Bills is being made available to honourable senators and as this sets out more fully the goods affected by these measures, I think that I do not need to provide further detail at this stage. The net result of the changes will be an increase in revenue estimated at some $330m in a full year. The original estimate of the increase in revenue in the current year from those proposals was $132m. The delay in implementation means that only some $53m can be collected in the current year, a shortfall of $79m from that projected in the Budget Papers. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated earlier, the present Bills complete the legislative framework for the sales tax changes announced in the Budget, and it is desirable that they soon become law. It is now some six months since these proposals were announced in the Budget Speech, and Bills in the same form as the present Bills were introduced into this place. I therefore trust that the Senate will now give these Bills a speedy passage. In that spirit, I commend the present Bills, Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) 1981 [No. 2] (1982), to the Senate. </PARA>

Effectively the Bills seek to tax all goods that are not currently subject to sales tax except for food, medicine and wine. These taxes will be paid by the consumer. They will be paid by the average Australian household and will bear more heavily on large families than small families, on married people rather than unmarried people and on the poor rather than the wealthy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The attitude of the Australian Labor Party towards these Bills is as before. We oppose them and will vote against them. However, on this occasion we are somewhat heartened by what appears to be the new-found support of the Australian Democrats and by the continued support of Senator Harradine who, from the beginning, has opposed these Bills on the grounds of social principle as he sees it. </PARA>
<PARA> This change of mind by the Australian Democrats is welcome. It has been flamboyant in a sense, agonising, even heroic in a classical sense. It reminds me very much of that character in a Stephen Leacock novel who jumps on his horse and gallops off in all directions. In a sense the same sort of thing has happened to the Australian Democrats on a number of occasions. But we are happy to have with us on this occasion this band of 'Latter Day Saints' who have been converted to the position which the Labor Party has held consistently for a very long time. This change of mind by the Australian Democrats has been explained as being an error of judgment. I remind them that in some circumstances errors of judgment in politics can be very costly. But I say this in a spirit of kindly criticism, if I can put it that way, rather than in anger. </PARA>

<PARA> Sentor BUTTON-Senator Haines, I want to indicate the nature of that criticism because I said that people suffer from errors of judgment. The Labor Party suffered from the Australian Democrats error of judgment. We did not make the error of judgment but we were told by people like Senator Haines on 9 September last year:</PARA>
<PARA> I take the opportunity to engage in some backchat with Senator Button because he insists that we change our minds daily . . . It is therefore of no credit to the ALP, although I am sure that its members are acting within their principles as they see them, that it is hell-bent on taking or manufacturing the first opportunity which presents itself to get even. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Mason said a week later in a rhetorical question:</PARA>
<PARA> I ask my friends in the Labor Party: If we had gone along with them hand in hand down the short nasty path back to November 1975, how would they have liked it if we had started meddling with their first Budget? What sort of a world would that have created for this country?</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor Party has suffered at the hands of Senator Haines and Senator Mason from this error of judgment. We feel, more in sorrow than in anger, that perhaps there should have been a touch of humility towards the Australian Labor Party in some of the comments that have been made recently by Australian Democrat senators. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the Labor Party has been consistent in its opposition to its Bills. Fundamentally, the opposition arises from a consistency of principle and honesty in government which the Liberal Party Government of Malcolm Fraser does not have. He is the first Prime Minister in the history of this country to be described in the Hansard record as 'a liar' and for that to be uncontradicted. In that environment how can the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in his Government of Ministers in this House who have sought to explain this legislation do anything else so long as they follow that leader? That is the political standard that has been set by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of this country. Of course, the Prime Minister is concerned to run this country as he would run Nareen. The accounts are kept in a well-thumbed old exercise book. The people of the country are treated like sheep or dumb animals by this Prime Minister, and he is assisted in the process of running that farm, as he sees it, by a couple of jackeroos from the National Country Party who crack the whip whenever it is required. That is the standard which this Government has imposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government had no mandate to introduce this sales tax legislation. It was sneaked in after the last election. Let me be more precise about that. There was no mention of sales tax before the last election. Four days after the last election, in October 1980, the Prime Minister was asked on television in Melbourne what he would do about the introduction of indirect taxes. Do honourable senators know what his answer was? It was: 'No comment'. This was four days after the election. It took him that long to decide to change his mind or to reveal what was in his mind about this issue. I think I am quite justified in saying it was sneaked in after the last election. Not only were these bills sneaked in contrary to the understanding which the Government had given the people of Australia prior to the last election, but also they represent a specific repudiation of a pledge by the Treasurer, Mr Howard, on 12 March 1981 following a so-called review of the taxation system by this Government. The review embraced the question of whether the indirect tax base should be broadened. Following that review, the Treasurer, Mr Howard-the man who combined with the Prime Minister to deceive the Premiers at the Premiers Conference last year-said to the Parliament that to extend indirect taxation would be inflationary and the Government would not do it. So the Opposition charges this Government with repudiation of specific pledges which it made to the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will quote it to the honourable senator in a minute. He can just suffer in silence. The Opposition charges this Government with repudiation of a specific pledge. We regard that as an issue of good faith. The Government has said one thing and, as usual, has tried to do another. The Senate should not pass legislation for which the Government had no mandate and which it pledged it would not introduce. This point is made important by the Government's undertaking that if indirect taxes of the sort proposed in this legislation were introduced, they would be coupled with reductions in personal income taxes. The people of Australia are entitled to ask every Liberal member of this Parliament: 'Where are those cuts in personal taxes?' Last week the Treasurer announced that quite definitely there would be no decrease in income tax rates in the near future, certainly not before the Budget. What did the Treasurer say on 12 March 1981 after the so-called tax review was completed? He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Throughout its consideration of this issue, the Government remained firmly of the view that if a shift towards greater emphasis on indirect taxation were to occur, it should be accompanied by a noticeable reduction in personal income tax . </PARA>
<PARA>First of all, the terminology is interesting: '. . . if a shift towards . . . indirect taxation were to occur'. The Treasurer is saying: 'It would not be our fault if that actually happened; it would just be something that happened by some strange process of osmosis'. The Treasurer went on to say that such a change would be accompanied by a noticeable reduction in personal income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Budget Papers of a few months later to see what happened in that regard. There was a 22 per cent tax increase for pay-as-you-earn taxpayers in Australia. According to the Budget Papers an additional $3 1/2 billion would be gleaned in personal income tax. The amount is more if we accept the figures of some of the outside commentators. That is what Mr Howard said and that is what was repudiated three months later and again by the introduction of this legislation. In the same document the Treasurer went on to say that the purpose of the taxation review was to do the following:</PARA>
<PARA> Assess the desirability of altering the mix or combination of taxes, to the extent possible, in the context of reducing the overall burden of taxation; it was not about an increase in the overall taxation burden. </PARA>
<PARA>There has been a shift from one area to another. Let us look at what has in fact happened. There have been no personal income tax cuts: There has been a greater burden on indirect taxation. If the issue is in fact one of broadening the tax base in Australia, let us have a debate about that issue in this Parliament. Honourable senators in this place, many of whom are ignorant about what has gone on in the Senate over the years, are now trying to shift the nature of the debate. Senator Hill made a fine and thoughtful speech last night about the desirability of spreading the tax burden. That is very idealistic but has nothing to do with what has happened under the Fraser Government. All these speeches remind me of that character in My Fair Lady who, oozing charm from every pore, oiled his way across the floor. That is the only thing that Government senators do not do: They do not cross the floor, but they oil their way out of the argument which they ought to face up to in this Parliament; that is, that concerning the credibility of the Government on this issue of taxation. That is the issue that Government senators have to face up to. There is a greater burden of indirect taxation and there are no promises of personal income tax cuts in the foreseeable future. The Government is, in fact, increasing the tax burden. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue, primarily, is one of credibility. It is about the honesty or otherwise of this Government. It is about the legitimacy of the Fraser Government, something over which there has been a dark cloud since 11 November 1975. I use the word 'legitimacy' and not the opposite when I talk about this Government in the Senate. It is a question of concern of the legitimate aspirations of the people of Australia to be able to rely on what a government says it will do. The people of Australia cannot do that with the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Not content with this contradictory and deceitful position, the Government is bent on further misrepresentation of the issue. The Government's capacity to mislead has been well illustrated by its reaction to the Senate's rejection of these sales tax Bills. The Treasurer, with a straight face, says that rejection of the Bills by the Senate will make future tax cuts more difficult. That is bunkum in the context of the personal income tax take arising from the last Budget. Senator Chipp has dealt with that issue, and I do not want to go over it at any length. In saying that, Mr Howard makes no mention whatsoever of the fact that the rejection of the Bills will save taxpayers more than $50m this financial year. In a full year, sales tax would have taken about $330m out of the pockets of Australian taxpayers, the people whom Government senators say they are concerned about. These are the people the Government says it is concerned about. We are talking about mostly low and middle income earners when we talk about those on whom the imposition of this sales tax provision will have the real effect. The amount of $330m is nothing compared with the additional $5, 000m, for example, that the Government will gain next year from PAYE tax collections, based on the progress which is presently being made. To argue that the Government needs sales tax revenue which would result from the present Bills in order, at some unstated and future time, to offer personal income tax cuts is ridiculous, unless it is for the purpose which Senator Chipp touched on in his speech earlier tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to talk about the Bills and the Budget strategy for a minute. The Government speaks of the refusal to pass these Bills as endangering its Budget strategy. Senator Lewis had a lot to say about that matter tonight. But the Government's Budget strategy is clearly in tatters, with or without these sales tax Bills. Current estimates of the Budget blowout reach as high as $1.4 billion . We are talking about $300m-odd in a full year. The country is being pushed by this Government into deeper and deeper recession and an alarming escalation of interest rates is threatening every Australian. When the relatively small amounts that will be raised by this Bill are put into their perspective we can see how calculatedly alarmist and misleading are the Government's claims about its Budget strategy. In short, the Government has consistently gone back on its pledges, has consistently misrepresented the situation and has misled the nation about both the effects of these sales tax increases and the so-called Budget strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other aspects of the Bill which are repugnant. The Treasurer himself said in March 1981 that such a step would be inflationary. The Bills are regressive; the taxes fall more heavily on lower income earners. Public reaction is overwhelming against the Bills. People are right to be concerned that they will have to pay on average an extra $1.50 per week if these taxes are introduced. They are right to feel that the Government misled them over the sales tax issue. There are particular reasons for opposition to the tax on books and the necessity of life items which are dealt with by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills have also been discussed in the context of this first reading debate as an aspect of Supply. There has been a great deal of confusion in this place- deliberately calculated confusion, one suspects-as to the Labor Party's decision to reject the sales tax legislation, a decision which was made right from the start of this legislation being introduced. The decision is in no way one which endangers the Government. It does not endanger its Budget strategy, as I have tried to point out, and the Labor Party is not rejecting a Supply Bill or an Appropriation Bill. This is a measure designed to create new taxes. Over a number of years in the Senate the Labor Party has consistently opposed various revenue measures announced in respective Budgets. This case is no different from those on previous occasions and is classically in accord with what Government senators in opposition did to the Medibank levy, at great cost to this country, in 1974 and 1975. The then Opposition rejected it in the Senate. Did the Labor Party Government go away whinging like present Government senators have been about that rejection of a tax measure of this kind? What we had to do was establish Medibank without the levy. That is why we have had about six changes in it since under the Fraser Government. It was a stupid decision which the then Opposition made but we did not complain about it. It is a totally classic analogy with what is happening in connection with these sales tax Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very important to distinguish the position of the Labor Party on this type of legislation from the position of the Liberal Party in opposition. I do not think we should forget these issues when we hear pious speeches on this question from honourable senators on the other side of the chamber. For the benefit of those senators who were not here at the time, I shall quote what Senator Withers said in April 1974. Honourable senators will recall that in three years of a Labor Government the then Opposition twice put it to the jump. How can a government govern when it is twice put to an election in three years by an Opposition which refuses it the right to govern, not an opposition which just rejects a particular aspect of its taxing legislation? What did Senator Withers, the then Leader of the Opposition, and later the Leader of the Government in the Senate until he was deposed by one of the Government's palace coups, have to say about this on 11 April, after the first time? He said:</PARA>
<PARA> We embarked on a course some 12 months ago-I am not trying to be provocative-to bring about a House of Representatives election. That has now been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>Three months after the Labor Government got into office the Liberal Party embarked on a course to destroy it in this Senate chamber, as it did in 1974 and 1975. </PARA>

In those three years that was the course the Liberal Party adopted as a matter of policy, as stated by its leader. Liberal senators give us hypocritical talks in this place about knocking off a bit of tax legislation and chide or roast the Democrats about their error of judgment as if Liberal senators were people who could seriously talk in all intellectual honesty about anything like this. None of them can because that was the course which they adopted. In three years of Labor government they rejected more legislation in this Senate than in the preceding 70 years since Federation. Do not let us have too much piety about this question from people on the Government side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is one other important aspect of taxation which should be considered. When we raised the question of tax avoidance in the Senate we got the answer from Senator Sir John Carrick, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, that the Labor Government, between 1972 and 1975, did not do very much about tax avoidance. Professor Mathews said, in a paper given at the political studies summer school in January of this year, that if this Government devoted as much time to collecting revenue as it did to silly little cost cutting exercises, the people of Australia probably would not have to pay any more tax at all. That was the view of Professor Mathews. That is what he said about the Government and the tax avoidance issue. Senator Sir John Carrick says the Labor Government did nothing about it. All Government senators should have a look at reports of the Commissioner of Taxation. If they look at his report for last year they will see that he says that nearly $1 billion was lost by tax avoidance. Look at the report for the last year of the Labor Government, 1975-76. Is there a mention of tax avoidance in the report of the Commissioner of Taxation? It is not even--</PARA>

I know that the Liberal Party was not prepared to legislate in respect of it for a very long time until it was too late and all the tax avoiders had their bickies in the tin and were off to Surfers Paradise. Then it was prepared to legislate about it. The point I am seeking to make is simply this: To talk about the period of the Labor Government as though the tax avoidance industry was in the same class then as it is now is absolute bunkum, and the reports of the Commissioner of Taxation show that fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was referring to the question of Supply when I digressed. I think it is important, as we have said time and again, to distinguish between Supply and Appropriation Bills, the rejection of which would force a Government to an election-it is very hard to cop, but we will not do it-as happened in 1975, and Bills such as the present sales tax proposals. I said before that the Fraser Opposition rejected the Medibank levy-a classic case of this type of thing. There is a clear difference in attitude between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party in relation to the role of the Senate and the use which will be made of the Senate. This makes the present Government's posturing about the obstruction of the Senate ring very hollow indeed. I have referred to the Liberal Party's attitude when in government and when in opposition. I have referred also to the Labor Party's attitude when in opposition. I have found the quotation from Professor Mathews which was temporarily eluding me. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, if the same enthusiasm were to be shown by the Commonwealth for controlling revenue collections as for controlling Government expenditures, higher rates of taxation would be unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA>I just conclude on this note. We have consistently opposed the sales tax legislation as legislation which does not affect the capacity of this Government to govern. It does not affect the life and continuance of the Fraser Government. As I said before that is a very hard thing to do. We would like to make the Government walk the plank as soon as possible, but we will not do that. We profoundly differ from the Government on a question of principle. We have, as I said, been quite consistent in our attitude to these Bills over a long period. We do not think they will make much difference to the so-called Budget strategy because the so-called Budget strategy no longer exists. These Bills are just peripheral to the Government's Budget strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it quite clear, as we have tried to do on a number of occasions, that the proposals which we have consistently argued about relate very much to the whole question of the Government's mandate and its credibility as a government. If the Government wants to debate the question of broadening the tax base let us have a debate about it in Parliament. That is a very important issue on which I for one might not disagree with the Government as much as many of the government members think. If the issue is to be on the basis of lies and misrepresentation by this Government about what its intentions are, about misleading the Australian people, about promising one thing and doing another, we cannot meet the Government. We cannot even debate with it on that issue because the ground keeps changing all the time. One cannot have a debate in this Parliament about the important issues which were raised, for example, by the Asprey Taxation Review Committee about which very little has been done. One cannot have a serious debate about these issues unless it is a debate which is based on some degree of credibility on both sides. There is no credibility on this issue on the government side. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government promised that it would not introduce indirect taxes, until four days after the election when it started to say that it thought it might. It promised that when it took action it would do so in conjunction with income tax cuts. That promise again has been dishonoured. When we get some honourable statements of intention from this Government, if that is any longer possible, we can have a genuine debate in the Senate about honourable issues as this Parliament ought to do on the basis of a mutual understanding of differences of opinion and of philosophy. But we cannot do this with a shifty mob like this Fraser Government. </PARA>

<PARA> I feel that it is essential that at some stage during this debate somebody offers a compliment to honourable senators opposite for the consistent quality of the speeches that they have made on the sales tax Bills before us, particularly during the first reading debate. The speeches bore, as I am sure all honourable senators recognised, all the hallmarks of first rate political diatribes. They were full of hyperbole, purple passages and pseudo-tragic hand wringings and contained absolutely nothing of any merit whatsoever. Indeed, the deep, profound concern shown by Senators Missen and Watson for the purity of other senators in this chamber would have done the eunuchs in a sultan's harem proud. It was impossible, indeed, not to admire the terribly pretty picture the two of them made wringing their principled, honest little hands in alleged agony over what they saw as the rather misguided actions and lack of principles of some other senators. It will no doubt come as something of a shock to those senators and, I daresay, to Senator Lewis and to others that my colleagues and I can do without their little homilies, misguided and misbegotten as they are. </PARA>
<PARA> Since I am nothing if not a charitable soul and I work on the principle that one good turn deserves another I will give honourable senators a little reciprocal advice. In doing so I think I can do no better than to direct honourable senators attention to Senate Order No. 53 and in particular to that sentence of the President's prayer that seeks divine assistance 'to direct and prosper the work of Thy servants to the advancement of Thy Glory, and to the true welfare of the people of Australia'. A little thought on the meaning of that section of our daily Senate program could well prove beneficial to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of honourable senators tonight have raised the question of honesty in decision making and the behaviour of politicians generally. I agree with Senator Button that this is, in fact, the central issue of this debate. In his Budget Speech the Treasurer (Mr Howard) said:</PARA>
<PARA> For reasons that were announced at the time, the Government decided earlier this year against a major restructuring of the tax system towards greater reliance on broadly based indirect taxes. That decision did not rule out later consideration of smaller adjustments within the present system. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that there is advantage in some change in the mix of direct and indirect taxes to increase the potential for desirable reductions in direct taxes, and particularly personal income tax-</PARA>
<PARA>One wonders how much longer one has to wait in this country for the present Government's idea of a potential situation to turn into an actual one. Clearly, as Senator Button has already pointed out, it was not the intention at all, although it appeared to be so from the Budget Speech, of this Government to trade off income tax cuts with increases in sales tax levies. The new system was wholly and solely a revenue raising tactic. Unfortunately, we, like a great many other people in this country, were foolish enough to believe the Treasurer. We believed that the Government really was only increasing indirect taxes and adding sales taxes to a series of hitherto exempt items so that it could expeditiously lower income taxes. Unfortunately, but probably not surprisingly to most people who have watched this Government in action over the last few years, the Government played the electorate for suckers. It was only the combined action of the Opposition parties in delaying the passage of the Bills that, in fact, allowed this con trick to become patently apparent to the people of Australia, people whose welfare, I remind the Senate, we daily pray to act for. Despite what the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Messner, says he believes, taxes on items which we have no choice but to buy are regressive. If the honourable senator cannot accept that fact I suggest that he ask any pensioner or any person on a fixed income. Even if the Government parties do not have the sense to see that element we do. Our party policy takes it into account ; it specifically excludes these items from any change in the tax base. It has done so since 1977. Unfortunately, again we all know that this Government has at best a very tenuous grasp of economic principles or, for that matter, any other sort of principle. To watch as we have done in this place in the past few months , the Government search frantically and with ever-increasing hysteria for somebody else to blame for the mess it has run this country into would be funny if it were not so tragic.</PARA>
<PARA> The mire into which Australia is sinking is not the fault of a Labor government that held power so briefly in the early 1970s. It is not the fault of world market influences. Since, after all, we are fairly isolated we have been able to look after ourselves up to date. It is not the fault of the Australian Democrats , who have in the interests of the community at large deprived the Government-if it wants to use that word-of a piffling $53m. It certainly is not the fault of the last of the so-called bad boys, the Bass Strait strikers. Presumably the Government has now run out of people to blame. I trust that in the very near future we can look forward to it doing what the rest of the country has been doing for some time-looking closely at Liberal Party policies and actions with a view to seeing where it went wrong in order to set about correcting the blunders it has made. To date, of course, it has not. It has the remarkable arrogance to think that the Liberal Party and any party foolish enough to go into coalition with it has some sort of divine right to rule and that people in the electorate can sit back and take whatever the Government chooses to hand out secure in the knowledge that the Government is doing whatever is best for them no matter how much it hurts. Some of us are getting heartily tired of being told by this Government that it knows what is best as we watch ourselves rushing further and further into the mire. </PARA>
<PARA> To date all that the Liberal Party Government policies seem to have done is to squeeze the ordinary Australian one way or another for every cent he or she is fortunate enough to be able to earn. It is anticipating legislation that will make sure that none of that income earned gets ferreted away in non-interest bearing cheque accounts just in case this deprives the Government of some revenue. It insists on making sure that taxes, taxes and more taxes are applied to the pay-as-you-earn employee whilst calmly letting the millionaire Liberal Party donating tax cheats get away with everything short of murder. The Liberal Party Cabinet is aided by its lily-livered back benchers who are prepared to do the sort of thing that Senator Missen so proudly does regularly-bleat mildly and then follow the party line. They are eunuchs-every one of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, I am afraid that although this Government and its lily- livered-if Senator Chipp prefers that as an epithet-back benchers may be prepared to abrogate their responsibility to the people of Australia, we are not . This Government has to learn-I think that over the last couple of weeks it has started to learn-that if it treats the Parliament and the Australian people with contempt it will have only itself to blame if the Parliament and the people react by rejecting its draconian and muddle-headed economic policies. The extent of the muddle-headedness of some of its policies was made very apparent as recently as this morning in an interview that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) gave to a reporter from the Australian Financial Review. I shall quote a couple of sentences from that interview. For honourable senators who are vitally interested in it, it starts on page 6 of this morning's Financial Review. Half- way through the interview the reporter said to the Prime Minister:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Just before Christmas you and various senior ministers were saying that the budget was broadly on track. </PARA>
<PARA>That is quite the reverse, I might add, of what the Government has been saying in the last couple of weeks. It seems a remarkable turnabout for a little over a month. The reporter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> What has gone wrong?</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Why wasn't the Budget more carefully monitored so that the contribution to the blow-out from Government spending could have been averted?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer that the Prime Minister gave to that question in the long run was to blame overspending in the departments and to say:</PARA>
<PARA> If a department is starting to over-spend on the sort of rate you would expect throughout the year, it needs to be hauled back right at the beginning of the year, or as soon as the trends emerge. </PARA>
<PARA>The reporter asked:</PARA>
<PARA> So the previous monitoring hasn't been efficient enough?</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister responded:</PARA>
<PARA> Well, the habit of spending money just seems very hard to get people out of. </PARA>
<PARA>Undaunted by this the reporter pressed on and questioned the Prime Minister about the three-tiered tax scale which was introduced by this Government for reasons of simplicity and equity in 1976 and which appears to be no longer serving that purpose. The reporter asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Have you considered increasing the number of tax brackets as a means of ensuring that neither pensioners nor people on average weekly earnings are unfairly taxed?</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister has such a forward-looking policy-he is so au fait with what is happening-that his answer was:</PARA>
<PARA> I cannot pre-empt what is going to be said about or done about taxation at some time in the future . . . It seems to me that it is very hard to get people to recognise reality in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that it is very hard to get the Prime Minister to recognise anything very much at all. The reporter said:</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, when the three tiers were introduced, I think there was something like 90 per cent of people on the lower scale. That is no longer true. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> I recognise the problem of maybe average weekly earning people going into the middle bracket, and the Government does recognise, the problem that has not yet arrived, of people on the pension coming close to the tax threshold. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know how much closer he expects them to get without actualling arriving . He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Those problems never would have arisen if Mr Hayden had not introduced taxes on pensions. </PARA>
<PARA>The reporter said:</PARA>
<PARA> You have not abolished them?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Fraser responded:</PARA>
<PARA> No, we have not. There are some things that governments do that seem to just go on once they have been introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that says just about everything about this Government's attitude to economic planning, to honesty, to principles and to caring about the welfare of the people of Australia. If after this sort of comment from the Prime Minister this Government really expects the Parliament and the people to sit mildly back as we are driven further and further into financial despair, I am afraid that it is very much mistaken. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating tonight the 2 1/2 per cent sales tax legislation. I am sure that most people in Australia will be aware that these Bills have been debated in this chamber now at least three times. Because time is so short, I will not go into the detail of the reasoning behind the Government's introduction of this broader based tax. Suffice it to say that it is acknowledged world-wide that an emphasis on personal tax makes it much easier to indulge in tax avoidance and tax evasion than does an emphasis on any other form of tax. Enacting the Bills before us would certainly be one way of making it more difficult for people to indulge in these abuses. All the emotive words spoken in this chamber by Senator Chipp about children's clothing, all the lobbying by the media and the use of emotive words about a tax on knowledge and papers have been part of an attempt to exaggerate that 2 1/2 per cent beyond all reason.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is 2 1/2 per cent on the price of a pair of shoes, for instance? Let us look at some prices. Let us say that a pair of shoes costs $30. What is the 2 1/ 2 per cent sales tax on that amount? It is 75c. on $60 it is $1.50 and on $100 it is $2.50. What will be the extra cost of a newspaper as a result of this supposed tax on knowledge? It is less than half a cent. Yet all major newspapers put their prices up by 5c just a short time ago. The tax on knowledge is less than half a cent on the price of a daily newspaper. However, it is quite a considerable amount to the Government. A total year's revenue from the tax is $ 330m. We have not heard from many of the Premiers on this subject. We have to remember that part of this revenue, part of the $330m, goes directly to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us see what the Democrats have now denied the States. They have denied New South Wales $21m. Mr Wran has not commented on that. It will be interesting to hear, when the Premiers wake up to what the Democrats and the Labor Party have denied them, what the Premiers will be saying to their senators in this place. The States have been denied a total of $68m-New South Wales $21m, Victoria $16m, Queensland $12m, South Australia $8m, Western Australia $8m, and Tasmania $3m. I wonder what the Premiers are going to say about that. The argument that the denying of $330m in revenue to the Federal Government will prevent the Federal Government giving tax cuts has been pooh-poohed in this place. I agree; it probably will not. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) probably will still be able to manage some tax cuts. But it would be a very foolish person who would say that the Government, with $330m less in its kitty, can now give as many tax cuts or so great an amount of tax cuts as it would have been able to do had the sales tax legislation gone through. So, let the people of Australia be well aware that it is the Labor Party and the Democrats that have prevented the Government giving as much tax relief as it would have been able to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no problem with the Constitution regarding the Labor Party's refusal to pass the Bills. It has that constitutional right. At no stage has this side of politics ever said that it does not have that constitutional right to deny money Bills to the Government. We are not complaining about its right to do so. What we are saying is that it said that it would not do it. Mr Hayden said that it was not constitutional.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Hayden said that very clearly, but now he has changed his mind and has said that it is quite constitutional; and the Labor Party has said here tonight that it is constitutional. We agree that it is constitutional. We have no worries in that regard; it is constitutional. It is the Democrats who have problems. The Democrats really are a different kettle of fish. The Labor Party said right from the introduction of the Budget that it would not pass these Bills. I have no problems with that. It said that it had the constitutional right and it has stuck by that. It is the Democrats who have not done so. It seems to me that Senator Chipp has been allowing Senator Mason to cop all the flak in this chamber over what Senator Mason said when Senator Chipp was not able to be present in the chamber because of his illness. On 19 August, after the Budget, Senator Chipp appeared on the PM program. Simon Nasht suggested that the Democrats should stick by their professed election promise ' to keep the bastards honest'. Simon Nasht asked:</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Chipp and Senator Mason have been here for a very short time during the debate. (Quorum formed). I had been quoting Senator Chipp and I would like to quote him again. On the same edition of PM he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One can go through the whole budget and find dishonesty but I believe that when a Party wins the balance of power like we have on the basis that we're not going to allow 1975 to happen again, we're not going to let the Senate have the power to kick out a democratically elected government, I believe we're honour bound to be responsible and that's why despite your taunts, old buddy, I am not going to respond knee-jerk tonight. We're going to look at this, we're got several weeks in which to make up our mind. We're going to do it sensibly and responsibly after hearing all the advice available. </PARA>
<PARA>They sought that legal advice. On 26 August we were assured by Senator Mason in a speech in this chamber that they did seek all the advice under the sun. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, we make absolutely no apology for refusing to offer a knee-jerk reaction to the demands of either the Government or the Australian Labor Party. There have been several reasons for the much publicised delay on which we decided before reaching our final judgment. I suggest that the first was the sheer weightiness and significance of that decision-the question whether this would be a good or useful thing to do. The second reason was the conflicting legal advice which we received on the matter. There was good cause for that because this was a unique situation and one that the lawyers advising us needed plenty of time to consider. </PARA>
<PARA>We were told on 26 August that the Democrats sought legal advice. They considered the problem for weeks and they came up with a considered decision. Senator Mason made it very clear that a lot of thought had gone into it. In opening his speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA> In the normal course of events the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Chipp, would be giving the speech . . . Indeed, Senator Chipp has been the principal architect of that speech . . . Because of illness Senator Chipp cannot be here to give this speech, hence it falls on me to indicate a viewpoint and a course of action to which all five Senators of the Australian Democrats subscribe and which we all support. I stress that point at the outset. </PARA>
<PARA>He stressed from the outset that after due consideration each one of the Australian Democrats had decided that this was the action the Democrats should take. He repeated that further on in his speech. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I might add that the Australian Democrats are completely united in the view that I have just expressed. </PARA>
<PARA>They had considered that view and they were fully united in it. But that was before they got the lobbying that said: 'Come on. You will lose our votes if you do not do what we want you to do.' Senator Chipp said tonight that the Democrats received massive lobbying. We have all had lobbying on this issue from those with vested interests. Not one of us in this chamber has not had the sort of lobbying to which Senator Chipp referred. We have all had lobbying from all sorts of people who have said: 'You will do without our votes if you go ahead'. Some people have the courage to carry out their responsibilities but it appears not so the Democrats. Senator Mason, in his speech on 26 August, continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party members said: 'Come along down the garden path with us. We will hold you hand. Reject all the sales tax Bills completely'. We are conscious that that initiative would succeed or fail on our vote. Indeed, we are fully conscious of our responsibility in this regard. It is one to the people of this country, a responsibility towards stability rather than political intriguing--</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Mason said the Democrats would avoid political intrigue--</PARA>
<PARA>a responsibility to enable this country to go on in a reasonable way rather than not know from one day to the next-because that is what would happen-what the political future holds. The country would be in a state of crisis. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, it seems to me that Senator Mason, Senator Chipp and all the other Democrats came up with a considered opinion. Senator Haines is quoted in the West Australian of 4 September as saying that the Australian Democrat senators had signed statutory declarations stating that they would not block Supply or money Bills. She said that the sales tax Bills were unquestionably money Bills. I cannot imagine how any group of senators in this place can swear publicly and sign statutory declarations stating that they will not block Supply or money Bills-that was the Democrat's interpretation; it was not expressed by me or anyone on this side of the chamber-yet say to us later that they were in error and that they have had so much lobbying that they will succumb. They said that perhaps there was something in all the lobbying and they had decided to change their minds. Changed their minds they have. These money Bills, which they swore they would never block, will be defeated in this chamber tonight-that is, if they stick to their promise. They may not do so. One never knows. I will quote more parts of the speech Senator Mason made in August. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> When a government is elected by the people obviously its Budget is basic to its financial policies. Take that away from it and in some degree you remove its mandate. That is an opinion which is thoroughly respectable and which we feel we must stay with. </PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats told us that they did not agree with the blocking of money Bills. They told us they believed it would be detrimental to people. Yet at that stage they said: 'Take away some of the financial policies of a government and you remove its mandate. That is the opinion which is thoroughly respectable and which we feel we must stay with.' Later Senator Mason said:</PARA>
<PARA> We believe that if either of the two major parties is elected to government it has a certain mandate and a right to exercise it. A small party should not meddle or allow itself to be persuaded by somebody else to meddle with money Bills and legislation of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA>He did not refer to Supply Bills. His statement related to money Bills. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It would have been very easy for us to come out and say: 'Here we are, we are the Australian Democrats with the balance of power. Yeah, we are going to go in with the Labor Party and we are going to heavy these guys'. Great stuff! High drama!</PARA>
<PARA> Headlines! Terrific story. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Ryan interjected:</PARA>
<PARA> You would hate that. </PARA>
<PARA>She said it very sarcastically. Senator Mason said:</PARA>
<PARA> Well, we were tempted for about 17 seconds, Senator, to be quite honest with you. </PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats were tempted. Great stuff! Big story! They were heavying these guys. They were tempted for 17 seconds. Senator Mason continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we are not going to do it. </PARA>
<PARA>But they succumbed to that temptation in subsequent weeks. We now find that the great stuff, headlines, drama and a terrific story were too much of a temptation . Senator Mason also said:</PARA>
<PARA> True to our word, if the Government takes the reprehensible step of rejecting that request the Australian Democrats will not oppose the passage of that Budget legislation through the Senate. That is definite. It is a considered decision. That is the way it is going to go. Sorry chums, that is the way it is. Undesirable though these sales tax increases are, damaging though their impact may be . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He said the Democrats believed that the increases were damaging and unjust but that they would definitely pass the legislation. Very dramatically he continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Listen to this, senators, it is my bottom line. Those on the Labor side in particular should listen to this. Undesirable though the sales tax increases are , damaging though their impact might be, the consequences of the Senate meddling in or unilaterally rewriting a Budget seem to us too horrifying to contemplate. </PARA>
<PARA>Where do we stop? I could go on forever quoting Senator Mason. The statutory declarations that the Democrats signed were interpreted by them to apply not only to Supply Bills but also to money Bills. I have quoted Senator Chipp's own words. I have quoted the words of Senator Mason and Senator Haines on the way they interpreted the statutory declarations at the time of signing them to apply not only to Supply Bills but also to money Bills. Senator Mason underlined that. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I think the view of the bulk of the electorate . . . is that they would see any major tampering with the Budget, any major blocking of a Bill which substantially raises revenues for the Government or, indeed, a blocking of Supply or the appropriation Bills as possibly causing that constitutional crisis . </PARA>
<PARA>He assured us he would not go along with that. Senator Chipp and the Australian Democrats can never use the word 'honesty' in regard to their party again. Their supporters will not believe them. Their supporters looked to Senator Chipp who, in his flamboyant way, assured them that he was going to keep the Labor Party and the Liberal Party honest. His arrogance in saying those words was insurpassable. At the first opportunity that the Australian Democrats got to block money Bills, which they had sworn in a statutory declaration that they would not do, they succumbed to the temptation. It took a little more than 17 seconds to succumb but they did succumb. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button earlier this evening spoke about tax avoidance. I am not sure how he got on to that subject in debating these Bills. He said that he did not believe that this Government was doing enough about tax avoidance. Of course, under a Labor government we had the Curran scheme which was the king of all kings of tax avoidance. Hundreds of millions of dollars went down the drain under the Curran scheme which began under the Labor Government. The Labor Government knew it was on. Indeed, one Minister drew it to the Government's attention and warned that he might do something about it. He did not. The Labor Government did not touch tax avoidance. It said that the Curran scheme was causing the problems but it did not move at all. Senator Haines spoke also on this tax avoidance issue and said that this Government is playing around with it . Yet we know that when Senator Haines was in this place previously-she was here as an Australian Democrat for a very short time-she voted against the Government introducing retrospective legislation to cut out this abuse under the Curran scheme. </PARA>

Labor refused to do anything about it and Senator Haines, who castigated us tonight, voted against our measure. I am not sure what Senator Haines will feel when she reads that I have remembered that incident. At least Senator Chipp is now being consistent. He has changed his mind so many times.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note the irony of Senator Walters castigating the Australian Democrats for breaking promises. So revolted is she by such dishonesty, I wonder how she manages to live in the same party as Malcolm Fraser. Press reports of a claim by Professor Emeritus A. H. Pollard, the substance of which is that wage earners who have maintained the same relative incomes now pay a substantially lower portion of their income in tax than they did six years ago, have recently been widley circulated. They were eagerly grasped and incorporated into Hansard by Senator Carrick this afternoon. Apparently Pollard's article was published in some obscure publication not on the National Library of Australia's index and of which I have not been able to obtain a copy. But from the Press reports I gather that he claims, specifically, that a person who today has an income of $10,000 in 1980-81 terms with a dependent spouse pays 10.6 per cent less tax than paid by a person on the same relative income six years earlier. He claims that the same person on a $10,000 income today with a dependent spouse and two children pays 21 per cent less tax as a proportion of income than he would have paid six years ago and that a person on a higher income, specifically $18,360, with a dependent spouse and two children, pays 18.7 per cent less tax, again as a proportion of income, than he would have paid six years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Pollard's assertion is not only wrong but also his figures are wildly inaccurate. Pollard, of course, is a veteran toady of the establishment who occassionally moonlights by prostituting his academic position for the greater glory and comfort of the establishment. But I assume that not even Pollard would consciously publish what can so decisively be shown to be false. If he would not consciously do it, one could only attribute his false claims to chronic incompetence or premature senility. The correct figures for the specific incomes that he cited are: A person on a current income of $10,000 in 1980-81 dollars in 1975 paid just under 7 per cent of his income in tax at the same relative level of income. Today he pays 10.28 per cent, just over 10 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA> I return to Pollard's false claims. This toady of the establishment, this toady of the Liberal Party who has, yet again, prostituted his academic position, claims that a person on a current income of $10,000 is paying more than 10 per cent of that income in tax. In December 1975 a person with a dependent spouse on the same relative income paid less than 7 per cent in tax. A taxpayer on that same income with a dependent spouse and two children is now paying the same; just over 10 per cent of income in tax. In December 1975 on the same relative income that taxpayer would have paid much less than one per cent in tax. So in those two instances far from paying a lesser percentage of income as tax, as Pollard claimed, the person with a dependent spouse only is paying 49 per cent more tax, as a proportion of income, than he would have paid on the same relative income six years ago. The person with a dependent spouse and two children is paying 3,426 per cent more tax as a proportion of income than would have been paid six years ago.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Also associated with the question of taxation and wage demands are numerous claims peddled recently by the Government to the effect that increases in real disposable household income are the criterion of economic performance and government competence. It is claimed by the Government that real disposable household incomes increased substantially in 1980-81 and therefore that these increases should have moderated claims both for wage increases and tax deductions. The figures cited by the Government have never allowed for the increase in the number of households, which erodes almost half the recorded increase, changes in interest rates which, of course, have been upwards and changes in health insurance premiums. As real disposable household income is defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics increases in those factors are not reflected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> More important than the inadequate definitions and qualifications which the Government has supplied for the figures it has circulated is the fact that the most recent available statistics-those for the September quarter of 1981-show that, far from increasing, real disposable household income is lower than it was in the same quarter of 1980. In fact, adjusted for or converted to September 1981 value dollars the average disposable income per household in the September quarter of 1980 was $5,023. It has fallen in the September quarter of 1981 to $4 ,994. Certainly that is not a large fall but it is still a decline and not an increase as the Government would have us believe. Of course in those figures I have cited no allowance is made for increases in interest rates or health insurance premiums which have taken place since the September quarter of 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> If we take a longer term view of changes in disposable household income we find that under the Labor Government-which this Government would normally have us believe was catastrophic in the area of economic management-real disposable household income increased by 23 1/2 per cent. That was an average of almost 8 per cent a year for the three years that Labor was in government. In the six succeeding years it has increased by an aggregate of 11.2 per cent which is somewhat less than 2 per cent a year. Indeed in two of those financial years since the Fraser Government has been in office changes in real disposable household income have been negative. In only one of those years has real disposable household income increased by as much as or more than it did in the year with the lowest increase under the Labor Government. So much for household income and Pollard's false assertions on relative taxation levels. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party, as Senator Button has already stated, will oppose these Bills at the second reading stage and, with the assistance of the Australian Democrats , will defeat them. I understand that at least one other senator will vote against them. We oppose the whole package of sales tax Bills originally introduced on Budget night in August of last year. We have opposed them at all stages and at all times. I will summarise very briefly the history and the reasons for having done so. We oppose these Bills because they are regressive and because the proportion of income they will rip off low income groups will be higher than the proportion of income they will rip off high income groups. They are inflationary and they will intensify the economic recession which was already in the pipeline when the Bills were originally introduced in August of last year and which has intensified since. They are unjust, inflationary and unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> That applies to all the Bills that were introduced with the Budget. They came in three packages. The Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1 to 9), increased by 2 1/ 2 per cent almost all pre-existing rates of sales tax. That package, regrettably , was passed by the Government, assisted by the Democrats, last year. The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill, which increased pre- existing sales tax on a number of items, imposed sales tax on some new items at rates of up to 27 1/2 per cent and reduced sales tax on a number of smaller items, also has been passed. The third group of Bills in the original package, the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A), are those which are before the Senate tonight. They seek to impose a 2 1/2 per cent sales tax on a wide range of previously untaxed goods. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills which are before the Senate-the first two groups of Bills having been passed in spite of the Labor Party-were estimated to yield $330m in revenue in a full year and $132m in this financial year had they become operative on 1 January this year, as originally planned. If they were to be passed by the Senate tonight or tomorrow, which they will not be, I understand the estimate is that they would yield something like $60m in revenue this financial year if they were proclaimed when the Government planned to proclaim them. In a full year the three groups of Bills would have yielded an estimated $982m of which $330m is attributable to the Bills before the Senate now. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) were thrown backwards and forwards on several occasions between the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Bills contain what the Australian Democrats have asserted to be, to use their words, the necessities of life. The Democrats have claimed and have probably believed that the taxes imposed by the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) are more regressive than are the sales taxes imposed by the other Bills which have already been passed. They are wrong in making that assumption. There is almost no difference between the degree of regressivity in the entire package as originally introduced with the Budget in August of last year and that in the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) which are the subject of debate now. </PARA>
<PARA> In round terms the regressivity works in this way: The Australian Bureau of Statistics, in its most recent survey of household expenditure, which regrettably was six years ago, has identified six strata of income. The lowest income stratum will pay twice as much, as a proportion of income, based on the expenditure pattern of 1975-76, as the highest income group. As a result of the increases in sales tax from the three different packages of Bills as a whole-the whole original $822m-the lowest income group will pay as a proportion of income twice as much tax as the highest income group. The four intervening groups will pay about the same amount and will fall about half-way between the lowest and highest income groups. In other words, as a proportion of income they will pay about 70 per cent or 75 per cent as much as the lowest income group. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not detail the history of the Australian Democrats' reactions to this package of sales tax Bills through all its contradictions and contortions. However, it should be noted that their rationale for opposing what they call a tax on the necessities of life is based on a specious assumption that the so-called necessities of life impose taxation more regressive than do the entire three groups of Bills. It befits a Mickey Mouse party that it should make such an inaccurate assumption. I also note that the Democrats' repudiation last week of what was previously claimed to be a highly principled position befits a party which is led by somebody who discovered principles only when Malcolm Fraser sacked him from the Ministry in 1975.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recent arguments advanced by the Government in defence of these sales tax hikes are even more spurious than those advanced by the Democrats in support of their position and the multiple changes in that position. I will demolish the spurious Government's arguments. The first one is the claim that failure to pass these Bills and impose the taxes contained in them from 1 January has caused the deficit blowout. If the Bills had become operative on 1 January they would have yielded $130m or $132m this financial year. But the Budget deficit is blowing out by about $1.4 billion, a factor ten times as high as the loss of revenue from these Bills. At the most-at the very worst, from the Government's point of view-the rejection of these Bills will be responsible for about 10 per cent of that Budget deficit blowout. The second specious argument used by the Government is that a refusal to pass these Bills will preclude income tax cuts either later this financial year or next financial year. If income tax cuts were the inevitable consequence of sales tax increases, why was no income tax cut amendment Bill introduced or foreshadowed in August last year when the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and everybody else in the Government expected these Bills to pass without difficulty?</PARA>
<PARA> That particular claim by the Government is a retrospective rationalisation of the abandonment of the Prime Minister's repeated promises to reduce personal income tax or even, indeed, to cease harvesting massive tax increases due to what economists call fiscal drag and what the Prime Minister used to call the secret tax of inflation. As for next financial year, in the context of possible changes in income tax collections, the rejection of these Bills will cost the revenue about $330m which is insignificant when compared with the $5.5 billion increase in personal taxation which the secretary of the Australian Taxpayers Association, Mr Risstrom, estimates will be yielded to the Government. That figure, in real terms, is about $2.5 billion, even after adjustment for the lower value of taxation revenue caused by increasing inflation. On Mr Risstrom's projections, even after we have adjusted for that, what Mr Fraser used to call the secret tax of inflation, and what he used to catigate piously as the secret tax of inflation, will increase the real revenue available to this Government from personal income tax by $2.5 billion or more. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has the temerity to claim that the rejection of the sales tax Bills which would have yielded a paltry $330m, about 13 per cent of that total, has precluded changes in income tax in the next financial year. The Government claims that it cannot balance the Budget unless it receives the revenue that it planned to receive from these Bills. Leaving aside the fact that the Budget is already grossly unbalanced and that an unbalanced Budget may not be inappropriate for an economy sliding into deep recession, as the Australian economy currently is, the Government has in fact a wide variety of alternative sources of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, and most importantly, it could crack down on tax evasion which, according to Professor Mathews, results in the loss to revenue of $7 billion a year. I think that estimate is probably high but an estimate of the cost to revenue of $3 billion is highly credible. Senator Walters attempts to run away from this issue by saying: 'Your government did not stop tax evasion'. She actually said that our Labor Government did nothing to stop tax evasion, which is not true. There were at least eight specific amendments to the Taxation Act for that purpose passed in the three years of the Labor Government. She has some justification for castigating the Australian Labor Party for having been tardy in legislating against the Curran scheme, although I note that her Government was even more tardy; it took nearly one and a half years to do it. But, never mind whether the Labor Government was more reprehensible or more negligent in this area than the Fraser Government used to be, the important issue is what is going on right now. </PARA>
<PARA> What is going on right now is that at least $3 billion is being lost to revenue through tax evasion which would be stopped immediately by the credible threat of retrospective legislation. I say the credible threat because I do not believe it would be necessary to legislate, certainly not more than once, so long as the threat was believed. As I have said, $330m is an insignificant amount compared with what the Government chooses to forgo because it refuses to crack down on tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, but less important quantitatively, the Government could cut out some or most of the sixty-four tax concession which were the subject of questions on notice from my colleague Ralph Willis and which appear in the House of Representatives Hansard of 16 February. Two thirds of those 64 questions about concessions could not be or were not costed-a prime example, I presume, of responsible government in operation! The Government writes 40-odd concessions into the income tax legislation and it does not even know what the cost to revenue of those 40 concessions is, or if it does know it will not tell. The one -third that were costed in the replies to Ralph Willis's questions amounted to more than $1 billion a year cost to revenue on a full year basis. Most of those concessions were introduced by the Fraser Government usually without costing, or sometimes with a dishonest costing initially, and usually not only uncosted but also straight off the top of the Prime Ministerial head without paper, without written submissions to Cabinet and without prior departmental consultations. </PARA>
<PARA> The most notorious of these, of course-although it is not the most expensive it is the most notorious in context-is the film tax rort under which it is possible for the Government to pay $120 by way of forgone revenue for every $100 spent or invested in the production of a film. In other words, it might well be cheaper for the Government to foot the entire bill for film production than to subsidise it through the taxation system in this way. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) did not supply an answer to Ralph Willis on that one but earlier estimates which came from the Department of the Treasury show that this is likely to cost $20m this financial year. That idea was put to Cabinet straight off the top of the Prime Ministerial head upon which it had apparently been placed by some make-up assistant in a Sydney television studio. Again that is responsible government in operation! When John Stone found out about it he went beserk. He and the other boffins in the Treasury are currently trying to repair the haemorrhage of revenue caused by political stupidity and irresponsibility by defining production costs so tightly and I suppose even unrealistically or unfairly. They intend to stop the revenue haemorrhage in that way. That, of course, is an understandable reaction by responsible bureaucrats though it is no substitute and is no acceptable alternative to responsible and sensible government in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the costed concessions-costed that is in the answer to Ralph Willis's question-are primary producers' concessions which incidentally directly benefit half the Federal Cabinet including the Prime Minister. Let me give a few of them . One is primary producers income tax averaging at a cost of $215m. John Stone, the Treasury's Secretary, publicly described this at the Agricultural Outlook Conference last year as a system which operates in this way: Heads the farmers win and tails all other taxpayers lose. The admitted cost is $215m. There is a valid case for tax averaging; there is no case for tax averaging as it has operated since the legislation was amended by this Government in 1978 as a result of yet another stupid and irresponsible Prime Ministerial promise given before the 1977 election. This is one of those very rare events in the life of this Government and this Prime Minister; it is one promise that was kept. He made a promise to himself and he kept it. He has hardly kept any promise he has ever made to anyone else. The primary production component of the investment allowance and the 20 per cent special depreciation allowance together are another $95m. I regret that time does not allow me to detail the rest of these outrageous rorts under which the Government could easily raise more revenue than it will be forced to forgo by the rejection of these Bills. </PARA>

I opposed them on that occasion and I oppose them now that they have been returned to us. I am happy to say-I express the feelings of other senators-that I only have five minutes of time this evening to express a few words again in opposition to these particular measures. After all, they are measures which will affect virtually every family, every consumer and every wage earner in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The wide ranging nature of the drag-net in these sales tax Bills will cover a number of items which are essential for daily living. I will give some examples of these items; some are for daily living and some are for weekly or annual living. I would like to bring the debate down to readily identifiable items. The Government proposes for the first time, as I understand these Bills, to impose a sales tax on overalls, baby napkins, gloves, hats, footwear, household drapery and soft furnishings including bedspreads, loose furniture covers, mattress covers, curtains, towels, bunny rugs, yarns for knitting, sewing and tapestry, blankets, novels, text books, even knitting books and building materials. It has been estimated by one authoritative source that the extension of sales tax to items such as timber, timber frames, brick, lime, concrete, cement, bolts, door frames, et cetera will add an extra $500 to the overall construction cost of the average dwelling. There are, of course, some other rather unusual items caught up in the Government's drag-net, such as academic and legal robes, including barrister's wigs, kilts and sporrans, and lodge clothing such as aprons. So we have babies in nappies, barristers in wigs and Scotsmen in sporrans all affected by the extension of sales tax to goods which were previously exempt. We, as a Senate, must consider these matters very carefully as they cover a wide spectrum . </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, it has been said by the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) in her second reading speech that if these Bills operate from the prospective date there will be an increase in revenue to the Treasury of some $53m. As has already been said in debate, that figure could be reduced by something in the order of $12m. I certainly would not be one to support an amendment to this proposition to give the Government that figure. I am particularly concerned about the attempt by the Government, almost by stealth, to change the mix of taxation within Australia without an appropriate debate on the subject matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to deal with a facet of immigration. I say at the outset that had we adopted the revised Estimates committee system which was proposed-many hopes and aspirations were associated with that proposal-Estimates committees would operate on an ongoing basis and it would not be necessary for me to prolong the sittings of the Senate beyond 11 o' clock at night. I make that criticism particularly in relation to Estimates Committee D. Unlike the other Estimates committees, last year when the motion for the adoption of the report of Estimates Committee D was moved we tacked on a further motion referring specifically to the need for a continuing monitoring of our immigration program because of a changing pattern in that program. I have given the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) a copy of that fateful motion, which was adopted by honourable senators. I seek leave to have a copy of it incorporated in Hansard, Mr Deputy President.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Committee is of the opinion that the impact of the new Migrant Selection Scheme on Australia's migration intake, with particular reference to the country of origin of any refugee intake, be monitored by the appropriate estimates committee during its consideration of particulars of proposed expenditure for the remainder of the financial year 1981-82 and for the financial year 1982-83. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GM7">Senator MULVIHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks now concern the current policy on what might be termed sportsmen's visas. Some South African nationals were included in the Sheffield Shield cricket competition, but I aim my remarks mainly at the football codes, at both the rugby codes and soccer. Let me say quite definitely that nobody quarrels about sporting bodies making their own domestic arrangements. Conversely, we do not object to any country, much less our own, controlling its intake of people. By and large, we have been fairly reasonable about the issue of sportsmen's visas. I know that there has been a fair flow of both soccer and rugby league players. In years gone by there was more money in the United Kingdom in the rugby league code, but now the situation is reversed. It is slightly different with soccer. Tony Henderson has a $60,000 contract to play in the United States of America.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My criticism relates specifically to the experience of a number of 18 and 20- year old Australian soccer players with rather modest ambitions to play a season in third of fourth division in either Britain or on the Continent at an age when their game structure is not finalised. They thought they might possibly come back and inject something into the Australian soccer scene. I suppose that, in contrast with New Zealand, we can say that we do not look to Sir Arthur George as the complete oracle on that code. Since last November a number of boys have sought to play in the European soccer season. I rang up both the East German and West German embassies and was told in a very bureaucratic way that those boys had to be registered on an aliens' list and all that sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I do not object to the British soccer players professional union wanting a limitation to be placed on players, but what I did resent was that union saying: 'Australians and New Zealanders will be restricted, but if you are a European Common Market national the ball game will be different'. The thrust of my argument tonight is to ask whether the Australian Government will respond to that and say: 'If you exercise that power we reserve the right to do the same'. I know you, Mr Deputy President, were involved on behalf of the Actors and Announcers Equity Association of Australia and the Musicians Union of Australia on a number of occasions when the British actors equity adopted a different attitude from ours. I know only too well the very notable role you played in conveying the views of people from Actors Equity to our Immigration Minister and that certain negotiations took place. I believe that this bias against Australia and New Zealand and in favour of European Economic Community countries should be noted. Perhaps the Minister could convey to me in the next few weeks the position of United Kingdom and Irish soccer players in particular who have come here on two-year contracts. </PARA>
<PARA> Some years ago-I think Senator Baume figured in this-arrangements were made for summit talks with the Soccer Federation and the then responsible Minister. I think it was Michael MacKellar. The general idea was this: There was what I call pyramiding of a contract. For example, a player was signed on for a two-year term. That two-year term equally applied to some rugby players. If their form was good enough, they were granted three periods of two years residence, thus accumulating six years of continued residence in Australia. Arrangements were generally made in relation to their acquiring permanent residence in Australia. That was at a time when the EEC ban on Australian and New Zealand players did not apply. Of course it can go further. I have a case on my records at the moment which I might apply to people here who follow the Australian Rules code. A number of Gaelic footballers from Ireland are here on certain Gaelic sports assignments. I do not know whether they will ultimately graduate into Australian Rules football. Probably people such as Senator Evans and Senator McLaren who know that code better than I do might comment. The fact is that Australia is fairly reasonable and lenient in this area. I feel the time is opportune, in view of the attitude of the British Home Office in relation to the football codes I referred to, to get an early response on what our attitude is. I admit that this pyramid system that I referred to occurred two or three years ago but I believe that having regard to all the circumstances it should be looked at rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude on the note on which I began: Estimates Committee D was a very high- powered committee under the chairmanship of Senator Kilgariff. It was composed of Senator Sibraa and Senator McIntosh from our side and Senator Jessop and Senator Watson from the Government side. People have pious aspirations about the role of Estimates committees. Instead of holding up the Senate between 11 p.m. and 11.10 p.m.-I would like this message to be conveyed very forcibly to Senator Sir John Carrick by Senator Messner-if we lived up to the spirit of Estimates committees, and I am fortified in this by the thoughts of Senator Peter Rae, our Committee would have met during the first week of this parliamentary session. We could have had senior immigration officers before us and we could have got the truth of this one-way attitude on sportsmen's visas and possibly advised the British High Commissioner that we believe this bias in favour of the EEC should cease, or at least in turn we could take reprisals. I leave the matter at that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I raise a matter which is causing great concern to many parents of itellectually handicapped children in South Australia in the care of Orana Incorporated, an organisation in my State which was formed by parents some 30 years ago to provide a community service of the highest possible standard for the intellectually handicapped. Representations have been made to me and several of my parliamentary colleagues by concerned parents expressing disquiet at the way in which the organisation has been operating over the last few years. The concern of these parents is borne out in the 1980-81 annual report of Orana Incorporated in which it is stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The year past has been one where little progress can be reported, and the year ahead will be crucial to the continuig operation of Orana's community-based services in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The concern of these parents was communicated to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) by letter on 21 October last year and was signed by four parents. I have a copy of that letter. As I said, the concern of these parents has also been brought to the attention of two of my parliamentary colleagues; firstly, Mr Laurie Wallis, M.P., the Federal member for Grey and, to a much greater extent, Dr John Cornwall, M.L.C., Opposition spokesman on health in the South Australian Legislative Council. Dr Cornwall has had lengthy discussions with both the parents and people holding official positions in the organisation. I too discussed the concern of the parents with Dr Cornwall in November of last year. In the course of our discussions it was agreed that in view of the fact that an inquiry had been instituted by the State Minister of Health, Jennifer Adamson, we should await the outcome of that inquiry before raising the matter in public. However, on learning that the inquiry was aborted on 4 December 1981, Dr Cornwall, through his leader in the Legislative Council, Mr Chris Sumner, who is also the shadow Attorney-General in South Australia, raised the matter by way of question in the Legislative Council on 10 December 1981. A brief history of Orana and the concern of the parents was given in explanation prior to asking the question. To save the time of the Senate I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard pages 2613 and 2614 and two lines on page 2615 of the South Australian Legislative Council Hansard which deals with the question from Mr Sumner and the answer from the Attorney-General.

<PARA> Orana Inc. was formed by a small group of parents of intellectually handicapped persons more than 30 years ago. At that time there were no educational facilities at all provided for these disadvantaged people in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The original organisation became known as the Mentally Retarded Childrens Society. From the enthusiasm and dedication of the parents at that time and many who followed them, the organisation grew to a voluntary body which today provides 19 facilities-sheltered workshops, hostels and activity therapy centres -throughout South Australia. The activity therapy centres in particular were set up at the behest of the Federal Government. They were specifically to cater for those people with a low capacity to work in a sheltered workshop situation. Capital funding was provided on a Government subsidy and/or grant basis.</PARA>
<PARA> Recurrent funding was provided by widespread, well organised and enthusiastic voluntary fund-raising throughout the community. In addition, the Department of Social Security provided 50 per cent of approved staff salaries and some subsidies towards purchase and maintenance of equipment and premises. More than two-thirds of the running costs were met by voluntary fund-raising and small charges against the pensions of the intellectually handicapped people using the facilities. This was a very heavy burden for parents, many of whom were past middle age or on pensions. Nevertheless, it was accepted as a life-time commitment by them. After the financial squeeze imposed by the first Fraser Government in 1976, the organisation began to experience financial difficulties. It was by now a large and complex body providing a wide range of services.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1977 they applied for deficit funding to the State Government. This led to an inquiry which recommended changes in the administration to contain costs and streamline management. The inquiry found that administration costs had escalated alarmingly since 1974 while fund-raising, which by this time was being organised by so-called professionals, had declined markedly. Government officers concluded that, if the board of directors and the Executive Director, Mr Jim McLachlan, addressed themselves to these problems, financial viability could be restored. In other words, Mr McLachlan and his board were told to put their house in order . Despite these recommendations no effective changes were made at the time and the financial affairs of the society continued to deteriorate.</PARA>
<PARA> By 1978 Compton Associates Pty Ltd were engaged by management supposedly to find ways out of what was then a crisis situation. Unfortunately, implementation of the recommendations of the Compton Inquiry led from crisis to disaster. For the first time in almost 30 years parents were excluded from an effective voice or voting power on the new board of directors. Furthermore, the new board adopted the remarkable and reprehensible stance that it was no longer responsible to the members of the society, the vast majority of whom were concerned parents. Communication ceased and policies were promulgated without any consultation with the membership. All former methods of voluntary community fund-raising which had been so successful over the years were suspended and replaced with a so-called planned giving programme. The board demanded that parents must contribute regardless of their age or financial situation.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to this enormous imposition Mr McLachlan said in a report to the board in August 1981:</PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who does not respond to the request for payment or arrangement for payment should be handed over to a debt collection agency and ruthlessly pursued for the money.</PARA>
<PARA>He further recommended that any money or assets inherited by the handicapped persons be compulsorily assigned to the society. In the meantime, because of the continuing deterioration in the organisation's finances, fees charged for services at the A.T.C.s were raised by 100 per cent to $20 per week. This was taken from the meagre invalid pensions of the handicapped persons.</PARA>
<PARA> An examination of the published audited financial statement for 1980-81 showed a very serious financial position and rapidly escalating operating losses. Without a very dubious revaluation of assets, accumulated funds would have been wiped out. There are numerous examples of gross financial mismanagement. When a lottery organised in 1979 to raise funds by raffling a 22ft Boomaroo yacht failed, ticket moneys were said to be refunded. The yacht, valued at approximately $12 000, was sold to a person who allegedly declared himself bankrupt before financial settlement. The yacht has since disappeared.</PARA>
<PARA> Thousands of dollars have been misappropriated in the Riverland. In one case partial resolution has been accepted and police investigations dropped at the instigation of Mr Jim McLachan. Allegations of further misappropriations have been very poorly investigated. In September many parents approached me for assistance. At the same time the deplorable conduct of the executive director, Jim McLachlan, and the board were reported to the Attorney-General, Mr Griffin, and the S.A. Health Commission. At this stage parents were desperate to have the affairs of Orana Inc. put in order to ensure the continuing availability of services to their sons and daughters. At that time they believed this could be achieved by amending the constitution in conjunction with a private Government- sponsored inquiry. They were very anxious to protect the former excellent reputation and public standing of Orana.</PARA>
<PARA> I did everything I could to assist them during September, October and November. I scrupulously respected their wish that these matters should not be raised publicly. In November an internal inquiry was begun by a committee comprising Ms Ruth Prescott of the D.S.S., Mr Alan Bansemer of the S.A. Health Commission, Mr Robert Miles (Chairman of the Board) and Mr Bill Bowden as the parents' representative. The statement today by the Chairman of the Orana Board, Mr Miles , that the inquiry has been completed contradicts his circular to all members stating that he withdraw because of what he alleged was bias by other members of the committee of inquiry. In fact, the inquiry was aborted by his withdrawal. Instructions were issued to the paid staff of Orana by Mr McLachlan not to provide further information to the committee of inquiry or any member of the society.</PARA>
<PARA> Parents have become so desperate that they have now asked me to make these matters public in order to reinstate and reinforce urgent Government action. At the same time they are continuing their strenuous efforts to amend the atrocious and gerrymandered constitution. Despite all of these extraordinary irregularities, the Attorney-General has claimed that there is no legal platform on which an official Government inquiry can be instigated. That, of course, is complete nonsense. There are very large sums of Government and public money involved. The Attorney-General can and must now set up an immediate public inquiry. I ask the following questions:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Is the Attorney-General aware that the private inquiry was aborted on 4 December?</PARA>
<PARA> 2. What administrative, legal or legislative action does he propose to resolve the grave difficulties of Orana Inc. and ensure the welfare of 600 intellectually handicapped South Australians cared for by the society, particularly in this Year of the Disabled?</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Will he take whatever steps are necessary to suspend the Executive Director and the present board and appoint an interim administrator until the parents can reassume control of their society?</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Will he take whatever other actions are necessary as a matter of the greatest urgency to restore the financial viability, good name and excellent public image formerly enjoyed by the society?</PARA>
<PARA> 5. In co-operation with the Minister of Health, Mrs Adamson, and the Federal Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, will he give an immediate and unqualified assurance that all the existing Orana facilities will be supported in whatever ways are necessary to ensure the maintenance of their very necessary services?</PARA>
<PARA> The Hon. K. T. GRIFFIN: I have been aware, as has the Minister of Health, that there have been difficulties with the organisation known as Orana. Under the Associations Incorporation Act I do not have any authority that would allow me to suspend any person within that organisation. I am aware that an inquiry was instituted through the Minister of Health and that she has had some discussions with the Federal Minister for Social Security. I will need to refer those questions to my colleague, and I will ensure that the honourable member receives a reply.</PARA>

<PARA> Senator Chaney called for a confidential review of the group's operations, following parent protests alleging impropriety and mismanagement of funds.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the review lapsed when Mr Miles withdrew from the committee.</PARA>
<PARA> ''That report, including a Health Commission auditor's report showing the allegations were unfounded is now being written for the Minister,'' he said.</PARA>
<PARA> ''I withdrew because it was obvious the membership, the staff or the board would be fully satisfied with any finding or recommendation made by the review committee as it was formulated.</PARA>
<PARA> ''I am now insisting a complete review of Orana be carried out by an independent expert, totally unbiased and beyond reproach.</PARA>
<PARA> ''I am sure that this will be the only way to satisfy all associated with Orana .''</PARA>
<PARA>REVIEW 'NEVER WAS FINISHED'</PARA>
<PARA> Sir-The item ''Orana Review Tonight'' which appeared in The News 10/12/81 states that Mr Miles was a member of a committee which has just completed a confidential review of Orana's operations for the Social Security Minister, Senator Chaney.</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to point out that the report is misleading in so far as the Committee were unable to complete the review because according to a letter from Mr Miles the Board of Orana, on the 30th November directed Mr Miles to withdraw from the committee.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe the direction from the board was most unfortunate as there is no doubt that a review of the operations of Orana Inc. is absolutely necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> I trust that you will correct the impression given that the committee had completed its review.</PARA>
<PARA>DON BANFIELD, Life Member of Orana Inc, Daw Park.</PARA>
<PARA>CALL FOR ACTION ON ORANA</PARA>
<PARA> Sir-I refer to the reporting of a statement by the Chairman of the Orana Board, Mr Robert Miles in The News (10.12.81).</PARA>
<PARA> A check with the Department of Social Security, the SA Health Commission or any financial member of the Society would confirm that the PRIVATE Government sponsored enquiry was NOT completed but had to be abandoned because of the withdrawal of Mr Miles from the committee of enquiry.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Miles' circular letter dated 4/12/81 states: ''I have withdrawn from the committee and advised the Minister and the SA Director of Social Security of my actions.''</PARA>
<PARA> Further reference to the published and audited accounts in the Society's publication Gateway this year shows large escalating operating losses to 30/6/81 and accumulated funds severely affected apart from time by revaluation of property.</PARA>
<PARA> It must be remembered that the Society's property is very largely financed by grants from Government and in the event of sale such grants including revaluation factors are accountable to Government.</PARA>
<PARA> This casts doubts on the statement that Orana is a lot better off financially than some other welfare organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> A democratic meeting has been requested by members to amend the constitution and obtain greater representation on the Board.</PARA>
<PARA>S. F. PROCTOR, Bellevue Heights.</PARA>
<PARA>SURPRISED BY REPORT</PARA>
<PARA> Sir-As a member of the committee, set up by the Social Security Minister, Senator Chaney, to review the affairs and administration of Orana Incorporated I was most surprised to read the report (The News 10/12/81) that the committee had just completed the review.</PARA>
<PARA> The committee was not able to complete its task because the Board of Orana withdrew its co-operation. In my view the board took this action without convincing reasons.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to delay the Senate. I rise tonight, as I did last week, to bring up a matter which involves the current debate on social welfare and welfare expenditure in this community. I am glad that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) is here, but I did not expect him nor do I necessarily expect him to answer tonight. Last week I brought up the matter of a member of the House of Representatives from Queensland, Mr Donald Cameron, who was making one of his recurrent attacks on supporting mothers, in particular, receiving the supporting parent's pension. He , some honourable senators will remember, expressed the view that only supporting mothers who had been bashed up every night for a month by a drunken husband should be eligible for supporting parent's benefit-no one else should receive it.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is the little battler, a gentleman from my State, the member for Franklin and a member who, when he first became a member of parliament, spent some 18 months purporting to be the champion of single parents, first of all, because he claimed that he recognised that they had a great need, and secondly, because he claimed that he had special experience being himself the son of a single parent. He spent considerable time saying that he was-he received considerable publicity-the supporter of single parents. He seemed to take upon himself all the credit for the extension of the supporting parent's pension at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last night in the House of Representatives in the adjournment debate Mr Goodluck indulged in the sort of contribution to the debate on welfare in this community that both Senator Chaney and I at various times have said is unwise, to say the least, and does not contribute much. Mr Goodluck said, after saying that he had recently addressed many meetings of pensioners and elderly citizens that we should scrap the word 'pension'. He said that we should refer only to elderly citizens. He made the following remarks:</PARA>
<PARA> Elderly citizens should be divorced from the recipients of benefits; there should be a concentration by government on the elderly citizens. We should take it away from supporting mothers and all the other recipients of benefits and concentrate on the elderly citizens of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the gentleman who for some years spent considerable time proclaiming himself to be the champion of single parents in this community and who, once they had received some increases in benefits, as they know and as we pointed out at the time, quickly dropped them. Now he has found a new cause. He is quite happy to come up with the extraordinary suggestion that, in fact, the way to reform the social security system in this country is to take away the benefits from the supporting mothers and all other recipients of benefits and give them to the aged. I suppose it is the old divide and rule principle. </PARA>
<PARA> I merely passed the remark that those on lone parent's pensions and benefits in this community are, in fact, all below the poverty line. They were singled out by Professor Henderson as being among the poorest people in the community, and they still are. They, with the unemployed who, I suppose, are the other receipients of benefits whom Mr Goodluck is talking about, on any examination of the situation are, in fact, amongst the most disadvantaged members of the community. To suggest that we should be taking benefits or payments of any kind from this group of citizens and handing them to another group of citizens, whether they be age pensioners or anybody else, is unreal, unjust and does nothing for the development of the debate on social security in this country. I suggest that such remarks are merely publicity hunting efforts of Mr Goodluck. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Goodluck's remarks were reported in the Hobart Mercury this morning in a more coherent and statesmanlike way than they were delivered in the House of Representatives last night. He started his speech at 10.25 p.m. The Mercury goes to press at 6 or 7 o'clock at night. Quite clearly, Mr Goodluck had delivered his remarks in a more coherent way to the Mercury some hours before he delivered them in Parliament. I wish that the Mercury of Hobart would in fact report Mr Goodluck's speech as it was delivered. Perhaps we would then be able to see just what support he gets amongst the disadvantaged in the community. </PARA>

At that hour he would not have had an opportunity to look at his greens. I think it might be more appropriate if Senator Grimes made some comment after Mr Goodluck had had a chance to do that because, as the honourable senator has said, obviously the account is at variance with what Mr Goodluck has said previously. There is no way in which anyone could suggest that Mr Goodluck would say that the Government should take the benefit away from all the supporting parents and give it to pensioners. I am not querying the wording given. I have read it through myself. The honourable senator has not given the man an opportunity to look at his greens and make any correction. I do not doubt for one minute that in the past Senator Grimes has made alterations to speeches that he has made. He would not have changed the context but perhaps would have made an alteration because a critical word had been left out; I know that I have. I have listened to the tape and have been able to say to Hansard that I did put in the 'not' that it had left out. It changes the whole meaning.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very relieved that I was not kept away from the Senate for the adjournment debate because a number of the items did concern my portfolio and I was pleased to be able to hear what honourable senators have had to say and will be pleased to respond to them. The penultimate speaker, Senator Grimes, quoted a passage from the House of Representative Hansard which is reported at page 490. The speech was by Mr Goodluck who, as someone pointed out by interjection, is known as the 'little Aussie battler'. He has even been known to criticise the Minister for Social Security in his own party. Indeed, he has done that on a number of occasions. It would be quite unfair to suggest that Mr Goodluck is not deeply concerned with the disadvantaged in his electorate, and indeed throughout Australia. I find on the part of the elderly citizens among whom I move, a very great affection for him. Whilst I do not suggest for a moment that Senator Grimes has misquoted what appears in Hansard, I think he has misinterpreted and misunderstood it. In fairness to Mr Goodluck who, after all, has paid a great deal of attention to this area, I would like to read the relevant paragraph and then suggest the proper interpretation. I quote from the uncorrected Hansard of the House of Representatives of 23 February 1982. Page 490 reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point that came to mind when I was listening to a few of the speeches concerned the word pension. I think it has had its day. The word pensioner should be dropped. We should start talking about the elderly citizens rather than the pensioners. Elderly citizens should be divorced from the recipients of benefits; there should be a concentration by government on the elderly citizens. We should take away from supporting mothers and all the other recipients of benefits and concentrate on the elderly citizens of Australia. I believe we could introduce a new ministry with a portfolio concentrating entirely on the senior or elderly citizens of Australia. By the year 2001, 14.5 per cent of the population will be elderly citizens. Many will be on pensions and benefits for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA>There is one sentence in that paragraph which could bear the interpretation which is put on it by Senator Grimes. I suggest that the totality of the paragraph indicates that what Mr Goodluck was talking about was a matter which is raised with me periodically by lobby groups for the aged, that there should be a separate ministry for the aged to separate their concerns from the concerns of other social security beneficiaries, be they the unemployed, the single parent, the invalid pensioner or whoever. We do not have the benefit of Mr Goodluck being able to explain his words in detail to this chamber tonight, but I am quite confident that the totality of the paragraph means that Mr Goodluck is saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Elderly citizens should be divorced from the recipients of benefits . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He is suggesting a separating of the treatment of them. I am sure that he would hotly deny that he is suggesting that all benefits should be removed. I leave that to him. I have read the totality of the paragraph. I think there is a sentence which bears the interpretation that Senator Grimes has put on it but I think the totality suggests a different interpretation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLaren raised the matter of Orana Incorporated. I acknowledge that he has been patient in this matter. He has raised it previously. I think he has had explanations as to what was occurring before Christmas and he has not made any public statement on it to this time. He has now made a public statement in response to representations from constituents who are concerned at the delay between Christmas and now with respect to the advancing of an inquiry or some examination of the affairs of Orana. There has been some delay. It arose out of an unwitting breakdown of communications between me and the State Minister concerned in this matter who had been in consultation when the initial inquiry was commenced, although that inquiry was never completed. I understand that there has been agreement that there should be an inquiry under an independent chairman. I have spoken to somebody whom I think would be a suitable independent chairman of that inquiry. I have to say that I have done that only today. I acknowledge that there has been a delay. I hope that the independent examination will be able to proceed after very little further delay and I hope that my Department will be in touch with representatives of both the parents and the organisation within the next few days to discuss that matter further. I acknowledge Senator McLaren's interest in the matter. It is a matter which I also would like to see expedited. I have had direct representations from some of the people who have been making representations to him and I will, of course, be responding to those representations. The other matter which Senator McLaren raised concerned the change in procedures with respect to the payments of benefits. I have no information immediately to hand on that matter. I will seek that information and get a reply for Senator McLaren. I am sorry that I do not have it now. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the matter raised by Senator Mulvihill. I regret that I did not hear all that Senator Mulvihill had to say, although he has shown me a newspaper article which refers to the restrictions on British work permits for sportsmen from outside the European Economic Community-something which is no doubt a restriction on some young Australian soccer players although, as the article said, it might be greeted with great joy by the Australian soccer clubs which do not wish to see a foot drain from this country. I can give the Senate some information on that matter. I am advised by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) that we have rather similar rules governing the entry of sportsmen and women for Australian sporting organisations. Australian sports clubs may sponsor overseas players of a high standard for an initial period of up to two seasons subject to satisfactory contractual arrangements. Limits are imposed on the number of players who may be sponsored by any one club . The sponsor must undertake to be responsible for the full maintenance of the nominee, including medical and hospital expenses. In approved cases entry for temporary residents is not to exceed a maximum period of two years in the first instance. </PARA>
<PARA> There are apparently specific rules for the entry of soccer players. There is regular consultation between the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Australian Soccer Federation about these rules and their application. Currently the rules are that sponsorship of overseas soccer players is limited to Philips Soccer League and the premier competitions conducted in each State by member federations of the Australian Soccer Federation; that is, State League and first division competitions. A maximum of three overseas players may be sponsored by an eligible club in any one calender year and the total number of overseas players here temporarily in any one team is not to exceed four. Importantly, each nomination must have the full support of the Australian Soccer Federation. Any nominations received not having the Federation's support are not considered. </PARA>
<PARA> It would appear that the rules regarding the entry of soccer players into Australia are just as stringent as they are for overseas soccer players to play the game in Britain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The onus is on officers themselves to identify conflicts of interest and report the matter to their Chief Officer. Chief Officers have a responsibility to resolve conflicts in line with guidelines. To ensure that staff were informed, when PSB Circular1980/6 was issued the normal distribution of Board Circulars was supplemented by provision to departments of additional copies to distribute to all Second Division officers. Since then, the Board has written to departments a number of times, reminding them of their obligation to notify staff of the circular's contents and emphasising the importance of full implementation. In addition to this departments have taken implementation action including:</PARA>
<PARA> reproducing the substance of the circular in departmental staff bulletins and office manuals;</PARA>
<PARA> informing staff joining departments of their obligations;</PARA>
<PARA> reminding staff retiring or resigning of their post-separation employment guidelines; and</PARA>
<PARA> ensuring that selection committees interviewing applicants for promotion inform them of any potential for conflicts of interest.</PARA>
<PARA> Additional procedures are applicable where conflicts of interest may arise in relation to post-separation employment. Here, in addition to the responsibility of officers, departments are required under the Circular to identify and designate positions as sensitive where the nature of duties may put the occupants in a special relationship with prospective employers. All First and Second Division officers are considered automatically to be designated sensitive for the purposes of the post-separation employment procedures. Where officers resign or retire from sensitive positions, departments have a responsibility to inform themselves of any prospective employment and take the appropriate steps to ensure that the procedures are followed.</PARA>
<PARA> The Circular requires that the Board monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the procedures arising out of the recommendations of the Report of the Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interest as they relate to the Australian Public Service. Departments have been requested to record cases which arise and the Board will, at an appropriate time, undertake a general review of the effectiveness of the arrangements; the Board is, of course , in a position to secure the appropriate implementation of procedures in individual cases in which departments inform it of proposed post-separation employment of occupants of sensitive positions.</PARA>
<PARA> In a number of cases ministerial assent has been given to post-separation employment of public servants on the basis of certain conditions set by the Minister pursuant to the post-separation employment procedures. Generally speaking it would be neither desirable nor practicable to contemplate some kind of monitoring of the activities of former public servants who have taken up private employment with such conditional assent. In some cases conditions set may be such that their non-observance would be evident to the ex-officer's former department.</PARA>
<PARA> The guidelines set out in Board Circular 1980/6 apply only to staff employed under the Public Service Act and do not cover statutory authorities not staffed under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> Were a serious breach of the guidelines by a public servant to come to notice the disciplinary processes of the Public Service Act would be available. In the case of a less serious breach by a public servant counselling might be an adequate way of overcoming any problems.</PARA>
<PARA> The guidelines on post-separation employment require that former staff taking up employment which could involve them in conflict of interest should seek the Government's assent before taking up such employment. Once an officer has left the Australian Public Service the disciplinary provisions under the Public Service Act of course do not apply. The Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interest recommended (paragraph 13.33) that no additional legislation or penal sanctions be introduced in the post-separation employment area. This recommendation was accepted by the Government.</PARA>

<PARA> (1), (2) and (4) Since the introduction of the procedures outlined in the circular, the post-separation employment of 23 officers has been examined. Of these 17 were considered to warrant full examination by committees established in line with the circular. Three of the 17 examined by committee were officers at the Permanent Head level and the Prime Minister made the final decision about assent. The remaining 14 cases went to the relevant Minister for decision about assent.</PARA>
<PARA> As detailed below, assent has been given either by the Prime Minister or by a Minister in some cases subject to certain conditions.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australia Council has advised me as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Literature Board uses the following guidelines to assess applications from writers. These guidelines are as they appear in the Board publication entitled 'Literature Board 1981'.</PARA>
<PARA> 'Has the writer the literary talent and persistence to produce a work of high standard?</PARA>
<PARA> Would the planned work be retarded or impaired if the grant were not available?</PARA>
<PARA> Is the completed work likely to find a publisher and a market ?</PARA>
<PARA> The likelihood of eventual publication of works written under grants is a factor considered when the Board examines applications.</PARA>
<PARA> The Board awards grants in the following areas: fiction, poetry, playwriting, creative prose. The latter category may include autobiography, essays, histories , travel books and literary criticism.</PARA>
<PARA> Projects such as instruction manuals, university theses, guide books, works on the physical sciences and natural sciences, on theology, cooking, medicine or law and projects which are basically aimed at an educational market, are generally considered to be outside the Board's area.</PARA>
<PARA> The Board will not normally consider applications from writers for assistance with the publication of their own works'.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I am advised that the only restriction on consecutive grants for writers set down as a statement of policy by the Literature Board relates to fellowships . Literature Board policy on fellowships is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Fellowships may be awarded for a maximum of three years but applications for immediate continuation beyond that period will not normally be considered by the Board.'</PARA>
<PARA> I am also advised that the Board would not, however, offer a second grant to a writer who had not demonstrated (a) that the first grant was well used and (b) that there is a real need for a second grant.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In awarding its special purpose and general writing grants the Board does not consider an applicant's means but bases its decision on literary criteria, after satisfying itself that a grant is needed as a contribution towards the satisfactory conclusion of a work of genuine literary merit.</PARA>
<PARA> Fellowships awarded by the Board are intended as living allowances and may be awarded for periods up to three years. Applicants for fellowships are currently required to supply details of income received from all sources for the previous two financial years and the Board takes this information into consideration in deciding the award of fellowships. Fellowships are not awarded to applicants who have sufficient income to maintain themselves as writers on a full-time basis.</PARA>
<PARA> Among the conditions attached by the Board to fellowships is a requirement that recipients give up other full-time employment and restrict part-time employment to be no more than one day per week.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Literature Board does not have available to it details of all applicants' income. As outlined in answer to (3), only applicants for fellowships are required to provide details of income.</PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore not possible to say whether or not persons of substantial means have received grants. Among current holders of fellowships, none have sufficient income (apart from the fellowship) to maintain themselves as writers on a full- time basis.</PARA>
<PARA> The Board has always tried to assist the development of young writers who show promise of real talent. This has been done in various ways. Because funds have never been sufficient to meet all meritorious applications, however, some writers (young and old) have failed to obtain assistance which the Board would otherwise wish to offer them.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Literature Board has no record of a grant, or grants, being awarded to a Mrs M. Dixon of Perth, Western Australia. Two grants have been awarded to Ms Marion Nixon of Perth, but they were not consecutive. The first was a New Writers' Fellowship valued at $10,000, awarded in 1979 to enable Ms Nixon to work during 1980 on two novels; the second fellowship, valued at $17,244, was awarded in October of this year to enable Ms Nixon to work during 1982 on other literary projects.</PARA>
<PARA> The two grants were awarded on the basis of the Board's assessment of the work submitted by Ms Nixon to support her application; and on the basis of the Board' s judgement of the literary importance of the proposed work.</PARA>
<PARA> In the first case the supporting material included two books previously published by the applicant as well as substantial work-in-progress.</PARA>
<PARA> In the second case, the Board had evidence that the first grant had been well used. The applicant had completed the manuscripts of the two novels on which she had worked during her first fellowship. They had been submitted to publishers and appeared to have reasonable prospects of publication. In the meanwhile, a further biographical work, which is expected to be published in 1982, was written. The writer intends to work on another significant novel in 1982, as well as another work of non-fiction. If time allowed, she would also work on another novel.</PARA>

<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister and refers to the Freedom of Information Bill which was passed by the Senate in June 1981 and which has languished, with its second reading stage uncompleted, in the House of Representatives since August. Does the Government now propose to adjourn the House of Representatives without further effort to pass the Bill through that House during this session? Does the Government realise that, because of progress made in Canada, it is now most likely that Australia will no longer be the first nation operating under the Westminster system of government to pass freedom of information legislation?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the legislative programme in the House of Representatives was such that it was not possible to set aside sufficient time to debate the Freedom of Information Bill before the House rose on 18 November 1981. The Government expects that the Bill will be debated early in the present sittings.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 17 November 1981 (Hansard, page 2194) Senator Crichton- Browne asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Health, a question without notice concerning the Isolated Patients' Travel and Accommodation Assistance Scheme (IPTAAS).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Health has now provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> The question of advance payments and/or travel vouchers has been considered on a number of occasions in recognition of the difficulty some patients face in meeting the intitial costs of travel and accommodation especially where the patient makes such journeys at fairly regular intervals. However the legislation provides for partial reimbursement after a journey has been completed. This accords with the nature of the scheme as being a form of assistance towards expenditure that is primarily the responsibility of the individual while, at the same time, taking account of the acquittal requirements which involve consideration of the relevant incidents of the journey.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department operates the scheme only from offices in the capital cities and any advance payment mechanism would generally require patients to apply to those offices before travel commenced so that such aspects as eligibility and referral to the nearest suitable specialist could be assessed. Subsequent claims would need to be re-examined after completion of journeys to ensure compliance with the original referral, consideration of accommodation allowances, and recovery of the mandatory $20 patient contribution and any other moneys the patient may owe the Commonwealth due to non-compliance with the original referral.</PARA>
<PARA> In complementary schemes in the Northern Territory and some States, advance payment proposals have been instituted where, unlike the Commonwealth, they have officers in country areas who may be contacted by persons requiring financial assistance. I understand that all those schemes require the assignment in advance of IPTAAS benefits, where applicable, to the organisation or Government authority that provides the initial funds. In this regard I am pleased to advise that a similar advance payment scheme has recently been introduced in Western Australia following the finalisation of procedural matters with State Government officers. This scheme, which is being operated by the State Department of Community Welfare, enables a patient eligible for IPTAAS benefits to have access to financial assistance for fares and accommodation expenses prior to the commencement of a journey, provided that the relevant matching Commonwealth (IPTAAS) reimbursement is assigned to the State.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 18 November 1981 (Hansard, page 2272) Senator Mulvihill asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Health, a question without notice concerning the operation of health insurance funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> The comparison that the honourable senator makes between the election of delegates and officers of the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Railways Union and the boards of management and executives of the Hospital Contribution Fund of Australia and the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Limited, is not valid.</PARA>
<PARA> It has generally been traditional for members of unions to determine their representatives by ballot and, on occassions, to determine collectively action to be taken by their representatives to protect or advance their interests. On the other hand, nearly all health funds are either companies limited by guarantee or friendly societies, both of which in relation to representation and conduct of meetings are governed by State legislation. (The two health funds mentioned by the honourable senator are companies limited by guarantee.)</PARA>
<PARA> There is a closer analogy between the health funds and general insurers. In return for premiums, contributors and policy holders are entitled to receive benefits, subject to satisfying the terms and conditions relating to the payment of benefits. In the case of health funds, however, policy in relation to the eligibility for and payment of benefits is determined in detail by Commonwealth legislation enacted by Parliament. Health insurance, as is the case with other Government policies, is therefore subject to the democratic process.</PARA>
<PARA> Having regard to the closer regulation of health funds by the Government, I consider what is left for management is to conduct health insurance efficiently . In these circumstances, it would be difficult to justify requiring health funds to assume the administrative burden of arranging for millions of contributors to vote for representatives of management and to meet the cost that would be entailed from contributions.</PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, I cannot support the point made by the honourable senator.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 November 1981 (Hansard, page 2446) Senator Evans asked me a question, without notice, which raised the following substantive issues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Will the Attorney-General confirm or deny-or remain, I suppose, his usual mute self-the accuracy of the story in last weekend's National Times about the location, manner and frequency of operation of Australian Security Intelligence Organisation telephone tapping facilities in Melbourne and Sydney? Secondly, is it the case, as was claimed in that article, and indeed in a number of other places recently, that Telecom Australia technicians installing or implementing ASIO telephone taps are not in fact shown the authorising warrants, if indeed they exist? If so, what legal justification is claimed to exist for this procedure? Thirdly, what is the Government's attitude toward the extension to State police forces of a much wider range of telepone tapping power for criminal investigation purposes than is recently entitled to be exercised by those forces? Those matters, of course, have been the subject of recent strident claims in meetings of police associations and their commissioners.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. In accordance with long standing practice I do not propose to confirm or deny allegations concerning the operational activities of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation or the accuracy of media reports relating to such matters.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 provides specifically that copies of warrants issued pursuant to section 9 of the Act must be forwarded as soon as practicable to the Managing Director of the Australian Telecommunications Commission. This requirement is strictly complied with. Instructions to officers of the Commission to take action to enable an interception to be carried out pursuant to such a warrant are given by or on behalf of the Managing Director. The Telecommunications (Interception) Act does not require that an officer of the Commission apart from the Managing Director should sight a copy of the warrant.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The honourable senator appears to be under the mistaken belief that State police already have access to interception powers under the Commonwealth legislation. The Telecommunications (Interception) Act powers to intercept telecommunications and telegrams in relation to narcotic enquiries are available only to officers of the Australian Federal Police.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The Government is, however, carefully examining the proposals raised in several quarters suggesting the extension of existing powers under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act to State police forces as well as a wider range of serious offences for which interception power could be invoked.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Any suggestion for the possible extension of interception powers under the Act to State police investigating narcotic offences must be considered in the overall context of the report of the Australian Royal Commission into Drugs ( the Williams Report) including the possible development of uniform drug trafficking legislation. The Government has also noted proposals made, inter alia, at a meeting of the Australian Police Ministers in Hobart in November 1981, for broadening the purposes for which interception powers may be used. The Government remains conscious of the need to preserve the proper balance between the privacy of telecommunications and the public interest in effective law enforcement. I understand that the question of the extension of intercept powers is one of the matters on which the Commonwealth Law Reform Commission proposes to comment in its final report pursuant to the privacy reference. It would, of course, be desirable to have the benefit of the Commission's report on privacy in examining the question of extension of interception powers. I hope that that report will be available later this year to assist the Government in coming to a final view on this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's perspective of Australia's strategic outlook is very different to that implicit in the question. I will not debate the validity of either perspective here. The following answers are shaped by the Government's strategic assessment for the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) We are developing our defence technological base in accord with current strategic assessments.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Within their respective areas of responsibility, the Department of Defence and the Department of Industry and Commerce monitor and selectively foster Australian industry capabilities relevant to Defence production.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I will not speculate on the U.S. Defence production base but the factors mentioned are always important in any rapid increase in manufacturing activity whether for defence or civil purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Several Australian firms have extensive experience with titanium alloys in the manufacture of components for jet engines; the Government Aircraft Factories have manufacturing experience with carbon fibre composites. This experience ( which will be enhanced during the F/A-18 project) and the knowledge in the Defence Science and Technology Organisation provide a basis from which to develop such a capacity.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Some of the numerous possible forms of these items are stocked in support of defence production. For security reasons the composition and quantities of materials in Defence stockpiles are confidential.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) I understand the statistical data enabling detailed response to this question is not available.</PARA>
<PARA> I further understand that in 1976 the total number of machinists, toolmakers, and diemakers was an estimated 11,398. At 30 June 1981 there were 54,827 metal trades apprentices in training, an increase of nearly 5 per cent over the previous year. About 40 per cent of metal trades apprentices are in machining, toolmaking and diemaking. A large proportion of these trainees should be available to meet the manpower needs of the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The munitions industry presently comprises the eight Government munitions factories.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that based on a recent survey 35 per cent of the plant and machinery inventory of these factories is less than 20 years old and of this nearly 60 per cent is less than 10 years old.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) While it would be unrealistic to expect absolute assurance of overseas supply in all circumstances, much has been done to maximise the probability of sustained supply and support from overseas through the negotiation of Memoranda of Understanding and similar agreements. A range of such agreements have been or are currently being negotiated with a number of overseas countries.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator Durack</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The training of dog handlers and the acquisition and training of guard dogs for the Australian Defence Force are managed by the Royal Australian Air Force. The cost of locating and acquiring the dogs is limited to the use of Service transport involved in the selection of dogs offered by the public free of cost. This is carried out at little extra cost in the course of other duties as the opportunity arises. There is no advertising involved.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a and b) Dogs and handlers are trained together ab initio and a dog is assigned to its handler for life.</PARA>
<PARA> A specific costing system is not maintained in respect of this program, but the assessed cost of the upkeep of dogs and the salaries of the administrative and instructional staff of the RAAF Police Dog Training Centre was:</PARA>
<PARA>1979 1980 1981</PARA>
<PARA>$ $ $ 275,000 275,000 331,000</PARA>
<PARA> The salaries and allowances for trainees and the salaries for instructors ( included above) while conducting training courses are apportioned to each service as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>1979 1980 1981</PARA>
<PARA>$ $ $ RAAF  37,930 31,340 128,000 Army  9,310 2,610 22,390 Navy  5,735 7,830 3, 200</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The average cost of training a handler (ultimate) was $2,300 in 1979, $2, 600 in 1980 and $3,430 in 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) (a) The average annual cost of upkeep per dog over the last 3 years was $1, 190. The number of dogs in service varies due to wastage and other factors. The average strength of trained dogs during 1980 was 164 and the cost of their upkeep was $195,000; in 1981 it was 197 dogs and the cost was $234,000. Figures are not available for 1979. (b) Expenditure on the upkeep of all unsuitable dogs amounted to $1,434 in 1979, $1,536 in 1980, $2,376 in 1981. These low amounts are attributable to the rigorous standards applied when selecting dogs for training and the early rejection of unsuitable dogs.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) 93 dogs were acquired in 1979, 75 in 1980 and 138 in 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The success rate in training dogs over the last 3 years was 55 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Dogs considered to be unsuitable for defence work by reason of temperament, for example vicious or intractable, are destroyed. Those considered to be suitable to be household pets are sold for a nominal amount of $10 to members of the public chosen from a register of inquirers maintained for this purpose by the training centre.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the information provided above which addresses your specific questions you may be interested in details of the program the Army is conducting in the breeding and training of dogs for explosives detection. The cost of this program based on an average of 10 breeding/training and six operational dogs was about $235,000 in 1981. This included salaries and allowances of staff and the upkeep of the dogs. The difference in the cost per dog from the RAAF program is due to the peculiarly complex requirements of explosives detection training.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since January 1979, there have been no changes in the functions of the Department of Veterans' Affairs performed on its behalf by private contractors.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department is responsible for the administration of the Free Limbs Scheme and has a Repatriation Artificial Limb and Appliance Centre in each capital city . Since 1963, artificial limbs have been made available free to amputees from these centres and also from private contractors.</PARA>
<PARA> The Review of Commonwealth Functions report announced that the number of artificial limbs and appliances contracted to the private sector was to be increased. The implementation of this decision rested upon the private sector increasing capacity.</PARA>
<PARA> Since the announcement of the decision, private manufacturing capacity has been established in Canberra. Five other new manufacturers have been awarded contracts under the Free Limbs Scheme: two in Melbourne and one each in Wollongong, Newcastle and Bathurst.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 November 1981 (Hansard, page 2508) Senator Townley asked the Leader of the Government in the Senate, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Will the Leader ask the Cabinet to consider tabling in the Senate more frequently than every six months a manifest of the flights of VIP aircraft?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Parliament has accepted and acknowledged the present system of tabling the schedule of Royal Australian Air Force Special Purpose flights twice yearly. Under present procedures, the workload involved in preparing the schedule is extremely time consuming, requiring an extension of staff working hours to meet even the six-monthly deadlines. A considerable amount of time and effort is spent cross-checking the flight records with ministerial staff to ensure that they are accurate. It needs to be appreciated that the schedule is prepared from data contained in three different flight records.</PARA>
<PARA> Current working arrangements allow preparation of the schedule for tabling, and in particular clearance of any discrepancies, to be undertaken whilst Parliament is in recess. Any additional tablings would overlap Parliamentary Sittings and conflict with the heavy workloads already borne by staff at these times.</PARA>
<PARA> In the circumstances, I cannot agree to any extension to the present system of tabling the schedule of RAAF special purpose flights twice yearly.</PARA>
