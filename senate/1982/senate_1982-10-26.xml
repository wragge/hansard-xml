<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 291 citizens of Australia :</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the introduction of a student loans scheme will:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Extend the application of the 'user pays' philosophy to education. Education is a community resource, not a commodity to be bought on 'hire purchase'.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Pose a severe threat to the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. There is no guarantee that the loans scheme will not be changed and ultimately used to replace TEAS.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Give banks discretionary powers to refuse loans. Banks will view women as bad credit risks because women on average earn less, have higher rates of unemployment and are seen as likely to take time out of the workforce for child rearing. Mature age students with established financial commitments and a shorter working life over which to repay debts are unlikely to be given loans.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Reduce access to education for country and poorer students who are unlikely to borrow because their parents have fluctuating farm incomes or low incomes and cannot be relied on for support if the student cannot repay the debt.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Cause administrative chaos and increase government expenditure as has occurred overseas. The government should increase its expenditure on TEAS rather than spend money on a discriminatory loans scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will reject the introduction of a student loans scheme.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>14 October, 1982.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Brian Archer,</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra. A.C.T. 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Archer,</PARA>
<PARA>PRIVATE MEMBERS BILL. SOUTH-WEST TASMANIA.</PARA>
<PARA> As Tasmanians we are appealing to you to support the proposed private members bill, declaring the Franklin River ''an inviolable national park''.</PARA>
<PARA> When Mr Gray became leader of the State Parliamentary Liberal Party, he announced the No 1 policy was an ''immediate start to negotiations with the Federal Government to have Bass Strait declared a strike free national sea road, backed by State and Federal legislation''. This was deemed essential to promote business confidence to invest in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA> After gaining Government this policy has been shelved in favour of the emotional appeal of the ''DAM IS ESSENTIAL FOR SURVIVAL''. (Examiner Oct 11). The dam is to be a panacea which will automatically ensure business investment for the State.</PARA>
<PARA> While the World economy is expected to improve, will boom conditions in mining and metal industries return to Australia? These industries were the principal users of the State's electricity.</PARA>
<PARA> Experts have pointed out that a South-West power scheme has a longer lead time than a thermal power station. The Turnbull Report (Sept 81) is even more relevant today. ''The State could be faced with the bleak prospect of attempting to sell off an excess of expensive, non competitive power''.</PARA>
<PARA> We have a Premier who has tried to correct the former Labour Government's economic mismanagement, but he has shown his inexperience in his handling of the South-West issue.</PARA>
<PARA> We are a State of only 427,300 people, reliant on the goodwill of mainland people. Is it rational that Mr Gray should antagonise the media and people of the mainland in order to safeguard jobs for hydro construction workers?</PARA>
<PARA> It is time the Federal Government took action concerning Mr Gray's barrage of public statements-the warnings to Mr Fraser to kept out of the South-West, and threats of secession from the Commonwealth. For how long should a Federal Government be subservient to a Premier representing only 3% of Australia's population?</PARA>
<PARA> If we accept World Heritage Listing, The South-West would become only the thirtieth natural area so listed. Surely this would benefit all Australia, and particularly Tasmania. Overseas people would become aware of Tasmania as a place of scenic beauty, worthy of inclusion in an overseas tour.</PARA>
<PARA> At stake is a power station with a small generating capacity (180 m.w.) which would cause desecration of an area of ''irreplaceable'' beauty and flood the Franklin valley caves.</PARA>
<PARA> Naturalists and Scientists throughout the world have proclaimed that if Australia allows this destruction to occur, it will be guilty of an act of gross vandalism.</PARA>
<PARA> We sincerely trust that the proposed Bill will not be shelved or evaded on any technical ground-but will gain the support of patriotic Government members, who place the future inheritance of Australians, above placating an inexperienced Premier who mistakes belligerency for strength.</PARA>
<PARA> The Young Liberal Movement expresses the concern of all thinking members of the younger generation. The Gray Government shows no respect for the Senate, and is proceeding with the power scheme regardless of what the Senate Select Committee may report.</PARA>
<PARA> These circumstances call for strong action by Federal Parliament now.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When examining the Building (Amendment) Ordinance, the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances noted that section 7 (3A) appeared to absolve the Building Controller in the Australian Capital Territory from all liability in respect of any act or thing done by him, provided that it is done in good faith. The Committee also took note of a submission made to it, which reached a similar conclusion. The Committee has put to the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) that, if the Ordinance does indeed have such effect, the conferral of such a wide immunity on the Building Controller would alter personal legal rights under the common law very substantially. As today is the last day on which notice of disallowance may be given, the Committee has given notice to preserve its rights while awaiting a response from the Minister on the matters raised.</PARA></TALK.START>

The fact is that no enterprise could willingly enter into the massive outlays of hundreds, even thousands, of millions of dollars for the development of an enterprise like Roxby Downs without the assurance that it and any ancillary developments would proceed without qualification and that within the developments contracts could be made that would survive over the years. No such assurance can possibly be given or accepted within South Australia from the Labor side of politics and therefore, of course, the promise is without any foundation of credibility.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and why not? The people of Australia deserve to have the facts told to them about the imperfections in Australian Labor Party policy. Inherent in Senator Sibraa's question is the first element that a significant amount of the increase was in respect of charges-I think the figure was something in excess of one per cent or 1.3 per cent of the 3.5 per cent-and that those charges, particularly electric power charges, basically are heavily imposed by State governments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am being helped enormously by the Labor Party. The Labor Party does not want me to draw attention to the fact that State governments, particularly State Labor governments, have a record increase in taxes and charges. This has had a very significant impact on the CPI. The CPI for the September quarter has some peculiar characteristics in that it is bringing into one quarter what would normally be spread over the September and December quarters. Nevertheless, if one reads the media today one will see that the commentators are insistent that one major way to get inflation down in the future is to establish wage restraint throughout Australia. Quite clearly, the flow-on of the very large upsurge of wages in the last financial year has moved into this quarter. There is still a hangover from that. I will obtain the detailed breakdown of the CPI. If there is further information to be given to the Senate I will be very happy to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health. I preface my question by drawing his attention to an article which appeared in the Melbourne Age yesterday in which it is claimed that the Liberal Party has no health policy. Does the present Government's health policy provide for specific objectives? Does it also make provision for the manner in which these objectives are to be achieved? Is there any truth in the suggestion in the article that the Federal Government is seeking to reduce its policy and planning activities in the health care field?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Any health policy in Australian political terms would have several components. It would have a component related to the health of Australians. The Government certainly has a policy related to the health of Australians, health promotion and health promotion activities. The political realities in Australia today are that most health policy arguments relate not to health matters but to health financing matters. The Government does have a health policy relating to health financing. The policy is to ensure that all Australians have access to health care services which are of high quality and which are at a cost that the individual and the community can afford. Within that framework the Government is committed to maintain a mixture of private and public medicine, it is committed to the provision of private health insurance and it is committed to special assistance schemes for disadvantaged people and for those in genuine need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So, the criticism that has been made is quite unfounded and can be shown to be unfounded. In fact, many of the activities now being taken up by the States are in response to health policy thrusts by this Government which are designed to place responsibility where it belongs-with the States. The Government does not have a detailed health plan in the sense that the Opposition does. Unlike the Opposition, we do not believe that it is an appropriate approach to plan the detailed lives of individuals or to plan the lives of health professionals. We provide very heavily for health expenditure and have continued to do so over the years. In fact, I could answer Senator Hamer by saying that the record of the Government is one of very considerable involvement in defining its objectives, in making them known and in taking appropriate action to have the objectives put into effect.</PARA>

Apparently kangaroo, donkey, horse and deer meat have been sold as beef and pork in that country for about two years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I initially heard the reports I was relieved to hear animals described many of which are not native to Australia. That gave me some cause to hope that any difficulty would not be related to actions which had taken place within Australia. It appears that that is so. The difficulties being faced in West Germany in terms of meat substitution are not caused by actions which have been taken by Australian exporters. The Minister for Primary Industry issued a statement on 24 October. That helps to explain some of the points which might be in Senator Thomas's mind, and in the minds of senators who have been interjecting. Mr Nixon said in his Press statement that there had been no substitution in Australia of kangaroo meat for other products for the West German market and there was no fault in the Australian export inspection and certification procedure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Nixon went on to point out that West Germany had in recent years become a significant importer of kangaroo meat from Australia as game meat for human consumption. That sort of meat is produced under stringent conditions in Australia. It is certified by the Export Inspection Service of the Department of Primary Industry as kangaroo game meat fit for human consumption. Kangaroo game meat exports to West Germany currently average 1,000 tonnes annually which is valued at about $2m. Australians and the Australian media should not be quick to make assumptions in this area which could be very damaging to Australian exports . I was pleased that the Minister for Primary Industry was so quickly able to make a public statement on this matter. It would appear that the difficulties currently being faced in Germany are not difficulties related to any problems in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The decision to proceed with the development of a new runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport has had to be made in view of the seriousness of congestion being experienced in Sydney. However, I assure the honourable senator that while the responsibility also revolves around the question of negotiation with the New South Wales Government in this regard, the decision rests with us; but the closest possible working relationship will be established with State government bodies in New South Wales. Already the Minister for Aviation and the Premier have exchanged letters, and the Secretary to the Department of Aviation will be meeting permanent heads of the New South Wales Government in the next few weeks on the whole question of joint government machinery in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In coming to a decision to proceed with the development of a close-spaced parallel runway in Sydney, the Government is conscious of the lead time necessary before construction can commence. Before construction can start it will be necessary to carry out planning and feasibility analyses and other studies including those relating to sand fill, a point mentioned by Senator McClelland, location, an environmental analysis and the preparation of an environmental impact study. A review of the short-listed sites for a second major airport for Sydney will also need to be completed as soon as possible. That has been the subject of an announcement by the Government already. The Government has agreed that the selection of a site for that new airport will form part of the package of proposals necessary to meet the aviation needs of the whole Sydney region. It is expected that those processes will take about two years, after which time the project will be placed before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. With the agreement of that Committee and the Parliament the construction of the second runway can commence and this is expected to be some time in 1985. Given full co-operation of all concerned with the project and fast track methods for planning and control of the project, I expect the runway to be operational before the end of this decade.</PARA>
<PARA> The cost of the runway project is dependent upon the source of sand fill, as identified by Senator Douglas McClelland. If sufficient sand is available within Botany Bay, the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Construction estimates the cost to be something of the order of $125m. However, if we have to go outside the bay for sand, the cost could rise to around $175m. The study to locate sand fill is to commence as soon as the necessary co-operation with the New South Wales Government is achieved and this is one of the matters that will be discussed at meetings next week.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the last part of the question, let me say emphatically that I would not at all acknowledge that there will be no jobs in Australia for people in the next decade from a uranium enrichment plant. The fact is that there is a very great likelihood that Australia, in the course of the years ahead, will have a uranium enrichment plant and that will provide a very considerable number of jobs-thousands of jobs for construction and hundreds of jobs for operation. Let me put that completely at rest. The Uranium Enrichment Group of Australia was set up to do a number of things. First, it was to answer the question whether there would be markets for the product of an enrichment plant if Australia constructed one. It answered by saying yes, in the 1990s and beyond. The second question was: Would Australia have the technology and capacity to run such a plant? UEGA answered yes, emphatically. Then the group was put to work to study which, of three kinds of technology-gaseous diffusion, the centrifuge process and chemical exchange, or Chemex-would be preferred. The group reached the conclusion that the centrifuge process would be best. It then looked at the preferred technologies for use in the centrifuge approach and said that the Urenco-Centec process would be most acceptable. The group has now reported back. The Government having accepted in principle the centrifuge approach and the Urenco-Centec process, UEGA needed authority to proceed further with discussions on technology and, above all, as to marketability. This would take place with not only the European countries involved in Urenco-Centec but also Japan and other countries. Thus, the investigation is moving step by step towards a final decision, which will be made by government. UEGA itself is simply doing the investigation and making recommendations. I believe that it is fair to say, on the evidence that has come forward so far concerning the likelihood of markets and the selection of technology, that Australia has a very good chance of establishing a uranium enrichment plant. Secondly, the UEGA people have said that the two preferred locations are South Australia and Queensland. They are equally preferred. The enthusiasm on the part of the Premier of South Australia to get such an industry is to be commended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find it extraordinary that the Labor Party should be opposed to the establishing of an enrichment plant; or are we to find tomorrow that Mr Bannon has changed his mind as he purports to have done concerning Roxby Downs? Labor is opposed to the enrichment proposal and is trying to white ant the situation because it understands that the public of South Australia is very keen indeed to get such an industry. The public knows that the industry is working well in other countries, that it provides good jobs, is safe from the point of view of health and can be of great benefit to South Australia. The public should listen to the knockers in the Labor Party and recognise their actions as a death knock on the part of that party.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of statements on the subject made last week by pilots' representatives. Senator MacGibbon attributed the statement to the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and that is probably correct. The pilots are concerned about the effects of smoking in aircraft and have made certain proposals. I am also aware of moves in some States to do away with tobacco sponsorship of certain events. I have noted the interest in Western Australia at the present time in the objection of the cricket authorities to a proposition that they should not accept tobacco sponsorship. Senator MacGibbon is correct in saying that non-smokers represent a majority in the community. Although he did not include it in his question, I must say that for non-smokers it is not always possible to obtain a non-smoker's seat in aircraft, which is a point of some concern. I think the honourable senator is correct when he asserts that pressurisation of aeroplanes does result in oxygen tension less than that which applies at sea level. It is therefore correct that there would be a lower arterial oxygen concentration for those who fly in pressurised cabins. It would be reasonable to assume that the effects of cigarette smoke would be potentiated in that circumstance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Australian Federation of Air Pilots can make a convincing case that health issues do arise as a result of smoking in aircraft, I think Ministers would want to take that on board.

I finish by reminding honourable senators that it is the policy of this Government, as laid down by the Government some years ago, to encourage less smoking in Australia.

Finally, and in particular, I ask: When can we expect an investigation of the circumstances surrounding the meeting between Senator Durack, Mr Neaves and Mr O'Donovan at which the adequacy of the existing law was discussed-which meeting was admitted by the Attorney-General at the hearing of Estimates Committee A on 13 September to have taken place, the existence of which meeting was also confirmed in a subsequent letter from Mr Neaves to the Chairman of Estimates Committee A on 11 October, and for which meeting, despite the fact that two of the most senior bureaucrats of the country were present, no record as to date, time, place or subject matter appears now to be available?'</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The preface to that question referred to the revelations of the Costigan report that there was a failure to utilise existing law. It may be pertinent in that regard to note that, with the appointment of somebody to prosecute the case that was the subject of particular attention in the Costigan report, the finding of counsel was that indeed further evidence has to be obtained. As I think is known, the evidence is currently being gathered together . As to the detailed matter of what other action might be taken with respect to any deficiencies within the Department, I will refer that to the Acting Attorney -General for his consideration and reply. But my recollection of the comment on the meeting between Senator Durack, Mr Neaves and Mr O'Donovan referred to in the latter part of the question is that there was no written record and indeed that the precise time of the meeting is not known. I do not think that there is much prospect of any more detailed information coming forward with respect to that meeting. I will ask the Acting Attorney-General to make further inquiries about that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Statistician has changed his collection procedures so that many of the recent increases in government taxes and charges, including some of the price effects of the Commonwealth Budget measures, have been recorded earlier than would have been the case in the past. This bringing forward of the bad news as compared with last year means that the September quarter result slightly overstates the underlying rate of inflation. The Department of the Treasury estimates that the Commonwealth's Budget measures contributed 0.15 percentage points to the 3.5 per cent increase in the September quarter. Another point to note is that over the last year the Government has introduced major changes in the method of financing health services and has placed an increased emphasis on indirect taxation as a means of financing its Budget. Both of these developments have had a major impact on the inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Government had not made these changes the measured inflation rate over the year to September would have run at slightly over 10 per cent. If allowance were made for increases in State indirect taxation the underlying rate would be lower still. I note that Senator Sir John Carrick said he would obtain information, if possible, with regard to the implications of State increases in this CPI. If these measures had not been implemented the Budget deficit would have been several hundreds of millions of dollars higher. I suppose one has to take into account the way in which we will finance a deficit and whether, when doing so, it has some implications for consumer price index figures. As I have said, there was a change in the method of collection to the degree that I have mentioned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister, in his electorate talk on 26 September, claimed that the tax recoupment legislation was necessary to finance next month's so- called tax cuts, which could be more accurately described as next month's tax indexation. Since then the Prime Minister has weakly caved in by amending the legislation to cancel the obligation to pay of some vendor shareholders and deferring the obligation of others, thereby ensuring that a negligible amount of tax will be paid this year or perhaps ever. How will the tax cuts be paid for, or does the Government plan to cancel them as it did in 1977?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate will have the opportunity in the immediate days ahead of ensuring that the tax cuts legislation is passed and that the public gets the benefit of those tax cuts. The Government has brought down a Budget package which, in net impact to an average family, will give the benefit of something like $17 or $18 a week free of tax. Incidentally, that has been measured by outside people who are objective in their politics. In effect, that is an increase in wages of something like $25 a week or $30 a week before tax. I repeat that the Government will be bringing down the tax legislation and that the public will get the benefit of it. It is true that recoupment taxation is part of our Budget strategy. We are raising the money and we propose to give a very significant amount of that money back to the general public by way of tax concessions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has indicated that we are giving time to pay to the vendor shareholders because we are concerned that many of them may have invested money in employment and job creating opportunities and a sudden and immediate demand for that money could create disemployment. I would expect that every honourable senator in this chamber would be concerned that there should not be disemployment of people. The legislation will ensure that vendor shareholders covered by this recoupment tax will pay their tax, and that will be that. It will ensure that in so doing there is the minimum possible disturbance to employment opportunities in Australia. I would have thought that this was an eminently respectable and sensible way. It ensures that money will come to this Government which will enable benefits, including social service benefits, to go to the people of Australia. It ensures that those who have a tax liability will pay and it ensures that their liability will not impact upon innocent people who might have their jobs disturbed.</PARA>

Noting the cynical and hypocritical conduct which has surrounded the East Timor debate for some years, is the Australian Government also aware that, along with the other frauds and irregularities that accompanied the election in East Timor in May 1982, the official returns disclose that Golkar, the official Indonesian Government party, polled 3,000 more votes than the total of registered voters on the whole roll?

<PARA> The White Cliffs solar power station has been financed by the New South Wales Government through the Energy Authority of New South Wales.

<PARA> I am able to confirm that the Australian National University has participated directly, through its Research School of Physical Sciences, in this research, development and demonstration project in the solar energy field. It is appropriate for the University to involve itself in developmental projects which, as in the present case, are closely related to particular fields of research in which the University is engaged actively as part of its own research activities. Most of the implementation costs are being met under contract by the New South Wales Government. Some of the research has been carried out over a number of years within the school as part of its program of research funded through normal University finances.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-This statement is about the ninth report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I shall touch briefly on the history of the matter. On 9 June 1978 the Senate referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs a resolution to establish a committee to maintain a watching brief on all Bills introduced into Parliament for the purpose of highlighting provisions which might be considered to interfere with the individual rights of persons or subject them to the exercise of undue delegations of power. In November 1978 the Committee issued its report on the scrutiny of Bills proposal and recommended the establishment of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposal was subject to considerable debate in the Senate and was given consideration by the Government. A Government response was made to the Committee 's recommendation on 22 November 1979. That statement indicated that the Government would not support the Committee's recommendation. I will quote in part from the statement which was put down at that time. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is at one with the Senate Committee in its concern to protect the personal rights and liberties of the individual, and to ensure that there is no inappropriate delegation of legislative power or avoidance of adequate Parliamentary scrutiny of the exercise of legislative power. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the Government indicated that for a variety of reasons it did not think that it was appropriate to proceed in the way that the Senate Committee had recommended. The reasons for opposing the Committee's establishment included the reason that the proposal amounted to a new element in the legislative process, one which had the potential to distort and lengthen the present arrangements. Secondly, the Government believed it was the responsibility of each member and senator to ensure that legislation did not trespass unduly on individual rights and liberties and the establishment of a committee to perform this function would, in effect, delegate to a few the primary responsibility of the Parliament as a whole. The third reason was that the Government's legislation would or could be unnecessarily delayed. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition it was pointed out that there were other opportunities-at the time the Government thought they were ample-for the examination of legislation which comes before the Parliament to ensure that interests are protected and that such matters are brought to attention either before or after the introduction of legislation into the Parliament. It would be known to most honourable senators that the Senate decided that, notwithstanding the Government's attitude at that time, it would proceed on an experimental basis to have a scrutiny of Bills through the existing Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. In accordance with the recommendation, counsel were retained and the Committee has for a period been proceeding very much in accordance with the original recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is as pleased as the next man to learn from experience. In light of the experience of the actual working of the Committee, the Government now takes a different attitude to the proposal which is before us and which is to be considered, I understand, later this week. In fact, experience has shown that the Committee has not caused inconvenience to the Government's legislative program. Indeed, many of its recommendations have been readily accepted by the Government. It is perhaps coincidental that I had the conduct of a good deal of the legislation which was the subject of comment by the Committee in its early days, as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry in this place. Quite a number of items of legislation involving the rural industries were subject to amendment following matters which had been drawn to the Government's attention and the Senate's attention by the Standing Committee exercising its scrutiny of Bills function. So there has been a demonstration, in terms of amendments accepted by the Government and subsequently by the Senate, that there is a function to be performed in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, on behalf of the Government I wish to acknowledge that there has been a hidden flow-through effect into the departments. The very existence of the Committee is causing officials to think more closely about provisions in legislation concerning personal liberties and the delegation of legislative power and parliamentary scrutiny. So one of the other predicted effects of the Committee's existence has come about; namely, there has been a heightened awareness, in the pre-legislature stage of legislative preparation, of the sorts of principles with which the Committee is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> So in light of that experience the Government would propose, when the matter comes on for consideration, to support the continuance of the scrutiny of Bills function. That will involve the establishment of a new committee. The Government will be prepared to support that. We shall support the reference to the Standing Orders Committee, and without commitment to the detail of the proposed Standing Order, support its being considered at that level, with a report back to the Senate. So in light of the operation of the Committee the Government has reconsidered the stance which it formerly took and is now taking a supportive and positive stance with respect to the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> As a person who was involved in this proposition first as a senator in the early days of the consideration of the proposal by the Senate Committee and subsequently as a member of the Government when the Government had to consider its attitude to the proposal, I should like to say in this, as in so many elements of parliamentary and political life, the value and the success of any proposal is, in part at least-but in very large part, in my view-determined by the spirit in which the task is approached. There was a concern within the Government that this could be used as a means of delay, that it could be used for political purposes quite separate from the technical legislative purposes for which it was to be established. I am pleased to say that there has been no sign of that in the Committee's deliberations. I am sorry that that should call forth an attempt to interject from the Opposition Whip. It is a fact that at times politics bends the use to which things are put. The acceptance of this by the Goverment is an acceptance of the fact that to date this has operated as it was designed to operate, and it has been operated in the spirit in which it was intended to operate. </PARA>
<PARA> I make that point because, taking a very long established organ of the Senate, the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, it would be fair to say that is now so firmly rooted in the practices of the Senate that it is established that it should operate in a way which, again, I think, has been substantially non-political in character. It is worth noting in this regard that within the last two years there have been one or two occasions on which questions of politics have intervened in that and there has had to be some effort by the members of the Committee to ensure that it continues down its traditional path. I mention that because there is no point in ignoring the possible hooks in a proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> As one who was originally an enthusiastic supporter of this proposal, as one who then had, as a member of a government, to advance the view that we should not proceed with this, and as one who has now seen it in operation and succeeding in the way originally envisaged, I simply express my personal pleasure in that, and I express the hope that in this way we, the senators of the 1980s, are further advancing the usefulness of the Senate and its effectiveness as a legislative chamber. I would hope that this will be but one of the continuum of steps that we would all wish to see taken in the advancement of parliamentary life in Australia. </PARA>

As Chairman of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee which has been operating now for some nine months and which has presented some 15 reports to the Parliament, I make the point that members of the Committee have appreciated both the reaction which we have seen to the Committee's activities and the response which the Government has made to many of the matters which have been raised by it. Many of the things I have raised are not matters which the Committee considers necessarily calls for change. But very often there is need to draw the attention of the Senate to particular items in legislation so that the Senate can proceed and make a decision in the full knowledge of what is proposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think Senator Chaney was slightly modest-too modest-because my recollection is that originally this was Senator Chaney's idea. Certainly, it was because of his strong support that the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs looked at this proposal. So I am very pleased to see that the full circle has been made and that Senator Chaney is able to respond as the Minister concerned. I do not think it is being in any way critical of the Government for it to have an opportunity of seeing how this matter operates in practice and then deciding that in fact it can operate well. Naturally, government seems to be cautious in regard to ideas which come forward. I will not proceed any further. I understand that this matter is to come up for debate later in the week on the motion for the adoption of the Committee's report. If the motion were adopted, the Committee would be set up with a separate membership and would not operate, as it does at the moment, with the membership of the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee. Those matters can be discussed further when we are debating the motion for the adoption of the report. However, I want to say that we, as members of the Committee, welcome the Government's response to this proposal and commend the Minister on his statement. </PARA>

<PARA> This Bill is part of a package of 4 Bills.

The exemption will apply to transfers to executors or administrators of an estate and to be a person who is beneficially entitled to the vehicle under a will or by virtue of the law of intestacy. </PARA>
<PARA> Transfers to a joint owner or joint owners of a vehicle that are consequential on the death of another joint owner will also be exempt. As foreshadowed in the Treasurer's announcement of 7 June, the broadened exemption will apply from 1 October 1981-the date from which the registration tax first applied. Amendments proposed in another Bill included in the package-the Australian Capital Territory Taxation (Administration) Amendment Bill 1982-will ensure that persons who have paid tax in the circumstances covered by this Bill before the Bill comes into force will be able to obtain a refund of the tax paid. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment proposed by the Bill will exempt a transfer of registration of a motor vehicle to a hire purchase company when the transfer takes place as a consequence of the repossession or voluntary return of the vehicle to the company by the hirer. A transfer under equivalent circumstances to a lessor engaged in a business of letting vehicles on lease is also to be made exempt. The new exemptions will apply in respect of applications for registration made on or after 14 October 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The third amendment proposed by the Bill will extend an existing exemption applying to a registration in the name of a person carrying on a business in respect of which he or she is a licensed dealer under the A.C.T. Sale of Motor Vehicles Ordinance where the vehicle is held by the person as trading stock for re-sale in the course of the business. At present, the transfer of an A.C.T. registration to a motor vehicle dealer elsewhere in Australia-for example a N.S. W. dealer in Yass or Queanbeyan-in the course of carrying on business as a licensed dealer is subject to tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment proposed will extend the exemption to dealers licensed in a State or in the Northern Territory if, in the dealer's own State or Territory, there is an equivalent exemption for A.C.T. dealers. In this regard, the Prime Minister has written to the Premier of New South Wales on the question of the possible granting of reciprocal exemption in that State. Explanations of technical aspects of this Bill and of the other Bills in the package are contained in an explanatory memorandum that is being made available to honourable senators. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY TAX (INSURANCE BUSINESS) AMENDMENT BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will ensure that premiums on insurance in respect of an employer's liability at common law for an injury to or death of an employee are exempt from tax. Under the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance employers in the Territory are required to take out insurance with an approved insurer in respect of their liabilities under that Ordinance and at common law for an injury or death of an employee. Existing provisions of the Australian Capital Territory Tax (Insurance Business) Act exempt premiums payable by an employer on a policy of insurance against his or her liability under the Ordinance. That exemption is accepted as applying to exempt the full amount of a premium under a single policy of insurance covering both a liability under the Ordinance and one at common law. The amendment proposed by the Bill will exempt premiums payable under a separate policy of insurance taken out in respect of a common law liability only. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY STAMP DUTY AMENDMENT BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes to exempt from stamp duty certain conveyances of freehold or leasehold land to or from a trustee in circumstances where the beneficial interests in the property remain unchanged. The Australian Capital Territory Stamp Duty Act imposes duty on a transfer of, or an agreement to transfer, freehold or leasehold land situated in the Territory and on a transfer of a marketable security that is registered in a register kept by a company in the Territory. The first of the amendments proposed by this Bill will exempt from duty a conveyance made in consequence of the appointment or retirement of a trustee or of other change in trustees in order to vest the property in the trustees for the time being entitled to hold it. The second will apply in circumtances where a person purchases land in his or her own name with funds provided by another. The present law applies in these circumstances to impose duty on both the transfer of an interest in land to the trustee under the imputed trust arising in relation to this type of arrangement, and also on the transfer from the trustee to the person beneficially entitled to that interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the amendment proposed the second of the transfers involved in arrangements of this type-the transfer of the land from the trustee to the person who provided the purchase money-is to be exempted from duty. </PARA>
<PARA> The final new exemption proposed by the Bill will apply with respect to conveyances from a trustee to a beneficiary in the trust. The exemption will be subject to the conditions that the conveyance is not made for valuable consideration and that it does not consistitute a breach of trust. It is also to be a requirement for the exemption that the property the subject of the conveyance was acquired by the trustee by virtue of an instrument upon which duty has been paid or on which duty is not payable. The exemptions, which will be subject to safeguards against abuse, will apply with respect to instruments effected on or after 14 October 1982. Further amendments proposed by the Bill will make broadly similar transfers of marketable securities subject to antiavoidance safeguards of the kind that are to be applied in connection with the proposed exemptions for transfers of land. These amendments will also apply with respect to instruments effected on or after 14 October 1982. I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY TAXATION (ADMINISTRATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is the last of the package of Bills designed to correct deficiencies in the machinery and liability provisions of the law relating to Australian Capital Territory stamp duties and taxes. The first of the amendments proposed by the Bill relates to situations where an agreement to transfer freehold or leasehold land is rescinded before the transfer takes place. Under the Australian Capital Territory Stamp Duty Act duty is payable on either an agreement to transfer land or the transfer itself. Commonly the duty is paid on the agreement. As the law presently stands there is no authority to refund duty paid on an agreement when an agreement is rescinded or annulled so that a transfer does not take place. The amendment proposed will introduce refund provisions to accommodate this situation. The amendment, which will incorporate necessary safeguards, will apply in respect of agreements entered into on or after 14 October 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> A second amendment will apply to transfers to give effect to a partition or division of interests in marketable securities held jointly or in common by two or more persons. At present, stamp duty is payable on the unencumbered value of marketable securities transferred under arrangements of this type, even though there may be no increase in the value of the parties' interest in the securities in consequence of the division. The amendment proposed will apply in these circumstances, with effect from 14 October 1982, to exclude from duty on the relevant transfer, the value of the beneficial interest held by the transferee in the marketable securities prior to the partition or division of those securities. Other substantive amendments proposed by the Bill are complementary to amendments proposed by other Bills included in the package. Included in these are the previously mentioned refund provisions consequential on the proposed amendments to vehicle registration tax in the Territory and provisions relevant to safeguards mentioned in relation to certain stamp duty amendments contained in the package. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>PAY-ROLL TAX (TERRITORIES) ASSESSMENT AMENDMENT BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will raise the level of the general exemption from pay-roll tax applicable to the Australian Capital Territory. The Treasurer and the Minister for the Capital Territory announced the proposed increase on 2 August 1982. The exemption is to be raised from $80,400 to $120,000 per annum. The higher level will apply from 1 September 1981, thus providing an exemption for 1981-82 of $ 113,400 on a full-year basis. The last increase applied from 1 January 1981 when the exemption was brought up to $80,400 in line with that allowed in New South Wales. New South Wales has since increased its exemption level to $120,000 per annum, with effect from 1 September 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The maximum exemption allowable in monthly returns will increase fom $6,700 to $10,000 and, in conformity with the existing rules for the phasing out of the maximum annual exemption, will be reduced at the rate of $2 for every $3 by which the wages for the month exceed $10,000. There will be no exemption once the monthly pay-roll reaches $25,000. As a general rule, the new exemption will first apply to returns for the month in which this Bill receives the Royal Assent but end-of-year adjustments will ensure that the benefits are in all cases back-dated to 1 September 1981. From the day on which the provisions of the Bill come into operation an employer paying wages of $2,250 or less a week will not be required to register for ACT pay-roll tax purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> As foreshadowed in the 2 August statement, further amendments proposed by the Bill will enable future increases in the general exemption level to be prescribed by regulation. This procedure will enable earlier adjustments in the ACT exemption level than have been possible in the past. Explanations of technical aspects of the Bill are contained in an explanatory memorandum that is being made available to honourable senators. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave for the second reading speech to be incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to establish the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund from which an estimated $2.5 billion will be provided over the next six years to upgrade Australia's roads by 1988-our Bicentennial year. </PARA>
<PARA> This funding is additional to and separate from the $3.65 billion provided to the States under the Roads Grants Act 1981. Together, both Programs will provide the impressive sum of $914 million in 1982-83, rising to $1,208 million in 1983- 84 for all categories of roads. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the biggest drive to boost road construction and improvement ever mounted in this country. The Programs' contribution to national growth and prosperity will benefit all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The object of the new Program is to fund national, arterial and local road projects of significance that will develop the Australian road network to a high standard. The Program will facilitate the reliable and efficient carriage of traffic. It will enhance the safety of Australian roads. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABRD Program will address four main areas of need:</PARA>
<PARA> The national highway system will be brought to a high standard to meet our growing transport requirements for the efficient movement of people and goods around Australia. The Program will ensure the completion of a sealed, and virtually flood-free national highway system. </PARA>
<PARA> The construction of developmental roads, including some in remote areas and roads of national tourism importance, will be accelerated. </PARA>
<PARA> Specific urban and rural arterial road projects will be funded, and where States so choose, assistance may be provided for approved urban public transport projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Local government authorities will be able to nominate local projects for inclusion in the program. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABRD Program will generate a number of important benefits:</PARA>
<PARA> Lives will be saved as a result of the improved safety on our roads. </PARA>
<PARA> Communications between the States (and regional areas) will be enhanced as a result of better national highways and arterial roads. </PARA>
<PARA> Considerable savings will be made in vehicle and transport operating costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Savings will be made in private and commercial travelling time. </PARA>
<PARA> Travellers in more remote areas will benefit from reductions in dust hazards and reduced delays due to flooding. </PARA>
<PARA> 8,000 jobs will be provided in the road construction industry alone. Moreover it is expected that at least 20,000 jobs will be provided in both direct and indirect employment throughout the ABRD Program's duration. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government considers that this Program will be a tremendous tribute to the 200 years of our nation's development. Roads affect every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> Road transport accounts for almost 80 per cent of our domestic freight tonnage and 90 per cent of passenger kilometres travelled. Since roads are important to every Australian, it is appropriate that the Australian Bicentennial Authority has fully endorsed the ABRD Program. It will leave an enduring legacy of the Bicentenary to all future Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth acknowledges that the level of its funding of roads in recent years has not kept pace with increases in road construction costs. </PARA>
<PARA> While Roads Grants Act funding beyond 1984-85 has yet to be determined, the Government will need to give consideration to the level of road funding to be provided for the next five-year period 1985-86 to 1989-90 well before the conclusion of the current 5 year program. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Fraser Government has resolved to make a major investment in our road network-a national asset of critical importance. The ABRD Program is the Government's response to this important need. A recent Commonwealth/State study of national highway deficiencies concluded that at the former levels of funding by the Commonwealth, it would take until well beyond the year 2000 to bring our national highways up to an acceptable standard. </PARA>
<PARA> The urgency of the problem and the need for additional funds was made clear to the Minister for Transport and Construction when he undertook a tour of inspection of the Bruce Highway between Rockhampton and Townsville earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA> He indicated at the time that the condition of that road was, to put it mildly, totally inadequate for a national highway which was serving an area undergoing such rapid development. A joint Commonwealth/Queensland study later confirmed this assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of a Trust Fund has been adopted for the ABRD Program to ensure that all funds raised from the fuel surcharge are used for projects approved as part of the ABRD Program and for no other purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fund will receive all revenue generated from the surcharge on motor spirit and diesel fuel excise, less applicable rebates. All interest earned on Fund investments will accrue to the Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> The special surcharge was proposed at last June's Premiers' Conference and supported by all States and the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> As noted earlier total Commonwealth road funding in 1982-83 will now amount to some $914 million. This represents an increase of $229 million or 33 per cent when compared with road funds allocated in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983-84, when the ABRD Program is fully operational, Commonwealth expenditure under both the ABRD and Roads Grants Programs will total an estimated $1,208 million. That will represent an increase of $523 million or 76 per cent over 1981-82 road expenditures. </PARA>
<PARA> These increases are far in excess of recent movements in road building costs.</PARA>
<PARA> The special ABRD surcharge on motor spirit and diesel fuel excise is being phased in to allow State and Northern Territory road authorities time to gear up for the substantial increase in construction activity that will result from the Program. </PARA>
<PARA> One cent per litre has been applied since 17 August 1982 and this will rise to two cents per litre from 1 July 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> The surcharge will be discontinued after 31 December 1988, and as provided for in this Bill, the Trust Fund will be closed down one year later following the acquittal of any outstanding commitments. </PARA>
<PARA> While the impact of the ABRD Program on our road network will be substantial and appreciated by all travellers, the cost of the surcharge to individual motorists and road transport operators will be relatively small. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, even at the two cents per litre level, an average motorist travelling 15,000 km per year can expect to pay only 67 cents extra per week. For the driver of a typical 38 tonne truck, the 2 cents surcharge will mean that a Sydney-Melbourne round trip will cost an extra $18. </PARA>
<PARA> Significantly, the response that the Minister for Transport and Construction has already received from road authorities, local government organisations and others has been very positive. </PARA>
<PARA> It has confirmed the belief that the Australian people will accept an increase in Government charges and costs if they can clearly see where the money is going and know that it is to be spent for such a constructive purpose of enormous economic and social benefit to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> ABRD funds will be allocated between the various road categories in the following proportions:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1982/83, national roads 40%, urban arterial roads 30%, rural arterial roads 15%, local roads 15%. </PARA>
<PARA> For the year 1983/84 and beyond, national roads 42%, urban arterial roads 30%, rural arterial roads 16%, local roads 12%. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding these percentages, a State or the Northern Territory may seek and receive approval to transfer funds between the urban and rural arterial roads categories, or from both to either of these categories into national roads . </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill does not provide for transfers from the local roads category. </PARA>
<PARA> On a category by category basis, this will mean that in total some $396 million will be available for upgrading our national roads in 1982/83, rising to about $ 525 million in 1983/84. Similarly, some $317 million will be available for urban and rural arterial roads this financial year, increasing to approximately $448 million in the following year. Local road funds will be allocated a total of an estimated $200 million in 1982/83 and about $235 million the year after. </PARA>
<PARA> No set ratio will be used to apportion national road funds between the States and the Northern Territory. Rather, this money will be distributed in accordance with the requirement of achieving the basic Program objectives and national priorities, following consultation with the States and Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Developmental roads will also be eligible for assistance under the national roads category. Developmental roads are roads which are significant from the national point of view, for the development of particular industries and energy resources, including those in remote areas. Roads which facilitate international trade or commerce, or tourist activities may also be classified as developmental roads. </PARA>
<PARA> ABRD funds allocated for the urban arterial, rural arterial and local roads' categories will be distributed between States and the Northern Territory in accordance with current funding relativities. Local road funds in turn, will be apportioned within the States in accordance with principles to be developed for this Program. </PARA>
<PARA> On a State by State basis, indicative figures suggest that, taking into account both the ABRD Program and the ongoing Roads Grants Program, the following increases in Commonwealth funding will be provided:</PARA>
<PARA> N.S.W., a 34 per cent increase this financial year and a 78 per cent increase in 1983/84 compared with the 1981/82 figure. </PARA>
<PARA> Victoria, increases of 34 per cent and 77 per cent respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> Queensland, 35 per cent and 81 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> South Australia, 30 per cent and 68 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Western Australia, 34 per cent and 77 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania, 29 per cent and 65 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> and for the Northern Territory the respective expenditure increases will be 27 per cent and 62 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Turning to the arrangements which will apply to the administration of the ABRD Program, Honourable Senators will note that there are a number of significant changes when compared with the arrangements applying to the Roads Grants Program . </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, as this Program approaches the upgrading of the road network from a national perspective, Commonwealth approval will be required for each ABRD project. Thus national priorities will be considered in the project approval process, and in general, projects will be significant in nature. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Commonwealth's involvement will not be a heavy handed intrusion into State and Northern Territory affairs. On the contrary, projects will be identified by way of close consultation between the respective governments and the approval process will primarily be a vehicle to ensure that the objectives of the Program are being effectively pursued. Consultations with the States and Northern Territory are already underway to identify projects for inclusion in the Program. </PARA>
<PARA> Another departure from practice under the Roads Grants Act is that this Bill provides for separate allocations to be made for urban arterial roads and rural arterial roads. This will enable appropriate attention to be devoted to roads in urban areas where the majority of Australia's population lives. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard the Bill also permits the States and the Northern Territory, if they wish, to expend part of their urban arterial roads allocation on urban public transport capital works. This acknowledges that urban public transport services have the potential to take considerable pressure off urban arterial roads. </PARA>
<PARA> To maximise the benefits of the ABRD Program on our road system, a provision has been included in the legislation making it necessary for the State and Northern Territory governments to maintain, in real terms, the level of road funding from their own resources. Where a State proposes urban public transport projects they will be required to maintain their own spending on capital works in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Statistics Implicit Price Deflator for Private Non- dwelling Construction will be used, amongst other pertinent factors, in determining whether the States and Northern Territory have in fact, maintained their expenditure in real terms. However, if a State or the Northern Territory allows its expenditure on roads or urban public transport to fall behind in real terms in a given year, and subsequently fails to compensate for the shortfall with an equivalent increase in the following year, then its allocation may be offset by withdrawal of an equal amount of its ABRD funds. </PARA>
<PARA> This will ensure that real improvements are made to our road system, and Commonwealth funds are not used to allow States to diminish their continuing financial responsibilities for their own roads and public transport services. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the Government is determined that all taxpayers will receive full value for each dollar they are being asked to pay. With this in mind the existing tendering requirement for national road construction works is being extended in the ABRD Program to cover urban and rural arterial road categories and urban public transport projects. It is only in a competitive environment that we can be sure of getting maximum value from this massive investment in construction. </PARA>
<PARA> Highlighting the Bicentennial nature of the Program, all ABRD projects will be marked by appropriate Bicentennial signs. This will guarantee that all Australians will see where their funds are being spent. The signs will also have the effect of reminding Australians about the Bicentenary and the important contribution roads make to the economic and social life of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport and Construction will be reporting to the Parliament annually on Trust Fund transactions and on the progress made on approved projects. </PARA>
<PARA> I have canvassed the more significant elements of the Bill before the Senate today. The remaining provisions are similar to those contained in the current Roads Grants legislation, the most recent Act of which was passed through the Senate in the preceding autumn session of Parliament. The Explanatory Memorandum that has been circulated describes in detail all the features of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I do not propose to deal further with any individual sections. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During my remarks on this legislation last Thursday I made the point that the Government's claim that the new rebate would simplify administrative procedures was very suspect. The Government was calling on users of diesel fuel to apply for the rebate on a regular basis whereas under the old exemption procedures one had to apply only once. The burden of my criticism is that although the goverment claims that it will raise $161m through this legislation it is able to give no information whatsoever as to which sectors of the community will be called upon to meet this increased impost of $ 161m. In the meantime, while this legislation is being debated, all users of diesel fuel are paying for fuel at the full price.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As various honourable senators have pointed out, that imposes considerable hardships on certain users right now. I pointed out that it seemed to us that there were three sectors of the community, in particular, which were large users of diesel fuel and which would be unfairly hit by this proposed legislation. I referred especially to local government, tourism and the baking industry. I will pursue my comments as to the effect of this legislation on local government. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems particularly stupid for the Government to remove the exemption for local government authorities and to replace it with a rebate. It has been impossible to find out the precise usage by local government authorities but there is no doubt that it is considerable. We have only to consider the list of suggested uses compiled by the Australian Council of Local Government Associations. Local councils obviously use fuels for heating generally- particularly for small community facilities such as infant welfare centres and public swimming pools; for heating used in sewerage treatment plants; for power generation, particularly in remote areas, and for emergency generation the need for which is very widespread today; for pumps, for irrigation networks and flood control; and for garbage disposal crushers. This equipment is frequently powered by diesel engines. Crematoriums and cemetery plants use diesel fuel to a great extent. In addition, there is the doubtful area of road construction. This tax will apply to off-road use and, as new roads are not, I guess, strictly speaking defined as roads until they are built, it would seem that new road construction would also be a target for this new and hidden tax.</PARA>
<PARA> In effect, the Government will take 6.155c a litre from local government and give back one cent a litre for the building of new roads. Is that not clever? The Government will take it with one hand but not give it back with the other. There is no doubt that under this new legislation local government will suffer considerably. It will impose a tax on local government activities at a time when we should be looking to local government to expand employment. It is the wrong sort of tax at absolutely the wrong time for the health of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The second category I referred to was tourism. I made the point that the tourist industry is a very large earner of foreign exchange. At a time when we have a deficit of about $10 billion on our current account we are imposing an additional tax on the tourist industry, which accounts for four per cent, or $ 949m of our total receipts on that account-with the effect that that has on the balance of payments. Yet the Government proposes to tax this vital industry. What equity is there in that? Presumably, the Government has very rightly exempted primary industry, on the basis that it is an important earner of foreign exchange but has not considered at all the tourist industry, which is also a very vital generator of foreign exchange for this country. We have received representations from people in the tourist industry who are involved in developing multimillion dollar tourist facilities on islands off the north Queensland coastline and are now wondering whether those facilities will be viable. So we believe that there is no equity in exempting primary industry and not at the same time exempting the tourist industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The third category I mentioned was the baking industry. I say only that baking facilities are a basic requirement in any society. I am astounded that the Government is considering imposing on bakers an extra cost which will undoubtedly be passed on immediately to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> In my previous remarks I foreshadowed that on behalf of the Australian Democrats I will move at the Committee stage amendments to this legislation which will seek to exempt from the new rebate these three vital areas of our economy. The rebate represents a secret tax on vital sectors of the economic machine of this country. As I said earlier, these Bills are not impressive pieces of legislation. We are not convinced that they will ease the administrative load of the Department or make it any easier to detect abuses. I will be waiting with great interest to hear the closing comments of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) on this debate to see what possible justification he can put forward for the imposition of increased taxes on at least the three sectors of the economy that I have mentioned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Senate is dealing with the Diesel Fuel Taxes Legislation Amendment Bill 1982 and two related measures. It must be recognised by everybody that the legislation is designed to raise revenue for the Government. That has been the purpose of the exercise for many years now. The Australian Democrats, in their contribution to the debate, have more or less indicated that every Budget that is brought in is a negotiable document. They blithely say that they will not block Supply and traipse around the countryside with statutory declarations. Yet when we bring in a Budget document they seem to think that it is negotiable and try to deny the Government its methods of raising money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose that to say there are anomalies in this legislation is quite arguable . It would be equally arguable that anomalies exist in other revenue raising legislation. I am quite sure that I could make a pretty good case for my not paying income tax. I do not imagine that I would get much sympathy from honourable senators, least of all from the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). So I think one must point out at the outset that these are revenue raising Bills and have been such for some considerable time. As such, they are not negotiable-even though each and every one of us would have some sympathy with some of the matters raised by Senator Siddons. We might feel even more strongly concerning them, but must accept the purpose of these measures, debate them and go along with them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has recognised that for some sections of the community, the price received for their product bears no relationship to the cost incurred. I refer particularly to primary industry, the fishing industry, the timber industry and, to a lesser extent, to the mining industry. The Government has taken that into consideration and in geting rid of the exemptions has allowed a rebate. When I debated the report of the Woodward Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Australian Meat Industry I indicated that regrettably, in a country such as Australia, which has so much going for it, some members of our society seem to wish to cut right across the norm and make a quick buck no matter at whose expense it is derived. Thus we saw practised, irrespective of the damage that could be done, meat substitution that put into jeopardy our whole meat export trade. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the same type of approach taken to tax avoidance and evasion and thus have had to bring in legislation to recoup moneys owing by those who have indulged in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes in order to avoid paying their dues to society. Most other people have no alternative in that regard. When we examined the situation with regard to the diesel exemption, we found that people were abusing the exemption and that a lot of revenue was lost to the Government. The Government introduced this Bill to provide a tightening up. The exemption certificates were discontinued. The rebate system is being introduced. It will tighten up the whole situation. It will prevent the abuses that have occurred in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Siddons spent some considerable time saying how badly off local government would be. I thought everybody in this chamber was aware of the fact that, under the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund Bill 1982, local government will be allowed extra revenue for its road building programs. Instead of getting 10 per cent of the money available from the Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund, the Government is allowing local government 15 per cent to cover that contingency. It has been worked out that local government will not be any worse off. As I said at the outset, this is a revenue raising exercise by the Government. As such, it is not negotiable. A commendable case could be made out for anybody to find a way out of paying revenue to the Government of the day . This is one of the methods used to raise revenue. The Government has provided for those who, as I said, do not receive a price for their product which bears any relationship to the cost of producing that product. We have provided a rebate system. The sooner this legislation is passed, the sooner the rebate system will be put in train. Those people will be able to get back the money that they have paid over and above what they would normally pay. I support the Bill and I do not agree with the proposed amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Collard and other Government speakers for the support that they have expressed for the Diesel Fuel Taxes Legislation Amendment Bill 1982. Senator Collard made a fairly fundamental point which does explain some of the unhappiness which has been expressed by other honourable senators. This, of course, is a revenue raising Bill. It is a Bill which does increase the amount of income which the Government is seeking to help to pay for the very greatly increased outgoings provided in the Budget. These outgoings flow across matters such as roads, which are of direct relevance to many fuel users. The Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program has been referred to. Of course, across the range of Government activities, whether we are looking at defence or my own portfolio of Social Security, substantial additional bills have to be met. My own Department has to spend in excess of some $1,500m plus to carry out the welfare aspects of its activities. That money has to be raised by taxes. For that reason, it is terribly easy for those who are opposing the Bill to point with horror at the fact that the Bill increases the imposts on some sections of the Australian economy. There is no avoiding the fact that taxing measures will do that unless there is a reduction in all forms of taxation. That is a course of action which was not open to the Government when preparing the current Budget .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The debate has raised a series of matters. In deference to the fact that honourable senators have raised them, I wish to comment briefly on the concerns which have been expressed. One of the concerns will, of course, be met by the passage of this legislation that is, the delay which has occurred in the payment of rebates. Those users entitled to rebates have, since August, been awaiting the passage of this legislation to permit rebates to be processed. Once this legislation is passed through the Parliament, it will be possible to put in place the administrative measures required to ensure that the rebates are paid. Claim forms cannot be printed until the legislation has been passed. It is expected that the forms will be available within a few days of that date. Arrangements have been made for the forms to be distributed by oil company agents and fuel distributors. They also will be available at Australian Bureau of Customs offices throughout Australia. The completed application forms, together with the relevant invoices, will then have to be lodged with the diesel fuel rebate section of the Bureau of Customs in the capital city in the applicant's State of residence. The whole of the rebate program will be controlled through the Customs service's computer network. Since this scheme was announced on Budget night, the Customs service has been faced with the task of purchasing hardware, developing and testing the program and recruiting and training data processing officers. This involves a heavy workload in the initial stages. But it is expected that, once this is overcome, processing time will not exceed two weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of the effect on local government is the subject of one of the amendments which are to be moved and was also the subject of comment during the debate. As has been pointed out by Government senators in response, whilst local government will carry some of the impost of this revenue-raising measure it is a section of the economy which will be receiving considerable additional benefits in the Budget. In 1982-83, the total allocation for local roads under the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program and the ongoing roads program is expected to amount to about $200m-an increase of $39m or 24 per cent over last year's level. That increase will more than offset the additional excise charges which are unlikely to exceed about $10m in 1982-83. The Bureau of Transport Economics has roughly estimated that, combined, the extension of diesel fuel excise and the surcharge will add between one per cent and 2 per cent to road construction costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The benefits to local government will be greater in the next full financial year because, of course, it will get the full benefit of the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program. There is a total allocation for local roads which is estimated at $235m, which is $73m or 46 per cent higher than the 1981-82 level. Of course, local government will also benefit from the increased general revenue assistance in the personal income tax sharing grants which will increase by about $75m or almost 21 per cent over last year's allocation, bringing the total assistance under that scheme to $1,783m since 1976-77. In other words, it is true that there will be some additional impost on local government because of this measure. That is more than offset by the various benefits which flow to local government from the recent Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to refer to the other particular points that are raised by Senator Siddons's amendment. Senator Siddons touched on this aspect during the second reading debate and it may shorten the debate in Committee if I mention why the Government does not support the proposed amendments. Senator Siddons proposes to move an amendment to include in the rebate scheme the provision of accommodation for other persons. The Bill already contains provisions for the payment of the rebate on diesel fuel used at residential premises except where the accommodation is run as a business so that hotels, motels and boarding houses are excluded. Of course, it is possible to point to any area of business activity and say that it ought to be subject to exclusion, as Senator Siddons has said with respect to the tourist industry. The more exclusions there are, of course, the more heavily the impost falls on those non-excluded sections of the economy. One could go on endlessly multiplying the categories of business which might, in order to encourage their activities, be exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say I was somewhat tickled by the words used by Senator Siddons in the debate when this matter was before the Senate last Thursday. Senator Siddons said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is just another example of a government masquerading as Father Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, Senator Siddons is having his little go at being a Father Christmas through the amendments that he proposes to move. He is selecting some parts of the economy that he thinks would particularly benefit from exemption. He is endeavouring to show what a Father Christmas he would be with respect to them. I say again, as I have said in previous debates, that it is very easy for the Australian Democrats to propose benign amendments to taxation legislation which will lift the burden of taxation as it is terribly easy for them to support substantial additional expenditure. I am told that Senator Macklin, who is in the chamber now, attended a pensioners' meeting in Brisbane and cheerfully supported increases in the rates of pensions which would lift them to a very much greater proportion of average weekly earnings. The Australian Democrats take a luxury position; they sit there and demand increased expenditure and reduced taxation. I think it is important that at some stage those people who are interested in the Democrats, and perhaps in supporting them, should ask them to draw up something of a balance sheet of those increases and decreases that they seek. It is too easy to come into this place and urge that the impost be lifted from those sections of the community favoured by them. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of the fishing industry was raised in particular by my colleague Senator Archer. It has been dealt with in the sense that the concern that he has for operators engaged in fishing-their not being able to use the claim procedure because of the operations that they are involved in and the long period that they are away and so on-has been dealt with satisfactorily and can be dealt with administratively. The admission of fishing co-operatives to the arrangements as parties which will be able to process claims on behalf of the fishermen should remove that difficulty. No amendment of the legislation is required to meet the concern which was the subject of representations by Senator Archer. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same way, reference was made during the debate, and representations were made prior to the legislation's coming into the Senate, on the possible differential effect of the impost on the iron ore producers in the Pilbara. A very careful examination of the Bill and a check with the Attorney-General's Department of the wording of the legislation have disclosed a situation in which the feared differential impact will not in fact apply. The definitions contained in the Bill are wide enough to ensure that the legislation can be applied in a uniform way to the various iron ore producers in the Pilbara. </PARA>
<PARA> There were queries about the amount of additional revenue that this measure will collect. They were raised by both Senator Walsh for the Opposition and Senator Siddons for the Australian Democrats. The Budget announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) was that the changed arrangements were estimated to yield a net increase in revenue of $161m in 1982-83 at the previously existing excise rate of 5.155c a litre and $176m in a full year. As far as the precise burden which will fall on different users is concerned, that can only be subject to estimate because there simply are no records available which would tightly indicate the amounts of fuel used by sectors of industry. In other words, no records are available to give in precise terms the burden which will be carried by any particular section of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh raised the possibility of dyed fuel being used. That matter has been raised over the years, not merely by the Opposition but also by many who have been concerned both at the incidence of abuse and at the desire to have access to fuel in appropriate circumstances. Organisations such as the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia (Incorporated) have put it forward at meetings. I remember that it came up at one meeting in Meekatharra when Senator Walsh was in attendance. It is an issue that has been raised before and that has been considered. Under the old system of providing exemption for off-road use, there was a series of reasons why it was thought that that was not a practical approach. Of course, those reasons are no longer relevant, but to introduce that scheme now would undoubtedly complicate the physical handling arrangements of those who provide fuel and, indeed, the users of fuel who might require separate storage for the coloured fuel and the non- coloured fuel as they carry out activities some of which are exempt and some of which are not exempt. In addition, the sort of examination that would be required in a country the size of Australia suggests that as a policing measure it would have to be accompanied by substantial inspection facilities, which would be quite difficult. However, I note the suggestion which was made by Senator Walsh and which, as I have said, has been made on other occasions. I will refer it to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr Peacock) for further and future consideration. I know that it would have support from some sections of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think there is anything further that I wish to say. Senator Archer raised the possibility of a further amendment to include the timber industry. It is quite clear that one could go on endlessly increasing the categories of exemption or the categories of those entitled to the rebate. This is a measure which is part of the Government's Budget. Whilst it is not a measure which will bring in billions of dollars, it will bring in some $160m. It is a significant measure and the Government does not see its way clear to interfere with its Budget in this respect or other respects which would have the effect of changing the Budget aggregates in a way which the Government does not believe would be in the interests of Australia. </PARA>

However, it ought to be realised that there is a real possibility that if the request of Senator Siddons is not agreed to there could well be increases in the price of a loaf of bread, part of the staple diet.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has considerable sympathy with at least the first of the three sub-paragraphs of the request moved by Senator Siddons; that is, the one that relates to local government. I will say a bit more about that in a moment. As to sub-paragraphs (f) and (g), notwithstanding what Senator Harradine has just said, it seems to us that to say that we will exempt the baking industry and the accommodation industry, as proposed in Senator Siddons's request, is a completely arbitrary decision. I acknowledge that the decisions which have already been made by the Government as to who and who will not be exempt from this excise are probably equally arbitrary, but there is no clear, consistent or guiding principle, it seems to us, as to what should or should not be exempt. It is clear that local government -we have considerably more sympathy for it-is having a pea and thimble trick pulled on it by the Fraser Government. With much fanfare we have the announcement of the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program which is to be financed by increased taxes on distillate generally. I am informed by the Local Government Association that local government's share in that extra money will be in the vicinity of only $1m and the extra tax imposed by the extension of the excise tax on distillate used by local government in an off-road capacity will cancel the benefit derived from the local government share of the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, there is one other consideration on which a firm blanket statement has been made by the Opposition; that is, that Budget measures will not be opposed in the Senate. Quite clearly, this is a Budget measure; it was announced on Budget night. Underpinning the general statement which the Australian Labor Party has made is the proposition that this Budget is Malcolm Fraser's Budget and he can live with it. I might say that the Opposition shares the sentiments and the assessment expressed by the Australian Democrats last week on another motion about the Prime Minister's penchant for misrepresenting the truth. If any amendments to this Bill were to be carried in the Senate there is little doubt that the truth of the matter and the significance of the amendments would be misrepresented by the Prime Minister. I am a little confused by the Australian Democrats' action in this case when it is juxtaposed with their action in respect of a second reading amendment last week. The second reading amendment to which I refer was in respect of the Drought Assistance (Primary Producers) Bill, which was not a Budget measure. The Australian Democrats did not support a second reading amendment about something which was not a Budget measure. They gave their reasons, which I have mentioned; that they believed the Prime Minister would misrepresent the facts, the truth. They are almost certainly right about that. I am confused as to why in that instance they took that view and in this case, on an amendment at the Committee stage of a Bill-which as we all know is more meaningful than a second reading amendment, if it is carried, because it does actually change the substance of the Bill-they have chosen to take a different course of action. </PARA>
<PARA> With some regret I state that the Opposition will not support the amendments whether they are put separately or conjointly. We have particular regrets in not supporting the first of the amendments-the one which relates to local governments-because, as I said, local government has had a pea and thimble trick pulled on it. But they are Budget measures. We gave a blanket statement of policy two months ago that Budget measures would not be blocked in the Senate. The Opposition feels obliged to abide by that statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few remarks in relation to clause 5 of the Diesel Fuel Taxes Legislation Amendment Bill. In my opinion clause 5 is one of the worst worded clauses of a Bill that I have ever seen in my life. The amount of confusion it has created within the mining industry in particular would not be believed. First, I want to say a couple of words about the fishing industry. Senator Archer mentioned in his speech at the second reading stage of the Bill on Thursday that following representations by him, Senator Collard, Senator Withers and me, the Government had agreed to changes in the regulations with regard to the excise collection provisions. I thank the Government for that change. Until that happened there was a great deal of confusion about this in the fishing industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to give an example of the sort of confusion that it can create, and still creates, in another industry altogether-the salt industry. There are many major salt producers in Western Australia. One of them, Dampier Salt Ltd, is the second largest in the world. In fact, it was the largest until the Mexican industry began just a few years ago. Because of the way in which clause 5 of the Bill is worded the industry is still uncertain as to how this fuel excise will be applied. Information that I have received from departments and Ministers indicates that when the salt is harvested from the evaporative pans it will be covered by the exemption provisions of the legislation; when the salt is carted from the pans to the washing plant it will be covered; but when the salt is carted from the washing pans to the storage area or the port it will not be covered. I can understand that. I guess it is reasonable to make that assumption . But the salt industry has put to me very strongly the point of view that when the salt is in storage at the port a draining or beneficiation process is going on, because a larger amount of water, bitterns and liquid is left in the salt after it has been through the washing process. The industry claims that this storage in fact is a form of beneficiation. I suppose the industry will be making representations to the Government after this Bill is passed. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to reinforce the point of view which was put forward by Senator Walsh, Senator Archer and other speakers on Thursday with regard to the iron ore industry in the Pilbara. There are four producers there. It looked to us, and certainly to the industry, as though the Bill would disadvantage one of the producers there, Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd, to the tune of something like $2.2m, or up to $3.2m if it reached full production again of 48 million tonnes a year, as against the other three producers which will be exempt from the diesel excise with regard to the cartage of the iron ore from the mine site to the port. This is all to do with the understanding of the word 'beneficiation'. I thank the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) for the words he used in his summary of the second reading debate when he said that he and the Minister whom he represents had been to see the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and had obtained a ruling on this matter to say that my fears and the fears I have expressed to the Ministers and the Govenrment over the last five weeks are unfounded. </PARA>
<PARA> This really is an example of the messy framing of this Bill. The Bill is impossible to understand. I know that many other people at the margins who wish to have this matter interpreted will express concern. I understand from the Minister that departmental officers will be travelling around the mining industry and seeing people affected in other areas to try to explain just what the Bill means. I wish them the very best of British luck. It seems strange to me that the Government could not come up with a form of words which made the situation much more clear in the first place. This would have saved us and many other people a great deal of trouble. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment moved by Senator Siddons. I do not want to speak overlong about it but I do wish to raise an item in relation to local government. It seems to me to be absurd that we should seek to tax one level of government when today the Senate has received a Bill in relation to the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program. I am not quite sure about the estimate of $1m to which Senator Walsh referred, but in Queensland alone that program will involve in the vicinity of $3m. At the same time we are taking away through additional charges within this Budget an amount almost equal to that which will be given to local government under that Bill. Those figures have been given to me by the Local Government Association of Queensland, which, as probably most people would know, is not likely to be stocked very well by either the Australian Labor Party or the Australian Democrats. In fact, that group would be much more sympathetic to the Government. I believe its proposition is a very firm one. It raises the absurdity of the Federal Government giving with one hand and taking away with the other, and seeking to tax even further another arm of government. Local governments might be in some way appeased if they were allowed to levy taxes on the Commonwealth by way of rates, of which they lose massive amounts every year throughout Queensland. Of course that is not allowable, and I believe this tax ought not to be allowable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer now to the second part of the amendment. Senator Siddons spoke at length on tourism, which affects very closely my own State. The legislation would raise the very odd and very absurd items that tend to arise from such legislation simply because the Government initially did not even know who was able to be exempt and certainly it had very little idea of what was likely to happen to the various categories it was tossing out under the Diesel Fuel Taxes Legislation Amendment Bill. In relation to tourism on islands, for example, it is all right for a person with a launch to call it a ferry providing that he is engaged in ferry services. If the vessel happens to take part in cruises it is not exempt. If one were to put fuel into two identical boats, the one engaged in ferry activities would be exempt but the boat engaged in cruise activities would not be exempt. I seek from the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) what precisely is the difference between a ferry operation and a cruise operation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister for Social Security) (4.13)-It is clear that Senator Thomas has led a blameless life up to now and certainly has not been involved in the tax industry at all because his expression of horror about the wording of clause 5 suggests that he has not tried to read a lot of the sections of, for example, the Income Tax Assessment Act, which I think would make clause 5 look positively simple, straightforward and easy to understand. The fact is that some queries have been raised in respect of the definition of clause 5. Some of those queries have been answered but I do not think it would have escaped most honourable senators that however tax laws are drawn, even if the most beautiful simplicity is apparent, it is amazing what complications can be found. Undoubtedly, some time and effort will go into trying to push to the limit the extensions or the entitlements to rebates which are contained in this legislation. It would be very strange if that did not occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the amendment is concerned, I can share Senator Walsh's expression. It is with some regret that I oppose it. One would like to see exemptions widend . Nobody likes to see taxes imposed on any part of the community or on any part of the economy but it remains true-I accept his words-that there is to some extent an arbitrary decision to impose this tax because there is a requirement for revenue and it has to be raised from somewhere. In general, I would support the broad thesis that the tax should be as broadly applicable as possible and have as few exemptions as possible, notwithstanding that one might wish to see particular sectors exempted from it. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already addressed the question of whether local government benefits from the Budget or otherwise. I have tried to produce figures which show that it is not a pea and thimble trick, as it was described by Senator Walsh. Substantial moneys flow from the Commonwealth to local government through both a percentage of income tax and the roads program. On this occasion there is some impost on local government which, in a sense, simply makes local government compete on even terms with other sections of the community which would compete with local government in the provision of certain services and goods. For example, in the road making field local government is in competition with other elements and there is no particular reason why it should be treated differently from other people who provide that service. I have already addressed the particular exemptions in my response to the second reading debate. I do not believe that any other additional new points have been raised. I indicate that with some regret the Government also will be opposing this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps one other thing should be said. Senator Walsh indicated that the Opposition regards this Budget as the Budget of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), and he has to wear it. The Government wants the responsibility of wearing its own Budget. It does not want the responsibility of wearing a Budget which is being whittled away and changed to meet the political whims of the Australian Democrats. If we are to be judged on this Budget, it should be our Budget and not something which is pushed into some different shape by the Democrats' views. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> Page 3, clause 5, proposed new section 164, sub-section (7), definition of ' agriculture', after paragraph (c), add:</PARA>
<PARA> 'or (ca) the manufacture of food for live-stock,'. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not an amendment. It is a request moved by me in Committee for reference to the House of Representatives. It is simply requested to fix up an anomaly. I put it at that level in the hope that the Government will have a look at this request and see its way clear to resolving this anomaly. What my request proposes to do is to make the manufacture of food for livestock the basis for rebates under the definition of agriculture. At the present moment a substantial amount of food is being provided for livestock in situations of drought. I am advised by the industry in my State of Tasmania that, because of drought conditions, sheep pellets are being supplied at this time of the year, which is most unusual. Certainly those who will be affected by the failure of the Government to provide rebates in respect of food for livestock are the very persons in the drought affected areas for which the Government says it has a concern. I accept that the Government and the Opposition have concern for these particular areas but I suggest that they then support the Australian Democrats and me on this matter because, as I say, it really is an anomaly. In proposed new section 164 (7) (c) the definition of agriculture is stated as being:</PARA>
<PARA> The rearing of live-stock. </PARA>
<PARA>How can one rear livestock under drought conditions without manufactured food for livestock? We will have the situation in which a farmer gets in his tractor, puts sheep pellets on his trailer and goes out into the paddock. Under the provisions of this Bill, the tax on the fuel in the tractor is rebatable but the tax on the fuel used for the production of the livestock food carried in the trailer is not rebatable. If that is not an anomaly, I do not know what is. I understand that the Department has given a definition or an interpretation of the proposed new section which in effect excludes the manufacture of food for livestock. Frankly, I cannot understand that. It is not only the sheep grazing industry which is affected. Pellets for the pig industry and the poultry industry are also produced. I ask the Government whether in all fairness it could not go along with this proposition to request the House of Representatives to have another look at this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that Government members in the House of Representatives from Tasmania would be quite anxious to look at this aspect if it were referred back to the House of Representatives. My advice from the manufacturer in Tasmania is that they have said that it is too late to do anything with the matter in the House of Representatives because the Bill is before the Senate. The object of this move is to give the House of Representatives and the Government a chance to have another look at what I believe is an anomaly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has had some notice of this amendment as it was circulated and drawn to the Government's attention by Senator Harradine when the Bill was last before us. I have therefore had the opportunity of referring the matter to the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) for his consideration. The Minister has confirmed that the Government would wish to oppose this legislation. I do not agree with Senator Harradine that this is a situation which is an anomaly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have in the Bill a very broad definition of agriculture and it encompasses virtually all the activities which would take place on a farm, for example, pest control activities. That could be a very important element of a farmer's activities in these days, as in any days in farming. What the definition does not encompass is some exemption for the manufacturer of pest control goods which might be used on a farm. In other words, the exemption which is provided relates to activities which take place on the farm and not to activities which supplement the farm activities and which affect the goods which might be purchased for use on the farm. The Government, having established that exemption for the rural industries, does not propose to support any widening of the exemption to cover those industries which provide services which are ancillary to primary production. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise the acknowledgment which Senator Harradine made when speaking to his amendment that both the Government and the Opposition have indicated their desire to provide support for the rural industries in this difficult period of drought. The best estimate that we have been able to make as to the value of the exemption put forward by Senator Harradine is about $1m. That is of necessity a guesstimate rather than a close estimate. The amount is not very large but the question is the extent to which one goes on redrawing the boundaries of the exemption. That figure of $1m stands in contrast to the drought relief legislation which passed through this Parliament last week and which provides for expenditure in excess of, I think, $360m on some of the additional facets of relief which are being granted in acknowledgment of the widespread and serious drought to which most of eastern Australia is subject. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that we do not have to discuss this amendment in the context of an allegation that the Government is not concerned about the drought problems of farmers. Senator Harradine was gracious enough to make that point in his comments. I regret that I cannot in a similarly gracious manner acknowledge and accept his amendment, but the Government, having considered it, believes that would open up equally logical extensions which it does not think it should entertain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will not be supporting this amendment-for all the reasons which I gave about 20 minutes ago and which I do not intend to repeat, and for one additional reason. In most cases what is excluded and included is substantially, if not entirely, an arbitrary decision. If we were to accept this amendment, given that Senator Harradine has introduced the present drought as at least a major reason for moving it, we would be supporting a change which would be both arbitrary and ephemeral. The Diesel Fuel Taxes Legislation Amendment Bill 1982 will last until it is repealed at some time in the future. The drought almost certainly will be finished next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make one other comment in case there is some misunderstanding. Whilst it is correct that pelletised food is fed quite commonly to poultry and occasionally to pigs, it is rarely fed to ruminants. In response to Senator Harradine's rhetorical question as to what, if the stock-we are talking about ruminants mostly-in drought affected areas is not fed with sheep pellets, will keep it alive, the answer by and large is that the food which will keep them alive is the components of the sheep pellets fed in their raw state. </PARA>

It states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a matter I did touch upon in my response to the second reading debate but I obviously did not make the point clearly. The Government would be opposing that amendment but would in fact be picking up the position of co-operatives. I think the difference between the proposed amendment and what the Government is proposing is that we would not be widening the provisions to apply to fuel companies which might be providing the service but widening it to cover co- operatives. It is proposed to deal with this matter administratively. Those who are engaged in fishing operations who are working through co-operatives can be covered in a way which is satisfactory. Direct representations have been made on that aspect and that is one of the matters which will be dealt with not by amendment to the legislation but by amendment to the administrative arrangements .</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Loan Bill (No. 2) is a Bill to finance partially the deficit by borrowing under the Government's defence powers for defence expenditure, which governments may do up to a limit of $1,500m. It is a measure that comes in every year, I believe; it has appeared in every year that I can remember. It is a completely normal machinery bill of government, although in 1975 it was said by some of the excitable people in the then Opposition that there were sinister motives behind it. Indeed, Senator Sir John Carrick became so excited that he described it as a corrupt device. It is certainly needed this year because the deficit estimated in the Budget of $1, 674m will clearly overrun by something between $650m and $900m on the expenditure side, and we believe that on the revenue side there will be a shortfall of about $1 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A significant reason for that revenue shortfall is that of the $225m which the Government had forecast that it would recover from its proposed tax recoupment legislation only a tiny fraction will now be recovered. At most we estimate it to be $37m, which will, from that item alone, cause a shortfall in revenue of $ 188m. Leaving aside the possibility that the estimate was rubbery in the first instance, that shortfall will be the consequence of two spectacular surrenders by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Government. The first of those surrenders was the decision to require vendor shareholders to pay 25 per cent of the tax liability assessed within 30 days of receiving the assessment and to give them 12 months to pay the other 75 per cent-in some circumstances, perhaps even more than 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be remembered that these people are the ones whom the Prime Minister described last month as recipients of stolen money. One may speculate legitimately and justifiably, I believe, as to whether the Government is about to declare that bank robbers and thieves in general will be given 12 months to repay the money that they have stolen once they have been caught. The 75 per cent tax liability assessed which may be deferred for 12 months carries, moreover, no interest penalty. Even Mr Sinclair pays interest on the money which he tells us his father stole from the Walsh companies. It is only at 10 per cent , admittedly, but at least he pays some interest. But these other recipients of stolen funds, as the Prime Minister has designated them, will get 12 months to repay the money that they have, and they will pay no interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The second spectacular surrender by the Prime Minister and the Government concerns the decision to exempt entirely an estimated 700 companies from the provisions of the tax recoupment Bill as it was first introduced. That is about one-sixth of the estimated number of companies, but in all probability a great deal more than one-sixth of the money is involved because they tend to be the larger companies. It is probable that something between one-third and one-half of the tax liability, as distinct from the number of companies involved, will now be forgiven. The criterion for that forgiveness will be where a company's untaxed profits were offset by losses against another company in the promoter's hands-apparently, in many cases if not in most cases, by Curran-type arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it quite extraordinary that a Prime Minister who was talking so rough and tough just a few weeks ago about his attitude to tax evaders, and even to tax avoiders if one cares to go back a little further, should have caved in so readily to these two propositions, the first of which defers into the next financial year at the very least the collection of 75 per cent of the tax evaded -the stolen money, as the Prime Minister designated it-and the second of which cancels permanently the Government's claim on something between one-third and one-half of the revenue which it has said it would collect. Again, I believe that one can justifiably speculate as to just who were the owners of those companies which are to be exempted by that spectacular surrender. One does not need to be very suspicious to suspect very strongly that the vender shareholders of those companies are very influential people in the Liberal Party of Australia . So, for a variety of reasons, this Loan Bill is particularly necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The recoupment legislation, as originally introduced, was weak legislation never designed or claimed to recover more than a tiny fraction of the billions of dollars which had been evaded. It is now watered down as to be almost meaningless. It will, of course, to a very significant degree, blow out the Budget deficit which in part this Bill is designed to finance. It is, however, a normal machinery measure of government and will not be opposed by the Opposition . The consequences of the additional deficit blowout, caused by the Prime Minister's and Government weak cave-in to vested interests, the Government will be called to account for later. </PARA>
<PARA> Before closing I would like to add just one point with respect to the feeble excuse offered by Senator Sir John Carrick this afternoon and by the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) at the end of last week for this surrender to the people whom the Prime Minister has designated as recipients of stolen money. Senator Sir John Carrick's excuse was that unless people are given time to pay firms will be forced into bankruptcy and disemployment will result. He asked the rhetorical question as to whether the Labor Party wants disemployment. Of course the Labor Party does not want disemployment; that is why it wants to get rid of this Government. But Senator Sir John Carrick's excuse is phoney. There is a general provision already existing under section 206 of the Income Tax Assessment Act which allows the Commissioner of Taxation discretion in cases of hardship to defer the collection of tax which has been assessed. The technical legal view has been put to me that the recoupment legislation would not necessarily be covered by section 206 in the Income Tax Assessment Act. But there is, of course , nothing to stop the Government writing an identical clause into the recoupment legislation. So the Government has not only surrendered to people described by the Prime Minister as being most unworthy; it is now offering false excuses to try to camouflage the surrender. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill is being presented at a very early time in the current financial year. Last year the Loan Bill was presented much later and was for a much smaller amount of money. Last year's Bill involved only $300m; this Bill involves $1,500m. The Loan Bill for the last financial year was passed in the Senate on 19 May 1982. During debate on that Bill I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By paying for defence expenditure with moneys from the Loan Bill other revenue can be diverted for non-defence purposes. Basically, the Bill is a short term measure to stop the Government going broke at a time when tax revenue is not coming in at a sufficiently fast rate. Since we are not in the business of bringing down governments we will not oppose this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>We said last year and we say again this year that we are not in the business of bringing down governments so we will not be opposing this loan Bill. Of course, that does not mean, unlike apparently the Australian Labor Party's latest tactic , that we will not be seeking to amend any piece of legislation that has a dollar sign on it. We believe that the Senate has a legitimate role in reviewing all legislation and amending some Bills that may involve money. But this Bill, obviously, is fundamental to allowing the Government to govern and for that reason we do not intend to oppose it. However, we ask: Why is there the haste and why does the legislation involve this amount of money? We believe that this legislation could well be a symptom of the Government running short of money and having trouble meeting its immediate commitments. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to remind the Senate of the economic policies followed by President Hoover in the early 1930s which directly contributed to the severity and the length of the Great Depression. Under Mr Hoover the money supply was drastically restricted at a time of economic recession, transforming that recession into a full blooded depression. Fearing inflation, the Federal Reserve or the central bank of the world's greatest economic power strongly restricted banks' reserves and starved the economic state of money. Taxes were increased, the economy was in a slump and the deficit was growing. The Hoover Administration and Congress agreed to raise taxes in 1931 by $900m or nearly 30 per cent. The Hoover Administration, however, had the spectacle of seeing revenue falling and the deficit increasing from a projected $1.2 billion to $2.7 billion. That is how the Great Depression eventuated. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other very obvious parallels between what happened in 1931 and what is happening in 1982. In 1931 interest rates in the United States suddenly fell dramatically-interest rates on call, for instance, fell from 20 per cent to one per cent between 1929 and 1931. This strongly restricted banks' reserves and starved the economic system of money. We are being stalked by the spectre of a depression. The demonstrations outside this chamber only a little while ago can only be a foretaste of what will come if this Government does not act quickly to establish a national consensus. I pray to God that we may fight off another depression such as I lived through as a small child. I fear, however, that the conservatives opposite are condemned by their ideology to inflict misery upon us . I hope that that does not happen. I hope that they see the need for consensus on an immediate and dramatic change of direction in the economic management of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) That the following matter be referred to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence for inquiry and report as a matter of urgency: the effects on the aircraft industry of:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the level of work needed by the industry in order to maintain skills in the industry;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) proposed retrenchments in the industry, as a result of the decision to cut by 30 the Nomad Project, on available skills in:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) technical management and design, and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) trade skills related to aircraft production; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the cost of an extension of the Nomad Project to cover the loss of skills in projected retrenchments in the period between the rundown in Nomad production and the commencement of the F/A-18 and the trainer program. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That no retrenchment of employees should take place until both Houses of the Parliament have debated the Joint Committee's report on this reference. </PARA>
<PARA>This motion relates to the Government aircraft industry in Australia. In a sense , the terms of reference are almost self-explanatory. In that industry a very serious situation has developed as a result of, in summary, a lack of availability or work, particularly at such locations as that of the Fishermans Bend Government Aircraft Factory. My major concern in moving the motion is that over the years Australia has assembled a skilled work force in the aircraft industry and the Opposition is concerned that that work force should be maintained as a cohesive employment group. If those skills are lost to the industry probably they will be lost permanently. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of reports on the Australian aircraft industry have been produced. One , the one hundred and ninety eighth report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on Government Aircraft Factories, concluded basically that the Government should develop comprehensive reviews of defence establishments, particularly aircraft industry establishments. As recorded at page 44 of the report the Committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the Government consider, subject to normal commercial considerations, the greater utilisation by Departments and Statutory Authorities, the production capabilities of GAF. </PARA>
<PARA>Additional recommendations, including those on pages 42, 43 and 44, deal with a much wider concern-the need to retain continuity within the aircraft manufacturing industry in order to maintain existing establishments and the coherence of the peculiarly skilled work forces in those establishments. There is a sense of deja vu about my motion because it is almost a case of Bendigo Ordnance Factory revisited. I am not making partisan political points here. Maintaining the continuity of work in basically defence oriented industries and, consequently, maintaining the skilled work forces in those industries has always been a problem for governments. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been much criticism of the management of the Government Aircraft Factories. However, I have noted no criticism of the quality of the work produced or the talent and skill of the work force. This motion is moved in that context. Its effect is to ask the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence to report as a matter of urgency the effects on the aircraft industry of the level of work needed to maintain skills and the proposed retrenchments as a result of a decision to cut the Nomad project by 30 aircraft. It is also asked to inquire into questions of trade skills related to aircraft production, technical management and design and so on. There has been a good deal of correspondence about this matter between the Minister for Defence Support (Mr Viner) and personnel at the various aircraft factories. I understand that the Minister has now conceded that the original Nomad project, involving the production of 170 aircraft, the number first considered appropriate, should be carried out. I understand that that undertaking is given in correspondence with other members of parliament. That is the effect of what the Minister is saying. I am informed that even as late as today or yesterday some 38 employees of one of the establishments-I think Fishermans Bend-were retrenched. That process, unhappily, may continue. That is the point of the last paragraph of my notice of motion, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> That no retrenchment of employees should take place until both Houses of the Parliament have debated the Joint Committee's report on this reference. </PARA>
<PARA>It is very important-I believe most honourable senators would agree-that Australia maintain an aircraft manufacturing capability for both defence and civil reasons. This parliament and governments of either political persuasion- again I am not making partisan political points-are faced with the necessity to look very hard at some of the problems associated with particularly highly- skilled based industries, such as the aircraft manufacturing industry, and the fundamental concern and need to maintain that capacity in Australia. For that reason the motion has been moved. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Messner, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, has indicated to me that the Government would be anxious to include the word 'compulsory' in paragraph 2 of the motion after the word 'no' and before the word 'retrenchment'. No doubt the Minister can explain the difference, but I would not be averse to that amendment. In fact, I am appreciative of the Government's willingness to have this matter brought on. It is very important that it be dealt with as soon as possible. There is chronic anxiety in the industry about the possible dispersion of a skilled work force. That should be avoided at all costs. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I just mention that a number of members of Parliament, particularly the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), have been very diligent in negotiating with the Minister to try to see that something is done about this difficult situation. I feel that the Senate should take the course of approving the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise merely to say that the Australian Democrats support this reference to the Joint Committee of Foreigh Affairs and Defence. We have received various representations from the aircraft industry, so we have had the opportunity to hear at first hand some of its problems. We believe that there is a very grave risk of the basic aircraft manufacturing capacity of this country being eroded to the point where it will disappear. The skills in the aircraft industry are very peculiar to that industry. Once they are dispersed they are gone and are very difficult to to re-establish. It is very difficult to re-assemble people with those sorts of skills. It is the old story-once an industry is dead it does not come back to life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We believe that there is a very urgent need to keep the Nomad project going until such time as the FA18 project-I refer particularly to its off-shore aspects-can be phased into our aircraft industry. The Nomad project has been a highly contentious one. Nevertheless, some very basic research development work has been done on that aircraft. We understand a new tail plane has already been designed and is waiting to be tested. We would like to see that proceed, with the idea that that development could be incorporated in an additional batch of Nomad aircraft and could perhaps considerably improve the importance of that particular design. The Nomad, with all its shortcomings, does give us an aircraft which is capable of being used for surveillance purposes. As such, it seems that the Government could reasonably, logically and justifiably place additional orders for the Nomad until such time as other work can be phased in. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to see helicopters produced in this country. Unfortunately, that will take a little time. I urge the Government to look at that matter very carefully to see whether we can get a suitable helicopter for manufacture here. The struggle of the Falklands proved beyond reasonable doubt -at least I would have thought it did-the need to have the capability to service and maintain aircraft and, in fact, to produce them within one's own country. With an island continent such as we live in, the defence of our shores requires a viable aircraft industry. We are isolated. We cannot rely on imports. We need to have self-sufficiency in this vital industry. The Australian Democrats are very pleased to support the reference moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button). We hope that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence can deliberate on this vital question quickly and put a recommendation to the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Paragraph 2, after the word 'no', insert 'compulsory'. </PARA>
<PARA> I rise to make the Government's position clear in respect of the amendment I have just moved. I draw the Senate's attention to that amendment which, as the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button) has pointed out, may be something of a misnomer or a contradiction in terms. The very point is that a great deal of discussion has been undertaken by the Minister for Defence Support (Mr Viner) and his officials with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and other bodies in connection with the possibility of people voluntarily seeking retrenchment-I suppose that is the right word-in circumstances which might suit them. This would entitle them to the benefits of compulsory retrenchment arrangements. Accordingly, that would give the Government some flexibility in dealing with a situation that may arise where individuals personally see some benefits in their taking that course. I hope that the Senate will see its way clear to accepting my amendment although, as a whole, there are substantial reasons for opposing the motion. I will, at a later time, seek to make the Government's position clear in respect of the whole motion. I believe that some benefit would accrue to individual employees if the word compulsory were included in paragraph 2 of the motion. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the broader questions. I should quickly state the history of this matter. The statement by the Government in respect of the stoppage of Nomad aircraft production was made, I think, on 7 May this year. The production limit set was 170 aircraft. Senator Siddons referred to the retention of the aircraft industry. He made specific reference to redesign work in respect of the tail plane of the Nomad and the possible benefits that that might bring for later marketing opportunities. The Government has given consideration to the capability of the aircraft for the kinds of purposes he has enumerated and the kinds of variations which he has suggested. The Government has come to the reluctant conclusion that 170 aircraft is about the maximum number that the organisation can market for the kinds of purposes that are deemed to be feasible . For that reason the Government obviously has accepted the advice of experts in this regard. It sees the need to stop production at that point. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Siddons has other suggestions in respect of marketing opportunities he may see fit to put those views forward at the forthcoming hearings of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. I guess that that is an appropriate thing for him to do. On present indications and given that there will be a substantial upgrading in the Government's marketing capacity in trying to raise the numbers of sales to the level anticipated-that is, 170 aircraft- then the objective of building 170 aircraft seems to be realistic. As was pointed out, there is a continuing program of reduction of employment in the Government Aircraft Factories. That was detailed at an earlier time and I will not go over it again. I will make the point that the greater part of this reduction in employment will occur as a result of natural wastage, through retirements and so on. Senator Siddons made a very substantial point, as did Senator Button, with regard to the retention of the aircraft industry. The Government certainly sees the need for this retention and in fact is encouraging it. As I believe was acknowledged at an earlier time, there is to be a substantial offset of work arising from the new FA18 aircraft program. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The value of the work to be undertaken by Australian industry under those arrangements will be 30 per cent of the imported content of the program and there are compensation provisions if the United States contractors should fail to meet those commitments. I think Senator Button would acknowledge that as a very substantial development. This would also include the export of Australian made components to United States contractors. I understand that considerable value is to be put on that. In fact, it means that some $60m would be spent on new capital facilities required in the aircraft industry. That would be a very substantial upgrading in Australia's aircraft technology. I think it should not be forgotten that this certainly does not represent the end of the road but rather an opportunity to move towards new technology with new aircraft. It means a substantial investment in a new aircraft that clearly will be of benefit to Australian industry in the future and clearly will have job creation potential.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Naturally, the work to be done in Australia on the relatively small volume of Royal Australian Air Force F18 aircraft would cost more than it would have cost had the work been done in the high volume production lines in the United States. The Government is bearing those substantial additional costs in order to undertake work in Australian industry, thus achieving a technological advance and, of course, an improvement in our support capability. Clearly there will be an improvement in the satisfaction of those undertaking such jobs. Of course there will be future opportunities and interest in those potential jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also recently authorised the design, development and production in Australia of a new basic trainer for the RAAF. This aircraft will cost more than importing aircraft or building, under licence, on a foreign design. Again, that demonstrates the Government's commitment to building a substantial capability in Australia. The acceptance of that cost penalty is a further illustration of that very point. Very substantial export orders have been won by Australian industry which has been assisted by the pressure exerted on overseas suppliers by the Government's offset policy. This has been and continues to be applied to the procurement of both commercial and military aircraft as well as other major overseas purchases. The Australian aircraft industry is a specific beneficiary of that policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to stop the production of the Nomad aircraft at 170 has been carefully considered. It is an expensive aircraft to produce. The price we can sell it for is, of course, constrained by what the market will bear. There will also be a substantial upgrading of marketing capability in order to reach the production of 170. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is substantially committed to the continuance of an aircraft industry and is seeking ways and means by which its opportunities can be enhanced. As I have just pointed out, there are opportunities in the future, especially arising from our offset policy and in relation to the FA18 program still ahead of us. As I think Senator Siddons may have pointed out, I acknowledge that there will be some hiatus in respect of that matter before it gets off the ground. But, clearly, the commitment is there and the Government is prepared to pay the higher price in money terms to keep Australian aircraft industries at a high level of technology. </PARA>
<PARA> For all these reasons, given that there is a need for some flexibility in the arrangements in running the Government Aircraft Factories, given the fact that times are changing and there will be a need to move to new technology and given the reference now being made to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, I hope that all honourable senators will see their way clear to allow flexibility as is indicated by the amendment which I have moved. </PARA>

<PARA>To assist the consideration of the Bill at the Committee stage, I will apprise the Senate of recent developments and foreshadow the amendments that have been moved. The amendments have been circulated for the benefit of honourable senators. I take this opportunity to thank honourable senators for following up the suggestion made by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) when this Bill was last debated of circulating possible amendments that they might wish to move. The Public Service Acts Amendment Bill was first introduced in the Budget session last year. The Bill was the culmination of a number of projects undertaken to update the employment provisions in the Public Service. The major changes were to abolish the divisional structure of the Public Service, to revise the procedures for promotions and appeals and to revise arrangements for the recovery of outstanding debts from the salaries of public servants. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Bill was debated in the autumn session, the Government in the other place moved certain amendments to the Bill. They were: To provide a greater degree of autonomy to the Parliament in determining its staffing arrangements arising from the report of the Jessop Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing, to provide for the furnishing of reports giving reasons for decisions in relation to promotion matters and to provide for the dual appointment of permanent heads. The Bill, along with the Government amendments, was passed in the House of Representatives last session. During the winter recess, the Public Service Board has had extensive consultations with the unions representing the public servants. As a result of these consultations, and other developments to which I will refer shortly, the Government has decided to move further amendments to the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past few years, there has been a number of court judgments which have affected the promotion and appeal processes in the Australian Public Service. Prior to the introduction of the Bill in the Budget session last year, there was an important judgment on a promotions appeal case which indicated that the established procedures of the Promotions Appeal Committees were deficient. The judgment cast appeal proceedings into an adversarial framework requiring a far greater degree of legal formality than the Government considered desirable. For this reason, the Bill contained specific provisions which would have had the effect of allowing Promotions Appeal Committees to determine their procedures and therefore continue with the less formal arrangements that had existed before the judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the introduction of the Bill, there has been a number of judgments which have stressed the importance of personnel management interests involved in the promotions appeal system. The effect of these judgments has been to offset largely the effect of the earlier judgment. The Government, in the light of these developments and of opposition from the unions has decided to amend the Bill to omit these provisions detailing the procedures to be followed by Promotions Appeal Committees. Amendments (5), (6) and (7) circulated in my name have this effect. The amendments moved by the Government will also delete from the Bill special provisions for the giving of reasons for decisions in relation to promotion decisions. These special provisions were inserted by amendments moved by the Government in the other place and passed in the autumn session. They would have had the effect of replacing the application of section 13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government was of the view that these provisions were necessary to protect the privacy of public servants involved in promotions and appeals. It was feared that the application of section 13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act would have forced decision makers in the Public Service to reveal to an applicant confidential information about other parties to a promotion or appeal. This would have had detrimental effects on individuals as well as jeopardising harmonious working relationships in the Public Service. The effect of the recent judgments mentioned above, as well as developments in the legal processes for providing reasons for decisions, has been to minimise the problems of privacy in providing reasons for decisions. The Government has decided to accede to the requests of the unions and to delete those special provisions, contained in amendments (1), (11), (12), (16), (17), (18) and (21), which will have this effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button, in his speech on the second reading of the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill, foreshadowed an amendment to include a provision to give expression to the merit principle. The amendment proposed by Senator Button also made provision for inclusion in the Public Service Act of an anti-discrimination provision. Senator Button indicated that the amendment was supported by the report of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration. The Royal Commission recommended that there be a declaration of commitment to merit in recruitment and promotion. The Government proposes a provision of declaration to the merit principle. It is the Government's view that the anti-discrimination part of the Opposition's amendment should not be included in the Bill. The very broad approach suggested does not adequately cope with the inherent complexities of personnel management in a large organisation. Such complexities require a proper legislative basis for exceptions to be made in specific instances. For example, current practice in relation to apprenticeship training involves discrimination on the grounds of age. The Government believes that the Opposition's amendment does not recognise current emphasis given to conciliation as the first approach to the redress of perceived malpractices. The Equal Employment Opportunity Board of the Public Service Board has successfully been handling such cases in the Public Service on the basis of conciliation and staff counselling. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently the Government announced the introduction of legislation to deal with sex discrimination and the existing Racial Discrimination Act covering racial discrimination aspects of the proposed amendments, while providing necessary exceptions and mechanisms for redress. </PARA>

As I understand it, the legislation was introduced in the Senate by the Government in February or March of this year. If there has been any delay, I do not know that anybody on the Opposition side has had anything to do with it. I understand the Government's difficulties in negotiating and discussing all the proposed amendments which were the subject of discussion last time the legislation was before the Senate. In my speech on that occasion I indicated a number of areas which the Opposition considered appropriate for amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not in any sense wish to be uncharitable. I suppose I am now one of the old senators. I am glad that Senator Missen reminded me of that. I am not entirely up with the work of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills but I am sure it is very good and that the Committee made a contribution to the amendments which are now before the Senate. I congratulate that Committee for that and Senator Missen for his considerable activities in getting that Committee established. I have a number of things to say about each of these amendments on the assumption that they will be dealt with separately. I do not think I will indulge myself by saying it all now, but rather to say that in my speech at the second reading stage of the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill I indicated the matters about which we were concerned. Predominantly they have been dealt with by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One amendment is not satisfactory from the Opposition's point of view. Senator Messner has foreshadowed that. We are not in any sense opposed to the inclusion of proposed section 33AA, but we would seek to include a section 33AA (2). Before dealing with proposed section 33AA (2), I make the point that proposed section 33AA deals with the prohibition of patronage, favouritism and unjustified discrimination. In so doing it reflects quite closely an amendment previously circulated by the Opposition. As Senator Messner pointed out, the Government's amendment will have the effect of enshrining the merit principle as the principal determinant in recruitment, selection and transfer processes within the Public Service. That is in line with the recommendations of the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration. Clearly, merit should be the most important factor in deciding on promotions and staff movements within the Australian Public Service. With regard to the amendment which I propose to move, I think it might be better if I deal with it in a few minutes because I think Senator Chipp has something to say about the generality of the matter. I will move that amendment a little later in the proceedings because my colleague wants to talk about the generality of the matter. The other point which I find compelling is that I have left my notes behind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I desire to say a few things in generality in respect of the amendments which are proposed to the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill. Since this Bill has been before the Senate there has been a certain amount of controversy about its provisions. I think that all honourable senators have received representations-as far as I am concerned they have been very useful and informative representations-on a number of matters which have arisen. Quite a bit of the controversy that did arise concerned the provisions of the Bill which had the effect, as it appeared at the time, of varying the determinations which Mr Justice Ellicott had made in the case Finch v. Goldstein . Since then further litigations have clarified the position of the law. I believe that has played a substantial part in affecting the Government regarding the removal of some provisions which were causing considerable controversy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill contains a number of important matters. They have probably been lost to a certain extent due to the fact that people have objected to specific items. I mentioned by way of interjection that the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills had taken note of some matters which were involved in the Bill and had drawn to the attention of the Senate various items. So far as the present amendments are concerned, a number of them bring about clarification and satisfy the objections which the Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills raised. Amendment No. (4) leaves out clause 25, which was the subject of comment by the Committee in its eighth report. The Committee, in its eighth report, dealt with a number of other matters. Amendments Nos (6) and (7) delete the detailed provisions relating to Promotions Appeal Committee procedures that had been commented upon by the Committee. The proposed new provisions leave the procedures to be such as the Promotions Appeal Committee thinks fit. That is the expression which is used. Any procedure that the Promotions Appeal Committee adopts will still have to comply with the rules of natural justice. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a number of decisions of the Federal Court of Australia since Finch v. Goldstein, the case which stimulated a number of the previous amendments. These decisions have stressed that the procedure to be followed by a Promotions Appeal Committee must be adapted to the particular case. It has also been clear that Finch's case was rather special and ought not to be regarded as stating the requirements necessary in each case. It is presumably for this reason, at least in part, that the Government has abandoned the attempt to codify the procedure. This does leave the Promotions Appeal Committee with maximum flexibility in its procedures, but it does not provide much guidance to the parties on an appeal. In view of the various decisions and somewhat differing attitudes of the judges, this may be all that is practicable at the present time. In that sense, I welcome these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, amendment No. (11)-I will refer to each of them at this stage as we are dealing with them altogether-leaves out Division 5, which contains provisions on which the Scrutiny of Bills Committee had commented in its eighth report. These provisions were in respect of matters about which notice had to be given to the parties. Likewise, amendments Nos (19) and (20) omit clauses to which objections had been taken. The Committee also commented on clause 44 of the Bill. No alteration has been made in relation to those comments. I would consider, having given study to the various amendments which the Government has now put forward, that it does clarify a number of points which have been raised and which have caused difficulty. I strongly commend the Government on the way in which it has responded to the criticisms which have been made and improved this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Public Service Acts Amendment Bill has had a long and tortuous history. It was first introduced into the House of Representatives on 29 October 1981. I believe it has been an example of what co-operation between the various parties in this Parliament can do. It has been a triumph of good sense, of consensus and of accommodation of an opposing point of view and I strongly commend the Government for the way in which it has listened to argument and objections from both the Australian Labor Party in the House of Representatives and the Australian Democrats in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill is designed to amend the Public Service Acts and other related Acts in mainly two areas, the first of which involves the abolition of the divisional structure of the Public Service. There is basic agreement on that objective; it is a most desirable and long overdue measure to streamline the Public Service. Secondly, it deals with the promotion and appeals procedure. There was a great deal of controversy in the House of Representatives on the proposed changes to the appeals and promotions procedure. The Labor Party moved a great number of amendments, which were opposed by the Government and lost. Before the Bill could proceed to the Senate, the case to which Senator Missen referred-Finch v. Goldstein-was decided. Mr Justice Ellicott decided that principles of natural justice should apply to appeals and promotion procedures; that is, that all relevant information should be made available to all parties concerned in these proceedings and in subsequent reports. The Democrats see this not only as natural justice but also as sound management practice and in keeping with recent and desirable trends in the Public Service towards open management and employee participation in public administration. I give as examples open performance appraisals, access to personnel files and counselling by supervisors, particularly prior to any disciplinary action. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government saw fit to introduce 14 pages of amendments designed to counteract the Finch v. Goldstein decision. It is only now, after months of belated consultation with the Public Service unions and after I had stated in September of this year that the Democrats would oppose the Government's amendments, that the Government has finally abandoned its efforts to counteract the 'natural justice' stance in the Finch case and drop the amendments</PARA>

My staff and I also appreciate the hours of time that members of that Board have devoted to us in explaining the provisions of the Act and the Government's position. I now refer to the specific matter about which I want to talk. I am in the hands of my friend Senator Button; if he thinks I am going off before he should when I talk about specifics he should say so. Perhaps I should talk in general terms about the specific amendment I desire. Neither the Government nor the Labor Party, with great respect, has been prepared to tackle the area of discrimination in a manner which in my view is specific enough. It may be that in the event the way in which these amendments are interpreted will effectively kill discrimination.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know, and I respect that argument. If the Labor Party does argue that, I wonder why it stopped that one step short of being specific enough and putting it into the legislation. The amendment to the amendment to be moved by the Labor Party to section 33AA is the only amendment that we will move in regard to this matter. At the moment the Government's clause merely calls for ' procedures that involve careful assessment of personal qualifications and preclude unjustified discrimination'. The Opposition amendment does go further-I will not steal Senator Button's thunder by saying what it is-but we believe it does not go far enough. The Democrats are mindful of the need to ensure the effective performance of the work being undertaken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must pay tribute to the Labor Party for the manner in which it co-operated in the almost joint discussions on this Bill held between the Democrats and the Government. It has been a very pleasing exercise in co-operation and consensus making. We fully support the need to exercise positive discrimination on behalf of the disadvantaged. In fact, I believe these efforts should be stepped up. Subject to these provisos, we believe it is time the Australian community made a clear, decisive and explicit stand against discrimination in all its insidious forms. I ask rhetorically my friends Senator Button and Senator Missen: Does the term 'discrimination on the grounds of sex' include discrimination against persons who are homosexuals and, if so--</PARA>

This is one of the areas in relation to which we will move our amendment to the Labor Party amendment. If Senator Button does not mind-if he does, he should interject-I will conclude my remarks and let him continue with his speech on the specific issues. I want to put on the record some aspects of community attitudes towards homosexuality today. Thank God it is a subject that one can now at least raise in public forums such as the Parliament without being smeared, as I suggest would have happened just a few years ago. I refer to the Age poll of May 1978 which showed that a total of 58 per cent of Australians interviewed believed that homosexuals should be treated by the law in exactly the same was as heterosexuals. Another interesting finding was made by the American Psychiatric Association. In a statement released in 1973 it rejected that homosexuality per se implies any impairment in judgment, stability, reliability or general social or vocational capabilities. On 1 March 1978 the Board of Social Responsibility of the Uniting Church issued a statement supporting decriminalisation of homosexual behaviour in private between consenting adults.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In New South Wales the Anti-discrimination Bill of 1976 at first outlawed discrimination against homosexuals. The Bill was delayed and was later passed with the offending clause watered down. It simply said that 'the Anti Discrimination Board may investigate instances of discrimination'. That is what worries me-the non-specific reference to discrimination against homosexuals in this Bill. The Royal Commission on Human Relationships, the Western Australian Royal Commission into Homosexuality in 1974, the New South Wales Anti- Discrimination Board, the Tasmanian Select Committee into Victimless Crime in 1978 and the Victorian Equal Opportunity Board have all recommended against the discrimination against gay people. Although not formally within its powers, the South Australian Equal Opportunity Commission in its annual reports of 1976-77 and 1977-78 noted that it had heard and mediated on numerous cases of gross discrimination on the grounds of homosexuality. They noted in the 1978 report that such complaints were not decreasing and mainly concerned employment. The reports of the Wilenski Review of New South Wales Government Administration, the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration and the Hope Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security all noted anti-gay discrimination and recommended against it. Perhaps reluctantly, somewhat hesitatingly and certainly belatedly, gay rights are now on the public policy agenda in Australia . </PARA>
<PARA> My two friends, Senators Button and Missen, both distinguished lawyers, if I may say so, interjected at my invitation saying that they believed that the term 'discrimination on grounds of sex' would include homosexuality.

I just want to reiterate the point, and this is of relevance, I think, to Senator Chipp's amendment to my amendment, that proposed section 33AA deals with the prohibition of patronage, favouritism, unjustified discrimination and so on. But the most important aspect of it, I suppose, is that it enshrines the principle of merit in Public Service recruitment, selection and transfer. That, as I pointed out earlier, is in line with the recommendations of the Coombs Royal Commission into Australian Government Administration. We would agree with the Government that it is the most important consideration in getting an efficient and effective Public Service, which we should all be concerned about.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The wording of the amendment is important. We say it gives the authorities which appropriately have discretion in this matter a general authority in relation to dealing with questions of discrimination; that is, as it were, an injunction to them to avert their minds in dealing with promotion, recruitment, transfer and so on. We suggest that they have regard to the general principles of promotion by merit, but in applying that principle we ask them to avert their minds to questions of discrimination. We have referred to discrimination in employment on grounds of race, creed, sex, age, marriage status or political belief except where reasonably and justifiably required for the effective performance of the work being undertaken and except where such discrimination is part of a program of affirmative action for disadvantaged groups. </PARA>
<PARA> We think that is the best statement which we can appropriately arrive at in terms of the concept which we desire to see reflected in this Bill.

That is a view with which I hope the Democrats would agree. Promotion should be by merit. The purpose of moving my amendment, and in a sense the purpose of Senator Chipp's amendment, is to say yes-in the context of this legislation-promotion, transfer, et cetera, should be by merit but in assessing merit the employers will take a few other matters into account. In our amendment we have arrived at a formula which we think gives the employing authorities appropriate discretion. After all, it all depends on their discretion in the long term.

For example, it seems to me that one cannot take language into account in the way in which Senator Chipp wants to if there is to be promotion by merit because it is totally unacceptable, in my view, to promote to the Second Division of the Australian Public Service a person who speaks only Japanese. To take the words of Senator Chipp's amendment literally, that would have to be taken into account. There are a number of other examples of the sorts of things I mean.

I really do not see that it adds very much to the sort of formula which is contained in the Opposition amendment because what that does, of course , is flag the important issue of discrimination. There is a Latin expression which is common to lawyers which I think is: Expressio unius est exclusio alterius, which means, roughly translated-if I get into difficulties I will rely on Senator Missen-that if particular categories or words are specified, that excludes everything else. That is the danger in trying to spell out in an amendment like this all the varieties of possible discrimination that one may be concerned about because one or two might be missed. If that is done they are quite clearly excluded from the Democrats' amendment, whereas they are not excluded from our amendment which is more general in its terms. I think there are very real dangers in spelling it out in such detail as the Democrats have attempted to do in their amendment to my amendment which, I say again, I believe to be drafted with the best possible motives and a great degree of concern which the Democrats have shown on this issue and which I think is commendable. That is why we do not support Senator Chipp's amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most of the time I will speak English, yes. I will try to keep Latin expressions out of my speech as much as possible. I must say though, on that latter point that Senator Button mentioned, that he does not entirely convince me. There is a problem in specifying a number of things. In his amendment he specifies a number of things such as race, creed, sex, age, marital status or political belief and stops there. There is a danger that it may be said that other matters like physical and mental defects and so forth are excluded from the Opposition's amendment, so I do not think Senator Button escapes from the argument that he makes against the Democrats' amendment. Likewise that is a problem which he has. From that point of view one suggests that the Opposition's amendment should be expanded further. I doubt whether some of the proposals which are in the Democrats' amendment stand up very well. I think the point Senator Button made about language may well be justified. An effective performance of work may be done, but there may be reasons why someone who cannot speak English cannot be appointed to a particular job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button mentioned the security record. The person who is to be appointed might be splendidly efficient in the work to be undertaken but, if he has a security record which makes him an obvious spy for the Soviet Union, I think that must be taken into account. I therefore express the view that there are difficulties in the Democrats' amendment too as to whether some of those qualifications are satisfactorily described and should be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, as to the Government's amendment, I must say that the reference there is not only to it being by merit but also to precluding ' patronage, favouritism or unjustified discrimination'. I think that that is a very vague expression. With 'unjustified', it might be a very subjective judgment as to whether the discrimination is such. It might be a discrimination against Tasmanians, and it may be thoroughly justified that there should be discrimination against Tasmanians in appointments for the positions in question. I say that because there are, I think, no Tasmanians in the chamber at present; therefore, I can say that with safety. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering these amendments, my view is that the Government has not gone far enough. I think that an amendment along the lines of the Opposition's amendment is a better one-that there ought to be in the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill some spelling out of some of the provisions. But as I say, I am not sure that the Australian Labor Party has spelt out sufficiently the various grounds of discrimination which should not be taken into account, and I think that the Australian Democrats, in going much further than that, include some dubious grounds which should not, perhaps, be in the legislation. Whatever we do with the amendment or the shape of the Bill, the Bill will go back to the House of Representatives. I hope that it will be looked at again. I believe that there ought to be written into the legislation some more definite prohibition against discrimination and not just 'unjustified discrimination' because I do not know what that means and what we are intending to cover. The two amendments before us do not adequately cover the situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, in dealing quickly with Senator Chipp's amendments, without canvassing the ground again I should like to make the same points as I believe Senator Button made; that is, as to the specificity of the particular points listed in the amendment, which limit rather than expand the capacity for exception and flexibility in the administration of this matter. That leads me to the point of the Government's opposition to the Opposition's amendment, which goes to fairly detailed lengths to specify areas in which discrimination is spelt out and which , I believe, will not adequately cope with the complexities of personnel management from day to day in the Public Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is necessary to consider a system of exceptions where there is obvious need for them. Such things, as I mentioned earlier, as the age limits applying to apprentices is one area. Another might be the fairly obvious example of the religious problems of people being appointed to countries in which their religion may not be acceptable-in the foreign service or the diplomatic service. The Opposition's amendment also does not take account of the existing structure for resolving discrimination malpractices using conciliation and counselling. Again, these are points that I made earlier. The Equal Opportunity Bureau of the Public Service Board deals with these kinds of cases with what is regarded as a substantial degree of success. Also, existing legislation, such as the Racial Discrimination Act and the proposed sex discrimination legislation which was announced only this month, will be capable of dealing with most of the common forms of discrimination and will provide necessary exceptions and mechanisms for redress. </PARA>
<PARA> The term 'programs of affirmative action' mentioned in the Democrats' amendment is a terribly vague term and it is difficult to comprehend how it might be interpreted in a day to day administrative format. I noted Senator Missen's remarks in regard to the point, but I draw his attention to the amendment in proposed section 33AA which spells it out in the final phrase and specifically precludes 'patronage, favouritism or unjustified discrimination'. Senator Button 's earlier comments in relation to the question of merit and whether proposed section 33AA refers specifically to that limb of the problem are not totally exclusive of the point that those statements draw our attention very clearly to the questions of discrimination on the kinds of grounds that Senator Button has envisaged in his amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I note the concerns of Senator Missen. I believe that the generality of the point as outlined in the Government's amendment goes a long way to meeting his point. I hope also that Senator Missen will note the points that I made, albeit briefly, in regard to the need for some flexibility in the administration of these things, and hence the Government's decision to draw the amendment and proposed section 33AA in the fashion that it has. For those reasons the Government opposes both amendments-that is, Senator Chipp's amendment to the Opposition's amendment-and will support its own amendments. </PARA>

<PARA>I believe that the amendment is needed to overcome a drafting oversight. I believe that when the Bill was being drafted this list was missed out. It is clearly inappropriate to have the report of the Department of the Senate laid before the other place, and vice versa. The report of the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing foreshadowed that the annual report of that Standing Committee, as it became-the Senate Standing Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing-be the report of the Department of the Senate. It would be quite inappropriate to have the President of the Senate in some way presenting it in the House of Representatives. So the amendment resolves the situation-the Senate reporting to Senate; the House of Representatives reporting to House of Representatives; and the Joint House Department reporting to both. </PARA>

<PARA> That so much of Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Grimes giving a contingent notice of motion to provide for the division of the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sorry that I am in the position of having to seek to give this notice of motion so late in the day. I accept that the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) did not receive a great deal of notice. I do not accept the Minister's argument-this is the argument he gave to me and I am sure he will give it later-that he cannot give us leave because he could not get the approval of the Minister for Health (Mr Carlton) in another place. The Minister for Education has had notice of this motion for at least a short time and he knows that it seeks to divide this legislation. It seeks the permission of the Senate to treat this legislation in a certain way which I suggest has nothing to do with a Minister in another place. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation has two purposes. One purpose is to extend the eligibility for various health benefits to certain members of the community, particularly sickness beneficiaries who will receive their benefits on 1 November. The other section of the legislation, which we seek to divide out, is in fact aimed at an Act of the Victorian Government to put a levy on health funds in that State to cover out-patient fees. These two aspects are quite distinct. We believe it is a sensible procedure for the Senate to deal with the legislation in this way. We believe the legislation should be split because the Victorian levy section of the Bill is in fact tacked on to the rest of the Bill. It is for that reason that I have sought to suspend Standing Orders to enable me to move a contingent notice of motion to deal with the legislation in this way. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Universities in the States are autonomous institutions established by the States under their own statutes. The determination and public notification of salary and allowances paid to their vice-chancellors is a matter for individual institutions to decide. However, from a funding viewpoint the Government has made clear that it will not provide funds for salary levels in excess of those set by the Academic Salaries Tribunal, and the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act has been amended to empower the Minister to reduce grants where academic salaries, including those of vice-chancellors, are paid at levels above those recommended by the Academic Salaries Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The October 1981 report of the Academic Salaries Tribunal, which was accepted by the Government, set recommended salary levels for vice-chancellors as a basis for funding. For the Australian National University and universities of Sydney, New South Wales, Melbourne, Monash, Queensland, Adelaide, and Western Australia the level set was $59,572. For other universities the recommended level set by the Tribunal, as a basis for funding was $55,226. The Tribunal did not set non-salary supplements for vice-chancellors. The Tribunal has since its October 1981 report, reported on 10 August 1982 following a recent inquiry into academic salaries. This report recommended a salary level of $63,742 for vice- chancellors in universities in the higher salary group, and $59,092 for vice- chancellors in other universities. I announced on 8 October that the Government has agreed to the salary increases recommended by the Tribunal and will increase the level of 1982 grants for universities and colleges of advanced education.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) It is for individual universities to decide the allowances paid to chancellors. The Academic Salaries Tribunal does not set rates for chancellors whose role is an honorary one. I understand that no university pays a salary to its chancellor. Information on any allowances that might be paid to chancellors is not available.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Salary rates for university professors are recommended by the Academic Salaries Tribunal as a basis for funding by the Commonwealth and are set out in the reports of the Academic Salaries Tribunal. In the case of the Australian National University, salary rates are determined by the Tribunal for professors. The rate set by the Tribunal in its October 1981 report was $43,904. In the case of the Australian National University three levels of $49,914, $46,651 and $43, 904 were determined. The recent report of 10 August 1982 recommended a salary rate of $46,977 for professors (ANU $53,408, $49,917 and $46,977). In addition to salary, certain differentials and loadings may be paid by universities to professors within limits set by the Academic Salaries Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Academic Salaries Tribunal also recommends and determines salaries for principals in colleges of advanced education. The recommended levels are set out in the reports of the Tribunal. The October 1981 report recommended seven levels for principals as follows: $37,714, $39,969, $42,221, $44,478, $46,730, $49,360, $51,988. The report of 7 August 1982 recommended increases to the following levels: $40,354, $42,767, $45,176, $47,591, $50,001, $53,085, $55,627. In the case of Commonwealth institutions, the salary of principals is recommended by the Tribunal. The Tribunal does not set non-salary supplements for principals.</PARA>
