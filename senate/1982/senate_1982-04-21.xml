Is the Minister aware that what could have been a lucrative export market has already been prejudiced by allowing the situation to drift to the extent that these devices are being made under licence in Japan where they are being sold at the rate of a thousand a week? What action is the Minister's energy division taking to see that manufacture of such solar collectors for Australian use is carried out in Australia? Does the Government not yet see the need for adequate taxation incentives, such as those applying in the United States of America, Japan and New Zealand, amongst other countries, to promote such alternative energy and conservational practices, or does the Government not yet appreciate the fact that based on overseas experience such incentives actually save money by promoting more employment and additional tax revenues?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I saw mention of this matter in the Australian yesterday. I have not had time to check the precise details. I will do so and relate to the earlier parts of Senator Mason's question in that regard when the information is fully available to me. The fact is that in Australia there is a viable solar energy manufacturing industry. Indeed it is so viable that we do export and sell solar arrays to places such as California. So there has been no reason to suggest that taxation or other incentives are not adequate enough to allow such a manufacturing industry. We are keen to do so. However, since the matter also concerns perhaps one or two other departments in terms of manufacturing, I will get the whole matter looked at and give Senator Mason a more detailed reply.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Attorney-General in his capacity both as Attorney-General and as Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to remarks by a Mr Don Stevens, Brisbane Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia , on the possibility of employment of women wharf labourers, 50 of the applications for 35 vacancies in Queensland having come from women? For the benefit of the Senate I will quote Mr Stevens's attitude on this subject. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The blokes have already decided that if women are put on, they must wear skirts at all times, go down to the ships' holds first and that the men come up last.</PARA>
<PARA>Can the Minister confirm whether any trade union has the ability to make any such decision, unrelated as it is to the requirements of the job? Will the Minister make it clear to the Waterside Workers Federation and the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour that Mr Stevens's grossly offensive and sexist requirements on employment of women are totally unacceptable in this country? If there is any evidence either that women withdraw their applications for these jobs on the Brisbane wharves for fear of humiliation as a result of the repugnant attitudes of Mr Stevens and his ilk, or that the women applicants are not seriously considered for any of these vacancies because of fear by employers that Waterside Workers Federation members would attempt to put unreasonable or humiliating conditions on their employment, will the Government urgently consider its powers and obligations to prevent such discriminatory attitudes affecting anyone's employment prospects?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Martin drew my attention to the comments of Mr Stevens to which she refers. Of course, we have only the authority of the newspaper report about them. It may be that Mr Stevens does not take such extremely sexist views, which I am sure would be disapproved of by members of the Senate generally as well as by Senator Martin. It is an interesting development that with changes in the nature of the work force, the nature of work, mechanisation and so on, it does not seem to be unreasonable to expect that women may well work in the stevedoring industry on the wharves, which traditionally has clearly been an area where they have not been so engaged. With the sorts of changes that are occurring one must be prepared to accept that these things are likely to occur. It is unfortunately true that there has been a great deal of resistance to this development in parts of the trade union movement, so it is perhaps understandable that some views of that kind may still be prevalent although I agree that that is to be regretted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The immediate method of resolving these problems is to go through the employment discrimination committees. They are part of a tripartite organisation which has been established in each State throughout Australia. They provide the avenue for attempts to settle any disputes of this kind. Anyone who felt that they had been discriminated against by either an employer or a trade union leader would, I believe, have the opportunity of taking that matter to those committees. In some States also, of course, antidiscrimination legislation may be applicable. As the Senate would know and as I have said on a number of occasions the Commonwealth Government is in close discussion with the States at present about the ratification of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women entered into in Copenhagen in 1980. As I have said, there are a number of ways in which people in such a situation-in this case women who felt that they were being discriminated against-could have avenues through which they could pursue the matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The national program against brucellosis and tuberculosis commenced in 1970. The volume of money that the Commonwealth has paid to this point-some $32.6m-is about 12 per cent of the cost of the campaign. The figure about which we are talking was mentioned by the Industries Assistance Commission in its 1975 report and was arrived at by costing the Commission's recommended assistance and expressing it as a percentage of campaign costs estimated at that time. The Government recently considered a further IAC report on Commonwealth financial assistance after 1984. Not only did it accept the IAC's recommendations in full but also it agreed to provide additional loan funds where required by the States for compensation for reinfected herds. The provision of continued Commonwealth financial assistance after June 1984 is conditional on all States and the Northern Territory undertaking to adopt a program to achieve Australia-wide freedom from brucellosis and tuberculosis.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I saw the article. The fact is that bodies such as the International Energy Agency had seen that the free world's consumption and export of coal would double in the next 10 years. That has been revised downwards to about 60 per cent. It was seen that Australia would increase its production of steaming coal, which was in the order of only 6 million tonnes a year, to about 100 million tonnes a year in a decade or more. I do not know what the present revision is. The fact is that a number of factors are slowing down the development but, as Senator Tate quite rightly says, are not in any way causing cessation. The present and very temporary oil glut has caused some cessation of the urgency to change to alternative fuels. Therefore, there has not been the movement of oil to coal at the rate one would have expected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That article, if my memory serves me well, and other comments in the newspaper referred not only to the export levy but also specifically to charges and taxes which States have put upon coal. I thought the purport of the article was that governments and each of the spheres of government-Federal, State and local-have been putting burdens on the coal industry which were heavier than they might ordinarily bear. That is as I understand the situation. Against that background, I believe that there have been some representations from coal interests to suggest that the export levy should be removed or abated. I am not specific on this matter. I believe that in my presence I have had such representations around the Cabinet table. I do not recall the specific times. I know that the industry has been opposed to the levy. I will look towards the more recent specifics and will let Senator Tate know.</PARA>

It may be that a higher proportion of that will be eligible for income tax concession. This would mean that there may be a slightly higher cost to revenue in the next year. In the Budget of this year, we included a figure of about $20m with an amount of $5m which was in respect of the deductions that might be claimed for the 1980-81 year. I will have a check made through the Treasurer's office with regard to these figures.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am familiar with the whole situation. Some months ago , indeed in company with Senator Jessop, I made an inspection of the whole Iron Triangle area and the line of the pipeline down to Whyalla and Stony Point. I am aware that the timetable is that the pipeline will be finished by December with a capacity of some 35,000 barrels per day without pressure. So that is of particular significance. I have had before me an application from the Southern Cross Petroleum company asking that it be declared what is called a small remote refinery. The effect of that would be that it would not come under the crude oil allocation scheme and would not be required to take a portion of imported oil as do all other refineries. I and my Department have given very full consideration to the matter. I have written to the firm and informed it that, within the meaning of a small remote refinery, I cannot, however regrettably, accept that a refinery at Stony Point close to Whyalla could come under such terms. But I have said that I believe nevertheless that that ought not to be an impediment to the establishment of such a mini-refinery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are reasonable ways for Southern Cross Petroleum or any other refinery to make certain arrangements with other refineries. Therefore I do not regard this as an impediment. I would be very keen to follow up any difficulties that might emerge in that regard. Senator Teague asked me whether the refinery was ideally situated to serve that area. I understand that its output would certainly meet the fuel requirements for the whole of that Iron Triangle area. But because of the projected development of Roxby Downs the matter becomes increasingly important. The whole of the potential development, including Roxby Downs, the pipeline and Stony Point, is exciting in the development of South Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In regard to the machine to which Senator Colston refers I understand that the Queensland Government has submitted a proposal to the Department of Transport that it be allowed to fly that aircraft with one pilot only. Arrangements in the United States of America cannot be directly related to the Australian scene, it is true, but all operators and manufacturers' agents in Australia were informed that all models of Cessna Citation aircraft going into operation in this country would require a minimum crew of two pilots, even though in the United States of America, apparently, depending on particular circumstances of operation, one pilot is allowed to fly from time to time. No decision has been made by the Department with regard to the Premier's proposal. I think the Minister for Transport would feel that he doubts that the Premier deserves a lower standard of safety than members of the general community.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not asking a question about the Cessna Citation jet aircraft. My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, pertains to the pattern of Federal Government funding to the performing arts through the Australia Council. In particular I refer to the level of funding to the Queensland Theatre Company-a level which theatre company officials consider to have now reached crisis proportions. Is the Minister aware that the future of many theatre companies in Queensland is in jeopardy due both to an increase in costs and a reduction in funds through the Australia Council? Will the Minister give an assurance that this matter will be carefully and sympathetically considered in the forthcoming Budget with a view to increasing the allocation of such funds so that all Queenslanders and, indeed, all Australians, may have the chance to enjoy the performing arts?</PARA></TALK.START>

I believe Senator Bjelke-Petersen would recall that the Government was able to provide the Australia Council with an extra $800,000 in December of last year and that these additional funds were used by the Australia Council to reinforce the Council's challenge grant scheme and to enable its boards, including the Theatre Board, to give further assistance to organisations not receiving a challenge grant. There is no doubt about the Government's commitment to assist the arts. The amount of money going through the Australia Council is substantial and has increased.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I am aware of the report that appeared in the Australian yesterday. The article contained a number of errors and half truths. Perhaps I ought to refer the Senate to a response that I gave on 24 March when I tabled in the Senate a statement which set out in considerable detail the background to the 1981-82 expenditure on each of the three forms of industrial research and development expenditure-the commencement grants, the project grants and the public interest projects. The response to the article, I think, should draw on that statement made by me in March. I think I ought to state that the assertion that the Department of Finance acted without reference to Cabinet or without regard to government policies is just not accurate at all. The relevant Ministers have been in full discussion on these matters, both before and since the Budget of last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter I want to add is that my own Department has very limited discretion in an area of this kind. The Cabinet was advised at the time of its consideration of the 1981-82 Additional Estimates that savings this year of some $16m were expected against the Budget appropriations for the industrial research and development grants. I should also say, in view of earlier statements made, that the Parliament also has been kept informed. A statement of savings expected in annual appropriations, prepared as a Department of Finance information paper, was provided to the Parliament with Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4. This paper includes information that savings of almost $16m were expected this year. I gave much of this information on 24 March.</PARA>
<PARA> I would have to say that the article is a complete misunderstanding or misstatement of the position with regard to support for industrial research and development. I take up further Senator Townley's suggestion with regard to support for such projects from government expenditure. Of course, there is substantial government support for research and development to assist productivity. When we compare figures for this country with those of other countries, I think we need to look at what industry does in a number of instances and what is done in our academic institutions as well as at what is done through some of the grants that we are now speaking about. I can understand the interest of Senator Townley in this matter and I will draw it to the attention of the Minister concerned. But in response to his inquiry about that article in the newspaper, I draw attention to its inaccuracies and refer to the information given in March which I think provides a clearer picture of the situation with regard to this sort of project in the current Budget.</PARA>

I do not want to dwell on the details of recent events involving ex-Ministers Moore and MacKellar. One should just be reminded that it took four days for those Ministers to resign.

Trivial as the incident may seem to be, it would not have been trivial if an ordinary citizen had been involved because the ordinary course of the law would have taken its effect.

It is in that environment that the seemingly trivial conduct of a Minister evading duty on a television set becomes important because that evasion represents a manipulation of a position of privilege in a society where privilege is becoming more and more entrenched at the expense of the vast majority of Australians. So do not let us talk about it entirely as a trivial matter. </PARA>
<PARA> What I want to suggest in the course of what I say today about this matter of public importance is that if this Government from the beginning of its history, rather than making pious statements about ministerial integrity and standards which it would apply to the conduct of Ministers and members of parliament, had said that it was prepared to have a publicly available system of declaration of Ministers' interests and accountability in respect of the financial conduct of members of parliament, we would have had an objective test rather than the present system whereby Ministers report their financial involvements to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who himself is not, in the eyes of many people in the Australian electorate, beyond reproach. If we had such a system the Prime Minister of the day really ought to be a presidential figure quite beyond reproach-a monarchial figure. Perhaps that is how the Prime Minister sees himself but it is not how a very large percentage of the Australian population sees him. We have this situation of Ministers reporting to the Prime Minister on their pecuniary interests which is, to adopt a somewhat hackneyed phrase, like putting Dracula in charge of a blood bank. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look over this Government's record we see that there have been a total of 21 sackings, resignations and suspensions from the Fraser Ministery since it took office-I repeat 21. The Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Sir John Carrick, whose fixation is with comparative statistics of the past, will have the gravest difficulty in adding up that number of Ministers. He will have the gravest difficulty in the course of the development of his fixation about the years 1972 to 1975 in pointing to any Minister in the Labor Government who was charged with and shown to be guilty of an act of financial impropriety. Those are the considerations which are of the utmost concern when we consider the public standards of the Government and this Parliament. Of the 25 Ministers of the first Fraser Ministry sworn in in January 1976, 12 have gone. The Prime Minister, on 12 March 1978, had the gall to say:</PARA>
<PARA> One of my Government's first promises when we were elected just over two years ago was to restore the integrity and honesty of government. As long as I lead the Government, there is no way known that anything less than the highest code and practice of public administration will be tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA>It is arguable that this week a standard of public conduct of Ministers was enforced. That is to the Government's credit in a sense. But one of the strange things about that enforcement is that it took a process of four days, 24 hours of which was spent with two Ministers trying to arrive at what they saw as the truth of a situation. Then there was a long process of delay. There was no question of a prompt response to a situation which should have produced a prompt response. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the aspects which need to be addressed is the uneven attitude which the Prime Minister, having chosen to be the administrator of the standards of the Ministry and the standards which should pertain in this Parliament, adopts to Ministers belonging to different parties. Of the 12 Ministers who have left the Fraser Government through resignation, dismissal or suspension, only one was a member of the National Country Party. I refer to Mr Adermann, a fairly elderly Minister who was replaced by a junior Minister from the National Country Party. The rest were Liberal Party Ministers. There has been no real loss to the National Country Party in this non-stop unseemly game of musical chairs that has gone on in the Fraser Cabinet. Liberals are expendable; National Country Party Ministers stay put, whatever the circumstances and however grievously they may have betrayed their trust as Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> I could dwell on a number of cases but I will refer particularly to one. It involves a Minister of this Government who sat in judgment on two other Ministers this week. I refer to the case of the Minister for Primary Industry ( Mr Nixon). One could, of course, mention his colleague the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony). Let us look at the case of the Minister for Primary Industry, who sat in judgment on Messrs Moore and MacKellar this week. In 1975 a joint committee of this Parliament reported on the declaration of interests of members and Ministers of the Parliament. Mr Nixon was a member of that committee. The committee recommended that a number of decisions be taken-public decisions which would involve an ongoing review of situations which have never been reviewed seriously by the Fraser Government. That was a parliamentary report expressing the unanimous view of seven members of this Parliament. One of the things they recommended was the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee which would carry on a continued investigation of the public's right to know about conflicts of interest and other matters involving the behaviour of Ministers and members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee recommended that members of parliament should disclose the names of all companies in which they had a beneficial interest in shareholdings no matter how insignificant and whether held as an individual or a member of a company, partnership or trust. It said that members of parliament should disclose the location of any real property in which they had a beneficial interest excluding, of course, a family home. The committee said that members of parliament should declare the names of all companies of which they were members. It said that MPs should provide all this information to a parliamentary register . The committee recommended that the public have access to this information. Nothing came of these recommendations because the Fraser Government came into power and the recommendations were too unpalatable to the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask: What is so different about Australia under the Fraser Government in comparison with countries such as the United States of America on the one hand and Papua New Guinea on the other, which have very strict requirements about the public conduct of Ministers and members of parliament? After all, we import deregulation and monetarism from the United States as desirable intellectual concepts in politics. The things that we do not import from the United States are things which deal with public standards, and those things are too embarrassing and too difficult for the Fraser Government to accommodate. As I said, the Prime Minister came to power with promises of absolute propriety, but the recommendations of that committee were not acceptable to his Government. He then set up a committee-the Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interests-under Sir Nigel Bowen, a former Liberal Attorney-General, to devise a code of conduct. That Committee has reported. For over two and a half years I have been asking Senator Sir John Carrick in this place when the Government is going to implement in full the recommendations of the Bowen inquiry. I have also asked him whether there will be a debate on the recommendations of the Bowen inquiry. On each occasion I have been told that the matter will receive attention shortly. The last occasion was on 22 September 1981 when Senator Sir John Carrick, in answer to a question from me, said that at that moment the Government was in the process of having discussions to extend the provisions to members of parliament. That was in September 1981. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> We will be bringing into this Parliament . . . recommendations for the implementation, for members as distinct from Ministers, of the remaining provisions of the Bowen Committee report. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing has happened since. The Parliament will probably grind to a halt and be closed down in two or three weeks because this Government has no legislation, because it has nothing to say on the grave economic crisis which is confronting this country, and, again, those issues will not be dealt with because they are unpalatable issues for the Government. The Government ignored the findings of the joint committee of 1975. It has done very little about implementing the Bowen Committee's proposals on public duty and private interest. That was a mild report indeed, but it seems to have been burdensome for some Ministers. Among its provisions was the provision that when a conflict of interest arose in the administration of a department a Minister should inform the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister should then authorise the Minister to proceed with the matter or hand it to another Minister. The Committee suggested that a Minister should not hold shares in a company which deals with his department. The Prime Minister said that he accepted those recommendations in relation to Ministers. But the saga of Mr Ian Sinclair's business and political activities spans the period before and after the acceptance of the Bowen report. Mr Sinclair was acquitted of charges relating to family business affairs. He remained a Minister who was living on misappropriated money-$300,000. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Withers would not deny it. He is a very honest man. The real test of the Bowen guidelines was the disclosure of the fact that the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon, and his family held 1,244 shares in the Murray Goulburn Co-operative Co. Ltd at a time when he was Minister for Primary Industry. If honourable senators read the Bowen guidelines, they will see that the holding of those shares is quite inconsistent with the guidelines. A great number of questions arose from the Minister's decisions relating to the production by that Co-operative of a large quantity of butter. It was butter which was subject to a levy of $2.3m. The Co-operative had tried to disguise that butter as milk fat concentrate rather than butter in order to avoid the payment of penalties to the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many decisions of the Minister for Primary Industry in relation to that matter remained un-answered. Why did he not disclose that he had authorised payment to Murray Goulburn of amounts totalling $800,000? These payments effectively reduced the liability of Murray Goulburn which had tried to deceive the Government. It reduced its liability from $2.3m to $1.6m. The Minister for Primary Industry, as a shareholder in that company, presided over that situation . Why did the Minister not enforce section 22 (2) of the Dairy Industry Stabilisation Act which provides a penalty for false and misleading statements? Why was the company, in which he was a shareholder, exempt from the provisions of that legislation? What influence did he have in changing the long-standing policy of the Australian Dairy Corporation so that Murray Goulburn received a payment of $100,000 to cover interest on loans related to the disputed so-called 3,000 tonnes of butter?</PARA>
<PARA> Why were manufacturers of other dairy products not given the same concessions which were given to the company in which the Minister for Primary Industry was a shareholder? Why did the Minister for Primary Industry not inform the Prime Minister or Cabinet of the decision which he was taking? Why did he not tell the Prime Minister that he was a shareholder in the company which had constant dealings with his Department? The scale of those breaches by the Minister for Primary Industry is enormous in terms of the Prime Minister's own stated standards. It did not involve just the non-payment of duty on a $200 television set. The unfortunate Mr MacKellar was caught red handed in a parliamentary session. The situation with the Minister for Primary Industry was that it all happened over Christmas and the matter was glossed over. Even with the standards which this Government says it has, there is a gross inequity in its administration between various Ministers. It is an horrendous situation for any government to get itself into. Why does that Minister continue to hold his post when Mr MacKellar and Mr Moore have to go for breach of ministerial conduct? Why does Mr Nixon not abide by his own recommendations? Why is what is right with-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter that is being debated is the manner in which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) supervises the conduct of his Ministers. I stress that the conduct of Ministers is of very great importance indeed. The Parliament and the people of Australia are entitled to expect from Ministers a conduct higher than that required of the general community. I submit that that is the normal behaviour common amongst Ministers of both sides of Parliament. One will find, as one expects, that Ministers do seek to have such high conduct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I leave aside the melodrama of the rhetoric of Senator Button. He related straightaway to the sad events of recent days. The whole of the Parliament and the community will be sad that two young Ministers of very considerable promise should have found it necessary to resign within the Westminster process. Senator Button said that there was an unduly long period in that process. From the emergence of the issue on the Friday to the resignation on the Monday, there was a span purely of a weekend. Those who reflect on this matter will know that in order for this matter to be documented and so that the world should know it was necessary that files had to be got from the State. The head of Department who had the function at that time was no longer the head and had to be located. Various statements had to be made. I put it to honourable senators that it was with expedition that something that emerged on the Friday should have been resolved, however sadly, on the Monday. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to that incident, some three months or less after the Fraser Government came to office, following the Whitlam Government, for whatever reason the Prime Minister found it necessary to set out an instruction as to the conduct of Customs officers with regard to parliamentarians and other dignitaries coming through Customs. This ought not to have been necessary. In order to establish those standards, the Prime Minister set out those standards. That is a token of the behaviour of the Prime Minister and of his Government. The late Mr Carmody, then the Secretary of the Department, made it abundantly clear that there was to be no difference in the treatment of parliamentarians. The letter of the Prime Minister in that regard and the statement of Mr Carmody are documented and circulated and that is, and remains, the instruction of the Prime Minister and this Government to every Customs officer on the floor and to every officer in the Department. There have been some disabilities in the system . This is the reason why, at this moment, there is a problem on our hands. The Government does not disguise that problem and is seeking honourably to resolve it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make it clear that the standards are set, and were set after the Whitlam Government, at the highest possible level. Every Customs officer must have known that. To have said various forms of rhetoric-such as that there is a paralysis of the Government that can be demonstrated by the inactivity on tax avoidance-is , of course, to the nth degree absurd. Our Government came into office following a Labor government that did nothing on tax avoidance. The history of the Treasurer, Mr Howard, on this is one of persistent pursuit of tax avoiders. No government has done more on this matter. I put that in perspective. The Government set up, several years after it came to office the Bowen Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interest. The Bowen Committee sat for a considerable time and then produced a report, which has been circulated. It has been said that the Government has not acted on this matter. That is patently untrue. The Government has announced quite clearly that it has acted to adopt the section relating to Minister's conduct to enforce those provisions. The matter that is being discussed today concerns the conduct of Ministers. The recommendations of the Bowen Committee apply to Ministers today and have applied now for some considerable time. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been made of the fact that a previous committee in 1975 recommended a public register. On the one hand, Senator Button says that we should have adopted the Bowen Committee report; on the other hand, he says that there should be a public register. In fact, the Bowen Committee did not recommend a public register nor was this idea adopted by the Prime Minister or his Government. I repeat: The Bowen Committee has made its report; the standards set out in that report are now applicable to all Ministers and are to be observed by them. That means that each Minister must disclose by way of written statement his or her pecuniary interests. Those interests are made available to the Prime Minister and to the head of the Prime Minister's Department. In any discussion on matters which involve self-interest, it is the obligation of the Minister to indicate that he or she has such a self-interest. I want to make it abundantly clear that the recommendations of the Bowen Committee have been implemented and are, in fact, enforced upon Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> There was some talk of a list of some 21 sackings, resignations or suspensions. I will come to that in a moment. The interesting point is that two Ministers were picked out for criticism; one was Mr Sinclair, the other was Mr Nixon. There were no others. Whilst I do not want to make any comparisons-I do not believe that one helps one's argument by saying that the other fellow is worse- nevertheless, since that comparison was sought, I will refer in a moment or two to the record of the Whitlam Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer firstly to Mr Sinclair. It is time that this matter was put to rest. It is time that the interjections and innuendoes in this Senate were stopped. I emphasise that because these actions do nobody any credit. The facts are that a series of events occurred. It emerged that Mr Sinclair's father, an accountant, had apparently misappropriated large sums of money. The Labor Government of New South Wales, through its law officers, prosecuted the son-Mr Ian Sinclair-on a wide range of charges. On every charge he was acquitted. He made it quite clear that he intended, because he had not known of the circumstances, to make reparations. He made that voluntary statement. In any case, the ordinary public processes of the law existed to ensure that any moneys wrongly held would go to the proper persons. I emphasise that. Mr Sinclair has said:</PARA>
<PARA> No moneys are outstanding between the company and myself or the other shareholders and myself other than those covered by formal agreement entered into with independent legal advice. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement had been made by Mr Sinclair before Senator Button made his allegations today. It does Senator Button no credit that he made those allegations in that knowledge, in the knowledge of the findings of the court or in the knowledge of the ordinary processes for recovery of moneys. Let me make that abundantly clear. I repeat what Mr Sinclar said:</PARA>
<PARA> No moneys are outstanding between the company and myself or the other shareholders and myself other than those covered by formal agreement entered into with independent legal advice. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, quite deliberately, a misrepresentation was made by Senator Button. He said that two standards are held by the Prime Minister-one for Liberals, which is punitive; the other for the National Country Party which is not. How can he say these things when he knows that, in fact, Mr Sinclair stood down during the whole of the time there were charges against him, during the whole of that sad period when, because of a family tragedy, he was forced to undergo public scrutiny? Can there be a greater punishment for any man than that? He was proven innocent in the end. He stood down at the time of the Court-hearing. How can Senator Button have such selective knowledge that he fails to know that a National Country Party Minister-former Senator Sheil-within hours of his being sworn in was forced to have his portfolio withdrawn because it was considered that his behaviour in his approach to the Press was against the Government's policy? Could there be a more drastic enforcement of the strict rules of proprierty than that? In fact, this matter was not mentioned. It was hugged to the breasts of the members of the Opposition because they want to create some disaffection between the National Country Party and the Liberal Party. Indeed, full enforcement of the standard was applied in all its forms. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of Mr Nixon, the Minister for Primary Industry, and his shares in a dairy co-operative has been raised. The fact of the matter is that shares in a co-operative are, of course, completely different from shares in a normal profit -making company enterprise where one gets large and significant dividends and expects to get earnings capital accretions from those shares. Basically, in normal, legitimate trading, those who are involved in particular farming activities take out a nominal series of shares in co-operatives so that they have the capital to function as marketing or processing bodies. There can be no attempt to correlate this activity with some other business venture. </PARA>
<PARA> There was never an attempt to disguise the fact that Mr Nixon, being a farmer and processing dairy products and marketing vegetable products, was part of a co -operative and, therefore, held nominal shares in that co-operative. Mr Nixon has never sought to hide that. Mr Nixon has never at any time indicated otherwise. We have had selective details given to us today. One measure of this is that Senator Button sought to show that by an action of the Minister a known or sane benefit was given to the co-operative. He failed to disclose that, by a parallel action of the Minister, a punitive action was levelled against that co- operative. It is just not good enough for honourable senators to talk in the Senate about the propriety of Ministers when one by one the statements made are proven to be wrong and indeed, to be improperly made because they are wrong. Who , then, is the improper person? To whom does the saying 'Physician heal thyself' , relate? This Government set up standards for Customs officers' behaviour, and never modified them. It set up the Bowen Committee and adopted the report of that Committee. This Government had a situation in which a Minister, Mr Sinclair proven wholly innocent-nevertheless stood down. This Government, the day before yesterday, accepted the resignations of two of its Ministers. So, all that has been said is utterly wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to a matter which I did not want to pursue because I do not believe that comparative impropriety is any justification. I raise it only because it has been raised. Honourable senators will recall that Senator Button said: 'Even Senator Carrick cannot refer to the Whitlam Government'. The Whitlam Government was in office for three years. This Government has been in office for seven and a half years-more than two and a half times longer. It is interesting that at the end of the three years only seven Ministers held the same positions in November 1975 as they held in December 1972. That is not a bad track record! It is interesting that two Ministers were dismissed for misleading Parliament. Is not one of the major improprieties that a Minister can commit that he or she should mislead Parliament?</PARA>

These are the things that Senator Button seeks to gloss over. In three years of the Whitlam Government there were three Deputy Prime Ministers, three Treasurers, three Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs, four Ministers for Secondary Industry, three Ministers for Works and Housing, three Ministers for Immigration, three Ministers for the Northern Territory, three Ministers for Customs and four Ministers for the Environment. Only seven of the original Ministers were still there after three years. Two Ministers were sacked. One had to be sacked for misleading Parliament. One refused to resign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I repeat-I do not want to take any pride in this-that there is no joy at all in comparative propriety of impropriety. I did not raise this matter. Senator Button raised it. He does not come out of this debate with any sense of propriety at all. Each of the main claims he made were in fact, I put it to this Senate, improperly made. On each of the occasions that this Government has had a problem, it has set up the standards and has endeavoured to enforce them. In Mr Sinclair's case, he stood down. When we have had sad problems, as we did several days ago, the Ministers involved have resigned. We set up the Bowen Committee. We adopted the principles of its report. It does no credit at all to the Labor Party to raise these matters. I apologise to the people of Australia that the incidents of recent days occurred. But because they have occurred is no justification for the misrepresentation by Senator Button. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has proposed for debate the following matter of public importance:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The manner in which the Prime Minister supervises the conduct of his Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA>This debate is highlighted by the unfortunate events that surfaced last week. Whilst Senator Carrick, as Leader of the Government in the Senate, has made some comments about those aspects, I do not comment one way or the other on them. The fact is that two Ministers have resigned as a result of certain conduct on their part. The unfortunate thing is that the whole incident, and particularly the way in which it has been handled by the Government, has further belittled the important office of Minister of the Crown and has further belittled Parliament and parliamentarians in the eyes of the ordinary Australian man and woman. These people look to government, to Ministers and to parliament for leadership to overcome the economic problems that this Government has forced upon them. They look to government and to Parliament to uplift them and give them faith in their own and in their nation's future. </PARA>
<PARA> Since this Government came to office the system of parliamentary democracy has received a constant battering. The system continues to reel from the blows delivered by a government which daily and wildly accused its predecessor in office. Those accusations have been repeated here today by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. This Government, in Opposition, said that when it obtained and held the reins of office it would do something to clean up the rules. I intend to show in the short time available to me that the conduct of the then Opposition, the present Government, before the election of 1975, its statements during the election of 1975 and its standards since then are completely inconsistent one with the other. As the only remaining ex-Minister of the Labor Government in this Senate, I well remember the debates that took place in this Parliament in 1975. I then had the honour of being the Minister in charge of Government business in the Senate. I remember the constant and repetitive terms-'deceit', 'duplicity', 'dishonesty' and 'discrimination'. I remember the fishing expeditions that the then Opposition, the members of the present Government, embarked upon at meetings of Senator Estimates committee and by the establishment of Senate select committees when looking for the tiniest piece of evidence that they could dig up against some Labor Minister of the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember this Senate being recalled by the then Opposition, the members of the present Government, in the winter recess of 1975 and seeing senior public servants such as the present Solicitor-General, the then head of Treasury and the then head of the Department of Minerals and Energy sitting in the south- western corner of the Senate chamber waiting, as it were, like kids going into a dentist's chair to be called before the Bar of the Senate. Along with ordinary, decent Australian citizens they were called before the Bar of the Senate to answer questions, to be cross-examined and to be humiliated in the hope that members of the then Opposition might be able to dig something out against some Labor Minister of the Crown. I remember the suspicion, the mistrust and the urge on their part to pin something on somebody. I remember the monotony of the repetitive 'C' speeches-the speeches that collectively gathered the names of Cairns, Crean, Connor, Cass and Cope, decent Australian citizens, and honourable members of this Parliament-to give the impression that we, the Ministers and the members of the Labor Government, were a bunch of hoods fit only to ride with the Kelly gang. As Senator Button has said, no Minister of that Labor Government was ever charged or indicted before any court of this country. But tragically for the Australian people, the vicious and wicked propaganda of the then Opposition paid off. We were sacked and the Fraser Government came into office. What did Mr Fraser say in his policy speech of 1975? He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia needs an immediate change of direction. </PARA>
<PARA> What can be done immediately, and must be done, is to establish-for the first time in three years-sound and honest management of Australia's affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> There will be an end to Government extravagances and excesses. There will be no international safaris by members of Parliament. The purpose and nature of overseas trips will be subject to clear guidelines. Australia does not need a tourist as Prime Minister. There will be no more jobs for the boys. </PARA>
<PARA>That was what Mr Fraser said in 1975. What did the present Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Anthony) have to say at that election? Government members have said that they did not cast aspersions on the Labor Government. Mr Anthony in his policy speech in November 1975 stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The real lawlessness to be feared in Australia today is lawlessness in government. </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on at page 10 of his policy speech to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I ask you this:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Do you want the same dishonesty, the same corruption, the same incompetence, the same mismanagement?</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Should an incompetent government have three years? Should a dishonest government have three years? Should a corrupt Government have three years? Should a Prime Minister accused of lying have three years?</PARA>
<PARA>It was on those sorts of statements that tragically the Australian Labor Government of 1972-75 in which I was proud to be a Minister, lost office. So the present Government having made those pledges to scour out and clean up the system, what has been its sorry record in office and particularly the record of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)? I say, in reply to what Senator Sir John Carrick has just said in his speech, that we do not complain about the setting of the standards by the Government or by the Prime Minister. We complain that the standards that have been set have been ignored by the Government. Senator Sir John Carrick said that this Government has been in office for seven and a half years. In the six and a bit years that the Government has been in office we have seen the demise of some 21 Ministers including the resignation and/or dismissal of 12 Ministers of whom nine were members of the Liberal Party and three were members of the National Country Party. Of course, one of those members from the National Country Party was a Minister for one day only-the former Senator Sheil. Another of those members has been restored, as Senator Button has said, to his senior Cabinet position. In addition to that what appear to be countless numbers of others have been made ambassadors, high commissioners , consuls-general, administrators or even chairmen of some Commonwealth statutory body. Yet we were told in 1975: 'There will be no more jobs for the boys'. Therefore one reads with some cynicism in this morning's Australian Financial Review that now that it is certain that there are to be several Cabinet changes, it means that at least two Ministers are destined for ambassadorial or judicial posts. It is a fact that Ministers are moved either sideways or upwards, or they are dismissed, or they are feted for resignation, or whatever it be, not according to the standards that have been set by the Government or by the Prime Minister, but according to the political climate at the time. Yesterday the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> This Government has always upheld the fundamental principles of ministerial responsibility . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Rhetorically I ask: What happened to any Minister when there was a serious leak of Budget documents in the Budget before last to a prominent Australian journalist when Australian police were called in to investigate? Had that happened in London in the British Parliament the Treasurer would have had to resign. But what happened in this country?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button) has introduced into the Senate for discussion this afternoon a subject which he describes in his own words as:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The manner in which the Prime Minister supervises the conduct of his Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA>Those who have been listening to this debate will recall that Senator Button sought to place a general smear on the financial propriety of a large number of Ministers who have served in the various Fraser Ministries since November 1975 when the first Ministry was formed. I propose to go back and to say something about that because I think that is one of the most unfair insinuations that I have heard in the Senate. Following as I do Senator Douglas McClelland in this debate I immediately take up some of the matters with which he has dealt in his contribution to this subject. I was amazed to find that, in debating the subject which has been introduced this afternoon, Senator Douglas McClelland should have spent quite a bit of his time recalling the events and the record of the Labor Government between 1972 and 1975. He told us how he remembered the events of 1975 and he compared them with events during the Fraser Government's term of office. He complains that some Ministers have been appointed as ambassadors, that some have been given other posts and that others have been appointed to statutory authorities. Let us recall the record of the Labor Goverment under this head. Who appointed Mr Grassby, the Commissioner for Community Relations? Not only did the Labor Government appoint Mr Grassby, a defeated Minister--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not complaining about Mr Grassby. This is the record of the Labor Government which Senator Douglas McClelland has asked us to recall. Mr Grassby was a Minister in the Labor Government. He was defeated and appointed Commissioner for Community Relations. The Labor Government did one better in fact. It passed an Act of Parliament and created the position of Commissioner for Community Relations. Mr Grassby was appointed to that position. Do honourable senators recall that the Deputy Prime Minister in the Labor Government, Mr Lance Barnard, was sent off as Ambassador to Sweden, I think it was. Who appointed Mr Justice Murphy, the Attorney-General in the Labor Government, to the High Court? I am not for one minute criticising any of those appointments. I am simply recalling, as Senator Douglas McClelland has invited us to recall, some of the highlights during the Labor Government's term of office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Douglas McClelland told us that he remembers the events of 1975. He asked us to recall those events. He seemed to be particularly concerned- certainly he was very impressed as he remembers this in great detail-with events in the Senate when we were in opposition at that time and we called to the Bar of the Senate a number of public servants. Why were a number of public servants- they were perfectly distinguished people and no reflections were cast upon them- called to the Bar of the Senate? It was because we could not get answers. Not only could we not get the truth but also we could not get answers out of the Ministers of the Labor Government about the greatest scandal which had ever occurred in this country and which was known as the loans scandal. We tried for months to get answers in this Parliament about what happened. We got the truth only after months and months of investigation. Finally, the truth did come out about the squalid dealings with Mr Khemlani, an international broker, and the continuous dealings with that gentleman by Ministers of the Labor Government. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Teague is quite right. We could on on and on. But I do not want to take up time with irrelevancies in this debate today. The subject that we are discussing is the manner in which Prime Minister Fraser is supervising the conduct of his Ministers. I think it is wise to set the scene by recalling the events of those three years of office of the Labor Government of which Senator Douglas McClelland was a proud member. The fact is that the present Prime Minister was at great pains, and rightly so because of the events, to emphasise the importance that he attached to the proper conduct of Ministers. He has laid down standards. There seems to be no doubt about that. I think the Opposition has made it quite clear that it is not complaining about the high standards which the Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser has laid down and which he has reiterated. I believe that he has enforced them in relation to ministerial conduct. He laid them down at an early stage of his administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Further, during that administration he set up the committee which was presided over by Sir Nigel Bowen and which reported in July 1979 on the disclosure by Ministers, members of parliament and officers of the Public Service and statutory authorities of their pecuniary interests. The Prime Minister put into force the recommendations in that report relating to Ministers. Those recommendations were adopted, have been in force and have been acted upon. In fact, the major provision-namely, the disclosure by Ministers of their pecuniary interests to the Prime Minister-had been a feature of Prime Minister Fraser's earlier requirements in relation to ministerial conduct. All Ministers in the Fraser governments have been required by the Prime Minister to provide that information and to keep it up to date. </PARA>
<PARA> The case of the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon, has been mentioned in this debate. The fact is that Mr Nixon's interest was disclosed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister knew of it. I do not want to repeat what Senator Sir John Carrick said about it. But the fact is that Mr Nixon's interest, which has been discussed in this debate today, was the subject of disclosure under that requirement of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the insinuations of Senator Button about financial improprieties. That is my note of the phrase he used. He coupled that with the 'sacking of Ministers' and mentioned a figure of 21. He let all these things float around to give the impression to those people listening to this debate today that something like 21 Ministers of this Government had been disposed of in one form or another as a result of some sort of financial impropriety. That is how it sounded to me. He did not specifically say it in that many words but his remarks were coupled to give that impression. Of course, it is a totally false impression. The only cases of Ministers actually being sacked were the cases of Senator Withers and Senator Sheil. Most of the cases involved Ministers resigning for one reason or another. Some resigned on matters of principle, such as my predecessor, Mr Ellicott, and, recently, Mr Peacock. That is a very fine example of Ministers upholding the standards of ministerial responsibility because they had a difference with the Government or with the Prime Minister on a matter of principle. </PARA>
<PARA> Other Ministers have stood aside, either temporarily or permanently, because of questions that were raised and inquiries that were made into alleged misconduct. Examples of that, of course, were the cases of Messrs Garland, Robinson and Sinclair. It is worth remembering that no actual findings of criminal conduct were made in regard to those allegations. Messrs Garland, Robinson and Sinclair returned to the Ministry because they had been cleared of the allegations made against them. Other Ministers have simply resigned. In some cases, such as the cases of Mr McLeay and Mr Garland, they were appointed to posts outside the Parliament. Both persons were interested in pursuing other careers. In no sense were they sacked. They are perfectly normal situations which occur from time to time with Ministries. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent events which have given rise to this debate-the resignations of Messrs MacKellar and Moore, which I think everybody recognises were most unfortunate, arose--</PARA>

It would then have been over and done with and there would have been no prosecutions at all. That is the fact of the matter. He recognises that. The fact is that they resigned because they had high standards to uphold. If the Opposition is suggesting impropriety, I point out that Mr MacKellar wrote, as we all know, to the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs within a few days and offered to pay any duty that he was liable to pay. He has now said that he will pay the duty when the assessment is made. I believe that this Government and this Prime Minister have upheld the most high standards of ministerial propriety .</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Friday night the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) knew that Mr MacKellar had not paid duty on a colour television set, that a false declaration with Mr MacKellar's name on it had been filed and that the former Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Moore, found out about those incidents the next week and did nothing. The Prime Minister did nothing on Friday night or Saturday morning. On Monday night, he accepted the resignations of the Ministers as their fingertips touched the tops of their spines. No relevant facts were known on Monday night that were not known on Friday other than the fact that every major newspaper in the country had editorially demanded that the Ministers go. The Ministers went, not because of their offences, but because the Government's position was politically untenable given the unanimous reaction of the Press on Monday. According to Press reports, Cabinet unanimously decided that the resignations be insisted upon. In the greatest of ironies, Mr Nixon and Mr Sinclair voted for the resignations. Fancy putting Mr Sinclair on a jury, as my friend Mick Young said in the House of Representatives yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some people might think that the Prime Minister's attitude towards Mr Moore and Mr MacKellar was slack-and so it was. People are right to think that, especially given that a member of the Prime Minister's staff was this morning telling anyone around Parliament House who would listen that Moore and MacKellar would be back. Compared with some Ministers who are still in the Fraser Cabinet, Moore and MacKellar were victimised. For example, our old friend Mr Sinclair on his own admission in a statement in the House of Representatives on 6 June 1979, which I have with me, acknowledged that his father had misappropriated from the Reliance group of companies $292,000. He undertook responsibility to pay the money back under terms to be determined later. The terms were determined and released to the Press Gallery in a statement from Mr Sinclair on 2 August 1979, which I also have with me. Mr Sinclair received and, according to the terms of that statement, continues to have in his possession $100,000 of the nearly $300, 000 stolen dollars which he undertook to repay. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Carrick, in his usual obfuscatory style, said that Mr Sinclair was cleared by the courts. It is true that he was found not guilty of three charges of forgery, three charges of uttering and three offences under the Companies Act of New South Wales. It is true that he was cleared of those charges after the jury had deliberated for seven hours and in spite of a rather extraordinary direction to the jury by the presiding judge. But the facts about Mr Sinclair having received the money which he said was misappropriated and being in possession of some of it still came from his own mouth and pen. Whether he is living on the money or whether he is just holding it to finance the private business and accumulate more Sinclair family capital has no relevance to the fact that he received, knowingly or unknowingly, the money in the first place, that he certainly retained possession of it after he became aware of the fact that it was misappropriated, even after he had publicly acknowledged that it was misappropriated, and he has some of it still. </PARA>
<PARA> A Senate committee only last year unanimously found that it preferred the evidence of the former Chairman of the Australian Dairy Corporation, Mr Webster, to the evidence given by Mr Sinclair. Mr Sinclair declined to take an oath or to make a statutory declaration to the Committee. In fact, one wonders whether, if MacKellar's secretary had written George Sinclair across the bottom of the declaration, Mr MacKellar would still have been in the Ministry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was disclosed last December that Mr Nixon, acting alone, had authorised a discretionary payment of three-quarters of a million dollars to the Murray-Goulburn dairy co-operative, a company in which he and his family have 2, 000 shares. It is true that penalty payments of $2.3m, about which he had no option because the question was one of legal definitions and he had obtained legal advice on the matter, were made by the company. According to both Senator Carrick and the Prime Minister that action is also quite acceptable to the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bowen guidelines, said to have been adopted by this Government, in relation to ministerial behaviour say quite explicitly that when a Minister is directing the business of his department he must inform the Prime Minister of any real or apparent conflict of interest and that the Prime Minister, having been informed, unless he asks the Minister to divest himself of the shares, must appoint another Minister to make the decision or personally authorise the decision made by the original Minister. In any case, the guidelines say that the matter must be recorded. The Prime Minister's excuse for the suspension of the guidelines as they might apply to National Country Party Ministers was that the guidelines stated that the Minister should inform him and not that the Minister must inform him. From what Mr Fraser has disclosed to us, whether he was informed remains a mystery. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to dwell at great length on this matter. I could not do any better than quote the editorial judgment of the Melbourne Age on this subject when, on 8 December, it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Reminded of this-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the Bowen guidelines-</PARA>
<PARA>the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, has resorted to semantics. The report, he has said, uses the word 'should'. It does not say that a Minister 'must' divest himself of his shares or interest. The distinction is an artificial one; and the fact that Mr Fraser felt the need to make it will be seen by many as proof of his insincerity in the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Then, of course, Mr Nixon, acting in the style to which he has become accustomed , attempted to intimidate the Australian Broadcasting Commission for reporting the incident. This was reported in the Canberra Times of 5 January. Senator Carrick prevaricated and obfuscated in a different way on this matter both yesterday in answer to a question and again today. He said that shares held in a co-operative do not establish a financial benefit which, by and large, is correct insofar as the profits of such a co-operative are usually disclosed according to the volume of trading done through the co-operative instead of the shares held. Mr Nixon is, of course, a supplier to the co-operative as well as a shareholder in it. Therefore, contrary to what Senator Carrick claims, he stood to gain financially by making a $750,000 discretionary payment to the co- operative for interest and storage charges which would ultimately be distributed to the suppliers of the co-operative, including himself. So Mr Nixon made a grant to the co-operative, portion of which was destined to be made to himself, and said nothing about it. As Senator Carrick put it yesterday with respect to the way in which such co-operatives operate, everybody knows that is a basic principle within the rural community. Therefore, apparently, the principles which are accepted with respect to the operations of co-operatives are those which will guide the ministerial behaviour of this Government, and to hell with the Bowen report. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Carrick reminded us that the Government said it has adopted the Bowen guidelines, which is true. What we are concerned about and what the country is concerned about is not what the Government says but what the Government does. As this case makes perfectly clear, the Government says it has adopted the guidelines but in fact it has not. The Government says it has done a good job in managing the economy, and in fact it has not, and so on. What we are concerned about is not the excellence or the piety of the Government's rhetoric; what we are concerned about is its actual performance. The outstanding features of the principles of Fraserism with respect to ministerial behaviour are these: Firstly , they are, to say the least, permissive; secondly, there is an even lower standard for the National Country Party Ministers. Even a Country Party backbencher remarked recently, 'Even our people reckon Nixon and Sinclair should go'. Senator Carrick, of course, defends that double standard. Indeed, he is a beneficiary of it. If Country Party standards had been applied to Senator Withers nearly four years ago, Senator Withers and not Senator Carrick would be Leader of the Government in the Senate today. Senator Carrick indeed has good reason to defend the double standards of which he is a beneficiary. </PARA>
<PARA> Compliance with the needs of the Country Party has on some occasions got other members of this Government into trouble. Back in 1978 identical questions were asked in both Houses of the then Minister for Science, the former Senator Webster, and Mr Newman, the then Minister for National Development, regarding the Great Barrier Reef and whether oil drilling permits had been delaying the declaration of a section of the Reef as a marine park. Contradictory answers were received, which caused some embarrassment even to this Government. Five hours later Mr Newman came back into the House of Representatives and said that the answer he gave was not correct because he had not heard the question properly. He did not explain why it took him five hours to discover why he had not heard the question properly. The truth was published in the National Times of 6 October 1979 under Stuart Simson's byline. The article gave some background information on Mr Newman and indeed detailed circumstances in which Mr Newman was with a group of journalists late one night in Charlie's Restaurant in Canberra. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> One of the matters on which Newman bared his soul was his dramatic change of story on the proposed Barrier Reef National Park in May. Newman took the politically unusual step of changing from the right story to the wrong story. </PARA>
<PARA> His action severely damaged his credibility but, he confided to his breathless Charlie's audience, probably saved the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to state that Newman and Webster gave different answers to Parliament and that he realised something was wrong after he gave his answer. The article continues-</PARA>

It is not legally enforceable but is a matter of the utmost good faith. I shall refer to the matter of the utmost good faith a little later. It is said to relate primarily to official activities, and to the responsibility of a Minister for the policies which he adopts. Perhaps the best example in recent times that can be given is the regrettable incident in the United Kingdom, at Westminster, involving the resignation of Lord Carrington as Foreign Minister in the Thatcher Government. Lord Carrington, I believe, upheld the very finest traditions of the Westminster principle, the doctrine of ministerial responsibility. Whilst saying that he did not believe he was culpable, he believed that the policy was demonstrably wrong in the events which transpired and that he as the Minister must accept the responsibility and resign. One of the finest Foreign Ministers in Britain's history and in the world today was forced to resign under this principle. I believe that if we have a further look at ministerial responsibility we will see that its nature has changed somewhat with the growth in the size of government. We find that some authors suggest that the convention-that is the doctrine of ministerial responsibility-has become ineffective. One author stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Without examining all these factors in detail . . . ministerial responsibility developed in an age of limited government, when government responsibilities were restricted, when departments were small enough for the minister to be in close contact with his officials and when departments were responsible for administering a small number of relatively straight forward statutes. Today the scale of these operations has enlarged enormously, sufficently so in fact to question whether it is reasonable to hold a minister personally responsible for administrative errors. </PARA>
<PARA>The author also claimed:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a minister's ability to defy critics with the aid of his party may often outweigh Parliament's capacity to dismiss a minister even when the circumstances warrant dismissal. </PARA>
<PARA>The article further states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the secretive habits of modern government increase the minister's chance to evade Parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA>I think they are important words because brought before us today, at the behest of the Opposition, is a comparison between the behaviour in 1972 to 1975 of the Australian Labor Party Government under Mr Whitlam and the behaviour of the present coalition Government. I think it is important to acknowledge that there has been a change in the general view with regard to ministerial responsibility, but there is still behind it a belief that there must be, so far as Ministers are concerned, the utmost good faith, that standards of behaviour must be of the highest. What do we find? We find that the former Minister for Health, Mr MacKellar, resigned not because of action taken by him as Minister but because of what has been described in the Age editorial as minor acts of foolishness. The editorial of the Australian newspaper describes the matter as one which may 'itself appear trifling'. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not trying to suggest that the Ministers should not have resigned. I believe that they properly resigned. I believe it is that demonstration of the utmost good faith which has been demonstrated in this case by these two Ministers who, for what is described by two of the leading newspapers in Australia as acts of foolishness or matters of a trifling nature, did do what is expected under that convention should be done by a Minister where there has been fault on his or her part. What happened in 1974 and 1975? As Senator Durack stated we tried to drag out little by little some honest answers but they were not forthcoming from a government that preferred to cover up the iniquities, the deceit and the deception which was practised during that time.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me compare bringing in a television set which was dutiable-because it was colour; it would not have been dutiable if it had been black and white-with attempting to bring in half a million dollars of hot money from some shonkey, revolutionary regime in the Middle East. Let us compare that and see the comparison in standards of behaviour. Let us compare the Khemlani affair--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans asks: Was there any prospect that anyone would make a dollar out of it? All I can say is that if Mr Whitlam and the others who were involved in the Iraqi breakfast affair did not think that they were going to get some advantage out of it, why did they attend and why did the negotiations take place? The second point I want to make concerns a matter about which there was a cover up, in which there was deception and there was a misleading of the Parliament, and that is the matter which became known as the Khemlani affair. I think it is still sufficiently clear in the minds of the average Australian for me not to need to remind them in detail about what was involved-the way in which there was deception, the way in which the Minutes of the Executive Council were not properly dealt with, the way in which there were refusals to answer, wrong answers and misleading answers. Let me just compare that with the matter which has been brought up today by the Opposition. Two Ministers, for what has been described by those newspapers as an extremely trifling matter, displaying the highest possible principles, have in fact resigned. Yet that Government, between 1972 and 1975 to which I have referred had to be dragged screaming out of its office. It would not resign. It did not do the decent thing, having been found out, eventually, for what it had been doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe we should not be taking the time of this chamber this afternoon discussing these matters. I believe they have been dealt with. The Ministers concerned have paid a very high price. They have paid a proper price but a very high price, a price which the ALP when in government, was not prepared to pay and a standard of behaviour which it was not prepared to observe. I believe we should be getting on with debating some of the important matters which are facing this country, matters about which apparently the Labor Party has no real concern, matters which it is prepared to put aside whilst it raises something that one would think has been, relatively speaking, done to death in the past few days. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us get on with discussing questions of superannuation, the problems of interest rates and the effect that they are having on small business, on home building, on home purchase and all the other problems that arise from that. Let us get on with the question of the development of the possibility of tax cuts within our economy. Let us get on with the question of how we can increase productivity in this country to enable us to pay for the welfare programs, the defence programs and in particular the tax cuts which so many people believe are necessary. Let us get on with the debate about industrial relations and how we can overcome some of the real problems that are so demonstrable to every Australian so far as that field is concerned. There are a number of real problems to be debated. For members of the Labor Party to rehash again today a matter which has been dealt with, and dealt with according to the finest standards of the doctrine of ministerial responsibility, is, I believe, to demonstrate the paucity of the argument available to them about matters of real importance to this country. So that those who are interested in that can get on with the debate in relation to it, I move:</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this report is to acquaint the Senate with the Committee's consideration of the Public Assemblies Ordinance, contained in Australian Capital Territory Ordinance No. 10 of 1982 and made under the Seat of Government Administration Act 1910. One important reason for presenting the report is to enable substantive debate to take place which the Senate Committee regards as socially innovatory and affecting fundamental rights and liberties. The Committee has taken this step in accordance with the recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs that ordinances of this nature should be the subject of substantive debate. I point out that today Senator Ryan gave notice of disallowance which will, in any event, bring this Ordinance on for substantive debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The report reminds the Senate of the undertakings from the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) following the Committee's consideration of the Traffic (Amendment) Ordinance 1981, which gave rise to the most unusual proceedings followed by the Committee in relation to this legislation. The Committee, during the period October 1981 to March 1982, examined working papers and successive drafts of the proposed ordinance at eight meetings and examined the final instrument on 20 April 1982 in accordance with its normal procedures. In the course of its examination, the Committee had detailed discussions with officers of the Department of the Capital Territory and the Attorney-General's Department on four occasions. The Committee also met with the Select Committee on Public Assemblies of the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly. A copy of the Select Committee's report is tabled for the information of honourable senators. The Committee draws the attention of the Senate to the objects of the Ordinance contained in section 3 which states:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to recognize the right of peaceful assembly in accordance with article 21 of the Covenant-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the International Convenant on Civil and Political Rights-</PARA>
<PARA> (b) in conformity with that Article, to ensure, to the greatest extent that is practicable, that persons in the Territory enjoy the freedom to participate in public assemblies subject only to such restrictions as are necessary in the interests of public order and safety or to protect the rights and freedoms of other persons,</PARA>
<PARA>and this Ordinance shall be construed accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has determined that the Ordinance does not offend against the principles under which it operates and will take no action in relation to it. The full text of the Ordinance together with the explanatory notes provided to the Committee, are attached as an appendix to the report. As the report indicates, the Committee has been engaged in a unique exercise in considering this Ordinance and now lays its report before the Senate to enable debate to take place. That completes my statement as Chairman of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, but I wish to mention one other matter in relation to the Public Assemblies Ordinance simply as a Government senator. It seems to me that there is one fundamental question in relation to assemblies, that is, whether participation in an assembly should be limited or unlimited. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which is attached to the report, states:</PARA>
<PARA> The right of peaceful assembly shall be recognised. No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order . . . the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. </PARA>
<PARA>This Ordinance has been tabled by the Minister but was prepared with a great deal of input by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, a bipartisan Committee which contributed an enormous amount of work along with the officers of both the Department of the Capital Territory and the Attorney- General's Department. The Ordinance certainly reflects a majority view of the members of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the fundamental question which I mentioned before and that is whether participation in an assembly should be limited or unlimited. That is the kernel of what it is all about. The International Covenant provides that assemblies should be unlimited except in those circumstances which it sets out. But if we have unlimited participation, which I understand some members of the Senate would prefer, then it must be up to the police on the day of the event to resolve any disputation. With unlimited participation there is the possibility that there will be major conflict and major disputation on the day of the event. One could envisage a situation in which some person perhaps dresses in a uniform which is offensive to others. He could maintain his silence while dressed in this uniform and, therefore, create no disturbance which would enable him to be arrested or in some other way taken away from the assembly. Yet the mere presence of him in that uniform could create an enormous disturbance to others who are trying to utilise their right of peaceful assembly. That is just the sort of disturbance which might occur on any day. </PARA>
<PARA> The alternative to unlimited participation is to determine disputes before the event. The only way in which a dispute can be determined before the event is if, in some way or other, there is an application to someone to enable people to participate in the event and that application has been resolved. That is the procedure which has been adopted in the Australian Capital Territory by the Government and which, in fact, has been suggested by the Committee. In other words, the only way in which a dispute can be determined in relation to a particular event before the event takes place is if a course of action is taken similar to that adopted under this Public Assemblies Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to ensure that those who wish to participate in an event have the weakest possible limitation on their right to assemble the Ordinance provides, firstly, for the Commissioner of Police to make a determination in relation to those who have applied to participate and he is bound to take into consideration a number of things. Secondly, if any person or group who has applied is dissatisfied with the Commissioner's determination that person or group has a right to apply to a Supreme Court judge and the application will be heard de novo. The court has to apply the same principles as those which are set out for the Commissioner to apply. With all due respect to the people who have indicated publicly that they will speak and who I anticipate will speak in this place against this proposal, I cannot imagine anything which could be fairer than the resolution of these disputes before the event takes place by, firstly, the Commissioner of Police who does not have an unlimited discretion but who has to take into account certain matters which are set out in the Public Assemblies Ordinance, which could not be fairer. Secondly, if people are not satisfied with that they have the right to apply to a Supreme Court judge with a completely fresh application, not as a matter of appeal on a point of law or any such thing , but with the Supreme Court judge having a completely unlimited discretion except insofar as he must apply his decision in relation to the principles espoused in the Ordinance. I cannot imagine anything which would be fairer. The alternative to this, as I have said, is to have unlimited participation, which would mean that the police would have to resolve the conflicts on the day and at the place. I do not see unlimited participation as in any way advancing the civil liberties of people involved in the matter. On the contrary I suggest that it is the road to anarchy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some comments on the report brought down by the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances on the Australian Capital Territory Public Assemblies Ordinance. I will say at the outset that the Senate is indebted to the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee. What I have to say subsequently is not fundamentally a criticism of this Committee of the Senate or its work. It is rather a criticism of the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) who has created in this Territory an intolerable situation surrounding what is certainly one of the most important days of the year. Speaking as an Australian Capital Territory senator I must say that I very much regret what happened with the commemoration of Anzac Day in this Territory last year. Now it appears to be the case that the commemoration of Anzac Day in the Australian Capital Territory this coming weekend will be an occasion of difficulty, of tension within the community and of polarisation of community groups. We would have avoided all these things if we could have. All of these things, I believe, are directly the result of the incompetent actions of the Minister for the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Lewis has given us an account of the work of the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee in respect of this Public Assemblies Ordinance. Certainly it is true that that Committee sought, and I think achieved, some improvements to the Ordinance, but the Ordinance is still fundamentally unacceptable. I said that I am not critical of the work of the Committee and that we are indebted to it for the effort it has put into considering this Ordinance. However, I must say that I am critical of and I fundamentally reject its ultimate conclusion. I disagree with Senator Lewis. I believe the Ordinance does trespass unduly on personal liberties. However, I will not go into my specific criticisms of the Ordinance at this stage because, as Senator Lewis has pointed out, I have given notice of a disallowance motion in relation to this Ordinance which I will move at the earliest opportunity. That will be the occasion for me and other honourable senators who support me in this move to go into detail about the unsatisfactory legal and civil liberties aspects of the Ordinance. However, I want to make a couple of general comments now. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lewis has given us an account of the development of this Ordinance from the time last year when the Minister for the Capital Territory, Michael Hodgman, wrote to the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee asking it not to disallow last year's Ordinance-although by implication he admitted a number of inadequacies in it-on the grounds that he undertook to develop a new ordinance and to make that ordinance available to the locally elected body for consultation with the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee. He gave other undertakings. The letter that he wrote to the Committee is recorded in the Senate Hansard of 14 May 1981. I will not take the time of the Senate by reading it now. My criticism of the Minister is fundamentally that he did not keep to the terms that he undertook to meet in that letter. Yes, he did develop a new ordinance, but he introduced it at such a late stage, at a date so close to the Anzac Day memorial service, that there was not adequate time for public discussion of the ordinance. </PARA>

As it was, public discussion could not take place. I, as an Australian Capital Territory senator, could not answer the queries that my constituents kept bringing to me. Various organisations and various individuals kept asking me: 'What are we going to do about Anzac Day? What law is going to prevail with regard to the holding of the Anzac Day memorial service? What do we do if we wish to participate?' These queries from my constituents were genuine. I could not answer them.

I do not think it will be able to. The various groups which have been involved in the whole debate, including the Returned Services League, which requested the very first ordinance, are, I understand, dissatisfied. All the community groups are dissatisfied. We have a situation in which the citizens of the Australian Capital Territory are to be bound by a law which it seems now nobody, except Senator Lewis and the Minister for the Capital Territory, wants. I point out that the House of Assembly, as a result of the public inquiry it was able to conduct, has recommended that the Ordinance not be proceeded with.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House of Assembly concluded that it was of the view that the proposed Ordinance would represent a serious and unwarranted infringement of civil liberties and set out the detailed reasons. It said that a more general reason related to the complexity of some of the procedures which are laid down under the Ordinance. These, it believes, would present a major obstacle to the exercise of the right of free public assembly in the Australian Capital Territory. It is all very well for Senator Lewis to give the Senate a lawyer's view of the alternatives available to the legislature in these circumstances. What I, as a representative of the citizens of the Australian Capital Territory, am concerned about is that we have an Ordinance which satisfies nobody and which very few people can understand. It is so badly formulated and contains so many confusing aspects that a citizen picking it up to see how he or she should behave if he or she wished to participate on Anzac Day would not receive any illumination at all. For that reason alone it is a bad Ordinance. As I said, I will not at this stage go into the technicalities of my objection to the Ordinance. I will do that when I move the motion of disallowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am very disappointed that Senator Lewis has presented the Senate with a report from a most prestigious Committee of this place that amounts to a whitewash job on the behaviour of the Minister for the Capital Territory. The Minister for the Capital Territory gave certain undertakings to the Committee and thus to the Senate. He did not fulfil those undertakings. Through his negligent and incompetent behaviour he has created a most unfortunate situation for the Australian Capital Territory community. I ask honourable senators to consider that. It is not a matter that will affect their own electorates, but citizens of the Australian Capital Territory simply do not know how they will be able to behave on Anzac Day. I am sure that the Federal Police does not know how it is going to try to enforce this Ordinance. People know that their rights have been restrained and constricted under this Ordinance but they do not know precisely in what way. Some groups which have applied to participate on Anzac Day have been refused permission whereas others have got it. The reasons for the distinction between the applications are not clear to the general community. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that we have a chaotic situation in which many people's rights, including the rights of people who want a traditional Anzac Day observance, are being eroded in a very serious way. The responsibility is that of the Minister for the Capital Territory, Michael Hodgman. I recognise and acknowledge that the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee made serious efforts to resolve some of the difficulties. Its efforts, in my view, were not successful. I will attempt to have this Ordinance disallowed. However, it is not likely that that will happen before Anzac Day. It seems that we are to be faced with all sorts of community problems on Anzac Day. The effect of this law will be the very opposite of what a law ought to do. It is a most unfortunate situation and I very much regret it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, which dealt with this matter over the last few months. I wish just briefly to mention my position. As other members of the Committee would know, I disagreed with the Committee's involvement in this matter. I was not convinced-I am still not convinced-that it is yet proper for the Regulations and Ordinances Committee to help to draft regulations and ordinances. Being a relatively new member of that Committee I ended up going along with its procedure in co-operating with the Government in having discussions with officers of the Department of the Capital Territory and of the Attorney-General's Department in an effort to improve the initial drafts. I agree with Senator Ryan's criticism of the Government in that the departments and the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) in particular were slow in commencing work on this Ordinance. The matter had been a problem from almost this time last year, but it was not until October or November that an initial draft was provided to the Committee. That is the time which can be most criticised. A lot of work has been done since but, in view of the fact that everybody knew that the revised Ordinance had to be provided for this time of the year, a lot more work should have been done sooner rather than being in a position where the first draft was available only shortly before the end of the sittings before Christmas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I disagree with the fact that the Committee became involved to the extent that it did. I have a feeling that it really ought to be a matter of the Government, within its own counsels, determining its position, providing the Ordinance, tabling it and then the Regulations and Ordinances Committee and the Parliament as a whole determining their attitude to it. I have to acknowledge that the Committee's involvement improved in many respects, the various drafts provided by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Many aspects of the Ordinance were totally unsatisfactory. I think it has been improved a great deal. No other Ordinance has been gone through with such a fine tooth-comb as this one. Perhaps it is just as well that not every piece of legislation is drafted as thoroughly as this one. That is not to say that I agree with the Ordinance as it has been made and tabled. Aspects of it can be criticised in general terms, such as the unwieldly procedure and the possible costliness, which I gather is even objected to by the Returned Services League, in access to the appeal procedures. I guess one cannot object to the principles of the appeal procedures provided for. I still have some objections to certain sections, such as section 6 and section 24. I will not go into this aspect now as there will be another debate on this matter when Senator Ryan's motion for disallowance is considered. </PARA>
<PARA> My main objection to the Ordinance is the inclusion of the limited participation provisions. I point out that the limited participation proposal was not included in some of the earlier drafts; it was something which was included part way through the consideration. I make the point that the question of availability of limited participation is the wrong way round, if it is to be applied at all. Senator Lewis argued in favour of all marches being of limited participation. The basis of his argument was that because definition of people and classes of people who could be included were better able to be sorted out in advance so that everyone knew where they stood rather than it being open slather , that system ought to be available to everybody. That was the way he was arguing. He did not raise an argument which explained why limited participation should be available only on days of special significance. He talked in terms of determined disputes before the event. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a problem on the question of limited participation per se. If this is able to be justified, all the procedures for limited participation as far as I am concerned should be available for everyone and for all marches. I would have thought that there was more argument for it being available for a more private march for a particular section of the community demonstrating its point of view than for a march or a demonstration which was of more national significance. Section 4 defines a 'day of special significance', as meaning Canberra Day, Anzac Day or as sub-section (c) states:</PARA>
<PARA>a day declared under section 5 to be a day of special significance for the purposes of this Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 5, sub-section 1 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Where the Minister is of the opinion that a day is a day of national, historic, religious or social significance or solemnity to or for the people of Australia, the community in the Territory or a section of that community, he may, by notice published in the Gazette not later than 21 days before that day, declare that day to be a day of special significance for the purposes of this Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA>It strikes me that, if a day is of such national importance, it is precisely that sort of day which ought to be more available for everyone to participate in if it is to be a national day, a day of special significance, rather than be limited. We have a situation where it is precisely that sort of day which is to be limited to marches which perhaps involve a mere section of the community expressing a particular ideological or very limited point of view. They are the ones which will not be able to be limited to those people who have that point of view, but will be open to anyone who wishes to participate. I make those comments at this stage. I will reserve further comments for the debate on the disallowance motion when it arises next week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is more in sorrow than in anger that I make the point that for the second year in a row the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances is in real danger of losing its credibility as one of the most hitherto respected Senate committees. It is a committee which has traditionally acted without regard to party political considerations, which has looked at the merits of delegated legislation by reference to civil liberty criteria, and when delegated legislation has been manifestly offensive, has reported and recommended disallowance accordingly. That has been the tradition of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee ever since it was founded in 1932. That is the tradition which has made this Committee the model for so many similar exercises in legislative scrutiny in other countries around the parliamentary world. But that Committee will only preserve its credibility if it produces reports which have regard-much more seriously than I suspect this particular report does-to the true merits of the legislation before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find it impossible to believe that this Committee could come to the conclusion that the Australian Capital Territory Public Assemblies Ordinance 1982, now reported to us as not deserving of any condemnation at all by the Senate, does not unduly trespass on the rights and liberties of the subject. It is a manifestly unacceptable piece of delegated legislation by any civil liberty standards and certainly by the standards of the Committee as they have been applied over several parliamentary generations. I am prepared to believe that the Committee struggled for a long time to improve the original legislative model that was put before it by the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) some considerable time ago. I am prepared to believe that the Committee did make a number of quite genuine attempts to improve that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I readily acknowledge, as Senator Ryan has before me, that at least the product we have before us now has fewer holes numerically and quantitatively, than the original draft which was abominable beyond belief. I acknowledge that the Committee, to that extent, has played a positive and constructive role. But I find it difficult to credit the Committee's role in the final conclusion that it has come to after adding up the merits, such as they are, and the many more obvious demerits of this legislation. It has chosen to recommend to the Senate that this piece of delegated legislation does not offend the traditional criteria. I find it difficult to credit that that was a conclusion that could responsibly or sensitively have been reached by any group of legislators, let alone those constituting this particular highly respected Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have bothered to read the Ordinance very closely indeed, Senator Lewis. I will not, because of the nature of this parliamentary occasion, which is simply to respond to the report that has been put down by the Committee and not to deal with the question of the disallowance of the Ordinance, go into any great detail as to the many defects of this legislation as I perceive them and as we on this side of the chamber perceive them. I will say only that which is sufficient to indicate the range and the diversity of the objections which, I believe, can legitimately be made-not from a party political viewpoint but on an objective commitment to basic principles-to this legislation. I hope that an early opportunity will arise to proceed with the disallowance motion which was moved by Senator Ryan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There appears to be some uncertainty as to whether procedurally it will be possible, given the nature of our business tomorrow, to bring this matter on for debate tomorrow. There is a further difficulty in that if the debate were called on tomorrow and the disallowance motion were to be passed, we do not at the moment have a provision in our law whereby any pre-existing ordinance would leap back into life. We would to that extent have something in the nature of a legislative vacuum governing the Anzac Day march as it is to operate on Sunday. I think that argument can be very much overstated because there is quite a considerable amount of statutory authority vested in police officers under traffic Acts and other pieces of Australian Capital Territory legislation, not to mention the traditional common law powers, to deal with unlawful assemblies, breakers of the peace and so on that may still be available and applicable to govern this event on Sunday. I think it will add even more confusion and uncertainty to an already very confused and uncertain situation were the law, as it were, to be snatched out from under the feet of those trying to administer it on this coming weekend. It may be better as a result-I still have an open mind on this subject-for the debate on the disallowance of this matter to proceed in a more calm and reasoned way when the immediate context in which it will be applied is over. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me simply say rather quickly what I perceive to be the major problems with this Ordinance. I think they fall into four main categories. Briefly, they are as follows. The first problem is simply that the Ordinance was not approved by the Australian Capital Territory House of As- sembly. That is an important consideration. Not only was it not approved; it has been manifested and directly disapproved. If we are to have any sensitivity to the principles--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Chipp" NAMEID="3V4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator Chipp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Was it rejected?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was rejected, on a close vote, but it was rejected. After a proper scrutiny by a committee-admittedly hastily-it was rejected. If we are to adopt the principles of respect for the institution of local self-government, such as they are in the Territory, I think we should take that very seriously indeed. That is perhaps not a conclusive ground for the Senate acting to disallow anything but it is certainly something that should weigh very strongly indeed and should have weighed, to my mind, much more strongly in the views of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, it is the case that this Ordinance-I will not go into any of its procedural detail-is complex and confusing in the extreme. Moreover, as a result of that complexity and the various procedures and counter-procedures that are built into the Ordinance, it will be extremely expensive to apply from the point of view of those organisations whose rights to demonstrate or whatever depend on its application. So much was demonstrated, I understand, earlier this week when the RSL, which one would not have thought to be a peculiarly impecunious organisation, found itself unable to justify to its members the cost of appealing to the Supreme Court, as the terms of the Ordinance allow it to do, against the decision of the Police Commissioner to allow various other non-RSL organisations to march. If that is the case for the RSL how much more obviously is it the case for the litter of voluntary organisations around the place, usually with not a penny to save themselves with, which are likely to be the main bodies to which an ordinance of this kind will have immediate application. The rights thus created are to that extent illusory because on any view they require money for them to be exercised through the procedures of the courts. There are many more things that can be said about that but I will leave that to the proper occasion of the scrutiny of the detailed terms of the Ordinance itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area of objection to this Ordinance must be the very peculiar concept that it creates of the so-called limited participation assembly. I very briefly indicate the grounds of objection to this concept as it is embodied in this Ordinance. They are as follows: First of all, there is the fact that this has essentially been devised as a way of achieving the goal of making special legislative provision for Anzac Day. Rather than just letting the Anzac Day march be treated on its merits like any other public assembly, special provision has been made for Anzac Day and such other days, including Canberra Day, to be the subject of special gazettal and notification to that effect. This is in breach of the clear expression of ministerial intention which was offered publicly a year ago that any re-write of the manifestly unacceptable Anzac Day Ordinance that we debated last year would not specifically deal with the Anzac Day situation but would be a public assembly law of general application. But what we have here now is simply another Anzac Day Ordinance, a not very effective one, dressed up in generalised clothing. The Minister to that extent, I believe, has not honoured his statement of intention. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also conceptual problems of the kind that were referred to by my colleague Senator Coates in relation to the very concept of a limited participation assembly, particularly when it is made clear that the limited participation assemblies are primarily to be those kinds of assemblies like Anzac Day and Canberra Day which hitherto have been regarded as of significance to the community as a whole not just some particular sectional interest within it. It is odd, is it not, that the very assemblies which from that point of view ought to be most accessible to the community at large, most open to popular participation, are the very assemblies which under this delegated legislation are the most closed off to such access? There is that conceptual problem. I think it has to be grappled with. Also a problem in relation to this limited participation assembly concept is the obvious difficulty it will create in its practical application. We have seen the bizzare situation during this week when eight or nine groups, at last count, had applied for permission from the Police Commissioner to join this limited participation assembly-to join, in other words , the ranks of the RSL in marching on that particular demonstrative occasion. We have had a situation in which the Commissioner of Police has let in some groups and excluded others by applying-no doubt very genuinely and sincerely-the statutory criteria that are open to him. But how on earth will the working policeman on the ground next Sunday in the context of Anzac Day distinguish between those individuals who, on the one hand, are members of or associated with the Interim Committee for the Council of Civil Liberties in the Australian Capital Territory who are allowed to march and on the other hand those who are members of the Australian Capital Territory Committee for the Defence of Human Rights? What will distinguish the individuals? Will it be their dress, their mode of behaviour, their hair cuts, their beards or the length of their trousers ? What will it be? How will the police make those sorts of distinctions? A potentially nightmarish situation has been created. Many more things could be said about that. They will be said in the context of the further debate on this Ordinance. No doubt we will be debating this in the context of what happens-I hope that nothing happens-next Sunday although all the indications are that a shambles can be contemplated as a result of the operation of this Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining point I simply make about the limited participation concept is that I think the only real utility that comes through from the concept itself as it appears in the legislation is the requirement that it, in effect, imposes some sort of prior notification of the intention of non-mainstream groups to join the mainstream on a demonstrative occasion. I think it is important that the police, so far as is possible, have prior notification so that they can plan the occasion accordingly and anticipate difficulties accordingly. I argue that what is a benefit--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Chipp" NAMEID="3V4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe not, Senator Chipp, but that is a concept which has been accepted in other cities in other parts of Australia which has really worked quite well. A voluntary notification system has operated in Melbourne since the troubled days of the city square and the Melbourne City Council's overreaction to various demonstrations in the late 1960s and early 1970s. That has worked well, and essentially--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true. Of course, I am not saying that conduct should be criminal which is not the subject of a prior notification. I am saying that it should be removed altogether from the ambit of the language of the statutory law and that there should be introduced, so far as possible, a voluntary system of prior notification rather than the compulsory permit system that is enshrined in this particular legislation. It is a permit system which goes further than any comparable permit system in any other jurisdiction in the Western world of which I am aware.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many other things can be said about this. However, I think the best way the public assemblies law can proceed so far as these sorts of occasions are concerned is by this voluntary concept of prior notification not being reflected in the actual terms of the legislation, with the legislation itself simply being couched in such a way as to enable the police to deal properly and effectively with the mischief to which the limited participation concept is directed, the mischief being the possible provocation-response situation that can arise when groups with competing interests and beliefs mingle in a public demonstration. That is the mischief that has to be anticipated in legislation of this kind and it is proper that there be legislative guidelines to deal with that. </PARA>
<PARA> The failure of this legislation to deal with that kind of situation is the substance of my fourth and final objection to this Ordinance. Here I am referring to what I think is the extremely objectionable language of clause 24 of this Ordinance dealing with breaches of the peace, a section of the Ordinance which was manifestly designed to deal with the classic public order problem of provocation response-Orangemen versus Catholics on St Patrick's Day; Nazis and Jews perhaps, to take an example which was made notorious in London's East End in the 1930s and which provoked legislation there; Vietnam demonstrators and those supporting the Vietnam war, the kind of situation which for a time at least was relevant in public order law in the 1960s here in Australia; the RSL marches--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Black and white indeed, as Senator Button said. It has been a week for black and white matters of all kinds, and where more appropriate than here? A further example, of course, is RSL marches and the attempts to march of those who are likely, for good reason or ill, actually to offend the ranks of the RSL marchers in question. A legitimate public order problem has to be anticipated and, I think, has to be dealt with. But I think the way in which clause 24 deals with this is just outrageous because it makes explicitly criminal and subject to sanctions not only conduct which is motivated by an intention to cause a breach of the peace but also conduct which is merely likely to cause a breach of the peace, without more. Of course, as I argued in the context of last year's ordinance and as I will argue until I am red in the face in the context of this year's ordinance, that creates a situation in which a person, however benignly motivated and however anxious merely to express a point of view, who provokes an irrational, outraged response from an indignant RSL marche or anyone else can be hauled off and subject to criminal penalty. That is the way in which the Ordinance operates at the moment. It is manifestly unsatisfactory to the extent that that is so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It can be fixed up, as I would hope the Committee in its wisdom would have suggested, by adding additional criteria in those breach of the peace provisions to ensure that the conduct of the provocateur, if you like, is such as to be actually offensive and insulting and, more importantly still, to be objectively offensive and insulting. By the latter, I mean that a reasonable person-not just a person in the position of a peculiarly sensitive marcher-would be offended by it. If the Ordinance had in it language of that kind, which has become traditional in more enlighted public law legislation in various other jurisdictions, this problem could be cured. But so long as it remains uncured this Ordinance will create far more difficulties than it can solve. It will remain manifestly unacceptable by reference to any kind of enlightened civil libertarian principles and, I think, unworkable by reference to the public order principles that it is quite proper for the Australian Capital Territory authorities and the police force to want to be able to apply. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry that I have spoken rather longer than I intended to at this stage, but even so that has merely opened up the matter. I am delighted that Senator Lewis at least showed some superficial signs, whatever was going on inside his head-of which I am never quite sure-of listening intently to what I was saying. I hope that even Senator Lewis may not be beyond redemption so far as exercising some sensitivity in a civil liberties area is concerned. I hope that when we come to the more extended debate of this matter we will be able to approach it calmly and rationally and reach the conclusion, as a result, that this is an unacceptable Ordinance and must be disallowed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, not his getting 22 votes. The Ordinance of last year caused great division in the Canberra community, as Senator Lewis knows. Because the matter was debated in the national Parliament it caused divisiveness in the nation as a whole and, I believe, brought that precious and sacred day-Anzac Day -into disrepute. This year, instead of having the thing brought forward six months ago, as I understand it, the timetable was that it hit the House of Assembly in Canberra round about February. I regard it as almost unforgiveable that the Government and the Department of the Capital Territory should wait from April last year until February this year before bringing down an ordinance to control a march on Anzac Day. The Assembly, quite properly, believed there should be some public debate on it and it initiated some public debate. But the timescale precluded a proper debate and proper evidence being taken. In any event, finally the Assembly agreed by a small margin to reject the Ordinance, which again indicates its divisiveness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have great sympathy with the Returned Services League in wanting the march to be restricted to members of the RSL or to ex-servicemen. I am an ex-serviceman. I have marched in Anzac Day marches. Even though I did not see action or hear shots fired in anger, I would be offended if facetious people joined that march. I can understand the RSL's apprehension about it. It is different, although not excusable, for a returned soldier, who has seen comrades killed beside him or her, who has seen the actual horrors of war and who marches on a day sacred to him or her to remember his or her fallen comrades, to have that march intruded upon by other groups. I can understand that sort of reluctance on the part of people in the RSL. I have a personal view. I would not mind if Woman Against Rape or someone else, provided they were sincere, joined on to the rear of that march in which I was marching on Anzac Day. But, as I say, I did not suffer- thank God-the horrors suffered by some people in the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. On the other hand I have marched and I have been privileged to lead a number of anti-nuclear and anti-uranium marches. I would not have minded one scrap, in fact I would have welcomed, the pro-nuclear groups joining those marchers, carrying their banners and projecting their signs provided they did it in a peaceful and dignified way. As Senator Evans has said, if such a march were likely to cause an obstruction to traffic, the groups concerned should voluntarily advise the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police or whoever was responsible that they were going to do just that. That is my personal view. If we took a vote in this chamber I think that view would be shared by about half the honourable senators and the other half would be vigorously opposed to it. We are talking about something which is very controversial and very divisive . I think the Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Hodgman, should be condemned for waiting so long to bring before the Parliament such a controversial Ordinance for ratification. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly now to the Ordinance. There will be a vote on this matter next week. No doubt all honourable senators will be wanting to contemplate the pros and cons of this Ordinance and will be wanting to debate it more thoroughly. I join with my friend, Senator Evans, in saying that I find it particularly repugnant that the concept of a limited public assembly should be brought into legislation in the national Parliament. More particularly I find it disturbing that a police commissioner, honourable though he might be, broadminded though he might be, should be able to determine whether the purpose of an application to march in an Anzac Day march or any application to participate in a public ceremony is consistent with the purpose for which it was designed. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At that stage it becomes terrifying, not because sergeants or police constables are less intelligent necessarily than commissioners of police but, because of the reasons that Senator Evans gave, the power is delegated to whoever is on the beat to make an instant decision on the intentions of the person participating in the march. I think that is unfair to the officer and it is unfair to those people participating. I find even more offensive section 13.4 (c) of the report which states that the commissioner has a discretion as to whether there is any likelihood of serious public disorder. He has a discretion as to whether there is a likelihood, in his mind or in his delegate's mind, of serious public disorder. I need only mention that to send chills through any defenders of civil liberties in this country. If that precedent were established I believe it would be a most dangerous occurrence. One shudders when one thinks of how people such as Mr Russell Hinze, that champion of democracy in our northern State, might ask his police force to pursue that policy if that sort of ordinance were introduced by him in Queensland. It concerns me particularly that that kind of legislation could be introduced into the national Parliament without time for proper debate. As I have said, we will have further time, as I understand it, to debate this matter more fully tomorrow or next week. It is a pity that a decision cannot be reached before Anzac Day. I join with Senator Evans and other speakers and say that we hope that on Sunday no incidents of an unpleasant nature occur as a result of or caused by this Ordinance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There seems to be a fair amount of misunderstanding by honourable senators on the Opposition benches of the Australian Capital Territory Public Assemblies Ordinance that has been described in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. Senator Evans, Senator Ryan and Senator Chipp have all said that the time within which the Committee had to consider this matter was very short. That is not a fact. We first looked at the working paper on 22 October last year. I do not believe-I do not think anybody else would believe-that that could be considered a short time. We finally got the first draft on 18 February of this year. After all the work which had been done on the working paper after we had received the first draft I believe we were most of the way along the line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The public has been aware of this Ordinance since 26 February. Senator Ryan said that the public did not understand it and did not know about it. It has been very clearly put. Anyone wanting to march on Anzac Day has only to apply to have the details spelt out. It is like saying that people do not understand any other legislation and, therefore, the Government should not introduce it. That is a ridiculous statement. Anyone who does not understand this Ordinance has only to go to his parliamentary representative to have it explained. I am sure that Senator Ryan can cover that situation for those of her constituents who may wish to march. </PARA>
<PARA> There seems to be tremendous concern on the Opposition benches regarding the rights and the civil liberties of those who want to march on Anzac Day apart from the traditional marchers, apart from the men and women who served their country in time of war who, as Senator Chipp has said, saw the horrors of war and who march on a solemn occasion such as this. This is the traditional day on which they care to remember those who died beside them. Those are the people that honourable senators on the Opposition benches are not thinking about at all . They are interested only in those people who wish to march on that day for different reasons. Senator Evans in his arrogance stands up in this chamber and says that he is the only one in this place who is interested in civil liberties. That is a lot of rubbish. I am particularly interested in the civil liberties of those people who have traditionally marched on 25 April. Those are the people about whom we should be thinking. Members of other groups who wish to march for other reasons but who wish to be associated with those thoughts on war can pick another day. They can march in the evening, the early morning or at some other time that will not interfere with the traditional Anzac march. I have no sympathy for those sorts of people who try to enter this traditional march. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police has been ridiculed both by Senator Evans and Senator Chipp as not being the person who should make these decisions. I believe that the police Commissioner is the right person to make these decisions. If any group believes that he is not the right person or that he has not made a decision according to its liking it has the right of appeal to the court. There are certain criteria that the Commissioner must take into consideration. The court takes those same criteria into consideration when it is looking at an appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans said that there were three main areas which he found objectionable. The first was that the Legislative Assembly does not agree with this Ordinance. Traditionally the Legislative Assembly has not always had to agree with this place. This Senate is responsible for governing the Australian Capital Territory. We seek the opinion of the Legislative Assembly. We hope that it will be in agreement with us. But that has never been one of the reasons why we have said that we would not agree with it. We have never said that we would back down just because the Legislative Assembly did not agree with us. </PARA>

Secondly, Senator Evans said that as the Legislative Assembly was not in agreement it was all very complex and confusing. Senator Evans said that there is a cost of appeal. There is a cost of appeal. The Committee was concerned that the cost should not be too great. But there is always a cost in an appeal. It is something which one cannot get away from. He spoke then of limited participation and problems with identifying people. That underlines, probably more than anything, the fact that Senator Evans has not studied the Ordinance at all because he would not have been asking those questions if he had. Limited participation and how the people are identified is easily explained because the person putting in the request to march gives an estimate of how many people he intends to have marching in his group. He will be readily able to identify them. There is no particular problem in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Ryan, Senator Evans and Senator Chipp failed to come up with remarks about what they consider the Ordinance should do. I can only presume that they think it should be open slather. Senator Chipp ended by saying that we will not be able to debate this matter before the Anzac Day march and that he hoped that nothing untoward happens. If it were open slather everyone would be marching. The participation last time by the Women Against Rape organisation certainly offended the Returned Services League and many returned men and women. An open slather situaton could only create problems. I think Senator Chipp should understand that. Senator Evans did. He said that there should be some guideline, some indications. He suggested that at the most the police should be notified about who was going to march so that they could cope with the disruption and, perhaps, the violence that could occur if people with different opinions are allowed to march on the same day, at the same time and in the same procession. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen such violence occur in many cities in other countries. Fortunately we have not had a great deal of violence in Australia. There has been some violence in Sydney and Melbourne. We are trying in this place to avoid what happens overseas. Ten years ago there was never a thought in any Australian's mind that people would disrupt an Anzac Day march. Ten years ago thought was never given by any group to daring to march and upset the Anzac Day traditions. Times have changed. We now have radical groups which would like to march and upset the traditional Anzac Day service. I believe that it is the duty and responsibility of government to protect the right to march of people who fought in wars to protect our country. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Roads Grants Act 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that the Government made a commitment in June 1980 to provide grants totalling $3,650m under a five year roads program covering the period 1980-81 to 1984-85. </PARA>
<PARA> An allocation of $628m has already been provided in 1980-81 under the Roads Grants Act 1980. A further $685 million is currently being provided in 1981-82 under the Roads Grants Act 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before the Senate will enable grants of $734 million in 1982-83, $778m in 1983-84 and $825m in 1984-85 to be made available over the remaining years of the five year program. The Bill subsumes the amounts appropriated by the Roads Grants Act 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The amounts to be provided in the next three years involve annual increases of 7 per cent in 1982-83, 6 per cent in 1983-84 and 6 per cent in 1984-85. All States and the Northern Territory have been allocated corresponding annual increases in funding. As a result the 1981-82 funding relativities will be maintained through to 1984-85. </PARA>
<PARA> When determining the levels of funds to be provided under the five year roads program, the Government intended that the allocations would be firm and final amounts. The Government was not willing to encourage inflationary pressures by building into its expenditure programs open-ended commitments to meet unlimited future cost increases. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is increasing evidence becoming available that the Government's expectations in relation to future cost increases in the roads area are being exceeded. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau of Transport Economics has recently completed a report on the development of a national road construction price index. The report, which the Minister for Transport tabled on 17 March 1982, indicates that in recent years increases in Commonwealth road grants have not kept up with movements in road building costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the Government will be examining in the Budget context the scope for the provision of additional road funds. However, it is clearly not possible right now to say what might emerge from this. It needs to be recognised that the Government's deliberations on road funding have to be undertaken in the light of the need for continued overall restraint on the Budget and, within that, the competing funding demands of other Commonwealth programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill apportions between road categories on the same basis as in 1981-82 the funds to be provided in each of the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Commonwealth is not committed to maintaining the existing funding relativities indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA> For instance, a recently released Commonwealth-State officials study shows that there are major deficiencies in our National Highways system in all States. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the most pressing problems are in Queensland and New South Wales. The Minister for Transport recently had the opportunity to examine at first hand the state of the Bruce Highway between Rockhampton and Townsville. He has agreed to a Commonwealth and Queensland officials examination of the feasibility of a jointly funded project to bring the Bruce Highway to an acceptable standard within 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Explanatory Memorandum that has been circulated sets out in detail the features of the Bill. The conditions under which Commonwealth assistance is to be provided are identical to those in the Roads Grants Act 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I do not propose to deal further with individual sections of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter was the subject of some debate in the Senate yesterday. In the course of that debate, my colleague Senator Grimes moved that the Senate take note of the papers and the statement. I wish to move an amendment to that motion. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>At the end of the motion add:</PARA>
<PARA> ', and the Senate is of the opinion that a judicial inquiry should be established to inquire into and report on-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) whether the proper procedures were followed within the Bureau of Customs and at ministerial level to investigate the importation of the colour television set by the former Minister for Health in October last year and, if not, whether there was a cover-up;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) whether a junior officer was victimised for carrying out his duty, both at the point of Customs entry by the former Minister for Health and in the officer' s later complaint;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) what actions were taken by the Head of the Department in respect of all matters relating to the former Minister for Health and whether these actions were taken with the knowledge and approval of the Government;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) more generally, whether the Bureau is effective in performing its functions and the steps that need to be taken to ensure that it is an effective organisation and carries out its functions under the customs Act;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) whether any other Minister was aware or should reasonably have been aware of these matters and failed to take appropriate action.'</PARA>
<PARA>The matters which were raised yesterday in the Parliament were, as I think Senator Carrick appropriately put it today, matters of tragic concern to the two Ministers concerned. But they are also of grave concern to the community at large in respect of the procedures which were followed and the investigations which have been conducted into those procedures. What in fact has happened is that two ministers have resigned, presumably because they regard their conduct as reprehensible or because someone else regarded their conduct as reprehensible and inconsistent with the proper approach and standards which should be applied to Ministers. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has indicated that there will be a departmental inquiry into the procedures which were followed by the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs in relation to the Bureau of Customs . </PARA>
<PARA> A number of documents have been tabled in order to put the whole matter beyond doubt. The sad thing about the documents is that they do not put the whole matter beyond doubt. In advancing reasons why the amendment expresses the opinion of the Senate in relation to the establishment of a judicial inquiry, I will deal one by one with the questions which are raised in the paragraphs of the amendment. They go to the crux of the matter because they are questions which have not been answered by the Ministers' resignations, by the statement of the Prime Minister in which he indicated that an internal departmental inquiry will take place or by the tabling of the documents. In fact, there is some doubt whether all the documents have now been tabled. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. In the first of the reasons given for the establishment of a judicial inquiry, the question is raised whether proper procedures were followed within the Bureau of Customs to investigate the importation of the colour television set by the former Minister for Health. The answer to that question, if one can prejudge the findings of a judicial inquiry, is clearly no. The question is then asked whether there was a cover-up. It is not sought to have a judicial inquiry to determine whether there was a cover-up in order to pursue the two Ministers concerned. What is a matter of public concern is that this matter sneaked out publicly as a result of the statements of a particular Customs officer, both to the secretary of his organisation and to the Press, about what had taken place. Even at that stage, after those statements became public knowledge in the Press, there was a very considerable delay in order, in the words of one of the Ministers concerned, that they might determine the exact truth as to what had happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That course of conduct following Mr Mayhew's statements and so on revealed very simply that the procedures to which this part of the amendment refers were not clear. It was not clear precisely what happened. It is clearly suggested and in the minds of large sections of the public, one suspects, that there were attempts to cover up. In essence, apart from a number of details to which I shall refer, this set of documents amounts to the revelation of a tortuous bureaucratic process whereby a colour television became a black and white television. </PARA>

<PARA> Seantor BUTTON-That is what happened in these bureaucratic documents. It is a very interesting question as to who misled whom in that process. If one person has been consistent about the matter, it is quite clear that it is the Customs officer who originally had the conduct of the matter at the point of entry and who maintained that it was a colour television throughout.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps the word is 'mutation'. The colour television set became a black and white television set. That set of documents is extraordinary for that reason alone. We think there should be a judicial inquiry into the following of proper procedures or otherwise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second element is probably the most crucial of all. What emerges in the course of these documents is the very clear suggestion that a junior officer- this issue has not been resolved-was told to keep his mouth shut about the incident involving a Minister of the Crown. If that is the way the Public Service or any section of it operates, it ought to be horrifying to a parliament which talks about freedom of information legislation, for example. If a member of a government elite, a Minister of the Crown, is involved and a junior officer who tells the truth-perhaps the only person who did, if we look at this great book of documents-on the basis of his own empirical investigation of the matter, is victimised, that officer in his section of the Public Service is in the same situation as confronted Galileo. That is a most undesirable situation which ought to be the subject of judicial investigation.</PARA>
<PARA> The other comment I wish to make is that in that context, if a junior officer is victimised for telling the truth because the truth is unpalatable in respect of senior bureaucrats and a Minister of the Crown, an internal departmental investigation into that matter is not good enough because we will only lay ourselves open to a continuation of the same process. The third point, of course , is this: What actions were taken by the head of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs in respect of all matters relating to the Minister for Health and were these actions taken with the knowledge and approval of the Government? I do not think the answer to that question is revealed by these documents. It is a question which ought to be determined because the head of the Department is responsible for the activities of the officers of his Department, the procedures followed in the Department and for reporting to the Minister the truth in relation to those matters of fact which are relevant and the truth in relation to the procedures followed. I do not know whether a judicial inquiry might lead to this conclusion. I have a sneaking suspicion that one Minister was not told the truth. If that be so I think it ought to be a matter of public knowledge and judicially determined--</PARA>

It may be that that process will not result in anything to the detriment of the Minister concerned. Maybe it will result in something very much to his benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fourth point is whether the Bureau is effective in performing its functions to ensure that it is an effective organisation and carries out its functions under the Customs Act. Mr Deputy President, that very important matter of wider ramifications is being debated here and was referred to in the Senate at Question Time. It is a matter which I have raised in the Senate in the past. It was a matter of considerable concern to me in the month of January when I saw women with young children waiting for 3 1/2 hours to be cleared in a Sydney Customs area on a very hot day. That is a totally different issue but it goes to the administration of the Bureau of Customs and to the general desirability of investigating those many questions involved in dealing with passenger traffic at peak time, the hours worked and so on. All those issues go to the level of performance of the Bureau of Customs. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth point is whether any other Minister was aware or should reasonably have been aware of these matters and failed to take appropriate action. I suppose in a sense the Minister to whom that query is most appropriately directed is the former Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. There may well have been other Ministers who might have offered some advice in this matter , who might have been aware of the circumstances and who might have seen that appropriate action was taken before it got to the resignations of those two Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, I have not had the opportunity to peruse all the documents which were tabled yesterday. I am not even sure that they represent all the documents, but a number of issues I have seen have, quite frankly, been of considerable concern to me. They are documents relating to reports on the conduct of Mr Mayhew when he persisted with his allegations that it was a colour television set. These documents contain highly bureaucratic suggestions, the validity of which I have no idea. Mr Mayhew became very excited about the issue. He was in fact almost hysterical and unbalanced about it, but the fact remains that he was right. I think it is unfortunate that those sorts of documents should not be further investigated to find the facts of the matter in the interests of establishing a proper relationship between the various levels of officers in the Bureau and in the Department. I am particularly concerned about a report from the Senior Assistant Collector, Mr F. I. Kelly, to which I will refer briefly. That document states that Mr Bennett should be informed of these matters. I will refer to two of them. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr MacKellar has informed the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs that he imported a radio/cassette/black and white television combination unit on 5 October. Such a unit is admissible free of duty as part of the general concessions available to arriving passengers. </PARA>
<PARA>The next paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA>There can be no question of any inconsistency in application of the law to arriving passengers and V.I.P.'s;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) no further action is proposed. </PARA>
<PARA>In a sense that is a summary of what happened. No further action was proposed because there could be no question of inconsistency between the way in which ordinary citizens and VIPs are treated. That is the way the argument runs in this document. Of course, Mr MacKellar informed the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs that it was a black and white television. As I said earlier, these documents are about an extraordinary process by which people decide a colour television is black and white because there can be no question, in the words of that document, of different treatment of VIPs and ordinary citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are concerned about is that these issues should not lie about unresolved. If they lie about unresolved they will not go away and they will not lie about unresolved to the benefit of anyone-the officers of the Customs Bureau , the public servants involved or the two Ministers who resigned. I do not know what the truth is on all these matters. All I know is that, in moving this amendment to the motion moved by Senator Grimes that the Senate take note of the paper, the amendment being that in the opinion of the Senate there should be a judicial inquiry into a number of matters, we would like a resolution of some of these issues. </PARA>

That allegation is serious enough to warrant a judicial inquiry on the basis that the law, as established by the Parliament, has to be carried out without fear and favour and must be seen to be carried out in that way. We believe the population of Australia is entitled to have that particular item clear in its mind that there never has been, if that is the case , and never will be any favours given to people who hold public office in this country simply because they hold public office and that the law applies to them as it does to all other citizens.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He can defend himself very well indeed. I repeat that to understand this matter the then Secretary, in a minute to the Collector of Customs in all States, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has decided that all Australians on their return from overseas journey receive equal treatment in respect of the enforcement of the Customs and quarantine regulations. I have been instructed that all Federal and State parliamentarians (including Ministers of State), government officials, and notable Australian dignitaries of every description undergo the same Customs and quarantine formalities as other Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> This does not mean that our present procedures for processing passengers are to be varied, but it does mean that no special courtesies and facilities may still be granted to foreign dignitaries repeat dignitaries including passengers subject to diplomatic privilege. </PARA>
<PARA> This instruction is to be implemented immediately. If collectors feel there should be any variation the matter must be referred to me personally. </PARA>
<PARA>That minute originated because the Prime Minister had written a letter to originate it. I want to say here and now that that was the clear and unequivocal instruction of the Prime Minister and his Government. It has remained so and to the best of my knowledge and belief nobody has ever sought, at government level, to alter the thrust of that instruction. It is against that background that we look at this incident. An incident certainly occurred. It is not for me tonight to canvass all the details but an incident occurred, some details of which are established and that is, that the former Minister for Health, arriving at an early time at Mascot Airport, having had his luggage misplaced and delayed, presented a Customs clearance form which was wrongly filled in. It was not filled in by him; it was not signed by him. He took it to himself without inspecting it, but it was nevertheless wrongly filled in. That is admitted and accepted. </PARA>

The Government has announced that it believes that an inquiry should develop but it has not as yet come forward with the nature of the inquiry or the terms of reference and I am not in a position to indicate them. Nevertheless, the Government has been concerned that considerable discontent has been revealed within the Customs area with, particularly, allegations having been made by Customs officers concerning senior management and incidents arising out of those allegations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill in fact amends the parent Act, the Repatriation Act, in four respects and in doing so corrects four of the many anomalies which are contained in this complicated parent Act. The first amendment relates to the Government's attempt to provide equality of treatment for veterans suffering serious service-related mental illness as compared with veterans suffering other forms of war-related illness. The second amendment extends the repatriation benefits to Australian members of the Sinai peacekeeping force. The third amendment facilitates the Commonwealth's recovery of moneys expended on health care for repatriation patients eligible for workers compensation or third party payments. The last amendment is aimed at protecting from legal action employees in repatriation hospitals who have to carry out tasks specified by State laws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill corrects four anomalies in the repatriation legislation and these anomalies may be considered minor in that only a few hundred people are primarily affected by them. We support these measures but we intend to move an amendment in an attempt to correct further anomalies which also exist in the repatriation system in this country. We know that the Repatriation Act has a lot of difficulties and anomalies. What we should also be keenly aware of is the fact that too many of these are a direct result of successive conservative governments which were less anxious to care for those who returned from war than they were to send them off in the first place. Too many of the measures taken to correct these sins of omission are noteworthy for the miserable economy of their application in line with what has been a fairly parsimonious approach in paying a nation's debt to its ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen. </PARA>
<PARA> Three of the amendments that we propose tonight and which I will move deal with three anomalies which will be more than obvious to honourable senators in this place. The first would extend repatriation benefits for those Australians who served in peacekeeping forces prior to the Sinai. If we are prepared to provide repatriation cover for those who are serving in the Sinai force-we certainly should-it is surely equally appropriate to provide such benefits for those Australians who served in other peacekeeping forces prior to the Sinai. There were a surprising number of them and they should not be forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, as we have argued before and as I have moved before in this place, we believe the Government should extend eligibility for service pensions to allied ex-merchant mariners as it has previously extended service pensions to cover allied ex-servicemen and, more recently, to cover Australian merchant mariners who were in war zones. We suggest that there is no logical reason why allied merchant mariners should be denied this benefit, but this amendment was defeated in both Houses last year. We hope it will receive more favourable passage this time. </PARA>
<PARA> The third anomaly which we would seek to correct is the provision of equality of repatriation benefits between the veterans of the two world wars and the campaigns in Malaya and Vietnam. It is an extraordinary situation that our well- meaning repatriation system should provide different entitlements for Malaysian and Vietnam veterans. The differences between sections 6 (1), (4), (5) and (6) of the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act of 1962 and section 101 of the Repatriation Act of 1920 should not exist and, as these veterans are aging and increasingly more likely to seek claims for occurrences which arose out of war-caused disabilities, we believe that they, in fact, should receive the same treatment under the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe this is a sensible amendment. While we are devoting our attention to correcting anomalies percieved by the Government, let us do the right thing and correct anomalies which exist for other ex-servicemen, particularly those to whom I have just referred. Whilst the amendment the Government is proposing in respect of section 49 of the Act seeks to end the existing discrimination against veterans suffering service-related mental illness, it is significant that the repeal of section 49 was viewed with great suspicion by many of the totally and permanently incapacitated associations and other associated organisations in the country. I believe this amendment correctly ensures that the mentally ill veteran's pension and any accumulated money will become his property, as it is for any other veteran, and that in the event of his death, without recovering from his mental illness, his pension will be distributed according to his will or, according to intestacy laws if there is no will, rather than its being left simply to the discretion of the Repatriation Commission. In addition the trustee provisions have, on the surface of it, been improved. But this aspect of the legislation will require continuous review and will be watched by both the Opposition and, I am sure, by all veterans' organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> It would clearly be wrong, I believe, if we chose not to consider the reservations which have been brought to our attention by TPI members, especially as the speeches of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) are riddled with references to the importance of consultation with veterans' organisations in drawing up repatriation legislation. Both the Minister and I were privileged to attend the first national conference of ex-service organisations which was held in Canberra in August last year. This conference drew together some 50 veterans and dependants organisations to discuss their common concerns. One of those concerns, in fact, was to deal with the repeal of section 49. At that conference the following motion was passed:</PARA>
<PARA> That the action of the Lynch Committee in recommending the repeal of Section 49 of the Repatriation Act dealing with the transfer of pensions of veterans who are deemed incapable of managing their own affairs to the individual States, if accepted or implemented, be deplored and that any moves in this direction, either through Parliament or Regulation be publicly debated. </PARA>
<PARA>I was one person at that conference who expressed support in general for the repeal of section 49 and I certainly express it now. The fact that this motion was passed demonstrated the concern of these organisations that these few hundred veterans were to be left without proper support. As recently as last month, March, the issue was raised again at the Biennial Federal Congress of the Associations of TPIs in Canberra. The Minister and I were there and we were both questioned about the repeal of section 49. Again at this conference, concern was expressed about this proposal. As a result of this concern the Department and the Minister have reassured the TPI Association and the Returned Services League and have made what they believe and I believe to be satisfactory arrangements to cope with the new situation and, we hope, to provide for the future care of the unfortunate veterans concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> There are still those who are concerned that these veterans-admittedly, they are few-suffering from chronic mental disorders will not now be cared for as well as they have been in the past by being primarily the responsibility of State mental health authorities. We must be concerned to ensure that this is not so in the future, and be vigilant about it. My inclination is to take the attitude that the sooner we get rid of section 49 the better. I have made no secret in the past of the fact that I believe it to be an archaic provision, riddled with the particular injustices so frequently meted out in the past to the mentally ill in this country. It is in fact a discriminatory hangover from less enlightened days. I can appreciate the concern expressed by those members who in a very real way have represented over the years the best interests of all their disabled comrades, not the least their often forgotten mates in mental institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> In an attempt to establish the number of veterans directly affected by the proposals arising out of the review of government expenditure Senator Coleman asked at Senate Estimates Committee G in May of last year for figures over a five-year period and received a reply in the form of a table which I will later seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard. The numbers at 30 June 1980 totalled 477-141 in New South Wales; 207 in Victoria; 79 in Queensland; 12 in South Australia; 27 in Western Australia; and 11 in Tasmania. They are not large numbers but they are nonetheless important and, of course, deserve our protection. </PARA>
<PARA> The second anomaly corrected in this Bill relates to the direct collection by the Commonwealth from insurance companies of reimbursements for patients who are eligible for workers compensation or third party benefits. At present compensation can only be claimed directly from the injured individual and not from any third party. We agree with the proposal in the Bill that the Commonwealth should be able to recover those moneys directly from a third party, which is in most cases an insurance company. This is clearly a much more humane and sensible way of treating this issue, rather than having to put pressure on the injured person to pay money and leaving him or her with the responsibility of collecting it from the insurance company. Incidentally, it is likely to be a much more efficient way to collect money. We support these proposals. Similarly, we support the measure to protect repatriation employees in carrying out duties required by State law. A matter which comes to mind is the taking of blood alcohol tests from accident victims, which is a compulsory procedure in many States. People carrying out such work in repatriation hospitals need to be covered under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition obviously supports the decision embodied in the third amendment to the Act to provide repatriation cover for Australians serving with the Sinai peacekeeping force. Whatever our views on that involvement-they are similar to our views on Australia's earlier involvement in Vietnam -we nevertheless have the firm view that servicemen so deployed are entitled to cover, as they will be under this legislation. As I said in my earlier remarks, too often in the past we have been only too anxious to send troops away and not as anxious to ensure that they are adequately cared for on their return. It is unfortunately typical of this legislation that it has come before us only after the contingent has had time not only to settle in to the Sinai but also to be subjected to visits from Australian Ministers with all the grandstanding and the news coverage that such visits cause. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that at one stage it looked as though the current crisis in the Falkland Islands would involve Australian servicemen on exchange duties on British ships. The special and difficult position of our servicemen with the special Commonwealth training unit in Uganda serves to highlight the haphazard way in which this legislation deals with these groups of people who from time to time represent our country in such forces. It is very easy to commit a few troops as a goodwill gesture or for political purposes to some apparently harmless expedition designed to ingratiate Australia with other countries within the South East Asia Treaty Organisation or the Commonwealth, or occasionally far beyond any legitimate sphere of interest in an attempt to buy favours against an uncertain future. It has apparently been more difficult to cover those servicemen and to treat them with justice and compassion on their return. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year's amending legislation was designed to establish a mechanism whereby Australian representatives performing peacekeeping or other duties in areas outside Australia where a state of tension exists would be eligible for repatriation benefits. This extension was to apply only to those members with service after 1 November 1981. This then involved Australian peacekeeping forces serving in Kashmir, the Middle East and Cyprus because they all come under the umbrella definition of a peacekeeping force raised or organised by the United Nations or another international body. We found, of course, that members of the proposed Sinai force were not covered by this amendment, though all the signs pointed to their imminent involvement in the United States-sponsored peacekeeping venture. Thus, the legislation presently before us deletes the phrase to which I have just referred. I think it is symptomatic of the manner in which the Australian contingent was despatched that a definition could not be found to cover it at the point at which it left our shores. </PARA>
<PARA> The trouble with this amendment is that it does not cover services provided by earlier peacekeeping forces to which Australia has contributed. These forces include the Australian involvement in Indonesia between 1948 and 1951; the peacekeeping force in Korea after the armistice in 1953 to 1957; observer groups sent to India, Pakistan and the Middle East at various stages; and now, I believe, the training team in Uganda. It is because of this gross inequity in the treatment meted out to our differently designated returning servicemen that the Opposition moved, unsuccessfully, in the House of Representatives the amendment which I will move again tonight; namely, the extension of repatriation benefits to Australians who served in peacekeeping forces prior to 1 November 1981. Allied to this, we moved in the House of Representatives-I will do so again tonight-that equality of repatriation entitlements should be established among veterans of World War I, World War II, Malaya and Vietnam. I do not think these amendments go far enough. Like so many amendments in this place, they are largely an expression of a view of the Senate, but I think they are worth moving and worth supporting as a start towards correcting many of the anomalies which exist in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time of the notional debate which we held in this place on the commitment of Australian troops to the Sinai, much was made of the other recognised areas in which Australians had been deployed in peacekeeping and similar goodwill operations associated at various times with regional trouble spots. Yet few have been accorded the recognition they deserve in terms of public awareness for their contribution, specific repatriation or specific pension benefits, access to the defence service home loans or even, at times, full acceptance by the Returned Services League in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote as an example the case of the Special Royal Australian Air Force contingent which served in Ubon in Thailand in the 1960s. This seems to have been forgotten too easily by the public, the Parliament, the Repatriation Department and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The alarming aspect of the case of these veterans was that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in correspondence associated with the lack of recognition of that particular RAAF unit has admitted to a singular lack of awareness of the matters involved. He was unable to provide any satisfactory answer to the points raised in correspondence from people who served in the unit at Ubon. I am indebted to him for drawing this matter to my attention. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worthwhile going back to the parliamentary debates since 1956 and 1962 which saw the passage of the Repatriation (Far East Strategic Reserve) Act and the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act. The first related to services in a defined area, namely, services as part of the British Commonwealth Far East Strategic Reserve in Malaysia and Singapore. The second enabled appropriate repatriation benefits to be extended to members of the force serving in Vietnam. The legislation was to be applied immediately by a regulation to troops in Malaya serving in forward areas and to a comparatively small group then serving in an instructional capacity in the Republic of Vietnam and who, as we said then , might be exposed to some risk. One could say they were famous last words at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking on the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Bill in December 1962, at a time at which the RAAF unit was already serving in Thailand, the then Minister, Mr Swartz, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The basic principle of the Bill is that eligibility for war pension and associated benefits shall stem from an occurrence including the contracting of a disease, that happened during a period of the members service which exposed him to hazards beyond those of normal peacetime service. This was the principle adopted by the Repatriation (Far East Strategic Reserve) Act in 1956. </PARA>
<PARA>He summed up:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that members of the Australian forces who serve abroad and whose service involves some operational risk beyond that normally associated with peacetime service and the dependants of those members will receive pensions and associated benefits in respect of death or incapacity attributed to that service on broadly the same basis as that on which benefits are available under the Repatriation Act to ex-servicemen of the two World Wars and the Korean and Malayan operations and their dependants. </PARA>
<PARA>At that time Labor's Les Haylen stated:</PARA>
<PARA> This group of measures is designed to ensure orderly control of repatriation procedures and I can see the wisdom of this, for there ought to be a guide for the future. A pattern should be laid down for service abroad in these special strategic and other forces so that in future new measures will not have to be introduced to deal with situations as they develop. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest this was a valid comment in 1962, 10 years after our Korean involvement and on the threshold of Vietnam. It is even more valid 20 years later and several more overseas service decisions later. An RAAF contingent, the 79 squadron, was stationed at the Royal Thai Air Force base at Ubon between 1961 and 1966, in response to a Thai Government request made from one South East Asia Treaty Organisation member nation to another because of the concern with the Laotion border situation. The conditions under which that squadron served were certainly not normal peacetime conditions and there is no doubt that their health and safety were at risk. It seems that the Government believes that the RAAF Squadron was on some sort of tropical joyride. The contingent got no recognition, despite engendering respect and goodwill. Its members are ineligible for war service home loans and have limited access to the benefits provided for other members who served overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian base at that time was guarded by armed Thai service guards as were the airstrip, the hangars and the reservement areas. The RAAF service police, the United States Air Force and Thai service personnel carried out armed patrols during the evenings to protect the contingent from local insurgents. All rostered personnel were issued with arms. Living and working areas were punctuated with dugouts and sandbag shelters. Elevated buildings had wire mesh screens to prevent missiles being thrown under them. The RAAF accommodation was within 100 metres of the airfield perimeter and within 200 to 300 metres of the airstrip itself. They suffered, therefore, under conditions of considerable noise, especially when the United States Air Force was operating from this area. To all intents and purposes, they were in a war zone. I believe they should be more than considered for full benefits as other groups should have been in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as RAAF personnel find it hard to accept the fact that their Ubon duty is regarded as nothing very special, so too do allied ex-merchant mariners wonder at the injustice that now denies them a benefit available to their merchant mariner colleagues in Australia and in fact other allied ex-servicemen in Australia. The benefit was first extended to Australian merchant mariners who served in a theatre of war. I remind the Minister of his astonishing claim in response to a question at the time that nobody had asked for it to be extended to allied ex-servicemen. This is an extraordinary claim when one reads the continual correspondence which came from merchant mariner organisations. These men and women were certainly not members of the forces but many of them suffered and worked under conditions which were far more severe than any members of the forces. Allied merchant mariners also served in the convoys, lighthouse tenders, pilot ships, hospital ships and troop transports under considerably difficult conditions. No Australian wanted to know their nationality when they were part of the struggle for freedom. It is churlish, I believe, to single them out because of their nationality or where they came from at the time, when providing these benefits quite correctly to other Australian ex-merchant mariners. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope this part of the amendment will encourage people to vote for the whole amendment. When I started my speech, I mentioned that we have no reason to oppose the amendments that are made to this legislation. We certainly agree with the principles of the four basic sections of this Bill. We believe other sections of the repatriation legislation in this country need looking at. We believe, and have expressed the view many times in this place, that the repatriation legislation is excessively complicated and is hedged about with excessive conditions. Mr Justice Toose in his very lengthy inquiry pointed out that the legislation needs considerable amendment. Conditions do change for veterans as they age. The nature of the conditions and the proportion of the different types of conditions that they suffer from do change from time to time. The legislation certainly needs changing in line not only with the changing conditions of the veterans but also with our views on how they should be treated . </PARA>
<PARA> It is for this purpose that we will continue to move amendments of the type that we have moved. I note, in passing, that the scrutiny of bills report has two complaints about this legislation. We may discuss those in the Committee stage. The Opposition cannot see that any good purpose will be served by amending the legislation in line with those two relatively minor considerations which were brought up by that report. I will be interested to hear the Minister' s views on what he and the Government think of that report. I repeat: We support the legislation. I move the amendment in the hope that the Senate will, by merely expressing a viewpoint on this matter, go some way towards further improving this legislation and further improving the lot of our war veterans in this community. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add '', but the Senate is of the opinion that the Bill should provide for:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) repatriation benefits for those who served in peacekeeping forces before 1 November 1981;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) eligibility for service pensions for all allied ex-merchant mariners as is provided for Allied ex-servicemen; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) amendment to the Repatriation Act 1920, and related Acts, to provide equality of repatriation entitlements as between veterans of World War I, World War II, and the conflicts in Malaya and Vietnam, as is presently provided for World War II veterans under section 101 (1) (B) of that Act.''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Senate tonight is again debating amendments to the Repatriation Act to which the Australian Labor Party has moved an amendment as an attachment to the motion that the Repatriation Amendment Bill be read a second time. As has already been said, the Repatriation Amendment Bill deals with a range of items probably the most contentious of which deals with the repeal of section 49. This has caused some considerable concern within the veteran community. The particular proposal when it was first mooted appeared in an unlikely place, that is, in the report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the so-called Lynch committee report. The Government has said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the Government intends to abolish deductions for maintenance that currently reduce the veteran's pension by half and to hand control of the disability pensions of these veterans over to the State authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>It is true that this had previously been mooted by the Government. But raising the matter in a hard fashion in the Lynch report, I think, gave rise to serious disquiet amongst the various veterans' organisations that the Government was about to undertake an exercise to save money in relation to veterans' affairs. I believe that was unfortunate because, as it transpired, the intentions of the Government were nothing of the sort. Indeed, that concern was ill-founded. Nevertheless, that concern was there. </PARA>
<PARA> Since that time I and, I imagine, other senators and indeed the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner), have had considerable correspondence and discussions with various groups, particularly with the totally and permanently incapacitated pensioners' associations. The major concerns, I think, of those groups stem from the fact that they work very closely with their veteran friends on a voluntary basis. Indeed, the TPI associations in Australia are the groups which visit mental hospitals, which visit their former comrades and which assist their wives or children in what would be an extremely difficult period for anybody in the community but more so for these particular people because of their often advanced ages. Those people who give voluntarily of their time, their energy and their efforts, I believe, have shown themselves to be exceedingly worthwhile members of the community. They are people who, not only in their previous service to the community in the armed forces but also now in their service to their previous comrades, have shown that the dedication that they had previously has not died. Therefore, it concerns me greatly in meeting those people that they have had that worry imposed on them. This is of extreme concern to me. Indeed, only three weeks ago I met such a group. The people were still at that stage very disturbed. </PARA>
<PARA> Since that time the Minister, I acknowledge, has been at great pains and has spent some considerable time to allay their fears. Indeed I have had, and I am sure the spokesperson from the Labor Party has similarly had, correspondence from the associations to say that the Minister has now completely satisfied them on all accounts and has given them his personal assurances in relation to the supervision that he will have over how this piece of legislation is implemented. I would be grateful if the Minister in his reply conveyed to the general public the import of those discussions that he has had and the types of assurances that he has given to the veterans. I believe that many veterans in Australia would be pleased with the type of discussions that he has had. </PARA>
<PARA> The type of problems that originally arose in relation to this, I think, were and still are of concern. They involve the care and welfare of the seriously mentally ill in this community insofar as they come under the Repatriation Act. The problems differ considerably from State to State. My own State of Queensland is not a shining example in terms of its legislation for the treatment of the mentally ill. Indeed, I believe it has on its statute books some of the worst laws in the Western world in relation to the mentally ill. I was very pleased to see within the last week that the Queensland Minister responsible for this area has indicated that he will be introducing legislation into the State House which will comprise a fairly massive review of these archiac laws. I believe that also will satisfy the veterans' associations in my State as to the future treatment of the mentally ill ex-Service people. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise a couple of issues which arise in the Minister's second reading speech alluding to a particular point on how this Bill will operate. I hope that we will have some elucidation on this matter when the Minister replies. The second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that upon repeal of section 49, the accumulated moneys of these veterans will be transferred to the trusteeship of the Repatriation Commission under regulation 9 of the Repatriation Regulations or, if it is thought that the veteran is able to manage for himself, his pension will be returned to him with the interest earned. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not at all sure as to the meaning of that last section of the speech. Indeed, under the current regulations and current operation of the Act I was under the impression that if a veteran was indeed able to manage for himself or herself he or she had the pension returned. Since last year when the deductions for medical costs ceased that would have been the total amount received. In other words, if the veteran was capable of looking after his or her own affairs he or she would be able to look after his or her affairs. I am not quite sure whether that phrase means anything more than that, in other words, that the status quo might prevail. That matter has been expressed to me with some concern by a number of veterans. I would be pleased if the Minister would say that it means nothing more than retaining the status quo. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point I raise is the agreement that has been reached with five States on the proposed arrangements and the replies from the other State. I notice that in the debate in the House of Representatives it was suggested by way of interjection, I think, that the other State was Queensland. By way of another interjection it was suggested that it was not. I wonder whether the Minister would say what problems have been run into with the other State, whether they have been solved and what type of agreement has been reached with the State if it goes beyond any of the parts which are alluded to in the amending Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the amendment moved by the Australian Labor Party. I certainly concur with the points raised by Senator Grimes in his speech. The Australian Democrats will be supporting the amendment. I draw particular attention to paragraph (2) of the amendment which refers to the eligibility for service pensions of allied ex-merchant mariners. Although the motion does not say so it of course concerns allied ex-merchant mariners who are resident in Australia, most of whom are Australian citizens. The last time this matter came before the Senate the Government was congratulated for extending the benefits to Australian ex-merchant mariners. At that time it was said that they ought to be extended to allied ex-merchant mariners. Perusing that debate again, I can see no reason advanced by the Government for not doing that other than the monetary problems involved. Looking into it, I do not see that the problems are of such an extensive kind as to warrant the continuation of the denial of a pension to those allied ex-merchant mariners. There seem to be few people involved. Their claim, I believe, in terms of the operation in service, is as strong as that of Australians. It would carry a great deal of weight if we were to recognise the type of service provided to Australia by our allies during the war, particularly if those allies have since become residents of this country. It seems to me that war, although extremely costly in its operation, is probably more so subsequently. The picking-up after a war is necessarily of great expense to a country. I believe that the proposition that has been put forward, that those allied ex-merchant mariners ought to be provided for, is a reasonable one. </PARA>
<PARA> The other two items, I believe, speak for themselves-particularly the delay in the granting of pensions to members of peacekeeping forces. Those who served in them prior to 10 November 1981, although they are currently provided for under alternative legislation, ought to be brought under the same Act. That would be a cleaner and, in the long run, a preferable proposition. I remind honourable senators of the enormous problems which still exist in the changing of various Acts mid-way. We still have floating around-I hope it will be brought forward before too long-a further discussion of the relationship between the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits schemes. The type of problem that has arisen ought to be prevented in any other area, if at all possible. I believe that the Labor Party's proposed amendment, if taken up in legislative form by he Government, would in the long term cause the country fewer problems than would the keeping of the division we currently have before us. I believe that the last proposal is perfectly reasonable. The flux of time since World War I and World War II provides the justification for amendments to the Act. The same type of spirit could very well prevail now in relation to the veterans of the Malayan campaign and also of Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer finally to the two proposals brought to the Senate's attention by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. I believe that probably the best place to discuss those would be at the Committee stage of this Bill. I indicate that, for our part, we would have preferred some alteration in line with the Scrutiny of Bills Committee's recommendation that the calculation of costs be done in actuality rather than by a written instrument of the Repatriation Commission, thereby alleviating possible duplication in court. However, there does not seem to be sufficient support within the Senate to bring that suggestion forward. I believe that the Minister will be alluding to that matter later. We will be listening to the Minister's summing up of the second reading debate to see whether there is any need for further action. The second recommendation of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is an extremely fine one which is well worth bringing forward but which would be extremely difficult to implement. Therefore, we have not proposed at any stage to undertake any action in relation to that particular item. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole area of veterans' affairs is an extremely difficult one. I do not think that anyone really envies the Minister's position terribly much in the operation of his portfolio. It is not one which can be administered in the same way as other portfolios. It has to be administered with an extraordinary amount of care and concern for people. Any amendments, before their introduction, ought to be canvassed, as far as is humanly possible, with all relevant associations and not simply with the high profile associations. In this case a lot of the concern that was expressed by many honourable senators in this chamber could have been alleviated if further consultation had taken place with those associations. I hope that in relation to future amendments to the Repatriation Act-I am quite sure we will be having them from time to time-the type of consultation which the Minister has undertaken extensively with this Bill will be continued and perhaps improved. The Australian Democrats will be supporting the second reading of this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's piecemeal approach to anomalies and inadequacies in this legislation provides us with added opportunities upon which to draw attention to the extraordinarily blase approach by the Government to the plight of Vietnam veterans and others who have served their country in wars in days gone by. The amendments proposed by my colleague Senator Grimes are eminently sensible ones and have been very thoroughly canvassed, I believe. It is interesting to note that in relation to the second amendment, which refers to allied merchant marine personnel, there was a very positive response from nine Liberal and National Country Party members of the House of Representatives. I have no doubt that at least a few honourable senators opposite wrote to the organisations which circularised all parliamentarians some months ago soliciting support for this measure. Needless to say, none of the nine Liberal and National Country Party members of the House of Representatives was prepared to make the extreme sacrifice of crossing the floor when the vote on the Opposition's amendment was taken. Like the sea lord in HMS Pinafore, they voted at their party's call, and never thought of thinking for themselves at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The system of dealing with claims from veterans is obviously totally inadequate . At January 1982 there was a backlog of 17,000 claims awaiting hearing by the Repatriation Boards and some of those claims will not be heard for 12 months unless there is a drastic change for the better in the operations of the Boards. The Repatriation Review Tribunal has 9,000 claims awaiting hearing and a further wait of 12 months for some of the people involved with those claims is inevitable. A variety of reasons can be provided for these delays, some of which are inevitable-lack of foresight, lack of planning and lack of departmental awareness of a reasonable expectation of increases with the aging population of veterans and recent decisions which open up possibilities for those who previously considered themselves hopeless cases. Surely any department with a reasonable approach to the position would have realised that there would be an increasing number of claims, and provision would have been made for dealing with them. Vietnam veterans and their families, despite the prevarication and procrastination of this Government, still believe that they are entitled to a decent and fair deal from the repatriation authorities of this country in whose service they fought. Many of us agree that Vietnam veterans were exposed to an environment in which their health was endangered and their peace of mind shattered. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) has sought time after time to minimise the number of people affected. He spoke last week of a very small number of veterans with severe problems. The Vietnam Veterans Association was incensed to the point where it accused the Minister of totally misrepresenting the situation. With completely justifiable indignation the Vietnam Veterans Association issued a Press release which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Vietnam veterans are horrified at the very serious claims reportedly made by Veterans' Affairs Minister, Senator Messner, yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> He apparently claimed that only a minute number of veterans had severe problems . </PARA>
<PARA> Any reasonable person reading the Australian article (1st Edition, 16 April 1982, page 2) could only assume that Vietnam veterans were drunken, anti-social malingerers and lunatics. </PARA>
<PARA> The VVAA refutes this suggestion and calls on the Minister to clarify his position and state whether he was correctly reported. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister released certain statistics which apparently show a very small number of veterans with severe problems. He has ignored his own Department's figures (given to the Senate Committee in December 1981), which show that, to October 1981, approximately 17,200 claims had been made. </PARA>
<PARA>As far as I am aware up to this point the Minister has not clarified his position or stated whether he was correctly reported. Perhaps he will take the opportunity this evening, if necessary, to set the record straight. From the 53, 000 Vietnam veterans in this country there have been 17,200 claims-approximately one in three veterans had claimed at that point in October 1981. The third of the counselling centres-those jewels in the cardboard crown of the Minister-was opened in Perth last week. Despite a statement by the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr Thomson, that only 63 veterans had visited counselling centres in Sydney and Adelaide-that statement was made early in March this year-the Vietnam Veterans Association information was that by then these centres had been consulted by over 340 clients and were having trouble handling the work load. Already they were seeking more staff. In Adelaide that centre was seeing 10 people a day. There is a clearly demonstrated need for a much more broadly structured counselling service-advice which was rejected by the Minister at the time the service was in the planning stages. </PARA>
<PARA> Experience in my electorate leads me to believe that amongst the wives and families of Vietnam veterans there are very many who are intensely cynical about the degree to which there is any real intention to provide other than superficial assistance. It was with some disappointment that I found the newly opened Perth counselling centre clinical and impersonal. Worse than that, the three staff members, all excellently well-qualified, sensitive and compassionate people, are male. I was assured that the sessional doctor to be employed-a part time doctor-would be a woman. I hope very much that this will be the case. I urge the Minister to make certain that women are employed in the counselling services. I am not denying the fact that there are very many men counsellors who , as I have described the Perth employees, are extremely appropriate for these positions. But I believe that where the clientelle will be substantially the wives and families of Vietnam veterans a great deal more needs to be available than the average, well-qualified male counsellor. </PARA>
<PARA> Lack of humanity and compassion have been the hallmarks of the treatment of too many returned servicemen. As Anzac Day 1982 approaches I hope that it will be possible to achieve a few more amendments than those proposed by the Government which will perhaps make life a little more tenable for many of those who have survived wars only to find that the peace was a great deal more trying than actual warfare. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I propose to speak for a reasonably brief period. I commence by saying that I support in toto the amendment moved in the other place, and moved in the Senate by Senator Grimes. I believe that the provision of those things that have been spelt out by Senator Grimes in his amendment are as urgent as many other benefits that should be applicable to ex- service people who have served in any war. It is true, as one of my colleagues said in the other place, that there is an excellent system of repatriation benefits but every so often weaknesses surface. I know that these amendments in fact set out to correct some of the three or four anomalies but there are other anomalies that also need correcting. The World War II table of repatriation benefits is probably the most comprehensive table within the British Commonwealth. We must remember that this system was initiated by a Labor government. Not only did it include compensation for those injured in war time but also it made provision for the training of ex-service persons, both male and female, so that they might properly fit into the community again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose one of the good things about this system was the fact that if one was a certain age when one enlisted one automatically became entitled to those training schemes. On the other hand, of course, if one were severely wounded and unable to return to one's former occupation then one would receive the same entitlement to be trained in another trade or profession. Generally speaking at that point the repatriation system was working fairly smoothly. But after 1949 there were continuous attempts to erode many of the benefits. The situation has never been worse than it is at present. I realise that because of the Government 's inability to control the economic situation or even to make it operate smoothly it is endeavouring to pick up every spare dollar it can, often at the expense of ex-service persons. But this system was set in train long before this Government came to office in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1973-74 the Australian Labor Party set out to do some catchup work on the years of neglect prior to that period. This included such things as the picking up of the lag in the pensions of those persons who had been injured in war time and who were in receipt not of a full pension but the general pension or a part of the general pension. The Government, because of inflation and its neglect to catch up, has now indexed pensions to a certain degree. But that was not the case in those days. It was not the case until the Labor Party came into office. At the time of our dismissal from office we were looking at the possibility of picking up also the lag in the payments to dependants of wounded ex-service persons. Unfortunately, we went out of office before that situation could be corrected. We had hoped that this Government-we have encouraged it to do so- would look at that situation. But for a period of over 20 years there has been no catchup at all in that area. Today it would cost the Government very little money because most of the World War II and Korean veterans have grown families. In terms of cash a very small amount would be required to catch up on payments or just to bring the payments up to current monetary values for the dependants of ex-service persons. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is significant that when there is a smell of war in the air the conservative element of society-that includes the conservative parties in this Parliament-has a tendency to do all the flag waving and all the cheering to the troops going away to war in the same way as we did to those troops going to the Vietnam war. When we had a lottery system of selecting conscripts members of the then government, who are now in government again, used to celebrate with cocktails and morning and afternoon teas as they drew out the lottery numbers to send another lot of conscripts away to the hopeless Vietnam war. But it was significant, because it was never a declared war, that a very great number of those people were not entitled to any repatriation benefits, nor were they entitled to war service homes or any of the other sorts of fringe benefits to which ex-service people are normally entitled. I had a relative who served as a sailor. He did not become eligible for a war service home until about his fourth trip into the war zone. He happened to be serving on an Australian Navy vessel that was accidentally bombed by the Americans. He came under fire-not by the enemy but by one of the Allies-quite accidentally. He then qualified because in that engagement one person was killed and several persons were injured. </PARA>
<PARA> That is an example of the sort of ad hoc way that we participated in the Vietnam war. We kept pouring people into that war. A lot of people in this country made a fortune out of the Vietnam war. I remember reading in this chamber one night a list of three or four pages of companies which were involved in selling war materials. Some of our primary products were being laundered through Czechoslovakia and other countries so that they could go to the so- called enemy and keep up the enemy's strength to shoot down our people. That shows the immoral sort of way that conservative parties and conservative societies approach war generally. It is not changing. </PARA>
<PARA> The agent orange debate has been going on for a very long time. The Government set up an epidemiological survey. Honourable senators on this side of the House said at the time that that was not the answer. We said that a judicial inquiry was the answer so that all the facts could come out. That is a long time ago now . Finally, the Government abandoned the survey because it realised, after spending all that money, that it was not worth while. A Senate committee came up with some propositions which the Government has ignored. In the meantime, Vietnam veterans are still suffering. Many cannot work. Many of them have broken domestic lives. Families have divided and broken up. The young people, as they were then, who served in Vietnam knew they were being affected by something but were told on the ground that agent orange and the other herbicides being used were quite harmless as long as they took certain precautions. In many instances, of course, they were sprayed without being told that the herbicides were dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA> The same thing happened to people associated with radiation fallout at the bomb test sites in this country. Some of those people were servicemen, others were civilian employees. I know of one case of which, I think, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) is aware. We have endeavoured to chase up witnesses to this case. They are all prematurely dead from cancer. I have had some dealing with the Minister about a man at Esk in Queensland who has been ill for a long time. The Minister's office is treating him as something less than a human being. After years of unemployment and ill health he was finally granted a pension late last year. From memory he was granted a totally and permanently incapacitated pension. He wrote to the Repatriation Review Tribunal and said that he thought that that was fair enough. The man was so ill at the time that he was really incapable of writing a letter to anybody. I was distressed to find that the Minister's private secretary wrote back to this man after he applied for the pension to be made retrospective for a greater period and quoted the letter that the man had written to the Tribunal as vindication for not backdating the pension. </PARA>
<PARA> I think one of the big problems with these matters is the lack of humanity in dealing with people who are, in many instances, seriously ill. In some cases the illness might be a psychiatric one. Whatever it is, it is the sort of thing that ought to be treated with a great deal more humanity, softness and compassion than some people in the Department have a tendency to show. I realise that responsibility for a lot of this must fall back onto the Minister. He must ensure that his Department deals with a case in such a way that if there is any doubt at all the veteran should have the advantage of that doubt. They are not getting that today. The holdup in grants for war service homes is absolutely shocking. Many Vietnam veterans and their young families cannot possibly wait for a year or more just to get a loan to establish their first real home. They cannot afford bridging finance because the economy is now out of control and interest rates are so high, so they have to continue living in caravans and sub- standard accommodation. These are some of the things that are referred to in the Opposition's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the Opposition was opposed to Australia's involvement in a private war in Vietnam. It meant the loss of many thousands of lives. It meant that many thousands of people, both Americans and Australians, were injured. More sophisticated countries did not get involved. Great Britain would not be talked into becoming involved in that war under any circumstances. The big problem with the Australian Government is that it needs to talk up wars. That is one of the ways, I suppose, of overcoming the economic ills. It happened in World War I and it happened in World War II. It happened to a lesser degree with the Korean war and it happened to some degree with Australia's involvement in the Vietnam war. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment the establishment of this country and of the Western world generally needs another war. Metal prices have fallen drastically. I suppose some people in this country hope-certainly the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser ) has given full approval-that confrontation will take place over the Falkland Islands issue. I am surprised that Australia has not committed some servicemen to that confrontation. It is almost laughable that it takes almost three weeks even to get anybody into the so-called territory that Britain allegedly owns in order to have a confrontation. Australia has committed its servicemen to the Sinai peacekeeping force. This will be shown in the future to be a wrong political decision. The fact is that it is not a United Nations peacekeeping force; but another private peacekeeping force. </PARA>

If he were old enough he would not have believed in the League of Nations. He is young enough to have gone to Vietnam but did not bother to go because it was much more comfortable at home. But he sent his brothers, cousins and neighbours to Vietnam. Now, of course, he wants to abolish the United Nations, which is the only organisation in the world that might be able to make some contribution to peace generally. I am tired of the hawks in the establishment who keep on with this sort of rubbish . They are prepared to commit everybody else to a war while they make profits. I am surprised that Senator Thomas has committed himself publicly as one of those hawks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The onus is now on the Government of Senator Thomas. People such as Senator Thomas committed these people to the Vietnam involvement but they were never prepared to call it a war. Now they are taking away any benefits they can. The servicemen of this country are entitled to make their positions a profession if they choose. The Government is making it extremely difficult for the regular soldier and other regular servicemen. I may not be speaking to the amendment but the fact is that we are now buying an aeroplane that we may never get. We have bought an aircraft carrier that cannot carry aeroplanes. We are committing it to service in the Falkland Islands area. A couple of well placed mortar bombs would probably put it out of action. I hope it is well insured. There is no live ammunition for carrying out proper manoeuvres. We have become almost a laughing stock because we find when manoeuvres are being held that the supplies of ammunition for the year have run out. The soldiers cannot even be trained with live ammunition. </PARA>
<PARA> The radar system in Darwin closes down at 5 o'clock every Friday afternooon. If somebody wanted to invade the northern parts of Australia they would merely have to find out when there will be a public holiday or weekend. They could then bring their planes in as high or as low as they wanted and they would not be picked up by the radar system The Government has private mercenaries running a surveillance system around Australia. I happened to be present in discussions with a person occupied in this surveillance scheme. He said: 'We are going back to Cairns this afternoon. There is a beer party in Cairns and we have decided that we are not going to finish our run'. The Government is paying many millions of dollars for that sort of surveillance. A series of navy vessels is currently being manufactured. After the design was approved, it was found that they were too heavy and would fall over sideways. I do not know what sort of corrections have been made but in any case there are not enough vessels. The Taiwanese, the Indonesians-anybody at all-can come in and wreck the reef. The can send one decrepit old boat through a hole in the reef. A patrol boat can race out to arrest it but it takes three days to get back to the coast and another three days to go back to the reef. In the meantime 20 other ships have come in, wrecked that part of the reef, collected their clam meat and gone. The defence system is a laughing stock. </PARA>
<PARA> If one wanted to go into all the details there would be a chance for a debate about the defence facilities of this country. The Government is unwilling to allow a first class debate about the defence of the country because it knows it does not have any. It tries to cover up with all sorts of smokescreens. I suppose that the Canberra bombers are the best aircraft we have. They are now being phased out instead of perhaps being dressed up. The Government cannot afford to buy the type of plane that is needed. The F111, which the Labor Government finally had to pay for, was a long ranging blueprint. The late Athol Townley was sent to the United States in 1963 by Sir Robert Menzies, who said to him: 'Buy planes quickly because the Commies are coming-they are, they are!-and we have to beat them'. The Government, because of the F111s and, earlier, the Petrov affair, was able to save its political bacon. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the amendment which has been moved. I hope that the Government, before it calls a double dissolution or whatever it intends to do, and before it sacks the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen)-I understand he will be promoted to the position of Speaker of the House of Representatives until the Government puts him out to grass in a diplomatic position-will take notice of the situation and do something about it. The veterans have served in every war and they ought to be given a fair go. It is all very well to be patriotic and flag waving when a war starts but for God's sake, they are entitled to the justice that they and their families have earned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before coming to the main substance of what I intend to say tonight, I will attend to one or two points made by Senator Grimes and Senator Macklin in the course of their remarks. Both honourable senators drew attention to the problem of the repeal of section 49 of the Repatriation Act and some of the difficulties which some groups of ex-servicemen in the community have in understanding that move. I refer in particular to Senator Macklin's remarks. He realised that there was indeed a very real attempt by the Government to consult with organisations in this regard. In fact, it was only in the last few weeks that I had the opportunity to finalise arrangements with the totally and permanently incapacitated group in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This area is quite complicated. Both speakers correctly drew attention to the fact that totally and permanently incapacitated people would not be disadvantaged in any way by the passage of this legislation. In fact, they would be greatly advantaged. To confirm that remark, I will read into the record a passage from a letter that I have received from the Australian Federation of Totally and Permanently Incapacitated Ex-servicemen and Women, signed by the Secretary-Treasurer of that organisation, Mr P. G. Maley, J.P. I refer to the third paragraph of that letter, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> We were uncertain as to the allocation of funds that we thought may have accrued, and which if they were to be disbursed we felt should go to some worthy Veteran cause. However, it is now clear that the only funds held by the Department are in trust for the affected Veterans and when paid to the appropriate State Public Trustees will be solely available for the needs of the veteran in whose name it has accumulated, and must be paid to the Veteran if he recovers. If the Veteran dies, the normal inheritance laws prevail and the estate is disbursed accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out that clearly that organisation understands the situation now and is in support of this legislation. Senator Macklin referred to one other point which needs some attention. He said that there will be a need for the Department of Veterans' Affairs to monitor the administration of these funds by the public trustees in the various States. I give him my assurance that I will ensure that the Department undertakes that job diligently and, if there are any difficulties in the administration of the funds by the various States, other satisfactory arrangements will be made for the veterans. Senator Grimes mentioned the Ubon force. This is a matter of some complexity. The nature of the problem has its origin in the definition of the theatre of war and the difficulties with that definition. I undertake to look at the matter again and to communicate directly with Senator Grimes on it. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to respond to some of the matters that have been raised during the debate on this Bill not only in this chamber but also in the House of Representatives. It has been many years since repatriation has attracted as much attention in the Parliament, the Press and the public forum as has occurred in recent months. For many years repatriation has been smooth flowing with no need for major changes of direction or any particularly deep questioning of its role. Over the last couple of years when considerable media attention has been given to Vietnam veterans and their problems, there has been considerable questioning of the role of the repatriation system; and there have been challenges to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Federal Court of Australia and the High Court of Australia. These have led to a greater degree of soul searching than has occurred in the repatriation sphere for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> The repatriation legislation provides for a comprehensive compensation scheme to pensioners and treatment for all veterans who suffered incapacities related to their service and to dependants of those veterans who have given their lives in the service of the country. In addition to this compensation scheme, a wide range of welfare benefits is provided to veterans and their dependants irrespective of service-related conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Behind this repatriation scheme is a philosophy that was introduced in 1914 when the first wounded soldiers returned to Australia. There is an historical tradition to compensate those who have served, to meet with care and financial assistance those who answered the call. The philosophy is no less valid now than when it was born during the First World War. It is a philosophy which reflects the very best of the Australian character, that is, helping those in need, standing together in times of need and making sure that useful people are not thrown on the scrap heap before their time. Governments of all political persuasions have been the custodians of that tradition and of transmitting it into working, active programs for the care of veterans. I can assure you that we are no less mindful now of that responsibility than has been any government in the past. The repatriation system is a good scheme by world comparisons. It is as generous a scheme as any in existence in terms of the range and level of benefits, assistance and services. The system, however, was born to meet the needs of soldiers returning from the front. The clientele now has changed as many of the veterans are retiring from the work force and reaching old age. In fact, in June 1981, the eligible clientele of 636,000 had an average age of 63 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the problems we now face require flexibility to meet the changing needs of veteran clients. There should be no suggestion that the repatriation function is fading away and that, therefore, action is unnecessary. On present numbers of veterans and treatment beneficiaries, the projections of future trends show clearly that there will be a very large client group well into the next century. For example, Mr Acting Deputy President, by the year 2000 there will be at least 230,000 surviving veterans at an average age of 75 years. The trends suggest that the treatment population of veterans will not peak for another three years for, as the age of veterans continually increases, so too does the need for the services of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This demand for increased services because of age will be far greater than any reduction that takes place because of declining numbers of beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> Placed, then, in the context of repatriation history, the Department is faced with the requirement of developing new and more flexible response programs. In the treatment area we must pursue with vigour a program of rationalisation of services, both within the Department and in conjunction with the resources of the community hospital systems, to ensure that the aging veteran has available to him the best technology and the best thinking available for care of the aged. I announced in November last year that the Government had confirmed its commitment to the maintenance of the repatriation hospital system. That decision will ensure that the hospitals' high standards of care and services will continue while at the same time we can take every opportunity to rationalise services with the community hospitals system. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other end of the scale are the young veterans of the Vietnam conflict. I would like to say a few words about the action that has been taken to assist Vietnam veterans. These veterans have required a rethink of whether the current means of service delivery are adequate. It is a matter of concern that some sections of the Vietnam veterans' community have been critical of what they have seen as a lack of assistance. The Government has initiated a program for this group additional to the pre-existing benefits and services of the repatriation system. Our approach has been consistent and positive. I made a commitment on behalf of the Government that I would seek out those veterans with difficulties and provide a mechanism by which their difficulties could be properly addressed. Mr Acting Deputy President, in January last year I nominated counsellors in each branch office of my Department whom veterans could contact for counselling. I was also pleased to be able to say to Vietnam veterans that, in cases where urgent hospitalisation was necessary, this would be provided at a repatriation general hospital without cost to the veteran. I also went to the United States of America to examine at first hand the approach of the United States authorities in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Some Vietnam veterans felt that the existing machinery of the repatriation system, the interim counselling arrangements and the offer of hospital treatment in repatriation general hospitals, did not go far enough. After my visit to the United States I concluded that there was scope for helping those Vietnam veterans who feel most alienated by setting up facilities separated from departmental premises and staffed by personnel who know the Vietnam experience well. A counselling service was opened in Adelaide in January and a centre in Parramatta, Sydney in February and the Perth centre in April. Further centres will be opened in other cities in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> The counselling centres for Vietnam veterans are a concept of reaching out in the community to find people who have problems and placing them into the system in circumstances in which they are comfortable and which provide the best hope of identifying and solving their problems. It is of fundamental significance when we are dealing with people with problems that they not be afraid to come forward or feel alienated from the system. Where they cannot approach the system I feel it is absolutely imperative that the system approaches them. The senior level staff of the centres are fully qualified counsellors and the centres provide professional counselling, both in terms of psychological and social problems, not only for the veterans themselves but also for their wives and children. It is intended that the centres develop extensive contacts with other groups in the community which provide expertise in particular areas such as marriage guidance and employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the decision of the Government to establish counselling centres, it was decided that where wives and children are considered by the counselling service to require emergency treatment and it can be provided at a repatriation general hospital, this will be provided at no cost to the family. This is a most important extension of the counselling operation. It meets the needs of Vietnam veterans who feel that they could act in ways which might harm their families. Where a veteran is undergoing a program of counselling therapy at a centre, that program will include all aspects of his family situation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned, the Government last year made provision for urgent treatment for Vietnam veterans to attend repatriation general hospitals in capital cities. Vietnam veterans in country areas may have felt that there was an element of discrimination in that proposal and the Government has decided that non-insured veterans in country areas can now receive urgent treatment in country hospitals and refer the costs to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Government's activity concerning the possibility of increased instances of disabilities in Vietnam veterans or of birth defects in their offspring. There has been consistency of approach in respect of the scientific resolution of various allegations by Vietnam veterans. Using the expertise of the Commonwealth Institute of Health, which in turn has been able to have its study plans assessed by the Advisory Committee in Science and Technology, the Government has acted on the advice of acknowledged experts in complex areas affecting the health of veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Institute of Health originally proposed a comprehensive epidemiological study with the participation of all Vietnam veterans to examine matters considered relevant to their own health and that of their families arising out of the use of herbicides in Vietnam. After closely examining the research carried out to date, the scientific advisers have concluded that the comprehensive survey of all Vietnam veterans is not needed. They have recommended preparation of a design protocol for a morbidity study of Vietnam veterans and controls which would be more limited but still with numbers large enough to produce results. The Government accepted this recommendation. Other studies which have already been through the initial scientific review process are now in progress. I refer to the case-control study of congenital abnormalities and the retrospective mortality study-that is, investigation of the causes and incidence of death among Vietnam veterans and a control group. There have been requests to set up a judicial inquiry into the effects of herbicides on the health of Vietnam veterans. The Government's attitude has been that a judicial inquiry would not provide a scientifically valid answer to the question of whether problems that some veterans and their families were experiencing could be related to possible exposure to herbicides or to any other aspect of Vietnam service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment, in its inquiry into the use of pesticides, has taken as its first priority the question of the possible effects on Vietnam veterans of exposure to herbicides. That inquiry commenced on 8 December 1981 and the Committee is engaged in a very thorough investigation of Vietnam questions. I believe that its investigation will be just as effective as any judicial inquiry. The treatment program, the counselling service and the study work represent important extensions of the Government's efforts to assist Vietnam veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> Another of the matters which has been raised in the Parliament is the problem of the delays that face applicants in the repatriation determining process. In recent years, considerable delays have occurred at each of the levels of determination. Mr Acting Deputy President, the repatriation determination system is a multi-tiered, independent determination system. This commences with the Repatriation Boards; there is an appeal right to the Repatriation Commission, and a right of review by the Repatriation Review Tribunal. In recent years a further process of judicial review has emerged, whereby any person may challenge a decision made at any level right through, if necessary, to the High Court of Australia. As part of the introduction of modern concepts of administrative law, we have imposed upon the determining authorities the need to provide a record of every element of their thinking in arriving at a particular decision so that the decision may be properly viewed if challeged legally at any level. The increased number of claims, the complex legislation and the emergent process of judicial review has naturally slowed determinations down. It is a very significant problem and as yet the delays have not been eliminated. This is not to suggest that action has not been taken. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the actions taken has been an approach to the ex-service organisations to join with the Commission and me in attempting to find the answers and find them quickly. In addition, the number of Boards has been increased from the equivalent of four full-time Boards in 1970 to 14. Repatriation Commission delegates who consider appeals to the Repatriation Commission have increased from three to 18. Members of the Repatriation Review Tribunal, which was created in 1979 to replace the former War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunals and the Assessment Appeal Tribunals, have been increased to 21 full time and nine part time members compared with 16 full time members of the former tribunals. A good deal of effort has gone into streamlining medical reports and the administrative process of claims and appeals. These increased members, with the additional support staff and the other changes, are gradually eroding the backlog of cases and I am happy to say that in the case of the Tribunal and the Commission the delays are being reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent High Court judgment in Law v Repatriation Commission and decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court have reversed a trend of declining claims and the influx has greatly increased the burden on the initial determining area. The Department is undertaking more comprehensive investigations to ensure that claims are fully investigated and that veterans' rights will be protected. These additional claims make it more difficult for a repatriation system of determination to cope. The Repatriation Commission, however, is keeping the matter under constant review. It is redirecting resources from other areas so that the problem can be overcome in as short a time as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned some of the effects of the changes of administrative law on the repatriation determination system. There has been some comment in another place that the Government is eroding benefits of veterans and that it will take the opportunity, following the High Court decision on the Law case, to further erode benefits. That is nonsense. What should be said is that for the first time a definitive statement has been given on the effect of certain provisions of the repatriation legislation. I can say that the success of claims following the Law case and other court and Administrative Appeals Tribunal decisions has increased markedly. I have also mentioned that the number of claims from veterans wishing to test their eligibility, to make application to reopen claims or to make application for increased pensions have also increased. </PARA>
<PARA> I announced on 25 January that the Government had decided to take no action in the wake of the Law decision. This should have alleviated any fears that there was any intention to water down the repatriation compensation system. I should stress, however, that under the system it is still a statutory responsibility that each claim be considered on its merits and, although the decisions by these various higher authorities must be and are taken into consideration, there should be no acceptance of a disability in any individual case without proper investigation of the individual circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The repatriation system is a generous one and rightly so. As the High Court indicated, it was framed on the basis that people who suffered incapacity due to service would not be refused compensation. Mr Law was a Second World War veteran . He served first in the Middle East and later in Java where he became a prisoner of war of the Japanese. The High Court decision was based on the eligibility-liability provisions that apply to that war. These provisions are different in some respects to elegibility-liability provisions that apply to World War I or other conflicts. It has been suggested that the legislation be made uniform in respect of that elegibility-liability for all wars and conflicts . As I have mentioned, the repatriation legislation covers all wars and conflicts that Australians have been involved in since Federation. Perhaps, if I explain the history of the various liability provisions it will become clearer how the divergance has occurred so that nearly every conflict has a different provision. The only common elegibility is the provision for acceptance of an incapacity which was contributed to, or aggravated by, war service. </PARA>
<PARA> The basis of entitlement to compensation for veterans of World War I was governed by the War Pensions Act 1914. Because there was no Australian precedent , this Act followed the broad principles of the United Kingdom legislation which had covered earlier Australian contingents serving overseas as part of the Imperial Forces. Entitlement was based on 'incapacity or death resulting from the member's employment in connection with war-like operations' and was closely allied to the workers' compensation provisions of the time. The 'occurrence' provision was inserted in 1920. This provides for acceptance of an incapacity which resulted from an occurrance which happened during war service. </PARA>
<PARA> World War II prompted a major review of the legislation. In 1943, following recommendation of the committee of senators and members of the House of Representatives appointed to inquire into and report on the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, separate provisions were inserted to distinguish between veterans who had active service and those who served only in Australia. The wide elegibility criteria were based primarily of the nature of the 1939 war, the entry of Japan and the need to view the whole area of the Commonwealth as a potential theatre of war. It was recognised that liability should be extended to cover incapacity or death which might not have occurred had the veteran not been enlisted, the primary cause of which was a disability not itself due to the members service. It was not considered necessary to amend the provision applying to World War I veterans and, therefore, the Act had two distinct eligibility provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> With the Korean-Malayan operations the Act was further amended to cover members who were allotted for duty in an operational area. Benefits were restricted to the 'occurrence' provision although members were covered if they were incapacitated or killed as a result of any action by the enemy or in combating the enemy. The Korea-Malayan provisions became the basis for later conflicts governing members of the British of Commonwealth Far East Strategic Reserve which served in areas such as Singapore and Malaya and the Special Overseas Service of Vietnam. Finally, when compensation benefits were extended to serving members in 1972 a further set of provisions was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Justice Toose in reporting on the independent inquiry into the repatriation system concluded that the principles that have covered the granting of war pensions under the repatriation legislation are valid and continue to apply. He further added:</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of future service, entitlement to war pension under repatriation legislation should be granted where disablement or death results from an occurrence happening during the period of service, or for disablement which has been contributed to in any material degree or aggravated by the conditions of service, or for death which has been contributed to in any material degree by the conditions of service. Entitlement on this basis should apply to all types of service in respect of which eligibility under repatriation legislation is conferred. </PARA>
<PARA>Justice Toose, in restricting his recommendation to future pension cases, has overcome one of the greatest problems of introducing uniform criteria, that is, restrospective application of any view provisions. In workers' compensation it is possible to introduce new eligibility criteria as they can be made effective from a particular working day. However, in the repatriation area we are talking about past service in war and in war zones. The effect of any change in eligibility criteria cannot be restricted to future service and, therefore, applies retrospectively to all veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I am not suggesting that this is detrimental, it raises several obvious problems in terms of administration and cost. If we were to adopt a uniform eligibility policy would we allow each veteran and dependent to re-open claims, or should it be just restricted to new claims? We would be raising hopes of success when, in fact, in many cases the new eligibility may result in little or no difference. I agree that the matter should be investigated and my Department is doing what it can but I feel that it should be part of an overall review of the whole repatriation compensation system. Eligibility is only one part of the pension structure. The system of paying pensions to veterans and dependants has basically remained unchanged since the original Act of 1920. If we are to undertake a review of the major part of the compensation system I am of the strong view that such a review should be done in an integrated approach to the whole system. A partial aproach as suggested by the Opposition may go some way to removing differences but could create greater overall probems. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention also that some strange comments were made in another place to the effect that administrative means were being sought to meet the effects of court decisions. Those comments appear to be based on a belief that any improvements in the administrative system or procedures are to be viewed with suspicion. It is very much in the interest of veterans that the administration of the repatriation system and of programs for veterans be as efficient and cost- beneficial as possible. Both the Repatriation Commission and I see it as an urgent need to speed up the determination systems. More resources have been obtained and action is being taken to improve and streamline administrative systems and procedures and to introduced better management information and training arrangements at all levels of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Government assumed office many benefits have been extended. Let me just mention some. We have extended the service pension to all allied veterans who served in theatres of war. Last year we extended the service pension to merchant mariners. I take the point about allied merchant mariners and that is something which I will be considering in the next few weeks leading up to the Budget. We have increased to 60 per cent the level of disability pension disregarded in the income test for service pension. The major pensions are indexed twice a year in line with movements in the consumer price index. We have extended free treatment to Australian merchant mariners who were prisoners of war and to veterans with certain service-related amputations or loss of vision in one eye. Disability pension eligibility has been extended to members of peacekeeping forces and former members of the Royal Papuan Constabulary and the New Guinea Police Force. The Repatriation Review Tribunal replaced the old War Pensions Entitlement and Assessment Appeals Tribunals in 1979 and for the first time veterans were given reasonable access. </PARA>
<PARA> To return to the philosophy that I mentioned earlier, this Government believes that veterans should be compensated for incapacity due to their service. However , as much as we would like to increase and extend benefits there must be a limit on the extension and increases. Veterans' Affairs is not an island. It is an area that has to take its place, high though it must be, in the expenditure priorities of the nation. The Government is firmly committed to the provision of the highest possible level of care for veterans. In Veterans' Affairs, as anywhere else, the best of intentions must be tempered by the reality that these are tight economic times and in no area of Government involvement can the taxpayers' dollar be expected to stretch indefinitely. There is a limit on the community's capacity to pay and the success of the Government's policy of stimulating economic activity while reducing inflation must always remain the most important influence on the degree to which benefits can be expanded. We must have regard to those in greatest need so as to ensure that the maximum benefit for the taxpayers' dollar is assured. The Government has been concerned that the real needs of the most severely disabled veterans must be measured and met. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill reflects the Government's acceptance of its responsibility. It is extending compensation cover to members of the Sinai force; it is removing the stigma that has been placed on some mentally ill veterans; and it is removing the burden on patients by allowing the Repatriation Commission to recover costs from third parties. It is a Bill that recognises the tradition of the repatriation system. The Government, the Parliament and the public must ensure that no Australian veteran is treated in an undignified way or is disadvantaged by any program in the Veterans' Affairs arena. I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate will be absorbed to hear the Bounty Acts Amendment Bill 1982 involves bounties and the continuation of bounties for another year on drilling bits and non-adjustable wrenches. The subject of non- adjustable wrenches is notable for perhaps two reasons. One is that since legislation on this matter appeared in this place it has been the subject of a continued series of execrable puns on the subject of inflexibly-minded persons of the female sex. The other thing that is notable in this Parliament about non- adjustable wrenches is that they represent the legislative debut of Senator Siddons, not in his capacity as an honourable senator but, of course, in his capacity through the Sidchrome organisation as one of the founding fathers of Australian spanners. Despite those various excitements associated with this Bill it must be ac- knowledged that the conjunction in a single piece of legislation of measures dealing with drilling bits and non-adjustable wrenches offers little scope for the exercise of the creative legislative imagination except perhaps to those whose minds are not as entirely pure as they should be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation does, however, offer some scope for expansion on the general theme of the state of Australian manufacturing industry and on the relationship of that industry to the alleged resources boom which is occurring in this country. However, fascinating as those things may be, I think they were admirably expatiated upon by my learned colleague Mr Hurford in the other place and I do not propose to burden the Senate with a repetition of what was an excellent speech on that occasion. Indeed, although earlier today I was accused by Senator Walters in the context of the debate on the Australian Capital Territory Public Assembly Ordinance of being verbally intoxi- cated, I think I can assure Senator Walters and the Senate that I am not even the mildest bit verbally tiddly so far as this matter of non-adjustable wrenches and drilling bits is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few moments remaining to me, let me perform my allotted task as the representative in this place of the shadow Minister for Industry and Commerce by saying something about what is clearly an important piece of legislation as far as it goes. The bounties or the subsidies for these industries were introduced as a short term assistance measure, initially at double the rate which is provided for in this Bill. The extension of the bounty scheme until the end of this year at half the rate can be seen as a phasing arrangement towards a lower rate of assistance. From the beginning of next year the form of assistance will revert to tariffs-25 per cent for the non-adjustable wrenches industry and 15 per cent for the drilling bits industry. We on the Opposition side of this Parliament have taken the view that these industries, despite their comparatively small size, are very important to the country. They confer industrial benefits of a kind that only local manufacturing industry can confer, namely advanced technology, the employment of skilled labour, security of supply of strategically and industrially important items, and the spreading of the benefits such as they are, that are available to the minerals industry and to a wider range of occupations. </PARA>
<PARA> The two industries concerned, we are reliably informed, are not likely to require heavy assistance in the longer term. Indeed, they have not received much assistance at all from the public purse so far. Senator Siddons advises me that in his previous incarnation as a manufacturer he has made something like five trips to the Industries Assistance Commission since 1958. This legislation represents the first time that he has so much as a crumb from the public purse. Although the assistance involved has been neither high nor very lengthy in its duration, I am sure that it has been appreciated so far as it has gone and I say on behalf of the Opposition, that I am sure it has been necessary. The tariffs that are proposed-of 25 per cent for the non-adjustable wrenches industry and 15 per cent for the drilling bits industry are not high by any standard, particularly in comparison with other industries generally and more particularly in comparison with the average manufacturing industry. I am told by Mr Hurford that the average for manufacturing industry was about 15 per cent and the average for the metal industries in particular was about 20 per cent. This is a lot lower than many people in our community think. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we take the view in relation to this Bill that the provision of additional short term assistance, such as is provided for in this legislation, is justified and is necessary to allow the firms engaged in these industries to improve their competitiveness through new investment and improved quality. If that proceeds according to plan it will not be necessary, as I say, for legislation of this kind to reappear much more often, if at all, in the future. For all those reasons, I indicate that the Opposition does not oppose this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to put the point of view of the Opposition on the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill 1982 and the Overseas Students Charge Collection Amendment Bill 1982. The Opposition does not oppose this legislation. However, we have some reservations about it. Because of those reservations, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the end of motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that charges should not be levied against needy students from any developing country'. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation before us is an amendment to the 1980 legislation introduced by the Fraser Government for the purpose of imposing fees for overseas students attending tertiary institutions in Australia. Most of those students are attending universities or colleges of advanced education. Other students are in other forms of post-secondary education. The present legislation introduces an exemption from those fees for students from the South Pacific, including Papua New Guinea. It also increases the charges which are to be levied. Undergraduate fees are being increased from $1,500 to $1,700 a year. Students in the faculties of medicine, veterinary science, science and dentistry will pay fees of $2,200, an increase from the $2,000 that they previously had to pay. Doctor of philosophy students will not have their fees changed. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Australian Labor Party does not disagree in principle with the view that students from overseas who are wealthy and who have means at their disposal ought to pay fees if they attended Australian universities, it has never been happy about this legislation. At the time the Government introduced it we believed that there was not an adequate explanation of how the overseas students scheme worked, which students would be affected by the imposition of fees, which students would have their opportunity to study in Australia eliminated by the imposition of fees, and what effect the imposition of fees and the reduction in the numbers of students would have on Australian tertiary institutions. We still maintain that not enough information has been given to the Parliament by the Government to justify these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> We are happy to see that exemptions have been provided for students from the South Pacific region, including the students of Papua New Guinea. We ask: Why have the exemptions been restricted to students from those areas? It is the view of the Australian Labor Party that exemption from fees ought to be based on need . If there are needy students in the areas now able to be exempted, we welcome that; but we put forward the view that there would be needy students coming from other areas overseas to study in Australia who also ought to be exempted. For that reason we have moved the second reading amendment in the terms that we have . It seems to the Opposition that the imposition of fees across the board means that overseas students who really need help and really need access to study in Australia will not get it. Those who can afford to pay are not likely to be those in the greatest need, either educational need or financial need. </PARA>
<PARA> We note that the Government expects to collect $12m from this imposition of fees. I question whether that $12m is worth the disruption that the imposition of fees is causing to many overseas students and is worth the loss of prestige-I suppose I could put it that way-for Australia, which had previously been regarded very favourably by many of our neighbours whose countries are in a developing situation because we were providing something that they could not provide in their own countries; that is, a high standard of tertiary education. I think we should question whether the measure before us can be justified in terms of providing an extra $12m in revenue. The sum of $12m is not a lot of money. Certainly it is only a very small amount compared with the amount the Australian Government spends on overseas aid. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the view of the Opposition that access to our education facilities is in fact a form of overseas aid to many of our neighbours. In some cases it is probably the best form of aid we can find. We would prefer to see access to our tertiary institutions regarded as a means of aiding developing countries rather than simply as a means of collecting revenue to assist the Fraser Government to balance its Budget. It is strongly argued that education and training should be an important part of our foreign aid program. If honourable senators visit developing countries, as I have done in recent times, they will easily see that the real need is often in terms of expertise, understanding of modern technologies, administrative skills and so on. We can provide these sorts of things in our tertiary institutions. It is very important that we do not introduce policies which cut off access by our neighbours to our tertiary institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The views of the Opposition were set out in great detail in the debate in another place by my colleagues Mr Dawkins and Mr Beazley. Mr Beazley pointed out in his contribution to the debate that, prior to the imposition of fees, Australia had actually been providing a free university for Asia. I agree with Mr Beazley that that was, in fact, an excellent thing for Australia to be providing for Asia. The Labor Party regrets that the imposition of fees has meant that that facility is no longer available to many Asian students. We do not know how many Asian students are being prevented from studying in Australia because of fees since the Government has not been very thorough in its investigation of the operation of the program. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the kind of assistance that we can offer via liberal access to our tertiary education is the kind of assistance that many of our neighbours in the region need and the kind of assistance which will make an important contribution to stability and harmony in the region. I think, as all honourable senators will agree, the experience of going through a tertiary education is a very formative one for most young people. Those of our overseas neighbours who come to study in Australian universities acquire not only expertise, knowledge and qualifications but also an understanding of the Australian political and social system and, I hope, a sympathy for it. This can only be in the interests of Australia's relations in the regions generally. I conclude by saying that the Opposition does not oppose the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition clearly supports the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill 1982 and the Overseas Students Charge Collection Amendment Bill 1982. The Bills seek to impose fees on private overseas students attending educational institutions other than universities and colleges of advanced education on a pro rata basis to and consistent with fees currently being charged to overseas students in universities and colleges. The sentiments expressed in Senator Ryan's speech that this action is not a deterrent to students from overseas countries coming to study in Australia and gaining the advantages that we seek to afford them are shared by many in the Parliament. Indeed, the Government does not by this measure, as I understand it, seek in any way to deter overseas students from gaining access to our universities, colleges of advanced education and colleges of technical and further education. Rather we are noting the ability of that group of overseas students who are so participating to make a part contribution through their private means towards the education that Australia is providing them. The taxpayers' interests in any government program must always be protected by this Parliament. It is the taxpayers' interests that the Bills look to in seeking an appropriate part payment by these overseas students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government already acknowledges the main thrust of Senator Ryan's comments by specifically excluding from the measures in the legislation students from Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific countries. Indeed, almost all students from other developing countries receive full scholarships provided for by the Australian taxpayer through the Colombo Plan scheme and its parallel and extended programs. I do not know of any needy student from a developing country who will suffer from the charges brought about by the Bills. The Government and certainly I, as one Liberal senator who has taken a special interest in education matters and in overseas aid matters, recognise the measures in these Bills as in no way deterring overseas students from studying in Australia as they have done in the past nor do these measures deter needy students or place an extra burden upon them. Certainly, I would want it drawn to my attention in the coming months if there were even a single case of special need by an overseas student from a needy country. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment moved by the Opposition is pious. We all recognise that what it seeks is important, but that aspect is already incorporated in the legislation. The amendment is unnecessary. The legislation, of course, achieves consistency in relation to technical and further education and other courses provided by the Commonwealth by charging the same level of fees to overseas students as are paid by their counterparts attending universities and colleges. For the reasons that I have stated I support the Bills before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Teague said that the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill and the Overseas Students Charge Collection Amendment Bill were in the taxpayers' interests. I think that sums up the attitude of this Government on this very crucial matter which is a mixture of foreign policy and educational concerns rather than the very limited perspective in which Senator Teague and the Government has sought to place these Bills as though the whole question of our relationships with South East Asia, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific can be seen in a narrow, confined realm of the moneys to be paid out by the Federal Treasury.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can think of no better investment in Australia's relations with South East Asia, the Pacific and the developing countries generally than the expenditure of moneys on the education in our educational institutions of the talented young people from those areas. There can be no doubt that the expenditure of several million dollars in that regard is worth four, five or ten times as much as direct aid in those countries. I put that quite seriously because it seems evident to me that, when such people return to their home countries, by virtue of their education quite clearly they will be in positions of influence and of decision making in the various levels whether it be industry, commerce, public corporations, the Public Service, professional areas or, of course, political life. That is where we need decision makers who are favourably disposed towards Australia. Furthermore, I believe their experience of some three or four years in Australia in a liberal democracy can only be beneficial to the political development of their countries when they return. They return with an understanding which, I believe, can only benefit our commercial and political relations with those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> To be quite frank, I was appalled at the bland way in which the second reading speech delivered by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) simply stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government also decided, as part of Australia's special assistance, to meet the costs of overseas students charges from 1982 for nationals of Papua New Guinea and other South Pacific countries from its aid program for the region. The aim is to encourage more students from the area to come and study in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Teague said he would want brought to his attention any case-even one-of a needy student who is denied access to Australia's educational institutions because of the operation of this scheme of levying a charge on overseas students when they undertake studies in this country. It seems to me quite apparent from reading that paragraph that the Government itself and the interdepartmental committee on which it depends must have come to the conclusion that needy, talented students from Papua New Guinea and the Pacific area have over the past two years been denied access to this country because their families, extended groups or supportive groups in their home villages, towns and countries could not support their education here. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not forget: It is not merely a question of the fees that a particular institution might be en- abled to charge; it is a question of supporting the students here with reasonable accommodation, warmth and clothing in order to undertake their studies on a reasonable par with Australian students. That involves, perhaps, twice as much again as the actual fee component of their annual undertaking of studies in Australia. If $1,500 in fees is to be paid, one can say that perhaps each student's stay in Australia might cost from $5,000 to $6,000. That is a tremendous burden on a needy or average family or even a family group or an extended supportive group in the developing countries. As I said, the Government in that paragraph clearly admitted the validity of the points made by the Opposition back on 25 October 1979 when in that debate we emphasised that the effect of the Government's imposition of charges would be to narrow the opportunity for education to those young people from developing countries whose families already belong to a moneyed or racial elite. Let us not forget also that Australia's open-door policy not only enabled-as it should- students from developing countries without a wealthy family background to come and study here but also enabled those who, for racial or ethnic reasons, were denied access to higher education in their own countries to come to Australia to continue their studies. In fact, without being terribly selective one could surmise that many of Chinese or Indian origin in Malaysia, or perhaps the Tamils in Sri Lanka despite their relative wealth, could not find an opportunity to engage in higher education except for the opportunities that Australia had given them. The amendment proposed by the Opposition reads:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate is of the opinion that charges should not be levied against needy students from any developing country. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Teague said that the amendment is not needed in light of the Government' s concession concerning students from Papua New Guinea and the Pacific countries . Why is South East Asia not important to Australia any longer in the fostering of good political relations?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The more Senator Teague indicates the need for special aid programs, whether a particular South East Asian program, a Pacific program or a Papua New Guinea program, the more he admits the validity of the Opposition's original charge that this attempt by the Federal Treasury to raise some meagre millions is, in fact, inimical to Australia's foreign policy interests as shown by the various plans to which he alluded being used in order to overcome the deleterious impacts of this Act. I query whether the moneys entering the Australian education system via this Act-we have not heard from the Minister; before this debate finishes I want to hear what moneys are involved-are balancing the moneys spent on the administration of the Act, whether by the Commonwealth Public Service or by the educational institutions involved. It seems to me that the Senate deserves to know how much money is expended in ensuring that the Act is adhered to and how much money is actually raised by virtue of the operation of the Act. How much money is raised directly from those students, or their families, who do not benefit from a scholarship scheme, whether of their own government's making or of the Australian Government's making? Of course, the Minister's second reading speech said nothing of this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that Senator Messner is anxious to hear any further comments I have to make on this point. I am amazed that such Bills are still introduced into the Parliament by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee). Is it an educational matter primarily or is it a foreign affairs matter primarily? I think it is at least more in those spheres than it is in the sphere of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, except that the Government chooses to dress up this tuition fee as virtually a visa fee. That is the only reason why the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has a part to play in it. That is merely a mechanism. But it shows that the Government is obsessed by mechanisms instead of the substantive issues involved which are issues of foreign policy and of educational equity. </PARA>
<PARA> That is possibly the extent of the remarks that I wish to make, except to say that the Government gave an undertaking in 1979, as I recall, that it would bring to the Senate after a period of full assessment of the operation of the Act-its impact on the numbers of students entering the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will remember that part of the deal was that the numerical ceiling on the number of overseas students would be lifted. Why did the Minister not detail in his second reading speech what the impact of this Act has been after two years on the number of students entering Australia, from what countries they have come and, most importantly-given the tacit admission in the second reading speech-from what family and social backgrounds they have come? There is no doubt that the second reading speech tacitly admitted that the effect of this legislation has been to sustain the privileged, wealthy and ethnically or racially superior groups in the developing countries in the education of their children. The Government has got away with it because these overseas students are voteless. They are voteless and, therefore, voiceless and vulnerable to this sort of attitude of the Government that the taxpayers' interest is paramount, as Senator Teague so directly and honestly put it. That is the attitude and the policy of this Government. It has selected these students who are voteless and voiceless. It is up to the Senate to try to protect them. </PARA>
<PARA> I am only sorry, as I look at the list of speakers, that the Australian Democrats have not joined in this debate because I know and expect that Senator Macklin, in particular, would share the sorts of concerns which I have put forward, though, as I say, I have to assume that. I believe that this Senate has a very real duty on behalf of these voiceless and, therefore, vulnerable students to state as clearly as possible our opposition to these Bills in relation to charges on overseas students. It is with absolute support that I enter this debate with Senator Susan Ryan to say that the Senate should state very clearly to the Government that it is of the opinion that charges should not be levied against needy students from any developing country and that, furthermore, we should have the fullest possible rendering of accounts by the Government of the impact of this legislation over the past two years. The interdepartmental committee report is obviously in the hands of the Government. That IDC report must have looked at these matters exhaustively. Why could it not be tabled or at least its substance outlined to the Senate by the Minister so we can know what has really been going on?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Opposition for its support of the legislation and note the amendment that reflects its concern in the area of needy students from any developing country. I make the point that it is extremely difficult to define such people; and I think both Senator Ryan and Senator Tate, speaking on behalf of the Opposition, would well acknowledge the difficulties in those areas. However, I noted the comments in the House of Representatives of my colleague the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) when he indicated that there would be a constant on-going study of this problem by both his Department and the departments with which he is working; that is, the Department of Education and others. Consequently, we hope to be able to gain more information on this matter as time goes by. These are clearly difficult areas on which to gain information and it is this Government's concern to get as much as is available into its hands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Tate asked about the amount of revenue that would be forthcoming. I point out that the estimated amount to be collected in this financial year, 1981 -82, will be of the order of $11.9m. He raised a question about the cost of administration of the legislation. I am informed that it will not be very high. In fact, it will be undertaken by the staff of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. It is not expected that there will be dramatic increases in the cost of operating the Department as a result. I am unable to give him exact amounts as to the administration costs. Of course, it would be very difficult to try to get those for him during this debate. I undertake to refer the question to the Minister to see whether there is any more detailed information that I can provide to him. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate raised a question concerning the trend in the numbers of overseas students arriving in Australia as a result of the implementation of this policy in 1979. It is useful to note that in 1979, 1,509 students from the Association of South East Asian Nation countries entered Australia. In 1980 that number jumped to 2,275. This indicates an increasing trend and one which I understand is continuing, although I am not able to give the honourable senator specific information about that. It is clear that legislation in respect of that area certainly has not adversely affected student arrivals. With regard to Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific, in 1979, 633 students entered Australia and in 1980 there was a decrease in that number to 537. I understand that in 1981 that number increased slightly but I am unable to give the honourable senator a specific figure. For that reason, in order to encourage students from that region and recognising our responsibilities and taking into account the considerations which Senator Tate mentioned during his speech, an exemption will be introduced to encourage more students to come from both Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific region. I understand that that exemption will be introduced by ministerial direction and consequently will not require legislation and nor will it be incorporated in the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill. I believe that the Bill in general terms, apart from the amendment, has the support of all parties in the Senate. Consequently I wish it a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) said in answer to a matter which I raised during the second reading stage-that $11.9m would be raised this financial year. I think there is some ambiguity in that statement and I just want to clear it up in my own mind. The question I asked was: What moneys would be contributed by the students or their families alone? I do not want to know whether educational institutions will receive $11.9m from whatever source, in other words, from home government scholarships, Australian Government aid, or whatever. I want to know how much money will actually come into the Federal Treasury from overseas students' private sources. I wonder also whether the Minister can tell me, how much money has been set aside to fund the aid program to Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific islands? Approximately how many students will benefit from that money being set aside for this purpose? Are those moneys additional aid moneys or are they to be taken out of existing aid moneys to the detriment of other programs in those developing countries?</PARA></TALK.START>

I am not certain whether that is precisely the information the honourable senator is seeking. Perhaps the honourable senator could make his point more clearly in later discussions. We might then be able to get further information for him on that point direct from the Department. With regard to the question of the cost of aid for the exemption of South Pacific and/or Papua New Guinea students, it is estimated that the cost in forgone revenue this year will be of the order of $500,000.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to respond briefly to the remarks Senator Tate made during the second reading stage. From my point of view he noted that the Government's position was to make the taxpayer's interest paramount. That is an overemphasis of what I said and, I believe, of what the Minister for Veteran's Affairs (Senator Messner) said during the second reading stage. There is the question of the interests of our foreign policy in terms of overseas aid development to neighbouring and developing countries; the question of the educational needs of the students from Australia and overseas; and the question of the taxpayers' interest. It is appropriate to see a balance between these interests. I am not wanting to argue that in this matter the taxpayers' interest is so paramount that we exclude the other interests. Indeed the cost these days of a tertiary course of study is in recurrent terms, $6,000 a year. Overseas students with private means, often from wealthy families, are required by the overseas student charges, to pay about one-third of that recurrent cost. That does not take into account the capital provision in developing our educational institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Tate said that he would prefer the forgoing of these overseas student charges and have even four times the amount of that money involved in direct overseas aid, such as food aid, to developing countries in our region. If there are elite, wealthy families in all of the countries around us-and there are- including the developing countries, does Senator Tate seriously contend that rather than spend even four times that amount of money on food for the poorest in those countries we should allow the children of those wealthy, elitist families, who quite properly seek the best education available for their children, to come to Australia? I do not agree with that proposition. I believe that that perspective is misplaced. </PARA>
<PARA> I want also to note that in all of the countries about us from which students are coming to Australia there are well-established and often excellent universities such as the university in Kuala Lumpar, the university in Singapore , the University of the South Pacific in Fiji which serves many in the developing countries of the South Pacific such as Kiribati, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and so on. I believe that the idealism which has been expressed by Opposition speakers is already fully incorporated in the Bill. By not referring to the wealthy resources in the hands of some of the families who have some of the highest incomes even in developing countries, we have lost some perspective. By not referring to the educational institutions that are often of a very excellent standard in those countries again we are losing perspective. I wish to put it on the record that many interests are in the balance, including the Australian taxpayers' interests. We should by no means distort this matter by saying that we would prefer to forgo this $11m instead of allocating say $44m for food aid which is so important to those in much greater need in the countries round about us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note Senator Georges's point. But during my earlier remarks I mentioned that the area of needy students, their needs and the way in which these are properly assessed is an ongoing concern of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs which operates this legislation. Also of course, as the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) pointed out in the House of Representatives, there will be ongoing co-ordination with the other departments involved to ensure that more information is gathered on this question which, as I hope Senator Georges and the Opposition will appreciate, is one of some difficulty in terms of accumulating data.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is gratifying to hear that there will be an ongoing study into these matters. The fact is that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) and the Government have had available to them an interdepartmental committee report which, no doubt, must have reviewed two years of operation of this legislation, leading as it did, to the decision concerning the Papua New Guinea and Pacific Islander students in this country. I wish to ask a couple of questions which were raised in the debate of 25 October 1979. Government speakers at that time-I probably have to except Senator Teague who was a moderate at that stage but who has been a little more extreme tonight- spoke in defence of the legislation. They indicated two quite defamatory points in support of the Bill. One was the overseas students in this country were pursuing courses which were useless to them back home. In fact, I brought evidence to the Senate that showed, for example, that whereas 33 per cent of Australian students undertake what one might call liberal-arts-humanities courses, only just over 10 per cent of overseas students undertook such courses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, the proportion of overseas students in engineering, architecture and so on, which skills were essential to those developing nations, was much higher than the proportion of Australian students undertaking such courses. I would like to know whether the Minister can make available to the Committee a survey of the fields of study of overseas students in Australia over the last two to three years to see whether there has been any change in that trend and whether there is anything to support a statement by, I remember, Senator Davidson, who was in the Senate at that time that these students were pursuing courses that were of no use to them at home, leaving the inference that, in fact, they were here simply because they were indulging themselves at the expense of their wealthy parents and the Australian taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> The other argument put forward was that some 70 to 75 per cent of these overseas students were applying for permanent residence in Australia and were receiving that permission from the Government. In other words it was put that these students were not returning home to serve their developing countries as they should. That argument failed to recognise that those figures were based on two facts peculiar to Australia's situation at that time. Many of the students involved who were applying for and obtaining permanent residency, at that time were in fact refugees from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. Of course, it was unthinkable that they should be returned compulsorily somehow to their homelands if, in fact, their families and their social lives in those war-torn countries had been destroyed. So there was an artificial levelling of the figures in that regard from that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it is a fact that if we simply do not want to school these students and if we simply do not want to give them graduate diplomas or degrees there has to be some mechanism which allows them to stay in the country for two or three years, maybe to obtain professional or technical expertise in the area of their study. Particularly does this apply to a field like engineering-that is, as I say, if we want to educate them. So my second question is: Can the Minister now indicate to the Senate on the basis of the IDC report which, to be exhaustive, must have looked into this, what percentage of overseas students are returning to their developing countries in order to help the people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Coming directly to Senator Tate's question I understand the situation now is that almost all students are returning to their home countries. I point out that, further to the points that he made during his remarks, before 1979 the criteria for entry was based mainly on the non-availability of courses in the home countries of overseas students as he pointed out. This sometimes led to the students proposing to undertake courses of little relevance to their home countries. Since 1980, new private student criteria have enabled more students to be accepted from wider groups of countries. Those criteria take into account the training capacity of Australia, that is, without displacing Australian students in institutions in this country and such other factors as academic ability of overseas students, the relevance and the value of the proposed courses to their home countries and, of course, the value of those courses to themselves as students. I hope that satisfies Senator Tate's concerns in this matter. There are, of course, the normal requirements with regard to the interdepartmental committee report. But I understand that these matters were thought through as is indicated by the remarks that I have just made.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill is another of the fat omnibus Bills which have been popping up at the rate of about two a year for the last couple of years in respect of a miscellany of so- called non-controversial matters. This Bill contains 237 clauses. It deals with amendments to 39 different Acts and involves in ministerial portfolio areas about 10 different Ministers or, in the case of the Opposition, shadow Ministers . That means that it is not with a huge amount of confidence, even given the three weeks the Opposition has had to look at this Bill, that I can advise the Senate that there is nothing in the legislation which is controversial. Our look at it to this date-it is a difficult business dealing with such a sprawling piece of legislation- suggests that the description of it as non-controversial by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) is accurate and for that reason we will not oppose it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish, however, to refer to several matters arising out of this Bill. One comes again to the question of the presentation of legislation in this form. We acknowledge that tidy-up Bills of this kind, as they might be described, have a useful function but only within certain narrow limits. The test as to whether it is appropriate for amendments to be included in an omnibus Bill of this kind or whether they should have separate Bills to themselves must be twofold-firstly, whether they have an impact of real substance on a particular class of citizens and, secondly, whether it is important in practice that there be ready and convenient access to the legislative changes in question by those affected by them and, of course, by those who advise them. By that test I guess it is perfectly appropriate to include matters relating to such things as the parliamentary disallowance of delegated legislation, the composition and structure of statutory tribunals and a number of matters relating to the formal administration of territories and such like. Matters of that kind are perfectly appropriate to be dealt with in a Bill of this kind but I and the Opposition are not at all sure that that is the correct approach to adopt in dealing with matters as momentous in this legislation as those concerned with the operation of the national companies and securities legislation. We had occasion to make remarks of a similar kind in respect of several categories of amendment in the last round of omnibus legislation of this kind. It is in respect of the companies and securities legislation and the amendments relating to companies and securities that I make the same remarks on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> The companies and securities scheme, about which I will have more to say in a few moments as it is affected by these particular amendments is already notriously complex and difficult to untangle from the point of view of companies on the ground and legal practitioners advising them. That was not the intention of the new national co-operative scheme which has been recently set in train. It was the hope that practitioners could get by with reference to the Australian Capital Territory legislation in force at any given time without having to have regard to the accompanying State legislation which gave that Australian Capital Territory legislation in force for the time being application in the respective States. But, as things have already turned out and as it appears from the first round of litigation that the companies legislation has experienced, it is already evident that there have been cries of pain, not only from practitioners but also from judges coming to grips with the matter for the first time, about the number of different Bills, both State and Federal, that it is necessary to juggle on one's judicial lap in order to work out what the law is on a particular matter at any given time. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that it just adds an extra layer of difficulty to the business of working out what the law is when very important amendments to national legislation of the kind contained in the Bill before us tonight are contained in the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill, which deals with literally dozens of matters other than the companies and securities legislation and is not by its very nature easy material to find, to get access to and to work out its application to the companies area in question. Things may be different if and when we ever get a national computerised information retrieval system and instant access to and instant consolidation of legislation as it exists from time to time with legal practitioners right around the country being plugged into computer terminals which will throw up that information. Pending that particular millennium it is important, in our submission, to keep the statute book as streamlined as possible. Where there are, I repeat, important amendments of the kind in issue in this Bill they ought to have separate Bills to themselves labelled accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> Having got that off my chest, I will refer to three particular substantive areas dealt with by this Bill-two of them very briefly and the third at more length. The first area I refer to is that of the very important amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act as they relate to the status of delegated legislation which is repealed by subsequent regulations and ordinances. At the moment, when a new ordinance or regulation comes into effect and has the operative effect of repealing some earlier regulation the earlier regulation does not spring back to life if and when the new piece of subordinate legislation is disallowed by the Parliament. What happens if the Parliament disallows, for any one of the reasons available to it, a new regulation or ordinance is that in a sense a legislative vacuum is created. The previous law repealed by the new regulation does not spring back to life when the new regulation itself dies. That is the kind of situation we had occasion to refer to earlier today in the context of the new Australian Capital Territory Public Assemblies Ordinance. The difficulty that the existence of this state of affairs creates for the Senate is that there is a disincentive on some occasions to the Senate proceeding to disallow a piece of legislation because to do so a legislative vacuum would thereby be created in areas which may be crying out for some continued form of regulation. That matter was the subject of recommendations not so long ago from the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. It is with some pleasure that we note in this legislation their emergence into law. I will not say anything more about this matter except to draw the Senate's attention to a quite learned note on the effect of this legislation by Mr Ernst Willheim in the Australian Law Journal of October 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The second substantive matter to which I refer concerns some significant machinery changes to the membership and structure of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. They are all detailed in the Attorney-General's second reading speech. I have no need to go over the ground in any detail except to note for the record clause 22 of this Bill, which changes in very important ways the provisions relating to statements of reasons under section 28 of the existing Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. The Tribunal is now to be empowered to review a refusal by a decision-maker to give a statement of reasons for a decision whereas previously that option was not available where that kind of intransigence was being confronted. There are further provisions-I am summarising some complicated provisions rather quickly-to ensure that, where a certificate is given by the Attorney-General preventing disclosures of certain material, that will not result necessarily in the whole of the material in question being withheld but only so much of it as is covered by the certificate. There is a provision, in other words, for splitting certified confidential material in a way that will, I think, expedite the administration of justice in this area. Other things can be said about those procedural changes, but essentially they are straightforward and are welcomed by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The main substance of what I wish to say in the time remaining to me relates to the amendments to the National Companies and Securities Scheme. There are important amendments in this legislation to three of the five copies which comprise the Co-operative Companies and Securities Scheme, namely, the companies code, the takeover code and the securities industry code. In accordance with the formal agreement between the Commonwealth and the States governing the creation of this Scheme, amendments to the Scheme legislation have to be agreed to by the Ministerial Council. Once they are agreed to, brought before the Commonwealth Parliament and enacted by the Commonwealth Parliament they are automatically given operative force in the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the complexity of that process which I have had occasion to criticise on several occasions in the past, I think it is important to note, and to note approvingly, the speed with which these amendments, in particular the remedial ones to which I will refer in more detail in a moment, were drafted, approved, and now presented to Parliament. It is just two months since the then late lamented Minister, Mr Moore, who I notice in September last year in the House of Representatives described himself perhaps rather prophetically as a simple country lad, announced that amendments would be introduced at the earliest opportunity to shore up the powers of the NCSC against inroads which were being made into them. Two months may not seem like lightning speed, but given the lethargy with which the Government has been acting in a number of other related areas in recent times, which may conceivably be the subject of some attention during Estimates committees' hearings tomorrow, it is a matter for applause that things have moved as quickly as they have in this area. I grant the Government that applause unstintingly and unreservedly. It was important that there be remedial legislation here, and that remedial legislation has been prepared. The Government acted, extraordinary as it may sound, with dispatch. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say something about the major categories of amendment. First, I shall refer to the Companies Act. The most significant amendment in terms of the overall operation of this Scheme is clause 85 of this Bill inserting a new Section 16A into the Companies Act. This will empower the National Companies and Securities Commission to institute an investigation when it has reason to suspect that a person has committed an offence under the Companies Act. That is an eminently sensible addition to NCSC's armoury, one might think, and indeed so it is. The real question is this: Why was it not included in the Companies Act in the first place as the companion power to the special investigations provisions in Part VII of that Act and the power of inspection in Part II, division I, there already being, for example, such an explicit power of investigation provided for in the Securities Industry Act, in addition to those other powers. </PARA>
<PARA> The point to be made, I guess, is that this new section 16A is not primarily being inserted for its own sake but rather as a response to the very bad scare which the NCSC and the Ministerial Council recieved at the hands of the Queensland Supreme Court in the Pine Vale case in February. It is being inserted to ensure that the NCSC is able to hold public hearings in relation to matters arising under the Companies Act and, more importantly, under the takeover code. There is a general power under section 36 of the National Companies and Securities Commission Act, and section 7 as it is of corresponding State Acts, to hold public hearings 'for the purpose of the performance of any of its functions or the exercise of any of its powers'. But the Queensland Supreme Court in its wisdom held, however, that a hearing could not be held in relation to takeover matters unless there was in the takeover code a power of investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been my firm view which I have expressed in this place before that this involves a quite mistaken interpretation of the law and that the public hearing power is in fact quite general and unlimited as it exists at the moment. As it turned out, however, the NCSC chose not to appeal the decision and the Ministerial Council cautiously, but quite understandably in the circumstances, decided to secure the amendment of the legislation to make doubly sure that the Commission's power to hold hearings is clear and unchallengable. That is technical stuff, but it is very important and I am glad to see that the action has been taken. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I shall refer to the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act, the takeover code. There are several important amendments. The first of them relates to the power of the court to make interim orders when applications are made under sections 45, 47, 48, 57 and 60 of the code. This will enable the court to make an order pending the hearing and determination of the application when it regards it as desirable to do so. That means that immediate action can now be taken where necessary, for example, to protect rights under section 47 without having to wait for the full argument before the court and the decision of the court. I hope that the ever-cautious Australian courts will make use of this new power to serve its manifest purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment in this area relates to the power of the NCSC to declare the acquisition of shares or other conduct to be unacceptable. Section 60 is amended so that the NCSC will have 90 days instead of 14 days in which to decide to make such a declaration. Fourteen days was clearly too short a period in practice and, as this is an extremely important power in practice enabling the NCSC to enforce the spirit as well as the letter of the takeover scheme legislation, and these matters being as they are invariably complex, requiring time to unravel, I supported, in speaking to the NCSC 1980-81 report, the NCSC's call for such an extension of its powers in this respect and I welcome this as again a very sensible change. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter to which I draw attention under this head, and the most significant change in this batch of amendments-it is a change of a creative rather than a remedial kind-is the insertion of a new section 60A by clause 133 of this Bill. This will empower the NCSC, when it has made a declaration under section 60 that an acquisition of shares or other conduct is unacceptable, to make certain orders simply by an instrument published in the Commonwealth Government Gazette. Those orders will expire after 30 days if no earlier expiry date is specified. Further, there is the provision that no order may be made unless the person to whom the order is directed has had an opportunity to appear at a hearing before the Commission to make submissions. The orders thus available to the NCSC are similar to those already available to the court on application by the Commission and are virtually identical to those available to the Commission under section 35 of the securities industry code and section 311 of the companies code in the course of investigations under those codes. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important to emphasise to anyone who considers that this is, as some people apparently do, an alarming new accretion of power to a regulatory body, that the power of the Commission to make orders of a similar kind has existed in section 35 of the Securities Industry Act since that Act first came into operation on 1 July 1981 and also, as I said, in section 311 of the Companies Act. To my knowledge there has been no public opposition to the existence of that power in that context and I am surprised that there are signs of it being voiced in the context of the Bill before us tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The real significance of this change is that it reverses the onus of going to court. Instead of the NCSC having to go to court to have orders made as at present and then confronting the legalistic negativisim of the common law tradition, as has been graphically demonstrated by the cases in which the NCSC has already come to grief, it will now be up to any person aggrieved by the court to apply to the court for variation or revocation of the order. In a very important way this will enhance the flexibility and speed of movement of the Commission while maintaining the necessary protection of the right of appeal to the court. </PARA>
<PARA> The final matter to which I refer is the securities industry code which is amended by clauses 209, 210 and 213 of the Bill in ways that are attractive and acceptable and are welcomed by the Opposition. When I spoke on 18 February on the report of the NCSC annual report, I suggested that a strong need had been demonstrated for a section 15AA-type provision directing the courts to have regard to the purpose of the scheme as set out in the formal agreement in the legislation and in the scheme as a whole. That is conspicuous by its absence. I understood that there was some opposition from the States. I reiterate the importance of that provision and my mystification and that of the Opposition that there should be any opposition to it. The Opposition does not oppose the speedy passage of this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise for delaying the Senate this evening to speak in the adjournment debate but I think it is very important that I do in light of recent events and recent statements concerning a very important matter. I say to my Senate colleagues that if they are interested in the matter I am to talk about tonight it would be beneficial for them to look at the Hansard record of 8 November 1977, page 2263, when I made a speech concerning a matter that is very important and relevant to the matter I am raising tonight, that is, the trachoma project that was taking place in my State of Queensland. On 1 April 1980 I again made a speech in this place about the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program in my State of Queensland. If honourable senators like to refresh their memories they can look at the Senate Hansard of 1 April 1980, page 1299. I made quite a lengthy speech concerning these matters. Again, they seem to have been raised in my State of Queensland. If one looks at the Courier-Mail of yesterday's date, one will find that the Premier of Queensland has raised some questions concerning the trachoma problem in Queensland. The statement that is allegedly attributed to the Premier of Queensland was made under the headline 'Joh questions eye program' the article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Reintroduction of a trachoma and eye health program for Queensland Aboriginals would depend on the political affiliations of the program officials concerned, the Premier, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, declared yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> 'We naturally would want to assist in helping to improve Aboriginal health standards, Mr Bjelke-Petersen said. </PARA>
<PARA> But I would like to have a close look at the program first to see who's on it. </PARA>
<PARA> 'I have no objection provided it is used as a medical and not a political exercise. </PARA>
<PARA>If one looks at the speeches I made in this place on the dates I have already cited, one will recall that the Premier of Queensland consulted with his Federal colleague, the Hon. Ralph Hunt, who was at that time the Minister for Health. The Premier was able to block the trachoma scheme in Queensland because he said that Aboriginal political activists were going around telling Aboriginal people to vote for the Australian Labor Party. Whether that was true or not is beside the point. The point I brought up at that time and I bring up again tonight because of what the Premier has said, is that the trachoma and eye health scheme in Queensland will not go ahead despite Federal funding and Federal support for the scheme. It will not go ahead if the Premier of Queensland believes the people involved in the delivery of that service may have some affiliation with some political party. </PARA>
<PARA> One does not need to ask the question: What political party? It could be the Australian Labor Party; it could be the Liberal Party of Australia, but because it is not the National Party, the Premier will not be happy about it. But if it happens that some of those officials or some of those Aboriginal people involved in this scheme who are working for the benefit and the betterment of Aboriginal people in my State of Queensland are not supporters of the National Party the scheme will not go ahead. I was upset-naturally so-because the Queensland Premier seemed to have this kind of power over a scheme that was supported financially and in every other way by the Federal Government and by all those people who are concerned with the health of Aboriginal people. He could stop that program and he did. It does not matter what anyone in this chamber may say after I have finished speaking tonight. He did not stop the program at that time and now he is saying that he will prevent it from going ahead if he feels that some of the people involved with the scheme may support a different political ideology from that which he supports. We are talking about the lives of people. As we know, trachoma can result in total blindness if it is not arrested and taken care of by the people who want to prevent it from getting to the stage where people are blinded. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a man who is prepared to say that that scheme will not go ahead, regardless of what effect it has on people's lives, if people's political affiliations and ideologies do not coincide with his. Let us not fool ourselves. He does not just mean the Australian Labor Party; he means the Liberal Party in Queensland as well. He has said so many things on a number of occasions about me as a member of the Liberal Party representing the State of Queensland in this chamber. He has branded me as an activist and a commo. His close friend and confidante Russ Hinze even branded me 'a little Afghan camel driver'. He and his machinery campaigned against me and my partner, Yvonne McComb in 1980 when we contested the Senate election. They said that the Liberal Party had put up a ' nigger and a nagger' and therefore people should not vote for us. I am not a nigger; I am proudly-fiercely proudly-an Australian Aborigine. I am not an Afghan camel driver. I do not say that in any denigration of the Afghan people. They are a fine and very nice people. I have met them. I have known them and I admire and respect them, but I do not happen to be one of them. Perhaps I should title this address 'the Joh and Flo Show', because they both come into the act. The editorial in yesterday's Courier-Mail-a major newspaper in the State of Queensland-is headed 'Let us save their sight' and states:</PARA>
<PARA> The plan to re-introduce trachoma teams to treat Queensland Aboriginals must go ahead, with or without State Government support. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be wrong, indeed inhuman, not to ensure that everything possible is done to save the eye sight of Queenslanders, black or white, who live in remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Hopefully the State Government will throw all its weight-and all its facilities -behind the new plan. Although the program would be funded by the Commonwealth it would need State support to be fully effective. </PARA>
<PARA> It is more than four years since the work of the trachoma survey team in north Queensland under Professor F. Hollows was interrupted by a dispute over a claim taken up by the Premier, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, that two of Professor Hollows' field workers were urging Aboriginals to vote for the Labor Party-an allegation denied by the team leader. </PARA>
<PARA> The past should now be put aside. The proposal for a new team should not be a matter of party politics at all, but have the support of all parties and all Queenslanders. Trachoma, if untreated, causes blindness in a high percentage of sufferers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Premier yesterday indicated the State Government would consider supporting a new team provided it did not involve itself in politics and the people involved were acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA>Acceptable to whom? Acceptable to the Premier of Queensland? Why should they be acceptable to him? Why should they not be judged on their merits, on the job that they are about to do, will do and can do? Why should party policies come into it at all? We are talking about human beings-not animals, but people. The Premier says that these people can go blind if some of them in his opinion happen to support some party political ideology. I pray to God that we are above that kind of thing. I pray to God that this Commonwealth Government will say to the Premier of Queensland that the program will go ahead despite what he may think or what he may want, because people are more important than party politics . I know the people who were involved in the last program before it was halted and disbanded. Sure, they support a different party political ideology from mine . That is their prerogative. When I go out on the hustings before an election I try to encourage people to support my party and my party's candidates. I speak throughout the length and breadth of Queensland. Am I, then, to be classified by the Premier as a political activist? Goodness gracious me, there is not an honourable senator in this chamber-or an honourable senator who should be in this chamber-who does not go out and fight tooth and nail for his or her party and its candidates. Why would an honourable senator not do so? That is what politics is all about. Because some people were classified by the Premier of Queensland as political activists, a scheme that was going to provide relief to people who suffer from trachoma and who could eventually finish up blind was denied those people. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one side of the coin. On 11 March 1982 I asked a question of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) in her capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street). It concerned a statement by the same Premier, Johannes Bjelke-Petersen, that six Aborigines were undergoing training in Libya in guerrilla and terrorist activities. I asked a further question today following receipt of a reply from the Minister for Foreign Affairs stating that nothing like that is happening. But the Premier made that statement. He denigrated the Aboriginal people, putting them in a shocking light amongst their fellow Queenslanders, by alleging that they were training in Libya to disrupt, and to terrorise participants in, the Commonwealth Games to be held in Queensland later this year. An editorial in the Courier-Mail is headed 'Libyans training blacks in terrorism-Bjelke' and states:</PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal activists are being trained in terror tactics in Libya, according to information in a Queensland police report which has been passed on to the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, and the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I pose the question to you: If this information as given to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) when was it tabled in either the House of Representatives or in this chamber? To my knowledge it has not been tabled in this chamber. The information has been categorically denied by Aboriginal people . The Minister for Foreign Affairs in the answer he provided to my question stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that inquiries conducted by my Department and other relevant authorities have produced no evidence to verify that Aborigines are currently undergoing guerilla or terrorist training in Libya. </PARA>
<PARA>The Premier of Queensland says that they are being trained. Where are they being trained? By whom are they being trained? The Department of Foreign Affairs and other authorities in this country can find no evidence of that. The Premier says so. The people of Australia and the people of Queensland believe that Aborigines are being trained as terrorists. </PARA>

I think not .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was talking about the so-called political activists in the trachoma scheme. The Premier of Queensland will not allow the scheme to go ahead. Let us look at the report in the Courier-Mail. There is the heading: 'TAB chief detained in his Rolls. Knight faces drive charge'. This is political patronage. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The TAB chairman and trustee of the National Party, Sir Edward Lyons, was detained by police over a drink driving offence last Friday morning but was not charged or arrested. </PARA>
<PARA>This is political patronage. If Aborigines who might be involved in this trachoma scheme, working for the betterment or the health of Aboriginal people, happen to be members of the Australian Labor Party or the Liberal Party, then the scheme will not go ahead. Here we have a knight in shining armour who is a trustee of the National Party in Queensland. He is accosted on a drink driving charge.

That has gone on for years. That brings me to the third part of what I want to talk about tonight. There is a report in the Courier-Mail of 10 April 1982. It is entitled 'Use blacks funds for roads-Flo'. I do not need to elaborate on who Flo might be. I said at the beginning of my speech that perhaps I should call my address tonight: 'The Joh and Flo show'. The article reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Federal Government's $48 million allocation to buy properties for Aboriginals would be better spent on Queensland roads, Senator Flo Bjelke- Petersen said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>What, $48m is to be used to buy land? The whole budget of the Aboriginal Development Commission is $48m. This amount is for all the things the Aboriginal Development Commission has to do. It has not bought one single solitary acre of land in Queensland. Some time ago before the creation of the Aboriginal Development Commission another body tried to buy land in Queensland. It tried to buy the Archer River cattle station for the use of Aboriginal people, but the Queensland Government which had the final authority through the Department of Lands refused to have the lease transferred to the Aboriginal people because the Premier said that it would create an Aboriginal enclave. That is a dirty word. Blacks cannot have land, but the Japanese can have land. Honourable senators only have to look at Iwasaki at Yeppoon. The article continues. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The Federal Government should stop buying properties for Aboriginals through its Aboriginal Development Commission chairman, Mr Charles Perkins,' she said.</PARA>
<PARA> 'It would be $48 million well saved. It's not necessary for Mr Perkins to go around buying whatever land he thinks would be good,' she said. </PARA>
<PARA> 'A large allocation of funds already goes to the Aboriginal Affairs Department. The Aboriginals are pretty well looked after by both State and Federal Governments.'</PARA>

An amount of $3,935,796 was for expenditure on aged pensions. Should we take some of that money from the aged people and put it into the roads in Queensland? Why not do so? If we are going to take it from the Aboriginal people, why not take it from the pensioners ? What is the difference? Pensioners are people; Aborigines are people. I wonder whether Senator Flo would suggest to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) that in future, instead of giving that enormous amount of money to our senior citizens, we should spend it on roads in Queensland. Why not do so? If we are going to take the money from the Aboriginal people, why not take it from the pensioners? Let us look at the expenditure on unemployment benefit in 1980-81 -$995,748,000. Let us take a chunk from there and give it to Joh for his roads in Queensland. If we are going to take it from the Aboriginal people why not take it from the unemployed people? Let us look at a couple of other areas. Special benefits involve an expenditure of $66,100,000. We could use a chunk of that for roads in Queensland. Why not do so? What is the difference? Why take it just off the Aborigines? Why not take it off the people receiving special benefits? One could go on and on about areas from which money could be taken and put into roads because Flo thinks it should go into roads and not to people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it not time that we started to look at what is best for people? What are we talking about? Whom are we talking about? What are we supposed to be here for? Why do we sit around this chamber? Why do we listen to speech after speech? Are we not concerned about people, their future, their lives, what affects them and how we can best serve them? Are we more concerned with denigrating a powerless, helpless, voiceless group of people within our community? I do not say that in any denigrating way. The Aboriginal people of this nation are voiceless and helpless. They have no political muscle and they depend on goodwill, generosity and Christian charity, if one likes to put it that way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend delaying the Senate for too long. I was hoping earlier this evening to have an opportunity to raise these issues in a first reading debate. That opportunity did not come to hand, so I have to use the adjournment debate to speak on these three fairly important matters. The first matter relates to Customs. I recognise the difficulties which have been experienced by the former Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs and the new Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown), who have been in charge of Customs, in getting caught up with correspondence; but this is a matter of some concern because it relates to the attitudes expressed by Customs officers to members of the Australian community in Australia. A letter was written to the former Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs on 5 April. To the best of my knowledge no response has been received. A number of questions are contained in the letter.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V4">Senator COLEMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, two weeks ago. I will read the letter because I believe it is important. Unfortunately, it was addressed to 'Senator John Moore'. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On February 3, 1982, I returned to Australia after a two and a half year privately funded study session at the West Virginia University in the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA>The writer then gives her passport number. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>A few days prior to my departure from the U.S., on January 8, 1982, I ordered and paid for an academic gown, cap and hood, the tailoring and airfreighted transport time of which were estimated at four to six weeks. Recently, on March 23-</PARA>
<PARA>The dates are very important-</PARA>
<PARA>I received a phone call from the academic dress co-ordinator at the West Virginia University who informed me, as a result of a communication from Mascot Airport, that the gown, cap and hood were being held up by the Sydney Customs Bureau at that airport and would not be forwarded to me at the above address because I had not re-entered Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I make the point that she had re-entered Australia on 3 February, and this was now 23 March. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the W.V.U. co-ordinator advised me that the above goods had been at the Mascot Airport for approximately four weeks and that she was warned that they were to be returned to the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequent to receiving this information I took the following action:</PARA>
<PARA>1. On the evening of March 23, I telephoned the Perth Customs after-hours section and asked to speak to the officer-in-charge. A Mr Jim O'Neil took the call. After outlining the above circumstances to him, I asked for his assistance by way of a phone call to the appropriate authority at the Mascot Sydney Customs Bureau. While sympathising with my problem, he refused this request, saying 'I am not prepared to do it. I'm not prepared to give a reason. My reasons are personal'. He was prepared however to be quoted. </PARA>
<PARA>2. Later on the same evening I placed a reverse charge phone call to the officer -in-charge of the Sydney Customs Bureau at Mascot Airport. The gentleman who answered the phone refused to accept the call. </PARA>
<PARA>3. On the morning of March 24 I placed a reverse charge phone call to the Sydney Customs Bureau at Mascot Airport. On this occasion the call was accepted. After detailing the problem I was transferred to a Mr Thorne from Pan-Am, who undertook to search for the goods, and advise me of the result. Later on the same day Mr Thorne telephone to say he had located the parcel, had cleared it through the Sydney Customs Bureau for transportation to Perth Airport, and had requested the domestic carrier, Ansett, to advise me of its arrival in Perth. This advice was received on March 25. </PARA>
<PARA>I am at a loss to understand why this was not done four weeks before, when the parcel was received. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>4. At 10.20 a.m. on March 29, I attended the office of the Perth Customs Bureau with the appropriate papers from Ansett for clearance of the goods. Sixty minutes later, after begrudging cooperation in form-filling from one Customs officer, and 100% search by another, the parcel was released into my possession.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of this experience, I respectfully request answers to the following questions:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Who, and by what manner, was it determined that I had not re-entered Australia on February 3, 1982?</PARA>
<PARA> 2. On whose authority were the described goods detained in Sydney?</PARA>
<PARA> 3. What is the connection between my residence or otherwise in Australia and the decision not to forward the goods which were addressed from the tailoring company in the United States to</PARA>
<PARA> Dr J. Stephenson,</PARA>
<PARA> P.O. Box 129,</PARA>
<PARA> Wembley,</PARA>
<PARA> Western Australia, 6014?</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Why was Mr Jim O'Neill not prepared to make a phone call on my behalf, and what are the kinds of personal reasons that preclude a public servant from assisting an Australian citizen?</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Is it possible to improve the standard of co-operation with the public of the officers at the Perth Customs Bureau?</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Why did these goods have to be cleared by both the Sydney and the Perth Customs Bureau?</PARA>
<PARA> Your prompt reply to these questions would be appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA>I think a number of other questions need to be asked and answered. The first point is that the Customs officers are normally the first people whom people coming from overseas have contact with, and it is most important that a good public relations job is done by those Customs officers. As a general rule, my own experience and that of other people I have spoken with is that the public relations side of the Bureau of Customs is very good, although that has not been the case in the experience of Dr Stephenson. I will leave that matter with the Minister and I expect to get a fairly speedy response so that I can reply to Dr Stephenson. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I wish to raise is a matter of blatant discrimination in Victoria. I am sure that it is not an isolated case. It certainly applies in some areas of my State of Western Australia. I have not yet seen fit to take action, but it may be necessary for me to do so on behalf of this particular person. Firstly, I make the point that the person involved in this particular instance is at the moment just 11 years of age. She is an ardent cricket fan. As part of that passion, she wanted badly to become a member of a cricket club. She was a little unfortunate in that she chose the Melbourne Cricket Club which, I am sure everybody knows, is and always has been a very superior type club-at least in the eyes of its members! I might add that one of the first things I was informed about when I became a member of this chamber eight years ago was that my gold pass would admit me to the members section of the Melbourne Cricket Club . That I doubted then and still doubt, because I am female. But I would be very interested to hear from the MCC if it is prepared to admit me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I go to lots of Aboriginal communities, I can assure you, Senator. I am not sure, quite frankly, whether this incident occurred late last year or early this year, but the girl in question approached the club with regard to membership. Under the dateline of 22 February this year she received the following letter addressed to Miss C. Howe, 6 Brennand Street, North Fitzroy , 3068:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dear Miss Howe,</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for your letter of 10 February 1982 and your interest in the Club. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately the constitution of the Club does not allow for the inclusion of female members and this situation is not likely to change in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA> At the present moment, the waiting period for membership is over 20 years and so you would not receive any immediate benefits if your name was permitted to be added to the waiting list. </PARA>
<PARA> With best wishes. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours faithfully,</PARA>
<PARA>I add that the letter is signed 'June Fitch, Assistant Registrar'-a female writing to another female and not only describing the sexist and discriminatory attitude of her employer but also virtually lauding her employer by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the waiting period for membership is over 20 years and so you would not receive any immediate benefits if your name was permitted to be added to the waiting list. </PARA>
<PARA>I have some sympathy with Ms June Fitch, the Assistant Registrar, but she obviously knew the rules of the club when she took the position. However, Miss Howe decided that, even at her tender years, she should not be prepared to accept that attitude. She approached the Equal Opportunities Council in Victoria . She was advised that she should approach the club to obtain a copy of its rules. This she did. Under the dateline of 5 March she received this response:</PARA>
<PARA> Dear Catherine-</PARA>
<PARA>We have now gone from 'Dear Miss Howe' to 'Dear Catherine'-</PARA>
<PARA>-I regret that I am unable to accede to your request to forward our Rules et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA>That raises a question in my mind, but I will come back to it later. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> However, if you wish to telephone me I would be happy to discuss the situation, and perhaps offer you some comfort in your quest. </PARA>
<PARA> Yours faithfully,</PARA>
<PARA> BRYCE THOMAS</PARA>
<PARA> Assistant Secretary</PARA>
<PARA>Now, quite frankly, what comfort could be offered by Mr Bryce Thomas to Miss Howe escapes me. If there is a situation in which one wants to participate in a particular activity but, because of one's sex and for no other reason-the fact that there is a 20-year waiting list is of no concern to the club; it is only of concern to the applicant-one is precluded from participating in that activity, I suggest that very little comfort is to be derived from a telephone conversation.</PARA>
<PARA> I could further suggest that, as there is supposedly a 20-year waiting list for membership, perhaps it is being occasioned by existing members taking advantage, as I understand is done at most public schools in the larger cities, of the opportunity to register the names of male offspring at birth to ensure that, when it might be appropriate to be able to say 'I am a member of the Melbourne Cricket Club', they will have the right club to which to belong. Perhaps I could suggest that there might be another cricket club in Victoria that would actually welcome having a 10-year-old female member. It would be a little public relations exercise on its part and perhaps it would get a little kudos through the media if it were to contact her and say: 'We are pleased that you are an enthusiastic supporter of our sport'. That is what clubs are supposed to be all about-supporters of the sport-but obviously the Melbourne Cricket Club is not that way inclined. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps some little comfort can be derived by Miss Howe, rather than as a result of Mr Thomas attempting to soothe her ruffled feathers by a telephone call, from the knowledge that she is not the only one to which this applies. For those honourable senators who did not read the Age yesterday I will read into the record a passage from the column headed 'Table talk'. A photograph shows Lady Murray and Mrs Toner. Of course, Lady Murray is the wife of Victoria's new Governor and Pauline Toner is the new Minister for Community Welfare Services. The report reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Lady Murray, the wife of Victoria's new Governor, and Pauline Toner, the new Minister for Community Welfare Services, are not exactly enamored of the Victorian sporting clubs' practices of separating men from women at official functions. Lady Murray was quite astounded to be separated from her husband the last time she attended a VFL luncheon, and Mrs Toner has been a long-time opponent of the dreaded white line. </PARA>
<PARA> We can only presume that it was with some surprise that they found themselves seated at the 'women's only' table in the VFL VIP room at the Richmond- Collingwood game on Saturday at Waverley. </PARA>
<PARA> The pair shared a meal and chat with Marjorie Aylett, the wife of the VFL president, Allen Aylett, and Joan Hamilton, the wife of the VFL general manager, Jack Hamilton. Meanwhile, the Governor--</PARA>
<PARA>Who, after all, is only Lady Murray's husband-</PARA>
<PARA>Rear Admiral Sir Brian Murray, dined with the men. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hamilton tells us that after the official luncheon, the women were free to mingle. 'At afternoon tea, they could sit with their husbands,' he says. 'They could sit with anyone they liked during the game'. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a classic case of discrimination, one which really we do not need in Australia in this day and age. After all, we are well into the twentieth century ; women are equal human beings. It has been said many times that women are on the move. I give a warning now to clubs that practise blatant discrimination that they may find that women are on the move outside their very doors. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note what has developed in the leagues clubs of New South Wales since the anti-discrimination legislation was passed by the State Government. I understand that female members of leagues clubs which previously displayed such signs as 'associate members'-who of course were always the female members-'are not permitted to use the sauna; associate members are not permitted to use the billiard rooms', are now finding that instead of being limited to associate membership they are quite entitled to full membership. The clubs are now blatantly advertising that their facilities are available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps we have to look now to the Victorian State Government and other governments to introduce as rapidly as possible similar anti-discriminatory legislation as the New South Wales Government has done. I cannot, for instance, see it happening in my State of Western Australia at the moment where we have a rather ludicrous situation with the State conservative government saying: 'No, we will not have legal casinos but we will allow at least five illegal casinos to operate in which women are not welcome'. They may well look out for me on their doorstep one of these nights. I might pay them a visit and dare them to not let me in. </PARA>
<PARA> The final matter which I wish to raise concerns a question which was asked by Senator Bjelke-Petersen during Question Time today which related to the funding of the performing arts. I was not aware at the time that I put my name down with my party Whip to speak in this adjournment debate-as a matter of interest I did this yesterday-that a question on this subject would be asked. But it now gives me an opportunity to point out to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) who represents the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) that there is a crisis in all States in regard to the funding of particularly the performing arts. In Western Australia we are looking at a situation where it is quite possible that at least an entire generation of Western Australian people will be deprived of access to the performing arts. I wish to read quickly into the Hansard record a letter from the Western Australian Opera Company Inc. dated 8 April 1982 and headed 'Federal Funds Withdrawn-Opera Against the Wall'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> On the 11th February, 1982, the Australia Council advised that basic grants, paid to State Opera Companies since 1967, would cease after 1982. This is the realisation of a threat made by the Music Board of the Australia Council in 1977 and is only the 'thin' edge of the wedge. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet another blow to Western Australia, in particular, as it receives no benefit from the Australian Opera although its taxpayers and the State Government support the National Company both indirectly and directly-through the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust. The Australian Opera currently receives 80% of the Australia Council Music Board's funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The funding of our company has been inequitable as the enclosed table of grants made to the State companies since 1975 shows and the latest cut decreases our grant funds, on current values, by 17%. We now have to consider whether, in fact , we can continue providing W.A. with Opera and Music Theatre of the highest standards at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Standards of our productions have been acclaimed by both the public and critics and a steadily growing audience is proof of our acceptance in the community. During 1981 we played to over 33,000 patrons and audiences are increasing as a consequence of aggressive marketing. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the proven public need for our activity, it is not often realised that our industry provides considerable employment during the year. In 1981 we paid $443,000 in salaries to singing artists, musicians, technicians and support personnel. The employment of such people resulted in the Federal Government receiving over $50,000 in income tax, deducted at source, and the State Government receiving over $19,000 in payroll tax. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of the Federal agency (Australia Council) abdicating its responsibility to Western Australia, jobs for artists, musicians, technicians and administrative support personnel will be lost, not to mention the loss of income and payroll tax to Federal and State Governments, sales tax on all items purchased for set construction and costume making and spin offs to other local industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, taxes paid to the Federal Government far exceed grants received, so for what purpose does the Australia Council make the decision to eliminate grants to state based opera companies?</PARA>
<PARA> We need your help to have Federal funding through the Australia Council re- instated. </PARA>
<PARA> May we therefore look forward to you making representation on our behalf to the Federal Minister representing the Arts, the Honourable Ian B. C. Wilson, Minister for Home Affairs and the Environment, to have funding restored to this company on the basis of it being a special case due to its isolation and, as a consequence of that isolation, the lack of service from the Australian Opera, which regularly visits the other States. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter is signed by Mr V. A. Warrener, General Manager of the Western Australia Opera Company. I am well aware of the response that the Minister gave Senator Bjelke-Peterson this morning. I wish to make a number of points. Firstly , if we are to have national bodies, then they have to be truly national. In the case of Western Australia the last time that that State had a visit from the Australian Opera Company was in 1973 when there were in all five performances of The Marriage of Figaro in Perth. I know that difficulties are being experienced by all sections of the performing arts in this country. But I strongly put the case that it is the exposure perhaps to all forms of culture through creative performing arts that is an absolute essential in the backgrounding of the people of the future, the development of people, particularly young people. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is also important to relate matters that have taken place in other States and that have been recorded. For instance, in South Australia the Liberal Government has pulled back on its grants to the Australian Opera company, which means that the national company which had only two performing weeks in that State during 1981 will not have any during the 1982 financial year. In 1981 there were 28 performing weeks in New South Wales and there will be 30 in 1982. In the Australian Capital Territory in 1981 there were one and a half performing weeks and in this current financial year the figure will be the same. In Queensland there were two performing weeks in 1981 and that State will have one and a half weeks this year. Melbourne had 12 in 1981 and it will have nine this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already been advised that if things continue in this manner it may be necessary to confine the activities of the Australian Opera company to New South Wales and Victoria. I am conscious of the fact that when the South Australian Government decided to pull back on its grant to the Australian Opera company serious consideration was given to taking the Australian Opera company to Western Australia. But if one looks at the cost of transporting a company such as the Australian Opera company around the country one realises that suggestion is completely impractical. In fact, a three week 13-performance tour in that State-that is allowing for the transportation of goods, the material, the sets, the costumes and the people and provided that every single seat for every performance were sold-there would still be a deficit of $175,000. I do not anticipate that a national organisatoin or any organisation could stand a deficit of that nature. But the point that I am making is that if the people of Western Australia do not get visits by the naional body, at least they are entitled to be assured of adequate funding so that the Western Australian Opera company can continue. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bjelke-Petersen raised in this place this morning the problems of the people she represents in the State of Queensland. I press a valid point that I think is important. Western Australia very seldom enjoys the advantages that are available to those States on the eastern seaboard of Australia-the regular visits of overseas artists. Western Australia gets very few such visits and therefore it has to depend to a large extent for its cultural development on organisations such as the Western Australian Opera company. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate the point I made earlier. If we are to have a national body then it has to be truly national. The Federal Government has to accept a responsibility for adequate funding to ensure that those cultural, recreational activities that are available so readily in New South Wales and Victoria are available to all Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will try to be brief. I think it is important to raise this week, as it is the first opportunity I have had to do so , the concern the Australian Democrats feel in relation to the Aboriginal land rights issue in my State of Queensland. I refer to the Bill which has passed the Queensland Parliament entitled 'A Bill to Amend the Land Act 1962-1981 in certain particulars and to amend the Forestry Act 1959-1979 in a certain particular, and for other purposes', the short title of which is the Land Act ( Aboriginal and Islander Land Grants Amendments Act) 1982. The foreshadowing of the passage of this Act has been the subject of discussion in this chamber for quite some time and indeed it is the subject of a Bill which has passed this chamber and has gone to the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to raise a number of points, and will do so very briefly because of the late hour, about what we find still objectionable about the provisions in the Queensland Act. First of all, the Minister for Water Resources and Aboriginal and Island Affairs has indicated that the Bill and the deeds of trust in the Bill were referred to community reserves and, to quote the Minister, 'some Aboriginal reserves will remain'. If one reads his second reading speech, one certainly gains the impression that the country reserves in Queensland will not be included. There are at least 28 of these country reserves which, on a conservative estimate, may have upwards of 30 per cent of the Queensland Aboriginal and Islander community living on them. So the actual lands under consideration are still of enormous concern to us. Secondly, the Bill enables the Governor-in-Council to exclude from the grant or to reserve any land for public purpose such an access road, a camping place, pasturage reserves, ports and quarries, hospitals, police stations, et cetera. I refer honourable senators to clauses 5 and 334D. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Governor-in-Council may, at any time, rescind, amend, alter, vary, or modify any grant. This is an absolute power under section 334 and is not in any way controlled by Parliament. Fourthly, any by-laws relating to the use of the land must have the approval of the Governor-in-Council. That is provided for under section 339. Fifthly, the consent of the Minister is needed in some cases mainly for the occupation of certain portions of land granted for periods exceeding one month. Sixthly, in addition to the power to rescind under section 334, there is, under section 353, a further power which empowers the Governor-in -Council to revoke totally a grant, subject to disallowance by the Parliament. Here I draw the attention of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) to a statement that he made that this may be normal in Queensland. I refer him to the fact that one of the Acts which is amended is the Forestry Act 1959-79. I refer him specifically to the following sections: Section 26 on the revocation of the declaration of a State forest is done in a totally different fashion; section 28 dealing with the revocation of timber reserves is done in a totally different fashion; section 31 dealing with the revocation of the declaration of a national park is done, again, in a totally different fashion. I draw the Minister's attention to the fashion in which they are done. I ask him to compare those situations with this situation. I think he will then see where he may have been misled by his own advisers. I read section 26 (2) (2) as an example:</PARA>
<PARA> Any such proposal has been laid before the Legislative Assembly that the Governor-in-Council on a resolution whereof, not less than 14 days notice having been given passed by the Legislative Assembly, that such proposal be carried out . </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, the point that is made here is that the Governor-in-Council may have cause to lay on the table of the Legislative Assembly a proposal for such revocation but that the Legislative Assembly must, by deliberative vote, carry out that revocation, not as is contained in the Act. The Minister said: 'That may be normal in Queensland'. It is not normal in Queensland. I have quoted from the very Act which is amended in this Act which gives power. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Baume may quote from the other one, if he likes. It is not a quibble. It is indeed in one of the Acts which were amended. In addition to the power to rescind there is this additional power under section 353. The method that is engaged in-the Minister may like to investigate this; his knowledge of the legislative Assembly's procedures seems to be vast-is this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Governor-in-Council may totally revoke a deed of grant at any time. </PARA>
<PARA> This deed of revocation takes effect on the day of its publication. It must then be laid on the table in Parliament within 14 days from publication, if Parliament is sitting, or within 14 days of commencement if it is not. </PARA>
<PARA>In the latter case this may take many months. In any case-the Minister may care to check this out-failure to table an order made in accordance with this Bill would not nullify that order. There are many cases currently on record in the Legislative Assembly where that has occurred. If the order is tabled the Parliamentary Committee on Subordinate Legislation in the Legislative Assembly would, of course, as our committees do, scrutinise such proposals for possible disallowance. Alternatively a member of parliament may move, as in this chamber, for disallowance. The motion of disallowance must be moved within 18 days. This may be difficult since the Committee is extremely busy, as is our committee. The latest figures that I could find-it is somewhat difficult to find material in terms of the Legislative Assembly-show that in the last couple of days of its 1979 Budget session there were 209 instruments to which that Committee had to pay attention. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the legislative methodologies of the Queensland Parliament are such that far more legislation is done by way of regulation in that State than probably any State in Australia and certainly by this chamber. Leases may be granted to individuals, groups or families, but in such cases they are subject to the approval of the Minister for Lands who may require a council to charge the highest rent obtainable. I have no reason to draw the Minister's attention to that. He would know what it would mean if the Minister for Lands wanted to use it. That is dealt with in section 344B. </PARA>
<PARA> A proposed amendment to section 45 of the Forestry Act ensures that reserve councils may not use forestry or quarry products. The Governor-in-Council may at his absolute discretion give permission to anyone to enter land held under the provisions of the Bill. There are no provisions for compensation under the Mining Act similar to the ones enjoyed by occupiers of private land or Crown land in the State of Queensland. Finally, a reserve council may need the approval of the Governor-in-Council to carry its own prospecting. No provision has been made to guarantee traditional hunting, foraging and fishing rights. I draw the Minister's attention to a section of the speech that he made. He pointed to four principles for securing tenure. They were:</PARA>
<PARA> The integrity of the present boundaries be maintained; secure tenure for occupants and the preservation of their rights to use the land; local communities to play a significant role in the management of the reserves; full consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people before any decisions are made. </PARA>
<PARA>Avoiding the confusing term 'land rights', the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> The essential element is security of land tenure. Of course, there is a whole variety of ways in which that can be achieved and in which we should approach the matter. At this moment the reserves in Queensland are not secure. The Aboriginals and the Islanders do not have secure tenure today. They can be de- gazetted overnight. They were de-gazetted overnight a couple of years ago in one notorious example. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats and I would contend that the legislation passed by the Queensland Parliament does not change that situation. Until the Commonwealth Government uses its power-the power granted to it by the people of Australia- then that will remain the situation in Queensland. The Aboriginal and Island peoples will not have secure title to their rightful land. This Parliament must continue its action to secure for those peoples their legitimate and longed for rights. </PARA>

<PARA> People have taken a worst case view. They have asked what would happen if the worst possible case were applied. We think it very unlikely that the Queensland Government will move away from its stated intentions as to how it will operate these matters of land tenure. In the event that this happens the Commonwealth has given an unequivocal guarantee that it will stand behind the stated intent of the Queensland Government to provide security of tenure and integrity of the reserve land and that if there are actions which transgress those principles, that is the principles set down by Queensland, or which indicate an unreasonable use of the discretions in the legislation, which may be the discretions to which Senator Macklin referred, the Commonwealth will act accordingly. I make it quite clear that if Queensland, in a very unlikely situation, were to follow a course in which an instrument was not tabled in the Parliament or if action were to be taken when the Parliament was not able to meet these would be matters which the Commonwealth would want to examine. Certainly, any failure to table a document would require the Commonwealth guarantee to be exercised. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken on this matter a number of times. I thank Senator Macklin for the view of the Australian Democrats. The Queensland Government has progressed miles from where it was a year ago. It has moved its position publicly and legislatively. The reserve communities will now have title to their reserves. Perpetual title will be held directly by the communities. That title will be secure to the extent that parliamentary review would be necessary in any unlikely event of revocation. Senator Macklin is quite correct that there are other reserves, the status of which have still to be determined. I think it is also fair that the conditions to apply on particular deeds of grant will be the subject of negotiations one by one. The Commonwealth guarantee that has been given should be taken very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coleman raised several matters. I will deal with them in reverse order as it happens to be convenient. She referred to the performing arts. I understand the point she made in relation to the isolation of Western Australia, certainly in the context of what she called cultural isolation. She referred to the high costs of moving national companies to Western Australia to perform and the problems which have occurred because the State opera company of Western Australia is no longer able to fill that gap. The questions which she asked and suggestions which she made will have to be resolved in a Budget context. They are matters which the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) will have to take into account in a Budget context. I will pass on to him, as I said I would do for Senator Bjelke-Petersen this morning, that point. I raise one query with Senator Coleman. To the extent that the Australia Council is an autonomous operation I would be reluctant to follow up the suggestion that there should be ministerial direction to the Council in relation to how it should allocate its programming and resources. I think the Australia Council would want to read what the honourable senator said but it might be inappropriate for it to be given instructions in this or in other such matters. </PARA>

<PARA> The second matter related to the Melbourne Cricket Club-I take it that that is the club related to the Melbourne Cricket Ground-and questions of equal opportunity which arise there. The 20-year wait does not worry me. It applies all over the State. I understand Senator Coleman's point. I hope that she will encourage the young lady, as quite a separate matter, to become a member of the East Torrens District Cricket Club. I do not know whether Senator Coleman is a member of that club. I am certainly a member. It is a club in Adelaide and it functions as a non-smoking cricket club. I have been seeking parliamentary members to become members of that club because it has decided to operate independently of the money available from the South Australian Cricket Association on the basis that it will not take sponsorship from certain sources.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am offering Senator Coleman membership of the East Torrens District Cricket Club, and I would be happy to process her very nominal contribution to that club. The question of unequal opportunity is a serious matter and I take on board the point she makes. We are seeing the barriers crashing down; I think it will be a matter of time. Senator Coleman made another point about the rather quaint custom of separating wives and husbands at social functions. I concur completely with her. This is not an experience which many couples seek. Indeed, there are some functions which I attend in Sydney which my wife now no longer attends because we are not willing to dine separately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Coleman raised a third matter-she raised it first-which concerned a Dr J. Stephenson and his experience with Customs. I heard the story unfold and I accept the facts as set out. We can certainly make them known to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Brown. I am sure he will want to know the events. It was a matter of front counter attitudes and practice but it sounds as though some quite major administrative error or mixup occurred in this matter. I will not cover the ground again except to say that it seems appropirate, as the honourable senator requested, that this be passed to the Minister for early response to see why it was that the academic gown and goods were held up at Mascot, why the wrong information was sent back to West Virginia, why there was difficulty in communication between the west and east coast and why the whole series of events occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the points raised by Senator Bonner in his contribution. He raised a number of matters, all of them quite serious, and I would like to advert to those. I will start with the question of trachoma and the trachoma program. The honourable senator was not really concerned with the trachoma program itself but asked about its reception in Queensland and about certain bars which seem to have been raised about the participation in the program. I make it clear that there is a difference between programs through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs which are grants-in-aid programs and State grants programs . We make grants-in-aid programs to organisations. I have established as a matter of principle that I do not accept and will not accept a State veto on grants-in-aid programs by the Commonwealth to an organisation. That is a matter between the Commonwealth and an organisation. I think honourable senators would want it that way. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the point may be that if a State grant element is needed there is a need to co-operate with the State. While it is a grant-in-aid to an organisation, there is no need to involve the State. Of course, it is desirable always to work in co-operation with our State colleagues, but I remind honourable senators that last year in Western Australia I had occasion to ensure that certain medical services were funded. I have done the same in Queensland. The Wu Chopperen service in Cairns has been funded now. Because it is a grant-in -aid fund, it is a decision for me. Whilst I seek the advice of State colleagues , it is not something on which I require concurrence or on which I will accept a veto. Clearly, I would try to work, and I think any honourable senator would try to work, by co-operation in these matters. Having said that, Senator Bonner was concerned that there was, apparently, a political test to be put on people participating in the program. Let me answer him in this way: Someone's political affiliations are irrelevant. When one is carrying out a professional function- for example, during the time that I as a doctor am giving medical advice-one should be giving professional advice in that field, not political advice. I think we all would agree with that. If Senator Peter Rae is giving legal advice he should not be combining that with giving political advice. I think that is a perfectly simple proposition with which we all can agree.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I wish to talk about another couple of matters raised by Senator Bonner. First of all, I refer to the Aboriginal Development Commission funding. Let me give the exact figure for this year. The Aboriginal Development Commission received $ 48m. That is the figure that has been mentioned, and it is accurate. Of that sum $3.4m was set aside for land purchases. I understand that during this year the Aboriginal Development Commission has spent about $370,000 in Queensland for small parcels of land or for improvements on land which was taken over. Some issues are continuing on the question of land purchases. Some of them involve the possibility of further negotiations between the ADC and Queensland. Until those possibilities are exhausted, I do not think it would help things very much for me to go over the matters raised by Senator Bonner, except to say that I note them, I am aware of them and I hope they can be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other matter I wish to mention is the concern Senator Bonner expressed about people training in Libya. I agree with Senator Bonner; I know of no evidence to support the assertions that Aboriginals are training in Libya. That whole story is quite fanciful. I must say that those kinds of statements will occur; people will say these kinds of things from time to time. It may be that a Premier receives from one source or another information that may eventually prove to be false. But I say to honourable senators that there are elements within Australia today, both in the Aboriginal and the non-Aboriginal communities, who are not proceeding in the way which Senator Bonner set down as the desirable way to proceed. I am as concerned--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to say a little bit about this tiny minority because they are a concern when they are in the non-Aboriginal community. They are also a concern when they are in the Aboriginal community. I want to set on record that at a conference at the University of New South Wales last October, dealing with land tenure, I had the doubtful pleasure of listening to Mr Gary Foley speaking. I mention this matter in this context because, as I recall what he said, first of all he accused me of having Australian Security Intelligence Organisation people present, which was rather fanciful. He identified one of my officers as an ASIO person, which is fairly fanciful. He said that he was about to go overseas and that we could guess where. However, he did make the point, when talking about the needs of Aboriginal people, that if the matter could not be resolved in Australia they would be perfectly justified in seeking support from friendly Middle Eastern powers. I believe that we can resolve our problems here, within the framework of law and our political structures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that at both Federal and State levels we have a will. We have an emerging record of enormous progress over 10 years. Be it accusations from one side that people are being trained in Libya when there is no evidence that that is so or statements from the other side that people are going to seek the help of friendly Middle Eastern powers, all that can do is make a situation more difficult. I do not believe either of those courses is one which honourable senators here would endorse or promote. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) It is incorrect to say that moves taken by the Zimbabwe Government have turned the white people of Zimbabwe into economic prisoners. Zimbabwe has limits on the amount of foreign exchange that people wishing to leave the country may take with them. It should be noted that these limits were determined in April 1979, before the Mugabe Government came into office. Such controls are imposed by a number of Governments, not only that of Zimbabwe, and it is a matter for each country to decide, according to its economic circumstances, the appropriate level of foreign exchange those departing may take. I understand that in fact the present controls represent a more flexible arrangement than previous foreign exchange regulations. The limits set by the Zimbabwe Government apply equally to black and white Zimbabweans.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It would not be appropriate for Australia to approach the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, as there are no grounds for believing white citizens wishing to leave Zimbabwe are doing so as refugees from political persecution. Since independence, the Zimbabwe Government has followed a policy of reconciliation after a long and bitter war. The importance given by Mr Mugabe 's Government to co-operation and harmony between the different peoples of Zimbabwe has also received recognition from leading white Zimbabweans. A number of white MPs, formerly members of the white Republican Front Party, recently announced their intention to sit in Parliament as independents in order to help build an atmosphere of trust and confidence, and so as to be able to work more closely with Prime Minister Mugabe.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. The 1981/82 Budget brought down on 31 July 1981 did not single out white citizens for the imposition of severe economic restrictions. Economic measures introduced by the Zimbabwe Government in the Budget-including increases in sales tax, duty on petrol, customs surtax and estate duty-as well as a reduction in the holiday allowance, i.e. foreign exchange that may be taken abroad for vacation purposes, apply to all citizens of Zimbabwe.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) While I have no information to confirm or deny this particular report, I am aware that it is Zimbabwe Government policy to remove segregation along racial lines in all schools. On independence the Zimbabwe Government inherited a dual system of education catering on the one hand for the whites, coloured and Asians , and on the other for the blacks. The Government has merged these two education divisions and is according priority to the lengthy process of developing unified curricula.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Yes. In December last year Zimbabwean authorities announced that Rhodesia passports and Zimbabwe/Rhodesia passports would not be valid after 20 January 1982 and that Zimbabwean citizens travelling outside their country must be in possession of a Zimbabwe passport.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The future role of the North Korean-trained Brigade of the Zimbabwe National Army is not entirely clear, but at this stage it seems an exaggeration to say it will act as an internal police force without normal police restraints. There are five Brigades in the Zimbabwe National Army and one of these is currently being trained by North Korean advisers under an agreement due to expire in May this year. Early reports on the intended role of the Fifth Brigade quoted Mr Mugabe as saying it would be a special unit to be sent to trouble spots in Zimbabwe. Subsequent reports however, suggested that the Brigade was likely to remain a normal part of the Zimbabwe National Army, to be used within Zimbabwe's borders for defensive purposes only. Mr Mugabe said in answer to a question in Parliament on 15 September 1981 that the main reason North Korean military instructors were in Zimbabwe was to train Zimbabwean troops in the use of arms provided by North Korea.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Since its enactment in 1930, the sales tax has provided that, generally, sales tax is to be paid no later than 21 days after the close of the month in which the taxable transactions occurs. The question of extending this time has been considered on many occasions by Governments and by independent taxation review committees since 1930. It has always been recognised that it is a matter of balancing the varying credit terms of taxpayers (including many who deal on a cash basis) with the needs of the revenue. It would not be administratively feasible to have one due date for taxpayers who deal on a cash basis and another for those who deal on credit terms. It also needs to be borne in mind that, if the proposal contained in the article referred to in the honourable senator's question were implemented, there would be a cost to the revenue of about $250m in the year in which the charge was made.</PARA>
<PARA> While the proposals to amend the machinery and liability provisions of the sales tax law announced by me on 20 August 1981 do not specifically cover the matter raised by the honourable senator, the Government will, in light of representations it has received, consider the time for payment question in the context of its review of the other changes to the machinery and liability provisions of the law.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Following an application by the Government of the Republic of Ireland to the European Commission on Human Rights in December 1974, the European Court of Human Rights found in a judgment handed down in January 1978 that the combined use of certain interrogation techniques by the British Government in Northern Ireland constituted inhuman and degrading treatment but did not amount to torture. The British Government did not contest the finding but noted that the practices in question had been voluntarily and publicly abandoned in 1972 with substantial compensation being paid to those involved.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. In the light of recommendations of the Amnesty International Report of June 1978, an independent Committee of Inquiry, chaired by Judge H. G. Bennett, was established the same month to consider police interrogation practices and procedures in Northern Ireland. The British Government has stated that virtually all the 66 major conclusions and recommendations of this Committee's report have been accepted and put into effect.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government did not comment either upon the Amnesty International report or on the report of the Committee of Inquiry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. The terms of reference required the Commission, chaired by Lord Diplock, to consider 'what arrangements for the administration of justice in Northern Ireland could be made in order to deal more effectively with terrorist organisations by bringing to book, otherwise than by internment by the Executive , individuals involved in terrorist activities, particularly those who plan and direct, but not necessarily take part in, terrorist acts, and to make recommendations'.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Diplock Commission concluded that because of experience with the intimidation of jurors, trial by jury was not practicable in certain classes of offence in Northern Ireland, designated as 'scheduled offences'.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Trials of those accused of such offences are conducted in open court before four judges without a jury, with the prosecution having the onus to provide guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The accused has the right to take legal advice, to be represented by a lawyer and has full rights of appeal. Those accused of ' schedule offences' can however be detained up to forty-eight hours without being charged or having access to legal representation.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not aware of any offence being constituted merely by failure to respond to questions. I am also advised that these provisions are subject to regular public scrutiny through twice-yearly House of Commons debates and to regular mandatory renewal by Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Australian Government has made known its concern about the complex and tragic situation in Northern Ireland. The Government believes, however, that the problems in that troubled region are essentially a domestic matter for the local people and the British Government to resolve. For its part, the British Government has publicly acknowledged that measures to prevent terrorism in Northern Ireland have regrettably made inroads into civil liberties. At the same time, the British Government has stressed the temporary nature of these measures and the regular Parliamentary review procedures which apply to them. I reiterate the Australian Government's hope for an early end to the troubles and a return to normal life in Northern Ireland, including of course the full restoration of the civil liberties of its inhabitants.</PARA>

For the same periods direct sales by Air Queensland increased 32.6 per cent and 55.1 per cent respectively over the previous year's levels. Qantas therefore believe the conditions have been met.</PARA>
<PARA> (g) Yes. Several foreign airlines with their own sales offices in Queensland have Ansett and TAA under appointment as general sales agents in the State. The same practice occurs in other States of Australia as well as in other countries, not only with Qantas but also with other airlines.</PARA>
<PARA> (h) It is the Company's assessment that at the time of Air Queensland's appointment, Qantas' market share and exploitation of potential travel markets in the area were inadequate and the level of revenues earned through IATA agents in the area was unsatisfactory. The estimated cost of mounting an effective sales coverage to reverse the trend involved considerable cost increases particularly in staff because of the vast distances between centres in North Queensland and the limited accessibility of the area. Consideration of the general sales agent option showed this to be a more cost-effective arrangement. Air Queensland, with its strong route structure, own route agency network, and growing status and dominance in Queensland was ideally placed to take on the general sales agent role.</PARA>

<PARA> Yes; the requirement for operations manuals to be approved by the Secretary to the Department of Transport was deleted from Air Navigation Regulation 212 in 1971. The reason why the need for approval was deleted was because the bulk of the information required by Regulation 212 to be included in an operations manual must be devised by the operator and does not need to be specifically approved by the Department. Notwithstanding the amendment, provision was retained under Regulation 212 for the Secretary, or his delegate, to direct the inclusion, revision or variation of any information contained in the manual.

<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is aware of the reference by Mr Krumins, Chairman of the Ethnic Affairs Commission, to the possibility of the introduction of Channel 0-28 Multicultural Television to South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is yet to consider the extension of the multi-cultural television service beyond Sydney and Melbourne though it is conscious of its success and the demand from other areas for a similar service. However, before the service can be extended, the competing claims of a variety of areas for this new service will have to be evaluated.</PARA>
<PARA> The capital cost of establishing UHF transmitting facilities in other Capital cities, including Adelaide, is estimated at between $700,000 and $1m per city. Annual operational costs will vary according to the city. For Adelaide, these are estimated to be approximately $400,000. It should be noted, however, that SBS anticipates that the costs of purchasing programs for screening will rise substantially as the number of Australians able to receive Channel 0-28 outside Sydney and Melbourne increases.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister assisting the Prime Minister has supplied the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Administrative Services has advised that as a matter of policy departments and authorities provide housing only where necessary for the efficient discharge of Government functions such as where there is not an acceptable rental market or where an employee is required to live on an establishment. Employees are charged rental for such accommodation. Rents for housing vary, common charges currently being 10 per cent of salary or economic rental (that is recovery of capital costs and recurrent expenses) whichever is the lesser. The bases for these charges are presently under review.</PARA>
<PARA> As a matter of policy, employees are not assisted to purchase housing through subsidised interest rates. Where, for example, surplus Government housing stock is sold on terms to employees in occupation, the interest rate charged is that notified by the Department of Finance from time to time.

<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has agreed to match the Queensland Government's subsidy to Trans Australia Airlines for continuation of F27 services to western Queensland . This involves up to $1m per annum contribution by each Government for 1982-83 and 1983-84 with a review at the end of 1982-83. The new arrangements are expected to commence on or about 1 May 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> In deciding to provide a subsidy both the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments agreed that a rationalisation of services was necessary to reduce the losses incurred by TAA while at the same time maintaining an appropriate standard of service. Although detailed administrative arrangements have not been finalised between the two Governments and TAA, frequency reductions will occur on both the Townsville/Mt Isa and Brisbane/Central Queensland routes. The only service to be withdrawn is the once weekly Birdsville/Alice Springs sector .</PARA>
<PARA> On the Townsville/Mt Isa route, the overall frequency of F27 services will be reduced from seven to four per week with one weekly service reduction to Hughenden, Richmond, Julia Creek and Cloncurry. Reduced direct F27 services between Townsville and Mt Isa are offset by increased direct jet services. TAA' s annual loss on this route can be reduced from $1.3m to $0.8m.</PARA>
<PARA> On the Brisbane/Central Queensland route, the new arrangements will include one service from Brisbane to Charleville and one return service to Longreach and Winton.

<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following additional information to the answer I gave to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> It is correct that all western delegations have now accepted the principle of universal jurisdiction. It is not possible however at this stage to determine when negotiations on the Convention will be completed. There are still a number of important substantive issues to be resolved, especially those relating to the implementation of the Convention. One such issue is the nature of the body to be established to oversee the operation of the Convention. The recently concluded 38th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights adopted a resolution providing for the open-ended working group considering the draft Convention to meet for the period of one week prior to the 39th Session of the Commission scheduled for February 1983 to enable the group to complete its work on the draft Convention.</PARA>

<PARA> Finally, approximately what percentage of crude oil imports over the last three months has been purchased for Australian distribution at prices below those set by the Saudi Light crude bench-mark?</PARA>
<PARA> I undertook to secure this information, together with information on oil purchases from countries other than Saudi Arabia.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Details of crude oil shipments are reported to my Department but, because of the commercial-in-confidence nature of each company's information, I am not in a position to release details of individual shipments.</PARA>
<PARA> In aggregate the returns from the oil companies show that in the three months December 1981 to February 1982 crude oil imports totalled 2.5 million tonnes, of which 49 per cent was Saudi Arabian Light crude oil. The remainder comprised heavier crudes from Saudi Arabia (13 per cent) and crudes from other Middle East countries (11 per cent) and Indonesia (27 per cent).</PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of the information supplied by the companies it would appear that practically all of these cargoes were imported at prices close to official government selling prices. The lowest price paid for Saudi Arabian Light crude, for example, was $US33.9748 per barrel, which compares with the official selling price of $US34. Small variations above and below official selling prices can arise because of variations in the specific gravity (*API) of the individual oil cargoes involved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 10 March 1982 (Hansard, page 637): Senator Mason asked me as the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Does the Minister agree with the broadly expressed professional view that because of its high profile, relatively slow full speed of 28 knots and relative scarcity of defensive armament, HMS Invincible would be highly vulnerable to guided missile attack in time of war? Is it still the case, as the Minister for Defence informed me on 11 September 1980 in answer to a question on notice, that there is no available defence system in the world against such missiles fired in salvos? Is it a fact that most nations including some of Australia's near neighbours, have the ability to fire missiles in salvos? Is it not a fact that a determined missile attack from the sea or the air would sink Invincible if she were armed to the extent of Government announcements so far? Does the Government propose to equip Invincible with the Phalanx quick-firing gun system which can provide some defence against small numbers of missiles? If so, what will be the cost?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> HMS Invincible is less vulnerable to missile attack than other smaller less capable ships. Her size enables the installation of many damage control features and the use of specific design criteria which minimise the effects of battle damage, in the unlikely event that this should occur. Furthermore, it must be remembered that this ship will operate with other ships of the Royal Australian Navy as part of an integrated group exploiting the principle of concentration of force. Such a group's anti-ship missile defences are provided by a wide range of weapons and tactics which are available to the group, for example, anti-aircraft missile and gun systems, electronic counter measures, and active and passive deception techniques. The effectiveness of these measures is enhanced because they can be employed in a co-ordinated fashion by the group commander using the excellent facilities available in Invincible.</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it remains true that no single system exists which can defeat a large number of missiles arriving at a ship simultaneously, it should be understood that the defence of a group of ships does not rely on the effectiveness of one single system, but rather on the cumulative effect of a number of systems. Successful anti-ship missile defence rests with the effective employment of supporting aircraft and ships, ship board electronic counter measures and decoy systems, area defence surface to air missile systems, and self defence gun and missile systems, to firstly attempt to destroy the launch platform or confuse its targeting picture and then engage or decoy any missiles which may be fired. It is relevant that the Exocet missile referred to in answer to Question on Notice No. 3179 (Hansard, page 1425 of 19 September 1980) must be fired from ranges well within the range of the Harpoon surface to surface missile fitted in RAN FFGs, and it would be most unlikely that any attacking craft could ever achieve a firing position. Additionally, the level of co-ordination required for a number of units to achieve a simultaneous salvo attack is extremely difficult even when unopposed. In the face of opposition it is next to impossible. It is relevant that the much vaunted ability of missile firing patrol boats is of limited application in our area because of their relatively short range, susceptibility to weather and extreme vulnerability to air attack. The difficulties I have outlined above, apply to those navies which do have craft with the potential to fire missiles in salvos.</PARA>
<PARA> Equally, provided the range of area and self defence measures discussed above is available, it cannot be said that a determined missile attack from sea or air would sink Invincible if she were armed to the extent of Government announcements so far.</PARA>
<PARA> The question of fitting Phalanx Close-in Weapon Systems is being examined in the context of the special study into the question of whether or not to retain the Sea Dart area air defence missile system, which was announced in my statement concerning the purchase of HMS Invincible. Decisions relating to the possible enhancement of Invincible's existing air defence capability will be taken after consideration of the results of this study.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 11 March 1982 (Hansard, page 700), Senator Hill asked me a question, without notice, concerning industrial research and development in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Science and Technology has supplied the following additional advice to the answer I gave the honourable senator on that occasion:</PARA>
<PARA> The latest figures available as a basis for comparisons (1978-79) show that, while Australia may be considered among the medium level research and development performers of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, private business enterprises and public sector businesses (for example utilities) performed only 23 per cent of the total value of research and development in Australia. The same joint category of businesses in other OECD countries generally performed between 45 per cent and 75 per cent of national research and development.</PARA>
<PARA> This comparatively low level of proportionate performance of research and development by business enterprises in Australia is of concern to the Government. In recognition of this, and to induce greater research and development by private industry, the Government has:</PARA>
<PARA> increased the financial incentives provided through the Industrial Research and Development Incentive scheme to industry to undertake research and development both as it affects the individual company and at the aggregate level;</PARA>
<PARA> encouraged Government departments and instrumentalities, including Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, to stimulate more industrial research and development through establishment of closer links with industry and through adoption of a policy of contracting out wherever practicable;</PARA>
<PARA> strengthened and developed its procurement and 'offset' policies to encourage the introduction into and development within Australia of high technology with associated industrial research and development; and</PARA>
<PARA> promoted debate on the need for and effect of technological change and, by implication, industrial research and development through establishment of a Technological Change Committee to the Australian Science and Technology Council .</PARA>
<PARA> The effect of these positive measures may be influenced by Government decisions taken in the light of the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission following its inquiries into 'Certain Budgetary Assistance to Industry' and 'Approaches to General Reductions in Protection'. Clearly, it would be improper for me to speculate on these influences at this time.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> There were 46 general aviation aircraft accidents-including commuters-in the first two months of 1982. Although this was five more accidents than occurred in the first two months of 1981 it was only one more than the figure for the same two months averaged over the preceding three years.</PARA>
<PARA> This situation supports the view that little reliance should be placed upon relatively low accident numbers representing short time periods. The doctrine of regression to the mean is almost certain to operate.</PARA>
<PARA> The much more significant statistical information is that, between 1971 and 1980, the number of general aviation accidents per 100,000 hours flown in this country reduced steadily from 21.93 to 14.09. Not all general aviation activities shared equally in this improvement. Private and business flying, particularly, did not match the other areas but I believe the recent introduction of the biennial flight review will go a long way towards remedying that situation.</PARA>

<PARA> 'The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Trade and commerce with other countries, and among the States:'</PARA>

<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and it refers to public telephones. I preface it by saying that I note from a letter I received a couple of years ago from Telecom Australia that it anticipated income of some $1,100 from each public telephone before a new one was installed. Of course I realise that that figure may now be somewhat higher. Now that Telecom has decided to increase public telephone calls to 20 cents, will this mean that Telecom will re-examine the number of public telephones that are installed and consequently install many more so that those people who are without a private telephone will have a public telephone more easily available to them?</PARA>
<PARA> Will Telecom convert most telephones to take 50 cent pieces as well as 20 cent pieces so that people who make subscriber trunk dialling calls, long distance calls, will not get arm ache from putting the 20 cent pieces in?</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, will Telecom convert as many public telephones as possible to the international subscriber dialling system so that people without that service available to them at home will have it available at public telephones?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's question:-</PARA>
<PARA> As background to the honourable senator's questions, Telcom advises that the loss on the public telephone service in the 1980-81 was about $43.3m or the equivalent of over $1.350 per public telephone in service at the end of that year.</PARA>
<PARA> The figure of $1,100 quoted by the honourable senator was assessed some years ago and has the average annual revenue used as a guide in determining whether a public telephone should be installed at a particular location. Clearly, in the light of the above loss figure, $1,100 is insufficient to offset the network costs of handling calls from the unit plus the maintenance and continuing running costs of clearing, cleaning and lighting the unit itself. The figure of $1,100 is therefore being re-assessed in view of cost increases to Telecom since it was first established.</PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the honourable senator's specific queries, the recent increase in the public telephone fee was designed to help offset the high loss being incurred on the public telephone service rather than to provide additional public telephones which will continue to be installed in particular locations on the basis of expected revenue and community needs.</PARA>
<PARA> There are currently some 26,000 of the new type green public telephones in service. Whilst similar in appearance, there are two types-the CT3 and the CT3 (I)-and, because of the technical and cost considerations, the earlier CT3 units (some 20,000) will be conveted to 20c operation only. Of the remaining 6, 000 CT3 (I) units, 2,500 will be converted to 20/50c operation in 1982-83 at a relatively low cost. Also, 2,000 new type public telephones will be installed in 1982-83 and these will have 20/50c operation.</PARA>
<PARA> The 20/50c units will be available in areas with a high incidence of STD and/ or ISD usage. Telecom will convert as many public telephones to ISD as is practicable bearing in mind particular local exchange equipment restrictions an the need for such a service. It will also give consideration to 'out of area' provision of ISD public telephone facilities in areas where the local exhange equipment is not suitable for ISD and where subscriber requirements justify such action, for example, where there is a high level of overseas calls being booked through operators from public telephones.</PARA>
