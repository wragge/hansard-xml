<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of Senator Bolkus, I present the following petition from 44 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that the Health Care Card System introduced on September 1st for low income, unemployed, pensioners and other beneficiaries discriminates against the unemployed by its exclusion of pharmaceutical, optical and other entitlements to unemployed people . This discrimination results in greater hardship and distress to the unemployed and their dependants, and reduces their access to essential health facilities by increasing the onerous burden of health charges on this group which can least afford it.</PARA>
<PARA> This discrimination is a further example of the government's harsh and insensitive treatment toward the unemployed and their families, and creates unnecessary divisions within Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should review the health care card system and extend the benefits for pharmaceutical, optical and other entitlements to the unemployed (in line with the recent recommendation of the Australian Medical Association).</PARA>

The humble petition of the undersigned Citizens of South Australia respectfully showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned at the special privileges bestowed on the Deputy Prime Minister Mr Anthony M.P. and the Minister for Primary Industry Mr Nixon M.P.-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) That in 1964 a Liberal/Country Party Government granted Mr Anthony M.P. a Commonwealth Government Home Loan Mortgage of $17,964 for a period of 45 years at a fixed interest rate of 4.75% and that at 1.10.81 the amount of principal outstanding was $15,005.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) That in 1970 a Liberal/Country Party Government granted Mr Nixon M.P. a Commonwealth Government Home Loan Mortgage of $30,352 for a period of 45 years at a fixed interest rate of 6.25% and that at 1.10.81 the amount of principal outstanding was $28,404.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) PVR will aggravate the free exchange of genetic material for plant breeding .</PARA>
<PARA> (2) PVR will not enhance Australia's access to improved plant varieties developed overseas but will encourage the dumping of unsuitable varieties on the Australian market.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Leader of the Government in the Senate to a statement on 29 April last year by the honourable member for Kooyong, Mr Peacock , in a speech giving the reasons for his resignation from the Cabinet, and to the fact that he complained about the Prime Minister's establishment of a so- called co-ordination committee. Mr Peacock referred to the committee as 'a powerful new element of government' superimposed over other Cabinet committees and, in effect, over Cabinet itself. I ask: Does this committee comprise the leaders and deputy leaders of the Liberal Party and the National Country Party? Is its role to discuss the entire range of departmental and ministerial responsibilities? Is the committee still operating? Does it consult with other Cabinet Ministers? Is the Minister in agreement or otherwise with the opinion expressed by Mr Peacock that it crushes the Cabinet system and is outrageous to the parliamentary system?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the practice in, I think, virtually all the democratic parliaments of the world that have Cabinet systems of government that within the Cabinet system there are a variety of committees and indeed a small committee for special purposes which normally consists of the more senior Ministers. It has been the practice of this Government to have such committees over the years. They vary from time to time. There is a co-ordination committee. It comprises the leaders and deputy leaders, including the Government Leader in the Senate. They are fully responsible to the full Cabinet. Matters of significance that would normally involve full Cabinet are referred to full Cabinet and a decision is made in full Cabinet. I would reject entirely any criticism of the arrangement. It is a normal function of government common, I believe, in virtually every parliament that has a Cabinet system.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate by reminding him that a large number of Army and civilian personnel were employed at various atomic weapons testing areas around Australia during the period when testing was taking place. I have been advised by one of the former employees that he was refused a life assurance policy because he had been employed at one of those sites. Can the Minister inform the Parliament whether all persons who were similarly employed have been refused cover by all insurance companies or does this apply to some insurance companies only?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Keeffe may know that I have authorised, as the Minister responsible, a total contact with all persons now living, whether civilians or military personnel, who were associated with atomic tests in the Maralinga, Emu and Monte Bello Island areas. I have authorised also an extensive test of the reasons for the deaths of those no longer alive. We have already completed a pilot study which indicates to us that we can go ahead with the extensive study. We believe that there were something like 15,000 Australians, from various Services as well as civilians, involved altogether. I think we have located the records of the best part of 10,000 of those. I say that as a preface to give Senator Keeffe some idea of the nature of the details we are seeking. We then seek information on where those individuals were located, their likelihood of exposure and the dosimeters that were worn or that should have been worn to show any radiation. We do this to gain some background upon which to work. We widely publicised this. We are getting a considerable amount of correspondence from the community apart from that relating to the pilot scheme. I have never heard of a refusal by an insurance company to grant a life assurance policy because a person has served in those areas. That is not to say that it has not happened, or that it has not been mentioned in responses to us. I will direct the question to my Department for attention to see whether we have had any such responses. If there are any such people in the community I earnestly urge them to come forward and let us know because we want to contact them all. We have a completely genuine desire to make a thorough test, to find out what we can. Perhaps Senator Keeffe will give me the details of that individual. In the generality I widen that request to others.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. In the light of the deficiencies shown by the Price Waterhouse Associates Pty study into meat export controls, such as inadequate segregation of domestic and export meat, seals on cartons being broken during handling and the like, will the Minister give an assurance that recommendations by the Price Waterhouse group will be given more than lip service and that inspectors will be more solidly backed up by management in their policing of the new inspection procedures?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry issued a media release on 20 January about the matter raised by the honourable senator. At that time Mr Nixon indicated what action he was taking on the report and also made copies of the report available to the Press. He described the report as confirming that the general approach taken in introducing the new measures was the correct one and he said that the report confirmed generally the approach adopted by the Government on these matters. Much of the subsequent media coverage concentrated on what they saw as being deficiencies in the controls as implemented without providing the balance of citing corrective action which was taken as soon as problems were identified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In all, the Department of Primary Industry has identified 60 separate recommendations or suggestions put forward in the report by Price Waterhouse. Many of those will need prior consultation with the industry and with the authorities of Australia's customer countries. On 20 January the Minister personally initiated consultations with the industry, and he met again with industry leaders earlier this month. He does not propose to pre-empt those consultations by commenting in the interim on the specifics in the report. But it is quite clear from the attitude which the Minister has adopted that he will pursue all those recommendations to ensure that Australia's meat exports are protected to the greatest extent possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Finance whether it is correct that the Government has held discussions with Australian banks on the question of deregulating interest rates generally and, in particular, housing interest rates . Is it correct that the banks have pressed the Government very firmly either to deregulate or to allow them to increase their rates, including home interest rates, substantially? Can the Minister give categorical assurances that the Government has not decided to take one of these two courses but to defer any action until after the Lowe by-election and the Victorian election and that interest rates, particularly housing interest rates, which are being artificially depressed now will not be increased within three months following the Victorian election on 3 April?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; There is considerable detail in the question asked by the Leader of the Australian Democrats. In general terms, I can say that the Government is giving consideration to matters related to housing. Of course, that implies that discussions are being held with a number of people. It is common knowledge that the Treasurer meets with the banks for discussions, but I am not in any position to deal with the details of the question. I am not in possession of the full details of any discussions that may be held by the Treasurer with organisations which directly concern his responsibility. Senator Chipp asked whether interest rates would be increased within three months of the Victorian election. I think that type of question is very hypothetical whether it relates to interest rates or anything else. However, I undertake to refer the matter urgently to the Treasurer and to seek a response from him.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill referred to Press reports about the European Parliament. Indeed, such a motion was carried in that Parliament. I understand that the resolution will now have to go back to the constituent countries for further action. The resolution passed by the European Parliament is not of itself binding or necessarily effective. In relation to what the Australian Government has done, I am advised that the Federal Government has taken a strong stand generally and has taken positive action in relation to the issue of the import and export of wildlife and wildlife products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised that the Government intends to introduce very shortly the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Imports and Exports) Bill which will strengthen existing controls on exports and imports of wildlife. The legislation is designed to control better the export of Australian native species and it would also extend coverage from existing Customs regulations to include animals and plant species added to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species which, as Senator Hill would know, was ratified by Australia in 1976. The legislation will also provide a mechanism for prohibiting the imports of animal products and wildlife even if the species involved are not actually endangered-if there are other reasons why they should be prohibited. The Government would be prepared to consider the banning of all seal products under this provision of the new Bill in the light of significant Australian public reaction to the current Canadian seal harvest. I understand that consultations on the legislation which I have described are in an advanced stage with the Northern Territory and the States.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without having read the Age newspaper this morning, I cannot pick up the details or confirm for the honourable senator whether a Minister said this or said that or made certain comments. It is quite clear though that the honourable senator seems to misunderstand the problem of resistant staphylococci and what that means in hospitals. Misunderstanding the problem, he is suggesting what are really quite facile and inappropriate solutions. The golden staph has been around for many years. When I was a medical student in the late 1950s it was a problem then and people were dying from golden staph infection. The problem is not one that will be solved by money alone. To put it in terms of a solution which can be found by opening the money coffers and pouring money in is to misstate and to misrepresent the problem. It is a problem which goes to the capacity of organisms to change their nature and resistance. This is neither a recent problem nor a problem which has become markedly worse. It is a problem which relates to the way we use antibiotics and to cross-infection in hospitals. I know Mr Borthwick would be approaching this matter with sensitivity, care and responsibility. Money alone will not be appropriate to solve the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. This week there has been strong criticism of the industrial disruption and resultant high costs within the shipping and waterfront industries by the President of the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association, Mr Allwright. Is it a fact that the proliferation of unions is a major cause of the significant disruption? If it costs half as much to get containers from Melbourne to Rotterdam as it does to get them from Tasmania to Melbourne, what chance do Australian primary producers and manufacturers have of competing with overseas imports? Will the Minister have the costs of compulsory use of Australian shipping for our coastal trade examined, as we are told by the Germans that our port loading costs are four times higher than those which apply anywhere else in the world?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the second time over recent weeks that Senator Archer has raised this very vexed matter in the Senate. In my previous answer to him I stressed the concern of the Government and of the Minister for Industrial Relations at the continued disruption on the waterfront. I pointed out also that the matter had been raised at the Premiers Conference and the State Labour Ministers Conference and that discussions are to be held with employers and unions in the waterfront and maritime areas. At the State Labour Ministers Conference all Ministers agreed to examine their respective industrial jurisdictions to see what further steps, if any, might be taken to facilitate the process of settling demarcation disputes. In other words, the Ministers from all States were expressing concern about the central issue in the question which has been raised by Senator Archer this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those discussions are now being arranged. It is my hope and the hope of the Minister that they will help to improve the industrial relations climate in these industries. My colleague, Mr Viner, is examining ways of strengthening the role of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to resolve demarcation disputes. How that can be achieved needs very careful thought, but the process which has developed will place emphasis on conciliation and arbitration being exploited to the fullest extent possible. The Government has also foreshadowed that legislation to enable the creation of industry unions will be introduced to the Parliament during these sittings. That legislation will provide the means for a single waterfront union to represent the interests of all waterfront employees should they so desire and will go a long way towards overcoming the level of industrial disruption in the area.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Archer raised some very specific questions about cost and compared the cost of getting containers from Melbourne to Rotterdam with the cost of getting them from Tasmania to Melbourne. He referred to the difficulty that that poses for Australian primary producers and manufacturers when they are competing with overseas imports. It is axiomatic that an efficient system of transport, including efficiency on the waterfront and in the shipping industry, is central to the welfare of Australia's primary producers and manufacturers and all exporters. The extent to which our use of Australian shipping is counterproductive is a matter which needs careful examination.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Archer referred to the fact that our port loading costs are four times higher than anywhere else in the world. Without having the detail before me I think that figure would probably apply whether we were using overseas shipping or coastal shipping. But within the context of a concern for our exporters the Commonwealth is also concerned to try to encourage Australian shipping. The present Minister for Transport, Mr Hunt, has certainly directed his attention to the possibility of extending Australian involvement in shipping. I think all Australians-indeed all honourable senators-would support that in principle. The difficulty for us as a government and for Australia as a country is that unless the trade unions involved are a co-operative part of that process of encouraging participation the fears which were expressed in Senator Archer's question are valid and certainly will tell against any effort to maintain even existing Australian involvement in that area let alone be the basis of some expansion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, relates to a number of rumours that have been circulating in regard to payments made under the supporting parents legislation. I ask the Minister: Have any changes been proposed or made to payments being made under the 1973 supporting parents legislation? I ask also: Have any changes been made to the system of counter cheques being paid in cases of emergency to those people who can gain a benefit under that legislation?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="781" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only change that I am aware of that has been introduced by this Government with respect to the Act to which the honourable senator referred in his question is that during the life of this Government and during the term of office of Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, my predecessor as Minister for Social Security, the benefit was extended to supporting parents as against supporting mothers. The benefit was made available to those fathers in the difficult position of trying alone to look after small children. So although the relative numbers are small, a significant group of Australians dealing with children under conditions of hardship has received additional assistance to that which was originally available under the 1973 legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No doubt the question and the rumours referred to in the question arise out of the concern which has been expressed in a number of quarters about the very considerable expansion of the number of people receiving the supporting parent's benefit. That expansion would appear to be very largely related to the large number of broken marriages. The major proportion of supporting parents are the victims-if 'victims' is the correct description-of broken marriages. There has been a significant change. It is an area of increasing expenditure and it is understandable therefore that there should be expressions of interest both within political parties and in the general community. A number of things which are relevant to that situation are under consideration. A recommendation of a parliamentary committee which relates to the question of the collection of maintenance is being examined by the Attorney-General and me and by our respective departments. That does not amount to any suggestion that there be a restriction on the benefit but goes to provisions of the Family Law Act which relate payments of maintenance or orders for the payment of maintenance to the availability of social security benefits.</PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect which is no more than a very distant gleam in someone's eye-if it is a gleam in anyone's eye-is the New Zealand experiment in this area. The New Zealand Government has introduced a new system of having a departmental assessment of the contribution by the non-supporting parent. That was described to a couple of meetings of the Council of Social Welfare Ministers by the attending New Zealand Minister. It is a matter of some interest. It is a very new scheme in New Zealand. It certainly has teething problems and all Australian Ministers are watching that development with interest. For the rest, there are no proposals in train which would change conditions of that benefit. In this area, as in other areas, I would welcome some public discussion as long as it is sensible and constructive. I think the fact that that area is probably the largest growth area in the social security system reflects some changes in Australian society which may not be altogether beneficial. I think we ought to be looking at the extent to which the benefit system is performing the function that we would want. It is quite clear that this Government, like the previous Government, is concerned to see that those Australians who are, for the reason that they have the care of children, unable to provide support for themselves should be assisted by their fellow Australian taxpayers.</PARA>

I now put to the Minister: In view of the fact that most nations have knock for knock arrangements to meet this situation, is it true that citizens of Australia and the United States, which countries lack a national health scheme and are in bondage to private schemes, will not have cover after September should they have the misfortune to be ill in Britain and to enter a British hospital?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that a series of arrangements is in existence between the United Kingdom and Australia under which United Kingdom visitors to Australia receive the following health benefits: Nursing home benefits, domiciliary nursing care benefits and pharmaceutical benefits under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It is only when it comes to private medical services or hospital services that they would not be covered unless they had private health insurance. Public hospital in-patient and out-patient services are matters for the State governments to determine. If any of them want to provide United Kingdom visitors with services without charge, that is a matter entirely for them to decide. They now receive the money which was previously administered by the Commonwealth and they can decide how it is to be used.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator has asked a question in one of the many areas where we seem to be moving towards a bipartisan policy in Australian politics. We now all agree-except the Australian Democrats-that the Senate can block a Budget, when it wishes to, in reprehensible circumstances. That is a new common point which we have arrived at. Apparently there is agreement, too, that we should not have a capital gains tax and there appears to be agreement that we should not have a means test either. Those people in Australia who loathe the fact that Australian politics is so divisive must be greatly enjoying this newfound mood of oneness that seems to be pervading both the left and right in Australia. However, the question which was asked by the honourable senator relates to the Prime Minister's letter. Of course the letter contains a series of statements of fact which are true and I will not seek to place a gloss on them. I was aware of what the Prime Minister was writing.

Investment activity has been strong. We all regret the unemployment figures that were released recently. A number of factors do need to be taken into account. I think, in particular, we are all anxiously awaiting the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission's response to the matters before it because if we are to see improved employment opportunities we need to recognise that interest rates, wage demands and other things are very important indeed in relation to providing the confidence that will enable people to go ahead and expand the employment opportunities in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that last Thursday Senator Robertson asked me a question about the Evidence Amendment Bill that had been introduced by Mr Everingham that day in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. At that stage I was not aware of what had occurred. Later in the day I became aware of the matter. I received a telex from Mr Collins, the Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory. I think that message was probably received by a number of senators. Senator Evans, in the adjournment debate in the Senate on Thursday evening, lent his support to the concern expressed. I have considered the matters raised by Mr Collins, Senator Evans and Senator Robertson. Other senators have also expressed concern to me, in particular Senator Baume, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. The position is that I do not believe that there is any need for this Parliament to take any action to amend or clarify the powers under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act as a result of the action that has been taken in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, even assuming that that becomes law .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a well established principle of law which was first enunciated in the High Court of Australia as far back as 1929 in the case of the Federal Capital Commission and Laristan Building and Investment Co.

The Commissioner's powers to require evidence are stated in fairly wide terms in section 54 of the Aboriginal Lands Rights (Northern Territory) Act. As far as I am aware, he has successfully operated under that provision without difficulty. Therefore, the mere passage of legislation by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, which may be thought to detract from the power of the Commissioner to seek evidence of the kind covered by the Bill, would offend the principle of the High Court case which I mentioned. It would not have any effect on the existing powers of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One Australian in three lives in rural and provincial areas of Australia. Those areas earn almost a half of our export income and constitute a key component in our national life. I think it is important in considering policies in relation to those areas to realise that not all Australians who live outside metropolitan areas live on farms; they live in small towns and in large provincial cities. They have always been, with various degrees of assessment, a disadvantaged group, particularly disadvantaged in relation to the delivery of government services. I believe that is something which ought to be acknowledged by all political parties, especially the National Country Party, which has pretended to safeguard country interests- the real interests safeguarded by the Country Party being, of course, sectional ones. For the last 20 years at least those interests have been only tenuously connected with country areas-that Party's interest principally being in mining companies, mostly foreign. There is little doubt about who bankrolls the Country Party; one has only to look at the favours that have been done for the mining industry over many years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Briefly, there are three areas that need attention in rural and provincial Australia from the point of view of government. The first is the need for detailed understanding of the level of disadvantage which country people suffer as compared with people in the cities. Secondly, I think it is important to understand the withdrawal of government or public services from country people which has taken place over the last six years. Thirdly, it is important to understand the ad hoc way in which policies of assistance for non-metropolitan areas have been formulated and the failure of the Government, or governments, to come to grips with decentralisation issues in a time of significant movements of population within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> What becomes clear in any examination of rural and provincial Australia is the lack of real knowledge of the question of social disadvantage. It is quite clear that there are shortcomings in the delivery of basic services such as health, education housing, transport and communications. These services affect the general quality of life and they are frequently in turn affected by the great distances involved in non-metropolitan Australia. Other disadvantages such as a lack of employment opportunities and deficiencies in social, cultural and sporting facilities stem from the dispersed nature of country population. In country areas it costs more money to provide such services for the people than it does in the cities. The last six years of cost cutting-I do not want to enter into this debate today as it is an issue which we debate often enough here-often aimlessly and carried out without constructive forethought has had the effect of further eroding the delivery of basic services in the country. The effect of these policies since 1975 can be detailed or referred to briefly under various headings. The first is reduced funds for roads. Despite higher costs, real funding for roads has been substantially reduced. There is agreement about that, from the secretaries of nearly every shire council in Australia to the Premier of Queensland, Mr Joh Bjelke-Petersen, who made a statement about it as recently as last Saturday. The National Farmers Federation raised this matter in its publication 'Farm Focus: The 80s' when it said:</PARA>
<PARA> Considerable upgrading is necessary if the road system is to meet the needs of the 80s . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to deal with that issue at some length. </PARA>
<PARA> The second manifestation of disadvantage is in petrol prices. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, rural or provincial households spend nearly 10 per cent of their income on liquid fuel compared with 3 per cent spent by Australians living in metropolitan households. Considerations of petrol prices for country areas, freight equalisation and so on flow from that situation. Another area concerns natural gas, the acquisition of which gives country communities a greater chance to compete for new industry with coastal cities. I was talking not so long ago to the Mayor of Wagga Wagga about this very problem. He pointed out the range of new industries which the Council has been able to attract to that city because of the provision of natural gas. In my State of Victoria, programs to provide natural gas to towns such as Stawell and Ararat have been talked about for a long time but have not been implemented. The same comment can be made about the New South Wales towns of Lithgow, Bathurst and Orange. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) specifically promised that natural gas would be provided to those cities by pipeline, and they are still waiting some several years after that promise was made. </PARA>
<PARA> A range of other issues abound in relation to the country. The effects of housing policies are more dramatic in country areas than perhaps they are in the cities. The Victorian Government, if I might again use my home State as an example, has compounded this problem in that approvals for housing have reached their lowest level since 1962. Victorian building societies are reporting a dramatic loss of funds, investors and borrowers. That points to poor growth in the cities and further stagnation in the country areas where the demand for public housing and low cost housing traditionally has been greater. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention those as a few of the problems that arise from a lack of a national approach to regional Australia. Let me be more specific for a minute and refer to three provincial cities with which I personally am more familiar. The first of those three cities is, of course, Bendigo. I do not want to go at great length into a topic which has been discussed here recently. As revealed by the Langley inquiry in 1979 more than 30 per cent of under 24-year-olds were out of work in Bendigo at that time. The average rate of unemployment in that city then was 10 per cent. There are now no Commonwealth Employment Service figures for country towns because the Government has abolished CES figures for employment in country towns. But there is no doubt from welfare agencies in Bendigo that the situation has deteriorated since the Langley survey. Similarly, one can look at Bendigo's industry with the depressed situation of the meat works resulting in further unemployment and, more particularly, the repercussions of the Government 's decision about the Bendigo Ordnance Factory which has enormous social implications for that city in terms of employment and wealth generation to the local economy. I suppose that that is just one example of a provincial town in which that sort of situation applies. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the city of Geelong similar indicators are available. In the last quarter of last year the value of new commercial buildings under construction was 53 per cent down on the previous year. Building society loans were down by 25 per cent and new car registrations were down by 14.2 per cent- all, in a sense, meaningless figures unless one relates them to similar figures in the major cities where the statistics are far less dramatic than they are in country towns of this type. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the city of Ballarat, it is now not possible to find out the level of unemployment, particularly among young people in that town, in the way in which it used to be possible as the razor gang stopped the publication of CES figures. But in March last year-the last month before the razor gang report was presented-the unemployment rate in Ballarat was 9.5 per cent. Evidence from employers, civic authorities and welfare agencies shows that it is now well over 10 per cent. The figure for youth unemployment is said to be well over 20 per cent. Just this morning the Ballarat Courier contained a report that bankruptcies in small business over the past six months have risen very sharply. The blame for these bankruptcies has included, notably, high interest rates and a major recession in the local building industry of that town. Similarly, big employers in that city have been affected by recession, particularly engineering firms and, again, the local abattoirs. </PARA>
<PARA> All these statistics paint a general picture of the impact of wider economic policies having graver effects on provincial communities than they do on the larger metropolitan areas of Australia. Similarly, let me refer the education policies which have been followed by perhaps a series of governments. I refer to the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and the fact that the availability of education in a wide range of subject choices is much less in provincial towns than in the cities. A lot of work falls on local organisations in trying to redress that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been ad hoc and somewhat abortive efforts over the years to recognise this problem and grapple with it. The Fraser Government made an attempt to recognise the peculiar economic problems of provincial towns in 1977. In that year it established the Commonwealth Government Decentralisation Development Program. Funding of urban and regional development, by the way, has declined in real terms by 90 per cent since the Fraser Government came to office , but in 1977 there was this effort with the establishment of a Decentralisation Advisory Board which was designed to implement this program in specific recognition of rural disadvantage, particularly in relation to the provincial economies of the larger rural cities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Decentralisation Advisory Board spent $36m during its life. The sum of $10. 5m was allocated in the last year of its existence-1980-81. It was not able to spend most of that allocation because in April 1981 it was disbanded by the razor gang accompanied by the statement that decentralisation and regional development was more properly a matter for State governments than the Federal Government. If that is the view, I do not know why it was not held in 1977. There was then a recognition by the national Government of the importance of the problem and of the fact that national government had a contribution to make towards its solution. It is estimated that the Decentralisation Advisory Board was responsible for the creation of nearly 10,000 jobs in provincial and rural Australia-3,200 of them directly and the rest as a result of the creation of those jobs in various industries. This was a small initiative in terms of cost- the Board was a body which provided a catalyst rather than on-going financial assistance-but it has been completely wiped out. I think this is a significant retreat in terms of national government responsibilities for people who live in the non-metropolitan areas.</PARA>
<PARA> The problems of rural and provincial Australia seem to get worse. The principal reasons are: Firstly, the decline in the prosperity of manufacturing industry and its effects on the manufacturing bases of regions; and, secondly, the rapid expansion in a few regions due to large scale mining development which has meant a sharp decline in established provincial areas and a too-rapid increase in resource development areas such as sections of Queensland, the La Trobe Valley and areas in Western Australia. The result is that people in older established provincial areas are being made increasingly jobless and unable to move because of the buyers' market in houses. The impact of the so-called resources boom, whether or not it exists-there is some doubt about that-has resulted in tremendous pressures for the provision of infrastructure when new population centres are arising outside the major cities. </PARA>
<PARA> The result in social welfare terms has been something of a planning disaster with the development of a so-called caravan culture which places tremendous pressure on welfare agencies, creates family tensions and causes disruptions in those new and developing areas. Thirdly, further job losses are occurring in service industries in regional areas resulting from technological change and centralisation of the operations of many companies. Fourthly, there has been a sharp increase in the rate of growth of Australia's population. That is important in stressing the necessity for a national government response to these issues rather than, as the Government advocated in April last year, leaving the matter to State governments. Even if the Commonwealth does not pay for it, there should be a national strategy in relation to population movements in the non- metropolitan areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall suggest, in conclusion, what might be done in relation to some of these areas if government is looking forward into the medium and long term future about the very real problem which exists in these areas to which I have referred . Firstly, I believe top priority needs to be given to a detailed examination of what is in fact happening in rural and provincial Australia. We need to know what disadvantages there are in regard to basic services and the quality of life . There are a number of quite clearly apparent indicators but what they mean in terms of a variety of regions in Australia needs further assessment. Secondly, there needs to be consideration of how decentralisation of population can be put on a realistic footing, taking into account the successes and failures of early decentralisation initiatives. Thirdly, we need to consider how we could give impetus, perhaps in a not very costly way, to the effort of the local communities in strengthening their industrial bases. The experiment with the Decentralisation Advisory Board seems to have been worthwhile in that regard. Fourthly, there needs to be a strategy to consider how regional communities can be discouraged from competing needlessly with each other for industry and resource development. Fifthly, we need to consider strategies for encouraging and implementing regional planning so that local communities can approach development in an ordinary way. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not say this on a particularly partisan basis, but I think there is a need for an inquiry which would be wide-ranging and which would put pressure on Federal governments of either political persuasion to take some positive action in terms of long term strategy to redress the problems of rural and provincial Australia. Unless we do this we will go on blindly trying with ad hoc methods to identify the real needs in the non-metropolitan regions and we will continue to make decisions which are merely band-aid remedies or, worse, are taken for short term political gains. Of course, a number of things can be done straight away. We could re-establish at the national level at least a co-ordinating program to assist and rationalise decentralisation programs. Secondly, the Decentralisation Advisory Board showed us how that could be done in a modest way and yet generate employment which is of crucial importance in the social fabric of rural communities. Thirdly, we can ensure a fairer distribution of funds for such basic services as roads and education. Finally, we might better manage the economy so that farmers, small businessmen, and ordinary households in rural and provincial areas can look to the future of their communities with a confidence that today is being undermined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The closing words of the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button) are probably the words on which we are most likely to agree. He drew attention to the importance of economic management to the people he was addressing in his matter of public importance today. I agree that the most significant requirement for rural and provincial centres and for the people who live in rural and provincial centres is that there should be a sound economic base from which they can operate. One of the things which is of most significance about the rural and provincial areas of Australia is one of the points made by Senator Button early in his speech; they produce about half the export income of this country. It is a fact that those rural and regional areas depend very greatly upon our economic health, upon the direct production of wealth, often for export, and they suffer if the economy is not running well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One can think of many rural and provincial centres which rely on our great traditional rural industries such as grain, livestock and sugar. We know of many which rely on our great metal industries such as iron, gold and coal and other energy projects. We know that others rely upon an active tourist industry. It is quite evident that if we are concerned about the health and welfare of those people one of our primary concerns has to be the economic situation as it affects those communities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is always attractive to talk in terms of a plan, an examination and an investigation which will disclose what is required and which will lead to pressure on government to take appropriate action to remedy the ills which exist . Of course, there are ills and problems in all sections of the Australian community which can be and need to be addressed. It is desirable for the Senate to remind itself that the sort of approach so apparently rational and so apparently concerned with real problems which was adopted by the then Government in 1972-75 did not necessarily produce the clear results which one might have hoped when the course was first established. In examining the way we ought to approach the welfare of the people of rural and provincial Australia it is worth casting back one's mind to the atmosphere in rural and provincial Australia in 1974-75. I say that not trying to be divisive in this matter but because it is a reminder of the approaches which produced a very adverse reaction in the areas on behalf of which Senator Button purports to speak today. </PARA>
<PARA> A list of the seats which were lost by the Australian Labor Party in 1974 and 1975 is a pretty hard reminder of the failure of policies which did not look to the welfare of our export industries, which did not look to the control of inflation and which did not look to keeping Australia competitive in the international markets on which we are so dependent. When one sees electorates such as Eden-Monaro, Hume, Macarthur, Macquarie, Mitchell and Riverina in New South Wales, Casey, Diamond Valley, Holt and La Trobe in Victoria, Bowman, Capricornia, Dawson, Leichhardt and Wide Bay in Queensland, Kingston in South Australia, the largest electorate of all, Kalgoorlie, in Western Australia and Bass, Braddon, Franklin and Wilmot in Tasmania one is entitled to stop and think about just what are the policies which are likely to benefit the areas that are so well represented in the list of electorates and which will meet the sorts of problems which have been raised by Senator Button today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has, in fact, drawn back from believing that a positive program of regional development is the answer to the problems of the people of those areas. It is true that the previous Government experimented with growth centres and that the present Government provided funds for certain regional development programs which were referred to by Senator Button a few minutes ago. The approach which we have adopted in a much more substantial way to spread benefits through the whole of the local government areas of Australia is much more likely to provide genuine benefits to the areas about which we are concerned today. I refer to the reforms which were instituted by this Government and which provided untied revenue sharing funds to local government for the first time. In 1981-82 a total of $350.9m will go to local government through that tax sharing formula; that is an increase of 16.7 per cent in one year and it is an increase, in real terms, of 139 per cent since 1975-76. </PARA>
<PARA> When one is looking at the sort of quantum of assistance which is flowing from central government to the more regional arms of government in this country it is quite clear that we are talking in very large amounts. Senator Button talked with approval of a program which spent, in total, $36m over a number of years fostering decentralisation. He was referring then to a program of the Fraser Government. That sum is a little over one-tenth of the amount which is made available to local government authorities under the tax refund scheme which was instituted by the Government. In fact, a very substantial and new contribution is being made to the areas to which Senator Button refers by the Federal Government through this mechanism of providing grants to local government. The fact that the grants are untied and are spent at the discretion of the local authority and not at the direction of the Commonwealth Government means that they are of particular value since they can be applied as the people of the local region believe that they should be applied. It is scarcely surprising to find that the expenditure of those moneys varies very considerably from area to area. Certainly a good number of authorities have chosen to use at least part of that supplement from the Commonwealth to expand their activities in the fields of social concern, which are the areas that Senator Button suggested were areas of neglect in rural and regional areas. We have moved not from a more generous to a less generous system of assistance to these regions, but, indeed, we have moved to make more available to them from the national purse. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the health of most of these areas is dependent on their economic health. One has to look only at the provisions for primary industry which were effected by the previous Government, and which have been effected by us, to understand why there has been concern in rural areas of Australia about the policies of the previous Government and such support for the policies that we have put forward. I have already mentioned the concern that was felt in those areas about the inflation that we were suffering and about our inability to compete in overseas markets. There are more direct policy areas, such as the abolition of the superphosphate bounty, the abolition of the fuel equalisation scheme, the abolition of the investment allowance tax incentives, the reduction of tax concessions for water, soil and fodder conservation, the repeal of the 100 per cent tax write-off provisions in any year for certain primary production capital equipment and the substitution of a 10 per cent write-off per year over 10 years, the failure to extend unemployment benefits to primary producers, the reduction of the distance for installation of telephone lines in country areas to only eight kilometres, the deterioration of rural roads during that period and the reduction of the minimum reserve price of wool by 50c a kilo. That list, which is by no means complete, is part of the story why rural and provincial Australia was less than charmed with the record of the previous Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I contrast that with the record of this Government which has worked to improve the competitiveness of Australian primary industry on which so many of those areas are heavily dependent. I refer to the expansion and consolidation of overseas market opportunities and the assistance in the improvement of amenities for rural people, especially those in remote areas. Let me be quite specific. We have improved tax averaging and introduced income equalisation deposits; we brought back the investment allowance on plant and equipment; we set up the Primary Industry Bank of Australia which, up to June 1981, has lent $360m to nearly 5,000 primary producers; we abolished Commonwealth estate and gift duties ; we vastly improved wheat pricing and marketing arrangements; we provided stabilisation and price support schemes for wool, wheat, fruit and dairy products; we provided an $80 a tonne subsidy on reticulated and bottled liquefied petroleum gas for household use; we provided a 100 per cent write-off in the year of expenditure on the cost of providing bores, wells, dams and reticulation facilities; we improved telephone services and rural roads; and we have provided assistance for isolated children and introduced a patients travel and accommodation assistance scheme. Those lists which cover, in part, not only economic areas of assistance but also other important social areas of assistance , such as the assistance for isolated patients in need of special attention and additional assistance for isolated children needing special assistance in their education, demonstrate the concern of this Government for rural and provincial Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The words of the Leader of the Opposition sit rather oddly with the list I went through earlier of the Australian Labor Party's record of non-achievement for rural Australia in 1972-1975. Part of the concern expressed related to the provision of Government services for the people of rural and provincial Australia. My own Department is critically important to the lives of a very substantial number of Australians, including many Australians who live in those areas. Let me very quickly refer to the things that are being done by my Department to improve the quality of service to people in those areas. We have continued a policy of decentralising the operation of the Department. In 1975 there were 107 regional offices of the Department; in 1982 there were 164 regional offices. They serve in a very valuable way the people that we are concerned about today. We have developed the visiting services which are undertaken by field staff to many smaller centres. At present we have 350 services of that sort operating in these areas. We have developed regional rehabilitation units so that rehabilitation can be available to rural and provincial city dwellers as well as to metropolitan city dwellers. These were established in 16 locations-15 of them in country centres. With respect to Aboriginals, an important client group of my Department in many areas, the first Aboriginal liaison officer was appointed in 1975-an initiative of the previous Government. We have expanded that program and at present there are 29 Aboriginal liaison officers. We have honorary information officers in 75 different centres. We have a pilot program involving the appointment of 10 paid agents in rural centres which are not large enough to support a full time office. </PARA>
<PARA> I have referred in some detail to the moves being taken within my Department and moves which have already been taken within my Department to ensure that the social service requirements of rural people are met in the same way as social service requirements of city people. Problems remain. A problem that we are currently addressing is the problem of the rural unemployed who sometimes with the lodgment of unemployment forms by post suffer losses which are not suffered by their city brethren. That is a matter that is currently receiving attention. In this area, as in many others, I admit that things remain to be done. But I point to that list of achievements as evidence of our concern about rural and provincial Australia and as an earnest of our endeavours in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> In the field of communications-certainly when I visit the remoter parts of Australia this is central to the people's concerns-I point to a series of changes which again have greatly improved the amenity of many rural and provincial areas. In telecommunications, as recently as January the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) announced a new policy on country line charges which dramatically reduced charges for rural subscribers. The details of that were set out publicly by the Minister at that time. As far as postal services are concerned, in New South Wales six country mail centres serving areas within 400 kilometres of Sydney have now been brought into operation. Perhaps most importantly, in the field of broadcasting, in the remote area television program , 77 stations are to be established from 1979 to 1983 and 50 stations are already operating. If one looks to what this Government is pursuing with respect to satellite communications one finds that homestead and community broadcasting satellite services will provide additional radio and national television services to outlying areas. The national satellite system will provide improved educational services to people in remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA> None of these acts is the act of a government which is careless of the concerns of rural and provincial Australia. I go back to the point at which both Senator Button and I started: Fundamentally, those areas of Australia, in common with the rest of Australia, depend for their amenities, for their convenience and for their suitability as a place for Australians to lead good lives on the economic health of Australia. There is no way that any inquiry or any government programs will insulate the people of Australia from the economic realities that underpin all of our activities. For that reason the areas which are the subject of concern today have as strong an interest as any other part of Australia in careful economic management. It remains true that Australia cannot always meet all of the expectations of its people-that holds true for the people in our crowded cities, as it holds true for the people who live in remote and lonely parts of the country. The fact is that those expectations can be met only out of the production of wealth. The areas about which we are concerned certainly do their share-many would say more than their share-to produce wealth for this country. The Government remains committed to keeping Australia a sound place for the businesses and the productive activities that operate in those areas so that they can be sound places for people to lead their lives and to bring up their children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speaker, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), about two-thirds of the way through his speech seemed to be seeking to make a great deal of capital when he started talking about tax concessions for farmers and high prices or reasonable prices for primary produce . It is fairly obvious to any of us who have lived all our lives in country areas that government measures such as these do not by and large do much for people living in the small towns and provincial cities throughout the length and breadth of this country. In fact, one wonders just how many farmers even benefited from tax concessions to sink dams or wells. The Government seems to have the opinion that when it introduces measures such as this every farmer in Australia rings up a boring contractor the next day and goes about making a sieve of his paddock, putting down bores ad infinitum. I suggest to the Minister that the great majority of farmers in Australia who have been on their land for 10 years have all the bores and all the dams sunk that they are ever likely to sink during their lifetime on their properties. So, it is a bit of a political kite-flying exercise to talk about matters that do not affect by and large the great majority of the Australian people living outside our metropolitan areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the great declines that we have seen in rural areas in the last couple of decades, I suppose, has been the downturn in processing of agricultural produce in country areas-our wool, our wheat and so many more of our agricultural products are by and large shipped abroad. The only Australian labour input in many of those industries is by the farmer, by the transport operator in carting the produce to the seaboard and by a few wharfies loading it at the various sea ports. That, I believe, has been one of the great reasons for the quite substantial increases in unemployment in our rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, this Government has made ad hoc decision making into an art form . I suppose that there is no better example of that than very early in the Fraser years when the decision was taken to curtail for the timebeing the building of the animal research laboratory in Geelong. If my memory serves me correctly, something like 18 months were lost because of an ad hoc, top of the head, decision by the Fraser Government-possibly high up in that Government- without any proper discussion throughout the proper government decision-making bodies in the Government parties to curtail the building of that laboratory. That is very typical of the sort of ad hoc decision-making that this Government has been conducting since coming to office. Because of this type of ad hoc decision making, this inability to look ahead and plan on some sort of reasonable basis, the whole of Australia will carry the scars for a long time to come. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, I suppose one of the most recent ad hoc decisions was the one to set up the so-called razor gang that slashed wildly, mercilessly and madly in all sorts of areas because, it would appear, some Minister or some person in that razor gang had a bit of a hang-up about something or other in the life of this country. There was no planning, no rational decision-making, just slash and kick . It is a bit like the old story about Australia generally: If it stands still, chop it down; if it runs, shoot it. That is the philosophy which, in my view, the razor gang adopted. As I have said before, the nation will continue to suffer. What was one of the first decisions of the razor gang to affect rural and provincial people in Australia? It took the Commonwealth Government out of regional development. Further, it abolished the Decentralisation Advisory Board. In the years that I have been interested in politics the Liberal and National Country parties have always made great play in the length and breadth of this country about decentralisation and what they are going to do about it. Of course , another ad hoc decision took the Commonwealth Government out of the field of decentralisation. It said, of course, that the States should retain this responsibility with no question whatsoever of funding the Senates to do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that generally we have seen a decline in decentralisation in Australia in the Fraser years, particularly since the advent of the razor gang. Any decentralisation that is occurring is occurring in a haphazard and unplanned way. As we well know, it is occurring in some of our developing resource areas in such places as Gladstone and the Latrobe Valley and Portland in my State. But , my God, it is a sight for sore eyes to see the way in which it is being done- no rationalisation, no planning whatsoever, with people being uprooted from their homes because no one first planned a proper housing program. Elderly people, pensioners and unemployed people are being turfed out of their homes because they cannot afford the rents that the resource boom allows owners of property to charge. The development is unplanned in that roads and rail and shipping facilities are all left to the States, which in turn do not seem able to cope with the problem; and chaos reigns supreme. There are caravan parks the length and breadth of the Latrobe Valley in Victoria because of the failure of the Federal and State governments to plan housing projects before the development program got under way. They are mobile slums in which thousands of Australian workers and their wives are bringing up their children today. Yet this Government talks with pride about Australia being one of the world's greatest nations of home owners. It is obvious that the people who espouse those ideas do not travel around some of the areas that I travel around in my State and see the poor housing and the terrible conditions under which people are obliged to live in this modern day and age. </PARA>
<PARA> What else did we see the razor gang institute? It declined to carry on any expansion of regional offices of the Department of Social Security. Anybody who, like me, lives in a town where one of those offices is established will have noticed that the staff and facilities in the regional offices of the Department of Social Security are totally inadequate to carry out properly the job that the Act asks them to do. The same applies to the Commonwealth Employment Service, where there is again a decline in service and facilities while thousands of young Australians walk the streets and wonder where they can get jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> The razor gang too deferred the building of Commonwealth offices in Townsville. The Fraser Government declined to foster the on-going program of the Whitlam Labor Government in relation to the expansion of government offices in rural Australia. At the time of the demise of the Whitlam Labor Government there were plans afoot for quite extensive development of Commonwealth Government offices in a large number of the provincial cities in my State of Victoria. All those plans have been laid in the dustbin by the Fraser Government since it came to power. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth item that I have listed as resulting from the activities of the razor gang is the insistence on the amalgamation of a large number of colleges of advanced education. That again was a decision made off the top of the head of the razor gang-slam, bang, cut and thrust, with no question of discussing the problem with the people who run those institutes. As a consequence, chaos has since reigned throughout that area. These forced amalgamations and the curtailment of some educational services in many of the institutes have hit hard thousands of rural students. Last year we had the classic case of the curtailment of the School of Engineering at the Bendigo College of Advanced Education. Of course, that decision has now been compounded by the more recent action in relation to the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. Bendigo is a city which was once proud of its engineering abilities and its engineering background and which stayed stable largely because of its interest in engineering. That city will now go down the drain, in that respect anyhow, if this Government stays in office for much longer. </PARA>
<PARA> One can continue to go through the decisions of the razor gang. The decision of the razor gang to get the Fraser Government out of the area of soil conservation was, in my view, one of the greatest crimes that any federal government has committed, or may well commit, against the rural people of Australia and against the nation generally. The decision was made without any consensus and without any discussion with anyone. A recent television program on this very question showed that approximately one-third of the land mass of this country is affected in some way or another by soil erosion, water erosion, salinity and wind erosion . The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has measured that in some areas there has been a loss of 80 tonnes of topsoil per acre per annum. Let us just reflect that, when all the mineral wealth of this country has been exported, the only area for the provision of wealth for the people of Australia will be those five or six inches of topsoil. Yet this Government got out of that field and claims to be the farmers' friend. I suggest that that alone should condemn the Fraser Government forever in the eyes of all Australians, in particular in the eyes of those people who live in rural areas and whose livelihoods in future will depend in one way or another on production from the soil of this country. One can go on and on. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other area I wish now to comment on is the savage decline in welfare housing in provincial areas. We can thank the Fraser Government for that. A friend of mine who lives in a city of 22,000 and who is interested in the building trade because he works on the periphery of it told me last Saturday that he took a drive around that city and could find only three houses under construction. Yesterday morning I had in my office two divorcees with three children. They were on the verge of tears because they could not get suitable accommodation. That shows the Fraser Government's attitude to people in country areas. It is a shocking record which will only be remedied the next time around. </PARA>

<PARA> The Government's neglect of the people of rural and provincial Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>That would be laughable were it not so serious, particularly when one considers that the two speakers for the Opposition, Senator Button and Senator Primmer, were in this place during the Labor Government's term of office. I listened with interest to Senator Button. It appeared to me that even he did not have his heart in what he was saying, and rightly so. I will turn the clock back to have a look at what happened during the Labor Government's term in office. In my opinion Labor, when in government, completely ignored the needs of the rural industry, especially the needs of farmers. Mr Gough Whitlam, when Prime Minister , asserted that primary producers had never had it so good. I do not think that those words will be forgotten; they will go down in history. </PARA>
<PARA> To gauge the contempt with which the Labor Government at that time treated country people let us look at its record of non-achievements. I will go through them if I may. In its three years in office the Labor Government created record inflation, destroyed rural producers' ability to compete in overseas markets; abolished the superphosphate bounty; abolished the fuel equalisation scheme; abolished the investment allowance tax incentive and reduced tax concessions for water, soil and fodder conservation. This was the government which comprised people who are now saying that this Government is neglecting the rural industry. I have mentioned some of the things that the Labor Government did to the rural industry. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0V4">Senator BONNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button has to say: 'That's right'. That is what his government did while it was in office for three years. It repealed the 100 per cent tax write off provision in any year for certain primary production capital equipment and substituted a 10 per cent write off per year over 10 years. The Labor Government failed to extend unemployment benefits to primary producers when they were experiencing drought and all the other things that happen to people who lived in country areas. It reduced the distance for installation of telephone lines in country areas to only eight kilometres. Is Senator Button saying 'yes, yes' to that? The Labor Government allowed rural roads to deteriorate and it even tried to reduce the minimum reserve price of wool by 50 cents a kilo. That is how it took care of people in the rural industries. I have mentioned only a few of the disastrous decisions that were made in Labor's three years of government. As I recall, Senator Button sat in the second row of seats in this chamber. I admit that he was a new senator but I do not recall him being so concerned at what his government was doing to the people in rural industry that he crossed the floor to vote against some of the measures. Senator Button sits here and grins but he raised the matter of public importance which is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's neglect of the people of rural and provincial Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The matters that I am talking about do not affect city dwellers; they affect people who live in rural and provincial Australia. Let us have a look at what this Government has done since it was returned to office in 1975. I know the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) who responded to Senator Button, covered some of these points but I think it is important that I cover them again lest Senator Button has forgotten what the Minister said and what his government did in those three years it was in government. This Government believes very firmly and very sincerely in rural Australia, its worth and what it contributes to Australia overall. The Government has taken positive and realistic steps and initiatives to help rural Australians. Let me mention some of them. The Government has worked to improve the competitiveness of Australian primary industry and to expand and consolidate overseas market opportunities. It has helped in the improvement of amenities for rural people, especially those in remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA> In specific policy areas, this Government has improved tax averaging and introduced income equalisation deposits, brought back the investment allowance on plant and equipment and set up Australian Bank Limited which up to June 1981 had lent $360m to nearly 5,000 primary producers. Is that neglecting people in primary industries? I think not. This Government has abolished Commonwealth estate and gift duties; vastly improved wheat pricing and marketing arrangements ; provided stabilisation and price support schemes for wool, wheat, fruit and dairy products; provided a $80 a tonne subsidy on reticulated and bottled liquefied petroleum gas for household use; provided a 100 per cent write off in the year of expenditure on the cost of providing bores, wells, dams and reticulation facilities; improved telephone services and rural roads; provided assistance for isolated children and introduced an isolated patients travel and accommodation assistance scheme. Is this neglecting people in primary industries ? Is this neglecting people in country areas? I have mentioned only a few of the positive initiatives undertaken by the Fraser Government to assist those living in rural Australia. The Government has always recognised the importance of people in the rural industry, their importance to our nation and our national economy. Almost half of our total export earnings-in case Senator Button does not know-comes from agricultural production. This Government also introduced the 200-mile Australian Fishing Zone and is working towards greater Australianisation of the fishing industry. It is continuing its efforts to improve market access for our products and to open up new overseas markets. If that is neglecting the people in the rural industry I am at a loss for words to say what we need to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I will speak briefly on perhaps one of the most exciting States in the Commonwealth-my State, Queensland. It is exciting to travel around, as I do consistently, and to see what development is taking place in the Queensland outback. A couple of years ago I had the opportunity of travelling with Mr President and showing him some of the things that are happening in that exciting State. These things are happening because of the Federal Government's policy and the Federal Government's belief in private enterprise and what can be achieved. The Government is not just handing out money to people in order to prop up industries but it helps those who are prepared to help themselves. When Mr President visited certain areas in Queensland with me he was astounded to see what is happening. We went through the coal mining areas of Blackwater and Dysart where towns, schools, gardens and parks are being built because of the boom in the mining industry. The building of roads, railway lines and all those facilities provide employment and benefit people in the country areas of my State. If one goes to the bauxite area of Weipa one will see that a whole town and beautiful roads, et cetera, have been built and this has created employment for people in my State of Queensland. This is because of the Federal Government' s attitude towards export and building up industries in the outback of Queensland. If one goes to Mount Isa one will find that a mining company has spent millions of dollars to build houses not only for mine workers but also for other people who are able to pay rent for them. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to our sugar industry which is one of the most important industries in my State and one of the most productive industries that could be found anywhere. This industry also assists people on the eastern seaboard and creates employment and better positions for people in those areas. I do not want to take up a great deal of time because I think that the wording of the matter of public importance is completely unwarranted. This Government has done remarkably well in assisting people in the rural industry in all States-not only in Queensland-throughout the length and breadth of Australia. I think it is the height of hypocrisy for the Opposition to say that this Government has in any way neglected the people of rural and provincial Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance before the Senate refers to: 'The Government's neglect of the people of rural and provincial Australia'. We have had debates concerned with the reiteration of the policies of this Government and of the previous Labor Government. One hopes that in the debates in this House in 1982 we will be a little less concerned with what happened between 1972 and 1975 and little more concerned with what will happen between 1982 and 1985. I wish to read briefly from a document which, I believe, might be considered unbiased or even pro-government. This is a submission to the Government from the National Farmers Federation. I will read three paragraphs that will show that concern about rural matters is not limited to the Australian Labor Party and is not limited to the Australian Democrats but , indeed, is shared by many rural organisations. The peak organisation, the National Farmers Federation, said this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> NFF and its members throughout Australia are increasingly resentful at the impact on the rural sector of a range of government actions. </PARA>
<PARA> The resentment is greater because of the degree to which the Government actions have differed from stated Government policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The resentment is the greater because policies have been determined on an ad hoc and piecemeal basis, whereas they were to have been determined comprehensively and consistently. </PARA>
<PARA> The resentment is the greater because the rural sector has more than played its part in complying with stated Government policy objectives. That others have not done so has accentuated the pressures which are bearing on the rural sector and the farmers individually. </PARA>
<PARA>That type of statement from the National Farmers Federation must surely not be able to be shrugged off by the Government with a reference to the ALP policy in 1972-75. The farmers are now concerned with their future. They are putting behind them the problems of the past. One hopes that the Government might do likewise and address itself to those types of criticisms arising from people who surely know what they are talking about in relation to their own pressure groups and their own constituencies. If one looks at what happened in the 1970s that laid the ground for the problems we have now, one will notice that Australia lost over 21,000 farmers and over 44,000 farm workers and that jobs in the country town and rural based industries plummetted, on a conservative average, by about 100,000. Those people make up rural and provincial Australia. In many ways the prosperity or otherwise of the rural areas tends to pass by the vast bulk of people who live in the country. I am not talking about the graziers or the farmers, necessarily, but about the vast bulk of people who live in the small country towns throughout this nation. They, in many ways, subsist on top of the rural industries. These people never manage to get terribly well off as a result of rises in rural industries but they certainly lose their employment when conditions in various industries plummet.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that if we are to get anywhere in relation to reasonable rural policies in this country we must indeed get away from pulling out a decentralisation policy and waving it around every three years at election time. Indeed, every Bill that comes into this House has to be considered for its impact on everybody in Australia. I wish to raise a number of current issues to point out the path that we believe this chamber and the Parliament ought to take . The Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) mentioned the Government's policies. Indeed, we commend the Government for the advances it has made in relation to the provision of more adequate telephone services in rural areas. However, the Government should be looking at providing an equal base. After all, that is all that the National Farmers Federation seeks and that is the basis of the approach of the Australian Democrats. The people in the rural areas are not looking for subsidies or hand-outs; they are the last thing people in the country want but they have been offered them time and again. They are looking for an equal base with people in the cities. Then it will be up to them to attract industry and to work hard. When one goes and talks to the people in the country the attitude that one gets is that they are not interested in hand-outs and subsidies; they are interested, however, in equal treatment from the Government. I believe that if we get agreement on all sides in this House that that is the way the rural sector wants to be approached then we could have some intelligent and useful debates on each matter as it comes before us. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to telephones, if we are seeking to give equal opportunity we may attempt to base charges not on distance, which the Government is doing currently , but on time. In other words, charges could be based on a two minute or three minute unit, or whatever is acceptable. The Government should look at that notion to see whether it is a practical and worthwhile policy to implement. Certainly, if that policy were capable of implementation, given the technical systems that Telecom Australia has available to it-from what I can discover it is possible-we could provide in one swoop an enormous capacity for the rural sector to attract industry to towns and provincial areas of this nation. Indeed, it would not mean that we would have to increase costs anywhere or that we would be providing a hand-out. We would simply be charging the method of charging. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that has become contentious over recent weeks is the purchase of the new aircraft carrier. While this decision may seem to be quite remote from rural areas, the point of view that the Australian Democrats puts in relation to this is very clear. The beef industry is worth over $11,000m to Australia. If there is anything that needs defending it is our rural industries. If we were to look at a sensible defence system we would look to providing an immediate defence for those rural industries against foot and mouth disease. It naturally flows from that that we should be looking at a range of patrol craft that could provide us with greater coastal surveillance. At the moment we do not seem to have an imminent wartime threat, but we do have, as of today, a threat to a major rural industry from foot and mouth disease. The suggestion that the Australian Democrats are making is that when any matter comes before this Parliament it must be considered in terms of rural Australia as well as urban Australia. While urban Australia discusses the aircraft carrier purely in terms of a military attack, rural Australia is certainly crying out for some defence against imminent attacks that may occur on our rural-based industries. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another major issue that the Australian Democrats believe needs to be raised. After the abortive attempt following the recent report on zone allowances, the Government should look again at zone allowances and come up with a reasonable proportion. If one considers the allowance as it was in 1945-it was then a deduction and now it is a rebate-and makes adjustments for the tax law changes that have occurred since that time, an average wage earner who now earns $14,430 would be paying, if that zone allowance were in force as it was at that time, only $545 tax. We believe that a very good argument could be put in relation to that zone allowance. It is not a question of providing a hand-out or a subsidy; it is a question of justice in terms of how much of the rural dollar is being actually spent in the rural area. For example, almost the entire amount spent on cultural activities by the Federal Government and large amounts of the medical dollar bypass country areas and are not used by the people in the country. The education dollar is not spent anywhere near as fully in the country as it is in the city and cannot be taken advantage of by people who live in the country without additional personal expense. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that on any reasonable basis all of those matters would lead one to accept the proposition that to revert expenditure to an equal base a reasonable zone allowance would be needed. That allowance should not be calculated on the rather absurd A, B and C basis that exists at the moment. It would have to be worked out on the basis of individual shires and their cost structures. Those figures are already available and could form the ready basis for a comprehensive and coherent policy on zone allowances. We believe this is long overdue. Anybody who talks to country people can see that that is so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that the political division that has grown up- partly fostered by division on party lines-between town and country is not and has never been profitable to Australia. To get a reasonable approach one would have to look at the notions that I have put forward today. If somebody came to Australia and was told that a farmers' party had been in power in this country for the last quarter of a century, that person would believe that many things in the country would be in place. We have today raised the notion of being able to go to an airport and get a reasonably frequent flight to major population and trade centres of rural Australia. I am quite sure that Senator Collard, who will follow me in this debate, will say that he would certainly like some reasonable flights to many parts of rural Australia that he visits. Those flights are not in place. </PARA>
<PARA> A visitor to the country would imagine that country people would have reasonable road networks. Yet the current Government is looking at a method which will disadvantage severely many of the rural shires. One town which I visited recently will lose 30 of its workers because the Federal Government wishes to introduce a tender basis for road construction in the shire. Thirty families will be lost from that town. I do not know whether many honourable senators visit small rural towns. The rural town to which I have referred will lose one-tenth of its population if it loses 30 families. That is the level at which rural towns subsist. They are not being supported by the policies that the Government has introduced in recent times. I believe that the Government has failed to take note that the policies it brings forward must not only be fair to people who live in urban Australia but also must take into account the specific and detailed problems from which people who live in rural Australia suffer. </PARA>

<PARA> I recall that Mr Hayden, at an ALP rural seminar in 1979, said:</PARA>
<PARA> I don't dispute that in some ways the Labor Government was naive in its attitudes to rural policy and to country people. </PARA>
<PARA>Later that year, at the Victorian ALP Country Conference, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of reasons for this marked decline in Labor's rural representation and prestige . . . The Party has also had problems in finding candidates with the mix of qualities attractive to the country electorate. </PARA>
<PARA>There are problems within the Labor Party in representing the areas of Australia that are responsible for our wealth and the high standard of living that everybody enjoys. Over the last few years there have been vast changes in rural Australia, as we all recognise. I was living in the north-west of Queensland when vast changes were brought about by seasonal conditions and the downturn of the wool industry. As well as the seasonal conditions, we have seen the changes in our markets. During the 70s there was a great plummet in the beef market. That industry was affected by seasonal changes but it was also affected by marketing conditions, particularly the effect of the policies of the European Economic Community. It is on record how the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) has, over a long period, hammered on the doors of the EEC to bring about changes. He has met with some success but not nearly enough. We all concede that there are problems in rural Australia, but I utterly reject the view that rural areas have been neglected. From listening to previous Government speakers one could take almost a whole debate in listing all that has been done for rural and provincial Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macklin mentioned at length some of the problems concerning exotic diseases that might get into Australia. I thought it rather ironic that a member of the Australian Democrats was talking about 'foot and mouth disease'. The Democrats seem to suffer from it regularly. The Cocos Islands quarantine station has been brought on stream in recent times. I was privileged to meet with some of the cattle breeders of Australia when the first shipment of cattle was brought into Australia through that station. It means that we can bring important new bloodlines into our great herds in Australia. This can be done relatively easily compared with the quarantine restrictions in the old days. The station was established at a not insignificant cost. The laboratories being set up in Geelong will work hand in hand with it to help bring the total quarantine system to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA> Some speakers, including Senator Macklin, touched upon the role of communications and transport in rural Australia. It is in the realm of telecommunications that we have seen some of the greatest changes over the last few years in order to try to bring to the people who need it most a service that they have not had and, unfortunately, in some circumstances still, do not have. A dramatic change in charging was announced recently. Prior to that, we saw the reduction of subscriber trunk dialling charges, trunk line charges and the implementation of Community Access 80 which meant that anybody with a telephone in a country area could have access to his centre of business for a standard 10c fee, as it then was, for a three-minute call. That was a tremendous breakthrough for people in rural areas. Since then we have seen a marked reduction in connection fees. I firmly believe that there should be a common connection fee. At present we have not quite reached that stage, but whereas people were once faced with a connection fee of thousands of dollars or a $500 per year rental fee which would go on ad infinitum, the maximum fee for connection to an automatic exchange is now $1,350. The maximum amount for those people converting to a manual exchange is $1,750. The maximum rural conversion fee for those people already on a part privately erected line is $600. This is a tremendous breakthrough when we consider what these people had to look forward to prior to that. But I am the first to admit that this is not good enough. I am a great advocate of a common connection fee right around Australia. That is what we want . I want to see that first before even such things as time charging, as was mentioned by Senator Macklin. Time charging has been looked at. Quite a massive capital cost is involved in instituting that. I think it is a matter of value judgment as to which is instituted first. But I want to see people without phones with phones before I see changes in the charging system. This is for the simple reason that there is only so much available in capital funds. As I said, I want to see that money used for people who have not already got phones. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen a great revolution in communications. The first experiments with radio concentrators were done in my area. This meant that lines did not have to be laid and that people could get their telephones a lot sooner than they might have expected. There was a lot of heartburn and expense as those experiments went on. Suffice it to say that over a period it was successful, and now those radio concentrators are being put to greater use throughout rural Australia. I understand that Telecom Australia has drawn up specifications for digital concentrators and has called for tenders for their production. This will mean enhanced usage for those people looking at a long waiting time before receiving their phones. Of course, need I mention the satellite which we as a government are committed to? What will it do? Of course, it will make a lot of difference to the propagation of television and radio with the dissemination of services from metropolitan areas to people who could otherwise not have a television service. I think the most important thing that that satellite will do for Australia is to provide people who would not normally have a telephone for many years to come with a telephone in the foreseeable future. The satellite is another government initiative in the way of communications. As I said, the satellite covers telephonic, television and radio communications. </PARA>
<PARA> Mail services suffered dreadfully with the rural downturn in Australia. As people left rural areas in vast numbers the carrying contractors, who usually had the mail contracts, found it no longer viable to do carrying. Thus the mail contracts were also in jeopardy. A lot of rearranging had to be done in rural Australia. While that was being undertaken many people were hurt when their mail services dropped from three times a week to once a week or once a fortnight. I am glad to say that that situation is being reversed. Where delivery was once a fortnight it is now once a week and where it was once a week it is moving to twice a week with the reorganisation of mail services in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I think people should realise that there is massive cross-subsidisation of postal and telephonic communication services in Australia. In 1980-81 the cross- subsidisation of rural postal services amounted to $25m. On top of that the subsidisation of registered publications was $19m. Of course, a lot of that went to rural Australia and assisted in the dissemination of knowledge. The cross- subsidisation in Telecom for rural Australia in 1980-81 is estimated at $350m. Of that amount $20m is used for telegrams. Recently the charges on telegrams for those people who have no other method of communications-those on outpost radio and on the Royal Flying Doctor Service radio-were reduced. That is an area of cross-subsidisation. Massive cross-subsidisation occurs for both rural telephonic and postal services. </PARA>
<PARA> In every Budget since this Government came to power there has been massive assistance to rural industries. I find it ironic that the Labor Party has brought this matter up for debate. We have set aside so much money for the fertiliser bounties. Of course, a lot of money goes into rural research, the beef carcass classification scheme and the beef export inspection and animal health services. The list is almost endless. On top of that we have the domestic sugar pricing formula which means that the sugar industry in the domestic market can look towards a guaranteed income. That formula takes into account the effect of inflation and increases in the cost of fuel and fertilisers. Australia is part of the International Sugar Agreement. This is something which was hammered out over a number of years and which stabilised the world-wide sugar industry. The only wild card in the pack is, once again, the European Economic Community. We also have the wheat stabilisation scheme and the wool marketing reserve price scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The prices received for most primary producers often do not bear any relation to cost of production but are basically what the market can bear. By comparison in other industries prices for products and services are based on cost and people work for set wages. Most primary producers are not in that position. Therefore, it is essential that we have a strong economy. Of course, it has been one of the Government's aims to reduce inflation because it is the rural sector of Australia which is hurt most when inflation gets out of hand. I think we have done that-of course, not as successfully as we would like but with a certain amount of success. </PARA>
<PARA> Rural industry is hurt as much as any other section of the economy when interest rates blow out. I find it rather ironical that those who sit on the Opposition benches, as late as last week, took part in depriving this Government of much needed revenue when they rejected the sales tax legislation. That is having an effect not only on the Commonwealth but also on the States. It means more pressure for inflation, there is more pressure on interest rates and there is less money to provide some very necessary services for rural Australia. I reject the claim that the Government has neglected the people of rural and provincial Australia. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is designed to meet a number of specific objectives. The first of these is to meet the wishes of the people of Hermannsburg in the Northern Territory about the grant of title to their land. Honourable senators may be aware that the Hermannsburg lease is one of the areas listed in Schedule 1 of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act to be granted to Aboriginal trusts. It has not been so granted-and it is the only land in Schedule 1 which has not yet been granted-because the leaders of the traditional land-holding groups in the Hermannsburg area did not want to accept a single title for the whole area, as Aboriginal people elsewhere in the Territory had done. Instead, they wanted five land trusts, each to hold separate titles to different parts of the land. As the Act is drawn, only one trust can be established for each of the areas of land described in Schedule 1. The proposed amendments will permit the establishment of more than one land trust for the Hermannsburg area. </PARA>
<PARA> The leaders at Hermannsburg also said that they did not want to have a chairman of each of the trusts as provided in the Act and that, in at least one case, there were only three people who could properly be appointed members of the trust. At present the minimum requirement is a chairman and three other members. The amendments will allow the establishment of trusts with a minimum of three members and without a chairman. </PARA>
<PARA> The second objective is to allow the redrawing of the boundaries of the land held by the Tiwi Land Trust. The Tiwi people of Bathurst and Melville Islands have asked that Clift Island, a small island which lies off the west coast of Bathurst Island, should be included within the land trust area. The Northern Territory Government has supported this request. The Bill provides for the amendment of Schedule 1 to include all land lying within 5.56 kilometres of the low water mark within the description of Bathurst Island. The Tiwi Land Council has also sought the consolidation of the titles granted to the Tiwi Trust in respect of Bathurst Island and Melville Island and the Bill provides for this. </PARA>
<PARA> A third aim of the Bill is the extension of the provisions for financial assistance to people appearing before the Aboriginal Land Commissioner in relation to an application for the restriction of access to an area of sea adjoining Aboriginal land. Section 54C of the Act provides a procedure by which people appearing before the Commissioner in relation to land claims may make application to the Commonwealth Attorney-General for financial assistance. The Government considers that it is reasonable for the Commonwealth to extend this provision to people appearing in closure of seas hearings since these are conducted pursuant to the Northern Territory Aboriginal Land Act, which was introduced as part of the package of legislation complementary to the Commonwealth land rights Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition the Bill provides for a more practical system of repayments from the Aboriginal Benefit Trust Account to the Consolidated Revenue Fund in respect of moneys advanced to land councils by the Commonwealth to meet their administrative expenses. Advances were necessary because payments into the Trust Account equivalent to royalties received by the Crown in respect of mining on Aboriginal land were insufficient to meet the administrative costs of the land councils. I point out to honourable senators that the Aboriginal Land Rights ( Northern Territory) Amendment Act 1979 already provides for the repayment of such moneys but as a once only lump sum payment. The amendments will provide the Minister with a discretion to direct periodical repayments from the Trust Account to the Consolidated Revenue Fund taking account of the capacity of the Fund to meet such repayments. It should be noted that these payments will not reduce the funds available for distribution to Aboriginals generally in the Northern Territory from the Trust Account. Repayments will be made when the amounts available for distribution to land councils under section 64 (1) of the Act are greater than are needed to meet their administrative expenses and will simply reduce the surplus available for distribution by land councils to communities in their areas. </PARA>
<PARA> A further aim is to remove any doubt that might exist as to the Minister's ability to make progressive recommendations to the Governor-General for the grant of land to an Aboriginal land trust following receipt of a report by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner. By way of example, the Land Commissioner has recommended that there are some areas in the Alligator Rivers region which should be granted to a land trust. These areas could now be granted, except for some parcels of land within the claim area which are currently the subject of, or may be affected by, certain applications now before the High Court. The amendments would permit the Minister to deal immediately with those parts of the claim area not affected by the legal proceedings and allow those areas whic are affected to be dealth with at a later date. I am sure honourable senators will acknowledge that the interests of the Aboriginals and of the community in general are best served by expediting the issue of title following the consideration of a report by the Land Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> For similar reasons, it is desirable to have flexibility in the Act to provide for situations in which traditional owners may desire more or fewer land trusts than were recommended by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner in his report. It is important, I feel, to be able to respond to applications of that kind by a land council where that is appropriate. For instance, in the Borroloola land claim the Aboriginal people wanted a single land trust to hold the land for the benefit of both the island and the mainland people. They simply wanted to be seen as one people. But the Commissioner recomended that two trusts be established in respect of that land. The Act, however, did not allow the Minister at that time to accede to the request. The amendment will allow me to respond if that or a similar request in respect of trust holding arrangements is made in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The land councils have been made aware of the proposed amendments. I table certain documents which indicate the responses of the councils to the proposals contained in this Bill. I do not consider this Bill to contain amendments which could be described as controversial but they are amendments which either derive directly from the requests of Aboriginal groups in the Northern Territory or are designed to facilitate the advantage of the Aboriginal people. So that the land councils may be aware of the provisions of the Bill I have today authorised copies of the Bill being made available to them, following this speech. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to make it clear that these amendments are not in any way connected with other proposals that have been advanced in the discussions which are still in progress between the Commonwealth, the Northern Territory Government and the land councils about the land rights Act. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that clauses precluding spouses of persons involved in industrial action or who have by certain other actions demonstrated an 'unwillingness' to work from receiving unemployment and special benefit were deleted by the Government from the Social Services Amendment Bill 1981 during its passage through the Parliament. Those clauses were subsequently introduced into the Parliament, in the Social Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1981, which the Senate failed to pass last November after it had been passed by the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill re-introduces that Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Before October 1979, the Social Services Act precluded payment of unemployment benefit to a person who was a direct participant in a strike. However, it enabled unemployment benefit to be paid at the 'married' rate to the spouse of a person ineligible for unemployment benefit on those grounds. The Act was subsequently amended to provide that unemployment benefit payable to the spouse of a person engaged in industrial action was to be at the 'single' rate. A further amendment precluded payment of special benefit to a person who, because of industrial action, was not qualified to receive unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes that, for so long as a person's spouse is disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit because of involvement in industrial action; or unwillingness to undertake suitable work; or failure to take reasonable steps to obtain such work, that person will also be ineligible for unemployment benefit. Additionally, a person will be ineligible for unemployment benefit for so long as payment of that benefit to the person's spouse is postponed because of their misconduct as a worker; because they have become voluntarily unemployed; or because they have failed to accept an offer of suitable employment. Consistent with this approach, special benefit will also be withheld from persons not eligible for unemployment benefit in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided, however, that if a person is precluded from receiving unemployment benefit and special benefit, in a case of extreme hardship and where there are no other means of support, that person's spouse may be eligible for special benefit at the single rate, with additional benefit for any children. This will ensure that cases of actual hardship can be assisted, in contrast with the present position where the social security system can be called upon in circumstances where there is no actual need. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, we are not here concerned to discuss the merits of strike action as contrasted with other means open to employees in dispute with their employers to resolve these disputes. What we are concerned with is how the cost of strike action is to be borne. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government holds strongly to the belief that these provisions should become law. In the case of the provisions relating to industrial action, we do not believe that Australian taxpayers should be asked to subsidise strike action through the social welfare system. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy underlying this Bill is that a person, when he chooses to take strike action, should act in the recognition that he takes responsibility for the consequences of his action, both for himself and for his family. Strikers make the decision to strike against the rest of the community, and they must bear the financial consequences, not the rest of the community through the welfare system. Trade unions, whether acting through their officials or by the vote of their members, should equally recognise that decision to initiate industrial action will have consequences for all members and their families which the community should not be asked to bear through the welfare system. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the proper perspective from which to consider the measures proposed in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not swayed by emotional and mis-leading arguments which seek to deflect attention from and misrepresent that fundamental concern. The issue is quite clear, and we do not intend to be drawn into the kind of fruitless debate which seeks to direct attention away from the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is not an 'anti-strike' Bill, but one which aims at restricting the community subsidisation of strikes. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation as it stands at the moment permits a situation where trade unions can choose to strike, knowing that through the operation of the social security system their members can be largely insulated from the financial effect of their actions. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless frivolously or maliciously entered into, the object of a strike is to obtain, by the exercise of economic pressure directed against the employer, a benefit for those who take such action. As a result, the benefit sought is itself economic, such as increased pay, a shorter working week, or special allowances. Not infrequently, strikes are settled on a basis that effectively compensates those who have gone on strike for pay lost during the duration of the strike. </PARA>
<PARA> The point to be emphasised is that to strike is an exercise in freedom of choice. Generally, it is one taken by the membership of a union to promote its own interests and only its own interests. It is taken against the interests of the employer and, what is directly relevant to this Bill, it is one which is not taken in the interests of the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the effect of strike action is often in conflict with the interests of the community as a whole or some part of it. Frequently, the community suffers as a result of strike action. This may be reflected simply in inconvenience or in terms of direct economic cost. Furthermore, in a larger sense, it may be said that in the longer term the community always suffers as the cumulative result of the strike action is to decrease the availability of goods and services, and sometimes to do great damage to particular sectors of the economy, or to particular employers. </PARA>
<PARA> These matters need only to be mentioned to make clear the absurdity of any argument that benefits should be paid to strikers or their families, and should be paid by the community at large. For it is the community at large that provides through taxation the funds from which strikers are currently paid the benefits that this Bill proposes to eliminate. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been numerous cases where the wives of strikers, who have appeared to have no genuine intention of joining the workforce themselves, have registered for work in places such as mining and construction towns where there is no real possibility of employment for them. This has enabled them, under the existing legislation, to obtain unemployment benefit, and so transfer to the taxpayer some of the real cost of the industrial action taken by their husbands. The burden so thrust upon the community is far from light. For example, honourable senators will recall that from 15 July 1981 to 28 September 1981 some 600 people were involved in a strike concerning the use of apprentices during industrial action at the Utah Development Co. mine in Central Queensland. Four hundred and seventy-one wives claimed unemployment benefit at a cost of around $ 40,000 per week, making a total cost of some $450,000. </PARA>
<PARA> So, the Australian public is attacked from two directions. First, it has to bear the personal disruptions, inconveniences and associated costs that result from the strike. In addition, it is then called upon to meet the cost of providing income support for the families of those involved in the strike. </PARA>
<PARA> To act to correct this situation is not to 'punish' or 'penalise' the families of strikers, but to ensure that people accept the financial consequences of their own actions and do not look to the rest of the community to bear the costs of workers and their families. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, there is no good reason why the community should automatically and immediately be expected to assume through unemployment or special benefit payments the normal financial responsibilities of people who are not willing to work, who voluntarily and without good reason give up their job, or who are dismissed through their own misconduct. This is happening at present, because the spouses of such people can register for employment in their own right and, if they are unable to obtain employment, can claim unemployment benefit both for themselves and for their 'dependent' spouses. </PARA>
<PARA> In this situation however, as with the strike situation to which I have earlier referred, the Bill also provides that, if a person is precluded from receiving unemployment or special benefit, that person's spouse may receive special benefit at the single rate, with additional benefit for any children, in a case of extreme hardship and where there are no other means of support. The very existence of this provision belies the quite false charge that the Bill will in any way 'punish' or 'penalise' families. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, we believe that whether people refuse to work because of industrial action or whether, in some other way, they show themselves unwilling to enter or remain in the workforce, there is no reason why the rest of the community should shoulder their financial responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill prevents them from manipulating the social security system to shift the consequences of their actions. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981 to provide for:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The payment in 1981-82 of additional tax sharing grants and special allocations totalling $69 million to New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland thereby bringing the aggregate tax sharing grant to be paid to the States in 1981-82 to $6689.7 million, and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The payment in 1981-82 of a fixed tax sharing grant of $315.1 million to the Northern Territory in lieu of the amount which would be payable under the formula prescribed by section 8 of the principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA> At the Premiers Conference on 20 June 1981, at which the Commonwealth Grants Commission's report on State tax sharing entitlements 1981 was considered, it was decided that there would be no change in the relativities contained in the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981 in respect of the year 1981-82, and that the Commission should be asked to produce a further report on its assessment of States' relativities in the light of submissions to be put to it by States and by the Commonwealth. The Commission is expected to report by 31 May 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of the likelihood that, following the further review, the State relativities would be adjusted in favour of the three most populous States, the Commonwealth agreed at the June 1981 Premiers Conference, to provide additional grants to New South Wales ($24.5 million), Victoria ($15.0 million) and Queensland ($20.5 million) in 1981-82. These additional grants are to be considered as being part of whatever total contribution the Commonwealth may choose to make towards assisting States to adjust to whatever new relativities are adopted after consideration of the further report of the Grants Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context, the Commonwealth made it clear that it has no intention of funding the total cost of the adjustments to whatever new relativities are decided and that the additional grants for 1981-82 are without prejudice to any future decisions about the degree of change in relativities or the pace at which any such change should be implemented. The additional grants for 1981-82 are on the basis that there will be no application by any State for special grants in respect of 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of an agreement between the Commonwealth and Queensland at the 20 June 1981 Premiers Conference the Bill also makes provision for that State to receive a supplement of $9 million to its tax sharing grant payable in 1981-82. This special addition is a once-and-for-all payment to compensate that State for the reduction in its basic tax sharing grant resulting from the adoption of a new basis of estimating States' populations in the tax sharing calculation. The impact of this change (to an estimated resident population basis) on estimates of the States' tax sharing grants in 1981-82 was to produce a significant reduction in Queensland's grant as compared with estimates using the population estimates, prepared on the previous 1976 basis.</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also gives effect to an agreement with the Northern Territory, arrived at subsequent to the June 1981 Premiers Conference, to pay the Territory in 1981-82 a fixed tax sharing grant of $315.1 million rather than the lesser amount that would result from the formula set down in section 8 of the States ( Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981. This amount takes into account both the population increase in the Territory and the abovementioned change in the basis for estimating state and territory populations to be implemented in March 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the following table which contains the latest (i.e. Budget) estimates of the tax sharing grants that would be payable to each State and the Northern Territory in 1981-82, including the amounts contained in this amendment Bill. </PARA>

The Northern Territory's growth will be determined by reference to the formula in the memorandum of understanding between the Commonwealth and the Territory, but with the substitution of total tax for personal income tax.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had foreshadowed a number of amendments to be moved by the Opposition to this Bill regarding the life of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. As I recall, when the Bill was last before the chamber Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle was vigorously nodding her head-a matter which was not recorded in Hansard but which indicated to me that the Government would give serious consideration to those amendments. I have no doubt that Senator Peter Baume has not been informed of that but it is something that he might look into. The Bill contains what is fashionably called a sunset clause which provides for the organisation to disappear at the end of 12 years, with an effective review of its operations at the end of 10 years. The amendment that I have foreshadowed suggests that there be a review at the expiration of six years. The operation of the sunset clause would thereby come into effect after eight years. The reasons given for that were, briefly, that when people had served on the Policy Advisory Council for two terms of three years each it would be an appropriate time to examine how the organisation was going, how effective it was and whether it was appropriate to renew the terms of those involved in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is one matter which I did not mention in discussing this Bill a week or so ago. That is simply the issue of land reform. The Bill provides an umbrella organisation in relation to Australian agricultural research with relevance to- for want of a better expression-developing countries or developing economies. The Opposition welcomes that initiative which means that research done in universities, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and a variety of other bodies can be brought together and co-ordinated for the benefit of the economies of underdeveloped countries. It seems to us to be a very rational way of handling Australia's contribution in this area. The only other point I make relevant to this legislation is that perhaps under the umbrella of an organisation like this Australian governments might be a little more active in encouraging land reform as a condition of assistance to underdeveloped countries. Research is very helpful and foreign aid is useful but in some countries, for technological reasons relating to the best use of land and so on, it might be desirable to consider policies of more encouragement for land reform and consolidation so that yields may simply give more wealth than they do at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, we agree with the idea of creating the Centre as a clearing house for requests for assistance from developing countries in agricultural development. We think it is an excellent concept. We criticise it only on the basis that some of the administrative arrangements seem to us to be not necessarily wrong but less appropriate than they might be. We also welcome the notion of support at the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research for academic training for scientists from developing countries. We think that should be considered and that more attention should be given to the staffing questions associated with the establishment of a body of this kind. I conclude by saying that we welcome the Bill. At the seond reading stage we foreshadow amendments. We wish the organisation established by this legislation every success. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Bill 1981. As a contribution to Australia's overseas aid the Centre will assume a role in the North-South dialogue. At the Cancun summit meeting on that subject last October the two co- chairmen, Mexican President, Jose Lopez Portilla, and Canadian Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau, stated that leaders had committed themselves to working together to try to build an international economic order in which all states would be able to realise their potential with equal opportunities and in which the developing countries in particular would be able to grow and develop according to their own values. That growth is impossible without food security and agricultural development. In the spirit of the North-South dialogue, that calls for a transfer of resources in this most critical area from the developed to the developing countries of the Third World. Thus leaders at that conference saw as their first priority an obligation on the international community to eradicate hunger and to ensure food security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There can be no doubt that the world food problem remains immense. Professor Harries, in the report of the Committee on Australia's Relations with the Third World, indicated that the number of people with a food intake below what he described as the 'critical minimal limits' has risen to an estimated 445 million , with over 60 per cent of them in Asia. Furthermore, he indicated that in order to feed the world population by the year 2000 at current dietary levels, world food production would have to increase by up to 60 per cent and that in developing countries an increase of about 75 per cent would be required. The Independent Commission on International Development Issues, more commonly referred to as the Brandt Commission, somewhat similarly showed particular concern at the gap between the production and consumption of cereals, which amounted to some 37 million tons in 1975 and which the Commission said might reach 120 million to 145 million tons by 1990. The Commission feared that such huge shortages might well cause mass starvation. In fact it has been suggested that since the Brandt report was published international food security has worsened. Wheat stocks as a percentage of consumption fell last year to the lowest level since World War II. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus the question is immediately raised as to how best Australia can contribute to solving this massive and critical problem. In an immediate sense there is no substitute for direct food aid. It is pleasing to note that our food aid has increased this year to $100m with a number of innovations, including payment of freight on an increased portion, the provision of 80,000 tonnes of freight paid grain to Africa on a bilateral basis but channelled through the world food program, and our contribution of at least 45,000 tonnes to the International Emergency Food Reserve. The subject of food aid is, however, complicated. Notwithstanding the demands made by some sections of the community, Australia has only a limited capacity to assist. Its exports of wheat, flour and coarse grains constitute less than 10 per cent of world total exports compared with over 65 per cent for North America. It cannot deploy the financial resources that Western Europe and North America have to support concessional commercial sales. Additionally, the provision of some sorts of food aid can have the unintended effect of inhibiting production and encouraging the recipient countries to postpone the adoption of appropriate development policies. To some extent this can be overcome by linking food aid to employment promotion and agricultural programs and other projects which do not weaken incentives to food production, as was canvassed in the Brandt Commission report. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst in the short term only direct aid can relieve hunger, there can be no doubt that in the longer term the objective of helping to increase agricultural production in developing countries is paramount. The Cancun Summit stressed that food aid should not be used as a permanent replacement for the necessary development of the required food production in developing countries. With similar sentiment the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne, only weeks before, stated in its final communique that it 'recognised that the ultimate solution to the world food problem lay in greater self-sufficiency in developing countries'. Whilst this no doubt sustained and long term internal efforts by developing countries, there is a clear international responsibility, in the spirit of the North-South dialogue, for the provision of timely and sufficient technical and financial support. Professor Harries, in his report to which I referred earlier, offers the encouragement that there is adequate potential, in terms of the availability of land and scope for increased productivity in respect of existing land, for food production per capita in developing countries to be increased. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> If the necessary political will, application of technical know-how, provision of requisite capital and improvement of agricultural practices are applied universally through food producing areas in the developing countries, the prospect of avoiding general or widespread food should be good. </PARA>
<PARA>With this encouragement Australia has had to face its responsibilities of contributing to meet the desirable objective of greater self sufficiency in the Third World. There are clearly a number of ways in which this countribution could be made. Brandt stressed the need for agricultural infrastructure, particularly the requirements of irrigation and water management, and also roads , transport, rural electrification and distribution and provision of greater quantities of fertilisers and pesticides. In fact many of Australia's bilateral programs have placed considerable emphasis on rural development. Brandt also found the need to develop farming systems appropriate to local circumstances. Again Australia has contributed in this area through its significant aid training program and in the transfer of its technological skills and expertise which have contributed to such basic needs as better soil management. But in addition to the bilateral aid programs to develop the required infrastructure, training programs, technological transfer and the more difficult goals such as agrarian reform, which has been mentioned, a need for greater research has also been found. </PARA>
<PARA> Brandt stated that much more effort should be put into development and research where relatively modest sums can have a large and well demonstrated impact upon production. He gave the example that the continuing development and adaptation of new plant varieties depends on a sustained effort of research at international, regional and national centres. This need for expanded support for international agricultural research institutions is, of course, the motivating force behind the proposed centre. Professor Harries specifically saw the opportunity for Australia which presented itself when, in his report, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It would appear that unused potential exists for Australia's scientific resources to be put to more effective use in assisting to expand the technological efficiency of agricultural production in developing countries, by stepping up the quality of the available knowledge and advising innovative ways of effecting its transfer, especially to those countries most in need. </PARA>
<PARA>The Institute will not solve difficult political problems or provide the necessary development capital but it can provide assistance in the area of agricultural technology which some, such as Professor Harries, see as the greatest assistance Australia can render. In examining this new initiative it should not be thought that financial assistance for agricultural research and development in developing countries has been absent in the past. According to the second reading speech of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), Australia's contribution in the year 1980-81 was about $12m, which is not insignificant. We have supported the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research and the maintenance of its 13 agricultural research centres around the world and, in particular, in our region, the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be little doubt that Australia is particularly well placed to assist developing countries in the area of agriculture, with expertise and experience in agricultural research and development over a wide range of climates and soils from dry land farming to tropical livestock and agricultural production. The work that has been done by the States, particularly in a demonstration and development capacity, in developing countries is well recognised. There is equally little doubt that adequate research capacity exists within Australian universities, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the State departments of agriculture and other tertiary and commercial bodies. What has been missing, however, from the Australian agricultural research aid program is co-ordination. There has, as the Minister was prepared to admit in her second reading speech, been a lack of an effective mechanism to identify agricultural problems in developing countries systematically, to identify the areas of research required to contribute significantly to the overcoming of such problems and to marshall the collective expertise which exists within Australia to meet such research requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is primarily to set up an institute in the form of a statutory authority to formulate programs and policies with respect to agricultural research in areas of identifying agricultural problems and finding solutions to such problems in developing countries, to commission agricultural research by persons or institutions in Australia in accordance with such programs and policies, and to communicate to persons and institutes the results of such agricultural research. Thus it is designed specifically to meet the shortcomings in our current agricultural research program. Its formation should therefore be applauded. It is to be noted that there will be an initial commitment of $25m over four years to the trust fund set up for the centre. The initial funding is therefore significant and should be able to purchase considerable valuable research. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard it is particularly pleasing that the administrative infrastructure of the centre will be kept to an absolute minimum in order that funds marked for research can actually be utilised for that purpose. It is also noted that the centre will be assisted by the Policy Advisory Council which will have expert rather than governmental representation from developing countries. Whilst the strength of the current bilateral aid projects has been that they were initiated on the advice of the recipient country, there has been a corresponding weakness in the possible political motivation of the request. In this instance it will be the function of the centre to identify and assist in particular agricultural problems. The move away from government to government aid will give the centre certain of the advantages of non-government organisations able to pierce the government veil. Notwithstanding that advantage , I must state that I have reservations in that the centre is to be yet another statutory authority. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is a public sign of Australia's commitment in a very rational way to the transfer of resources, which lies at the basis of the North-South dialogue, and the objective of assisting developing countries to grow and develop. It is also a furtherance of the major emphasis of Australian policy and the provision of high quality assistance without strings attached. In overseas aid there must, in addition to quality, be quantity. In that regard Australia must still strive to meet by 1990 the international accepted target of providing 0.7 per cent of its gross national product in development assistance. To place the quantity of Australian aid in its right perspective it should be recognised that our performance, currently 0.45 per cent of gross national product, has been consistently higher than the average of other highly developed countries. For example, the 1980 figure for the United States is 0.27 per cent, for the United Kingdom 0.34 per cent, for West Germany 0.43 per cent, for Canada 0.42 per cent and for Japan 0.32 per cent. By this Bill we are showing that we can meet the objective of quality. We must not, however use that to camouflage the objective of quantity. The formation of this Institute has been internationally applauded. The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting welcomed the decision as did the Development Assistance Commission of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation an Development in its consideration in Paris in November of last year of Australia's overseas aid program. </PARA>
<PARA> The formation and successful operation of the Centre will not negate our responsibility in the areas of technological transfer, development of infrastructure and training. It will further not justify us from facing the detrimental effect international trade protection has on the economies of the developing world and their ability to sustain their population. It will not avoid the need to support international food security by concluding international grains agreements, by the provision of large international emergency reserves and the establishment of a food financing facility. It will, however, make a contribution to the challenge which the Brandt Committee saw: There is no more important task before the world community today than the elimination of hunger and malnutrition in all countries. The Centre, therefore, should be supported with enthusiasm. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Bill which will establish an Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research and which will commission agricultural research to identify and find solutions to agricultural problems of developing countries. These are very worthy objectives. I only wish that the task was as easily achieved as it is defined. The Centre will also disseminate the results of the research. The Australian Democrats are pleased that this Bill introduces the sunset principle and that the centre will cease to be in force after 12 years. An opportunity for review will be given after 10 years. This has caused a bit of concern because any ongoing agricultural programs for Asia will not be disposed of in six or 10 years. I would have thought that there would be very little doubt in anybody's mind that this is an initiative that Australia would be happy to continue while it was needed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is not necessarily an organisation that will go on long after its need has passed, which is a reason for sunset clauses. This organisation is different: It is one where I think programs will begin and concrete results will be seen only after time spans of five to ten years. We were quite alarmed to see the proposed amendment of the Australian Labor Party which seek to reduce the period involved back to eight years so that programs will run effectively for six years before they are reviewed. The Democrats are unhappy about that. For those reasons the Australian Democrats will not support the proposed amendments. We believe that it is necessary to give a reasonable time to the programs which are embarked on in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the Labor Party-this may be its motivation perhaps-that we are being very hopeful. We are hoping that this will be a successful organisation, will be funded adequately and that there will be the enlightenment and flexibility of mind to ensure that it gets hold of the people who really know what they are talking about, the people who have been in village Asia and know what those people want, and gives them their lead. This has not always been the case in the past. One of the great tragedies of the world is that there has been an officious, well-intended feeling on the part of Western experts that to take Western experience in agriculture or anything else and hand it over, graft it, or transfer it to the village societies of Asia-fundamentally, in spite of their huge size they are village societies-is a good thing. Unfortunately the results, so far, have been tragically wrong in most cases. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give an example of a situation that I have witnessed personally. The first tributary scheme of the great Mekong Project was lauded some years ago as something that would transform Indo-China. The Nampong scheme, the first tributary hydro-electric development, flooded a huge area in north-eastern Thailand. Virtually all of the high quality rice land in the province was flooded. The farmers who were producing well were put off their land their land then flooded. The area there is unfortunate. It is situated in very low hills and a wide, flat basin. It is a very unpromising place for hydrodevelopment because of the shallowness of the storage and the relatively large flooding of land for the capacity involved. That turned out to be tragic in human terms and all others. The families who farmed that land have done so for longer than any person in Australia could comprehend, possibly for millenia. They were pushed off and not given any compensation. After many years they were given a small amount of money but were not given any land to work. Apart from providing a light to the neighbouring market town of Khon Kaen the last I heard was that the generators were still up to only a quarter of their capacity with no prospect in the future of ever being any real use to that community. The reason for this is that the society is a village-type society which cannot, in itself, make the quantum jump to a mechanised society. It is no good saying: 'Give them electricity, they will provide the industries and things will happen there. There will be a great industrial revolution and they will be fine'. In fact, that does not happen. </PARA>
<PARA> I am rather concerned at the reference in the second reading speech by the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) to the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines and a subsequent reference that the achievements of these centres are already very considerable. That, of course, is true. They have produced a rice which is much higher producing and which gives much more capacity per hectare, but they paid a rather heavy price for the so-called 'miracle' rices. Those of us who reviewed the green revolution wonder, with hindsight, whether these rices which need fertiliser, insecticides and considerable capital to grow and which have led to a major change of land ownership in many parts of Asia-indeed, this occurred in India, the Philippines and Indo-China when the varieties were first brought in- are any better in the long term than the traditional rice varieties which, although they were lower yielding, were at least reliable. They were planted for generation after generation and were known to be resistant to disease. A stable situation had been created. More attention should be given to bringing more acreage into rice production. This is an engineering problem rather than an agricultural research problem. The same thought is reflected in the Minister's second reading speech where she states:</PARA>
<PARA> Research in industrialised countries tends to be concentrated on those agricultural commodities that are important to their own economies. </PARA>
<PARA>That is in industrialised countries-</PARA>
<PARA>Consequently, little attention is given to new ideas and techniques specifically related to agricultural production in developing countries. This is a limiting factor to increased food production in the developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats found that paragraph in the Minister's second reading speech of very great reassurance. If that is the sort of thought that will inform this institute it will be moving along the right lines, it will be very useful and will be of use to the Third World countries. It recognises the need for a different type of research, a different type of approach from what is going on here. Agricultural research in Australia, some of which, as I will shortly describe, may well be of value to the Third World countries, is not necessarily of value to them in itself. I hope that there will be a tendency in this institute to counter the ever present impetus towards a drift away from subsistence crops to export or cash crops. This is another one of the great tragedies in Asia. This commercial motive has caused huge and disastrous famines , some of them not too long ago, which have killed many millions of people. It will cause them again if it is allowed to continue and if the basic need for these countries to produce enough food to feed their own people is overlooked. I think that is a point that should be made. I hope that the Centre in looking at agricultural programs will have the breadth of vision to look at that kind of very broad issue rather than say that countries should just plant this, that or the other thing. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Centre will be generously funded and its priorities set on a basis of real need in the countries concerned. Too often in the past aid schemes -not so much ours; ours have been excellent, especially the Colombo Plan and earlier programs of that sort-have become a virtual handmaiden to those classes of Asian people near the top, as they see themselves, those commercial interests which have taken over farming land in many parts of that continent. They are interested only in export cash crops and do not care very much what happens to people if there is not enough food to eat. </PARA>
<PARA> We hope also for great flexibility so that work is contracted out to individuals, and organisations, who really understand the Third World's problems , who see the need for consultation at the village council level, and who, indeed, consult at that level. I say this from my own knowledge as a person who worked in north-east Thailand, one of the most remote and poverty stricken areas of Asia. There I met some of the most charming, intelligent and enlightened people I have ever met, none of whom could read or write. I am speaking of the village headmen and the members of the councils of some of the villages in that area in which I worked for nearly two years. They know very well what they want. Their difficulty is to find someone to listen to them and to what they want. </PARA>
<PARA> Villagers want quite plain things: They want fencing wire so that they can keep their animals enclosed; they want something which will create change. Their tragic situation is abundantly clear to anybody who goes into one of those villages where all the children have bulging bellies because they are on too high a carbohydrate diet. This, of course, is due to the tragic situation caused by our friend cassava, or tapioca, which has now become possibly the world's major food crop. It is almost pure carbohydrate. Village aid schemes need to look, I think-I found that village headmen and councillors realised this themselves-at encouraging things that would take care of the protein and fruit areas of their diets. They are looking out for such things as breeding eggs to produce improved poultry stocks, and grafted fruit trees. They, I believe, are prepared-I have heard this discussed with World Health Organisation people working well out in the country-to try to understand the need for a balanced diet. They had not really understood this before. They are prepared to be flexible enough to vary their agriculture to accommodate this if, indeed, somebody would come along and do it for them. </PARA>
<PARA> I am hopeful that these are the sorts of broad initiatives that will come from the Centre. There will be no difficulty about that because there are people at our universities who are like that. I know some of them. I hope that there will not be some sort of dreadful situation where some program is decided on by some mysterious process, perhaps by some consultative committee which does not really know what it is talking about or what it is doing. If we do not have that situation we will have a success with the Centre. Although this seems to be rather a minor Bill to the Senate at the moment, I doubt whether we could be doing anything very much more important than we are. We are here making a contact with tremendous potential which could benefit many hundreds of millions of people who are now ravaged by disease, people who have come to accept the fact that perhaps 30 per cent to 40 per cent of their children die before they reach 10 years. The problem is of that order. This is a project of high dignity, high promise and tremendous importance. The Australian Democrats hope that it is regarded as such universally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a Bill to set up the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. The function of the Centre is to mobilise and expand Australia's research capacity so as to assist developing countries in agriculture and related areas and to develop and expand a better co-ordinated and more identifiable Australian effort aimed at achieving nutritional self-sufficiency in developing countries. The Centre itself will not be engaged in any research work. It will contract out research work to bodies such as universities, State departments, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and private individuals and organisations. The support services for the Centre will be provided by the Australian Development Assistance Bureau-ADAB.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition supports the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Bill but with some reservations. The Bill will not assist in the area of land reform, and that is something to which I wish to return after. The Bill contains provisions for a review of the Centre's operations after 10 years. We believe that is too long a period before it is reviewed. Senator Button, of course, will move amendments along those lines. We are concerned also that the resources of ADAB and the Department of Foreign Affairs are already overstrained with staff cuts resulting from the razor gang decisions and will not be able to assist the Centre properly. Further, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Street , said that all research work will be contracted out. We believe that research work should be given to the CSIRO rather than contracted out. We believe that it will be more expensive to contract research programs out than to allow the Government bodies to do the work. </PARA>
<PARA> In the recent parliamentary recess I was a member of a parliamentary delegation and an Australian Labor Party delegation that visited a number of countries in the Middle East. In perhaps nearly all of the countries that we visited we were shown agricultural projects. In particular, we were shown one in Egypt which is perhaps one of the most ambitious schemes that I have ever seen in the field of agriculture. It is hoped that in the end the town or the city that is involved in the scheme will have a population of 150,000. Two things in particular stood out and I think they are particularly relevant to this Bill: The first was how valuable Australian agricultural techniques and experiences are in the whole of the Middle East, and the second was how much Australia's programs of agricultural research and assistance in the Middle East need better co- ordination here in Australia. The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research should be able to assist but I have doubts about it. </PARA>
<PARA> During that visit to the Middle East we visited two Australian agricultural projects in northern Iraq. The one at Mosul is being operated by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture and the one at Arbil, which is near the Iranian border, is operated by the South Australian Department of Agriculture. Both of those Australian projects have an excellent image. The Iraqi Government was particularly impressed by the fact that the Australians remained on the job after the war with Iran broke out. When we were there early in January Australian families were still on the job. They still had their children with them. They were still operating despite the fact that Iraq had been placed on a war footing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is another matter. The South Australian project at Arbil is in the Kurdish area of Iraq. As I said, it is near the border with Iran. Earlier this year European tourists were kidnapped in the area. They have only recently been released. I place on record here this afternoon my appreciation of the dedication of those Australians who are working there and doing an excellent job under very difficult circumstances. As I said, these Australian projects are proving to be very successful. They are being helped by a fierce determination on the part of the local authorities to prove not only that the projects can be successful but also that locals can be trained to take over when the Australians leave. It was put to us by officials of the local council in the area that they are are asking the Australians to finish in 10 years what it would normally take the locals 100 years to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A large number of Middle East states are taking an interest in what Australia and Australian research institutions have to offer. It is not a question of aid, as it is in certain other parts of the world, because all of these states are able to pay for our expertise. Libya is one country that I give as an example. It has already offered large sums of money for Australian research and for Australian experts to work in that country. Australian State government projects at the moment are already being carried out in Libya, Jordan and the Sudan. </PARA>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EJ4">Senator SIBRAA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was commenting on the fact that a number of oil-rich Arab states are buying Australian agricultural expertise. They are also funding university programs and students. I was using Libya as an example and pointing out how recently the Government of Libya approached the New South Wales Government to take part in such a project. Its least consideration was how it was going to be financed; there was no problem at all about finance. What this Government should be doing is looking at making Australian agricultural expertise available to states which cannot afford it, particularly states in the Middle East and Africa. But that is a job which has to be done at Federal Government level, and it is also a task that needs a co-ordinated approach at that level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Throughout the Middle East there is an obsession about food security, which countries in the area define as self-sufficiency. For example, the Saudi Arabian Agriculture Minister told our delegation that his Government was subsidising wheat production to achieve self-sufficiency at five times the average world price. The Saudis have as a near neighbour the Sudan, which is a poor state and which is in a much better position to act as regional producer of wheat, but the Saudis are prepared to pay five times the average world price to ensure that they have at least some wheat production of their own. They are concerned that countries such as Australia, the United States and Canada will remain reliable suppliers. They are also worried about whether in some circumstances we will be involved in food boycotts. They are aware that not just oil but also food are universally vital commodities in the hands of very few producers. This point was also raised with us by the Gulf Co-operative Council which is not only conerned about political stability in the area but is also vitally interested in food security. It is already suspicious of the United States policies on food boycotts and continually raised with us the point that they did not want to be placed in a position in which people could say to them: A bushel of wheat for a barrel of oil. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to turn briefly to the issue of land reform. I believe our overseas experience shows that, whilst our agricultural research is valuable, it is useless unless there is land reform in a number of countries that are receiving our aid. In too many parts of the world we see poor landowners being forced to give up their land to the wealthy landowners. They then work as labourers on what was their own land. They become dispirited when forced to do this and they finally drift into the cities to work in factories for low wages. There we have all the seeds for political discontent. I always remember former Senator Wriedt talking in this place about a similar institute to the one we are talking about tonight-the Institute of Tropical Agriculture in Nigeria. That is a magnificent project and it proves exactly what can be done, but I do not think it looks very carefully at what can be done on small landholdings. </PARA>
<PARA> Our aid program needs continued assessment. We need to examine some of our projects to see whether they should be continued or whether they should be modified. In the past I have drawn attention to the need to do this in areas such as the Philippines, and I was glad to hear that another honourable senator also raised this in the debate earlier today. One only has to look at the situation that has arisen today in Central America in countries such as El Salvador and Nicaragua to realise the need for land reform. We do not have to look that far way. We need only to look at a country such as New Caledonia, the nearest country to Australia to be involved in an independence struggle, to realise that the issue of land reform is one of the key issues behind the push for independence in that country. In New Caledonia the situation at the moment is that a majority of the good land is farmed by very few European farmers, whereas the thousands of Melanesians who do own land are farming on very small holdings indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, I think the creation of an agricultural research centre as a clearing house for requests for assistance from developing countries is excellent. I believe the administrative arrangements are inadequate. I think aid management in Australia needs to be improved and streamlined. As I said, land reform is the key issue with which the agricultural research centre should be concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In supporting the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Bill I want to refer, firstly, to the general context of Australian overseas aid and then to make some suggestions regarding the provisions of the Bill. I welcome the Bill. It was originally announced in August last year by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) and now at last has come to legislative form. It is one measure of the Commonwealth Government over the last couple of years which all Australians can welcome and support as an important aspect of the development of our overseas aid effort. I think that effort is not great enough. Parliament should encourage the Government to go more quickly towards the goal that the Government has set itself-spending 0.7 per cent of our gross national product on overseas aid programs. That figure is not as high as I would like it to be. As I have urged in a number of forums, we might exceed that figure so that it is one per cent of gross national product by our bicentennial year, 1988. I take the opportunity of commending again to the Government and to members of the Senate the thought that , in 1988 when we look back at 200 years of our life as a nation, we ought to look outside to see the direct development assistance that we give to our neighbours. It would certainly be magnificent if we were to achieve the spending of one per cent of our gross national product on overseas development assistance .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another important step towards this objective was made by the Government in the last Budget when it applied an extra $100m to overseas development assistance. That was an increase of 18 per cent, but it lifted the level of overseas aid only from 0.43 per cent to 0.45 per cent of GNP. This did not reach the 0.6 per cent that was reached in the mid-1970s, when I must admit that gross national product slumped somewhat. Nevertheless, a very substantial standard was arrived at then which we still have not got back to. I am not yet convinced that there is under way in Australia a momentum which will allow us to reach within the next few years the 0.7 per cent goal that the Australian Government has supported and made its own. </PARA>
<PARA> Another step that the Government took in the previous Budget was to allow tax deductibility for private overseas aid contributions within very minimal and sensible guidelines. Ordinary Australians giving money to a number of overseas aid funds-about 20 at the moment-are being encouraged in that giving by tax deductibility. These several steps are going in the right direction, as is the present Bill which seeks to establish the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. I understand that the Centre, when it is fully developed in the coming year, will have some $20m applied to it. I very much welcome all these steps, and I believe we must do more. </PARA>
<PARA> I should refer to the incoherent but too often expressed criticisms of Australian overseas aid involvement. Those criticisms are expressed sometimes by State members of parliament and isolationist Australians. They try to justify their criticism of the extent of Australian overseas aid by saying that we should first help those in need at home. Of course we should have thoroughgoing policies which help the needy in Australia and which help various institutions to develop themselves along good lines. But that should in no way distract us from helping our neighbours, particularly those countries in the Pacific and South East Asia that are so close to our land. </PARA>
<PARA> Others argue that overseas aid is distorted in some foreign countries, leading to accretions by the already wealthy middle man or commercial manager, the urban elites, and that our aid does not lead to real prosperity for the ordinary families of developing countries. There is some substance in that criticism but I am convinced that the Australian Development Assistance Bureau is very vigilant and seeks to ensure that our aid is of a kind that cannot easily be so diverted and distorted. Anyone who claims seriously that the ADAB budget of some $600m is other than to a very small extent so distorted shows that he has not informed himself of the substance of the programs that ADAB is involved with in various countries and the links with which those programs are monitored. </PARA>
<PARA> A third argument against overseas aid which I believe should be entirely resisted is that put forward in the last year or so, too vocally, by some very right wing activists in Australia who argue that the very notion of international co-operation and international development, of Australia being involved with other countries in their development, is somehow on a slippery slope towards a centralised world government; that somehow, by fanciful argument , the United Nations would become a powerful overriding body interfering with, indeed subverting, the sovereignty of national governments. I regard those kinds of arguments as nonsense, as emotive, and as lacking proper information, but having the unfortunate effect of distracting some Australians from a full-bodied support for the kinds of statements that the Commonwealth Government has made, for example at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, about North-South relations, about exploring in dialogue from developed and developing countries the best steps towards developing countries being involved in more growth. These three types of arguments against overseas aid programs I believe should be resisted and argued against not only in this Parliament but also in the community. That much more vocal group in the community that is calling for an increased overseas aid effort should see more of a response from the Commonwealth Government through increased overseas aid votes. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer directly to the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Bill 1982 and make some suggestions about the context in which it will operate. Other honourable senators in this debate have referred to the importance of food aid and the Australian record in being of assistance in helping developing countries to meet their own food needs, to be nutritionally self-sufficient as the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) termed it in her second reading speech in the Senate. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Food Program are both substantially supported by Australia, as is the Consultative Group for International Agriculture Research which, since 1971, has been an important focus of the international community's encouragement for research and agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was a student in the 1960s, and subsequently in the 1970s, I had the opportunity to visit nearly all of the countries in Asia, especially our near neighbours in South East Asia and the Pacific, and to observe over a 17-year period a number of developments related to agriculture and increasing prosperity in those countries. I look back mostly with pride, in a quiet way, at the style of Australian support in our region. I certainly commend that. I remember reading as a teenager a book written by Lederer and Burdick called The Ugly American which argued that somewhat grandiose, heavy-spending, imperialist assistance, however well intentioned from legislatures, was subverted on the way and was used in fact for directly political purposes, for international relations to serve the home country. I do not see that ugly face directly associated with the Australian development program in neighbouring countries. It has not been my observation in the countries near us. There were aspects, perhaps in those years, of a somewhat ugly Australian face and to the extent that there was I urge that the lessons of that era in the early 1960s be continually before us and that we avoid those dangers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for that reason that I urge that whilst this Bill is not a cure-all but is specifically setting up a mechanism for encouraging international agricultural research and needs to be complemented by the other programs of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau, nevertheless the whole context of food production in a developing country and bringing to effect the fruits of new technology and better agricultural research is not, I believe, fully successful in meeting a nutritional self-sufficiency goal for that developing country. I believe that the food output in a country should fill the food needs of that country; but more than that I want to draw attention to the chain of production involved in the growing and distribution of food and the arrangements for this. </PARA>
<PARA> By a chain of production I mean that an ordinary farmer, or a group of ordinary farmers, may apply a superior seed with fertilisers in a new way by techniques that are newly taught to them as a result of agricultural research. They will go on perhaps to use their land more effectively and to have an increased productivity from the land. That crop will then go to the city where it may be distributed throughout the country. It will be bought and sold perhaps two or three times in the process of commercial sale and distribution. In some countries that produce such bumper crops the superior crop is sold and, by means of the money earned, other foods are consumed within the country. But too often over the last 20 years it has been the case in developing countries that the profits from such bumper crops, the profits of that higher productivity, have accrued to the urban commercial elite. Too rarely has the productivity increase led to an advanced standard of living for ordinary farmers and ordinary families in the country. So I believe that we must address ourselves to the full chain of production in applying these agricultural research improvements. </PARA>
<PARA> I have visited Thailand a number of times, particularly in the last couple of years. Partly through Thai politicians visiting this country and my visiting Thailand I have developed a particular friendship for Senator Sukum Thirawat, a leading senator in the parliament in Thailand. He was the director of the Department of Agriculture in Thailand throughout most of the 1950s. He came to Australia for some months in the early 1950s to look at our forestry production. He went back to Thailand and applied the knowledge he had gained. The eucalypts that grow in Thailand are, in large measure, the fruit of his observations and activities. He also became very aware of the improved technology and the lessons to be learnt from modern agricultural research. As director of the Department of Agriculture he sought to see these lessons taught in his country. After a considerable period, after 30 years of seeing these steps being implemented and these lessons being taught, his unfortunate observation is that the standard of living of the ordinary Thai farmer has been improved only marginally and that the profits involved in the increased productivity within Thailand have accrued too often to the commercial middle people in the city of Bangkok. He has, I believe, a very stable grasp of the experience to be had in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Australian Development Assistance Bureau will, in other matters such as training and in extension programs of the results of this research that ACIAR will come to develop, go on to direct its attention very closely to this suggestion that I am making so that we will address ourselves to the full chain of production and ensure, in co-operation with the leaders of developing countries, that there is a real benefit in standard of living improvments for the ordinary people, the ordinary farmers who will apply the fruits of this research. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to two provisions of the Bill, relating to the Policy Advisory Council and the nature of the research programs to be undertaken. In setting up the Centre, the Bill rules out the possibility of duplicating the research resources that already exist in Australia. I commend the Bill for that. We know that the Waite Institute at the University of Adelaide has a high reputation internationally for its agricultural research. Over 30 years it has given many thousands of students in agriculture post graduate training to the benefit of their countries. That body of expertise will, I believe, be drawn upon by the Centre for research programs. Similarly, I refer to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's dry land farming research being conducted in the Northern Territory. This is another good example of the resources already existing in Australia which may, along with overseas institutions, be drawn in by the Centre in the development of programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important provision of the Bill relates to the Policy Advisory Council. The Bill provides that this Council will include representatives of developed and developing countries' expertise. The Government, very happily, has already announced that the president of the interim advisory council will be Sir John Crawford who has unrivalled expertise and leadership in these matters in Australia. He is equal to the best in the world. The fact that his experience will be available to this Advisory Council in its initial stages is, I believe, of great benefit for the Centre. The representatives from developed and developing countries-particularly developing countries-will have a very important part in defining, in dialogue with others involved in the Centre, the projects of importance to them. Australia will, in that way, be able to directly respond to the needs of our neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia gives aid to about 80 countries throughout the world but the majority of our development assistance aid goes to our own region. I support that emphasis. Two years ago the Pacific countries received $28m. This was spread among about a dozen countries. The five member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations received some $60m of aid. Papua New Guinea, the country with which Australia has a particular relationship, received $235m in aid. These are three items out of a total of $550m in aid which goes to some 80 countries. Whilst we should give specific development assistance to countries in the Middle East, and notably in Africa, in ways to which earlier speakers in this debate have referred, I believe that we should retain the emphasis on concentrating our development assistance aid in South East Asia and the Pacific. With those observations I warmly commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I approach the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Bill with great trepidation. Quite frankly, I am baffled by what we in Australia hope to achieve from it. The aim of the Bill is to establish this Centre which will have the function of mobilising and expanding Australia's research capacity so as to assist developing countries in agricultural and related areas and to develop an expanded, better co-ordinated and more identifiable Australian effort aimed at achieving multinational self- sufficiency in developing countries. Clause 5 (1) (a) (i) of the Bill states that one of the functions of the Centre will be to identify the agricultural problems of developing countries. We in Australia have been in this act for quite some time. It seems to me that we should know of the problems that exist. I suggest that there are thousands of papers lying about the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, universities and other institutions that identify the agricultural problems of developing countries if one is looking purely at agriculture. I suggest that it is now time we looked at other problems in developing countries, not specifically agriculture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One immediate area that springs to mind is land reform. Do we really think that we, an all-wise nation on this rim of the world, have some ability to go into those countries and assist farmers whose forebears have been farming land for thousands of years? We have been in this country for 200 years and we are ruining it. As I said on a previous occasion, we are allowing it to drift away, blow away, and wash away. We cannot control our own land, yet we have the audacity to go into some other country and try to tell its people how they should run their agricultural enterprises. I suggest, as my deputy leader in the other place said, that if we in Australia want to make any progress in the area of agricultural foreign aid, it is time that we stipulated some measure of land reform in recipient countries before any aid is forthcoming. In my view, that is the greatest downfall and one of the reasons for the bottomless pit of foreign aid from Australia to the underdeveloped world. 'Land to the tiller' is the cry of those in developing countries. It is not being made available, so our money, our research and all the effort we put in is, by and large, going down the drain . Honourable senators should not tell me that the people in those countries do not know how to farm. They were growing rice and all sorts of other things before Captain Cook came to this country. Given the opportunity and the land, I am sure they will surprise even themselves. Clause 5 (1) (a) (ii) of the Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . finding solutions to agricultural problems of developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose that what I have just said applies to that area also. Clause 5 (1) (b) states:</PARA>
<PARA>to commission agricultural research by persons or institutions in Australia ( whether the research is to be conducted in Australia or overseas) in accordance with such programs and policies . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose that what I have said applies to that sub-clause also. The research has surely been done. Honourable senators should not tell me that some of our institutions have not by now a fairly good understanding of tropical agriculture . I am sure that they have. It is the political and social conditions in those countries that are inhibiting the further development of the work that has already been done and the practical application of the research work that has been conducted. Extension services and land reform are where the problems lie. They are the areas in which the recipient governments should be working. In my view, the research has been done; it is available. Let those governments get on with the job. Clause 5 (1) (c) states:</PARA>
<PARA>to communicate to persons and institutions the results of such agricultural research. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that that message should be sent to all the institutions in the underdeveloped world if they have not already got it. However, it will be futile for them while their political leaders and other entrepreneurs rip the wealth off the land and from under the soil. A political change has to come about in those countries before we will make any progress. Surely it is time that we started to listen to what is being said about some of our aid projects. The Sydney Morning Herald of 19 February carried the headline 'Australian aid effort under attack'. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> One of Australia's major foreign aid projects has been criticised by a Freedom From Hunger Campaign official for largely failing to help those it is supposed to reach-the Filipino poor. </PARA>
<PARA>Today an article in the Canberra Times was headed 'Concern over project in Philippines'. Again, the message was the same. The aid is not going to the people it is supposed to help. I suggest that this country has led with its heart rather than its head in the area of foreign aid. I suppose any of us can be accused of doing so at times. I suggest further that it is time we stood back and had a fairly cold, hard look at our aid projects around the world and at what we might be trying to do. Undoubtedly, under a scheme such as this, the papers will be written. People will write their doctorates of philosophy on agricultural development in the Third World. I suggest also that those research papers will be about as useful to the farmers in those countries as, to use a farming phrase, tits on a bull. They will be absolutely worthless. The governments concerned, by and large, have no intention whatsoever to lift their poverty-stricken farmers and the rest of their community out of the mire. The governments and their entrepreneurs are making too much money out of the current system under which they operate. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague, Senator Sibraa, mentioned visiting projects in the Middle East. Australian expertise and research has transformed some of those areas. In those projects we have reintroduced to the Middle East such things as subterranean clover. It was brought to Australia from the Mediterranean and it is now being re-exported to that area. The difference, of course, is that the governments of the countries in the Middle East in which those projects are being conducted have the interests of their people at heart. There is a broad consensus on what needs to be done. The expertise that is being provided in Lybia, Iraq and other countries by the state departments is, to some extent, scientific but it is also largely practical. Practical farmers are showing what needs to be done and what can be done. They are not necessarily high flying academics who may have doctorates in agriculture but who do not really understand what grass roots farming is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give a couple of examples of that situation which I have seen during my trips abroad. In 1973 or 1974 I was in Pakistan with an Australian delegation visiting a dairy farm, a project that was being jointly financed, from memory, by both the Australian and New Zealand governments. The land had been taken from the peasant farmers who had been given compensation and sent down the road with their buffalo and everything they owned. In 1969 the then Prime Minister, Mr McMahon visited Pakistan and promised the 100 Illawarra shorthorn cattle. They were duly sent and were going quite well until the farmers who had had their land expropriated started to return because the land they were given in lieu did not seem to be quite as good. They missed their aunts and uncles and community groups. Of course, when they came back they brought their buffalo. The buffalo rubbed necks through the fences with the Australian cattle. Before the people running the farm knew where they were, the Australian cattle were dying like flies due to buffalo tick. When I suggested to the people in charge of the project that perhaps the wisest thing to do would be to double fence the farm or carry out a weekly or three weekly campaign of dipping or spraying the cattle for tick, all the poor souls could do was scratch the dirt and remain mute. It seemed to me that that project was falling down because of the lack of even one practical, practising Australian farmer who could have fingered the problem straight away. All the scientific experts in the world were available but the project was falling apart. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken in this place before of the project in Bogor in Indonesia, just out of Jakarta where the elite live and go for their weekends because it has a nice dry climate. The Australian Government has spent $12m there on an animal research project. We were taken through it and shown all the things that the project had achieved by utilising the native species of chooks, ducks, goats, sheep, buffalo and God alone knows what else. I questioned the farmers only in relation to fowls. Egg production had been lifted from about 60 to 160 a year through breeding techniques. The largely Chinese entrepreneurs had moved in, grabbed the technology that was available, built battery cages and were supplying the egg market of Jakarta. The little peasant farmer with his half a dozen hens on which he and his family relied for an existence were now forced to get out of the trade. The green revolution was working in reverse. I think that was spoken about in this place some time this afternoon in relation to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> I will close by repeating what I said before: I think it is high time that this nation stopped increasing budgets for foreign aid to underdeveloped countries without giving proper consideration to the people of those countries. Rip-off merchants drain the cream from our foreign aid day after day, and if there is any skim milk left on the bottom of the bucket that is what the peasants get. I think we have been conned right, left and centre. To me it is one of the greatest rorts that the Australian taxpayer is providing for at present. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Identified by a number of studies and reports. I listened with great interest to what Senator Primmer said. I accept his sincerity in what he said. I think it is arguable what is the best way in which we can assist food security. There is a fundamental need as food security; there is a deficiency of food for mankind in so many countries of the world. Major studies repeatedly show that an institution which can share world research with other countries and which can give assistance of the kind envisaged under this legislation is a very positive step. The Centre has certainly been considered by the Australian Government in that sense. We recognise that food security cannot be achieved simply by developed countries with food surpluses sending their surpluses elsewhere. If the food is given free or on concessional terms that is not the way in which to guarantee food security far into the future. It can be best achieved by developing countries themselves producing more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note what Senator Primmer said about peasants and others in developing countries understanding their land and the way in which to develop it. If we are to assist them to produce more we have to find means to reduce the manpower, the land resource and the capital investment required to produce a given quantity of food. Again this can be achieved only by research. I hope the Centre will contribute to that. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of this Centre will be a means for mobilising Australian expertise and directing it specifically to the needs of developing countries. There are deficiencies in Australia's present system and I think it is time to address some of those. Certainly we spent about $2m on agricultural research under the aid program in 1980-81. But our aid is not strategically focused and depends on ad hoc requests from recipient governments. We found there is no really effective mechanism within Australia for systematically identifying sources of expertise within developing countries which would warrant support. If we are to look for strategic research in industrialised countries we would have to get away from the tendency for that to be concentrated on those agricultural commodities that are important to the economies of the industrialised countries. Consequently the supply of new ideas and techniques specifically related to commodities such as tropical crops and improved animal production has become a limiting factor in breaking important barriers to increased food production in many of the developing countries. These were factors that weighed very heavily with us when we decided to establish the Centre. Within the Australian and Pacific regions Australia is the only developed industrialised country with universally recognised expertise and experience in many fields of agricultural research in climatic zones relevant to such countries. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many reasons why we need to establish the Centre and to establish it in the form we propose. I think some honourable senators have spoken on those matters in their speeches tonight. Suffice it to say that there is presently no way of fully mobilising Australian agricultural research expertise in universities, State departments of agriculture or the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in support of agricultural development in developing countries. These institutions, irrespective of any amendments to their charter which sought to accommodate developing-country needs, would continue to give first priority to their in-Australia activities. This Centre will need guidance as to research priorities and the means of meeting them. The high level Advisory Council will be one way of assisting it to do that as effectively as possible. I think everyone is aware from the Bill itself of the way in which that Council will be constituted and the role it will play. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sibraa questioned whether there would be an overlap, whether this Centre would be similar to an institution such as the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture in Nigeria. I point out to him that the Centre will not resemble that Institute of the Consulative Group on International Agricultural Research. It will not have its own research capacity. It will consist of a small secretariat to contract research to existing institutions or to individuals. As we know and will discuss with the amendments to be moved this Bill includes a twilight provision which provides for the review of the Centre in the tenth year and cessation after 12 years unless the Government introduces further legislation. With those comments I commend the Bill to the Senate. I look forward to the work that it will be able to do to assist in the developing countries with food security. </PARA>

<PARA>The amendment relates to the expiration of the legislation. It is related also to our other amendments. In the second reading stage I adverted to the fact that the terms of the members of the Advisory Council were three years, that at the end of six years the members of the Advisory Council would have served two terms and that then would be an appropriate time to review the provisions of the Act. Presumably that review would take two years as is foreshadowed in the Bill as it now stands. At the expiration of those two years a decision would be made regarding the cessation of the legislation. If we are to have a sunset clause in relation to an area which in a sense is as volatile as this we think it might be worth while to have a provision for its review somewhat earlier than is envisaged in the Bill at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is not able to accept the amendment that has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Button) on behalf of the Opposition. We are not rejecting it merely because is seeks a change in the timing for review or anything of that sort. But the provisions in the legislation relating to the term of office of the director, the timing of the review and the expiration of the legislation at seven, 10 and 12 years respectively, have been decided upon only after the most careful consideration. Perhaps I should explain why we selected those three periods. After seeking expert advice the Government considered the initial term of up to seven years as the most appropriate for two reasons. Firstly, reasonable tenure was considered to be essential to attract the very best people in the field for the position and, secondly, it will provide the first director with sufficient time to establish the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research and to have it in full operation, bearing in mind the lead times involved in agricultural research, before his appointment expires. If there is a change of director after seven years the next critical date is that relating to the review process which, under the legislation, will be 10 years. This was very deliberately chosen to give a new director three years to make his mark on the organisation and to implement new policies before the review was undertaken. There would then be two years in which to conduct the review and, depending upon the result, adequate time in which to prepare new legislation or, if the review came to the conclusion that the legislation should not be renewed, adequate time in which to wind down the activities of the Centre.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It will therefore be seen that all the periods chosen by the Government form part of a carefully related and integrated package. If Senator Button who is proposing this amendment is basing it on the same premise-he has proposed periods of eight years and so on-the Government believes strongly that the ability of the Centre to achieve the objectives as laid down in this legislation would be seriously impaired by that time- table and that it would be difficult to attract a director of the highest calibre. Under the timetable proposed by the Opposition's amendment a director appointed for seven years would find himself in the position of having his administration reviewed when nearing the end of his appointment. This in itself would not be impossible but, in conjunction with the proposed sunset period of eight years, could lead to a ridiculous situation. The review would take some time-perhaps a year-and, depending on the recommendations of the review an incoming director could immediately after taking up his position be faced with major changes to the operation of the Centre or even closure during what could be his single year of office. </PARA>
<PARA> A further point which must be taken into account to ensure the effective operation of the Centre is that agricultural research by its very nature is long term, and in most cases one is looking at a lead time of three years to four years from the commencement of the research project until one obtains results which can be translated into practical field action. The timetable proposed in the amendment moved by the Opposition does not take into account this very important consideration. As I have explained, the legislation has been drafted specifically to cover this aspect. For those reasons the Government is not able to accept the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation replaces a means of stabilising prices for dried sultanas which lapsed a couple of years ago. The old mechanism for stabilising prices was the stabilisation scheme into which payments were made by growers in years of relatively high prices and withdrawn in years of relatively low prices. Frequently, additional contributions from general revenue were made into the fund. Such stabilisation arrangements were common for a number of agricultural products at the time. The Dried Sultana Production Underwriting Bill now before the Senate replaces that means of price stabilisation and introduces what is effectively a three-year moving average, guaranteeing producers 90 per cent of actual market returns for that three-year moving average with this one qualification: That the price for one of the three years in question which comprise the moving average is the estimate for the current season, to be determined by the Minister in consultation with the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. This type of legislation follows the trend to move away from guaranteed prices determined in an overtly arbitrary way, or by some bogus formula, to a market related price, albeit time lodged. The Opposition supports the Bill on those grounds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, this is not the first agricultural product which has had its market arrangements changed in this way. Like most enlightened trends in agricultural policy, this trend was first established by the Labor Government in 1974 with the wheat marketing legislation of that year. It is probable that this is a very favourable time for the industry to be introducing such legislation because in recent years prices have been significantly higher than trend prices. Therefore the effect of those high prices of the past two years will tend to write up the underwritten price for the next two years. There is likely to be considerable benefit to the industry. It is certainly a much more favourable time to introduce it now after a couple of years of high prices than a couple of years of low prices. Indeed, because of a very large crop, I understand, in Greece last year and probably in Turkey and Greece's entry into the European Economic Community, it is probable that world market prices will be somewhat lower over the next year or two than they have been in the previous year or two, Greece having been incorporated under the umbrella of the Common Agricultural Policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Common Agricultural Policy is the subject of a good deal of cant and humbug , particularly by the National Country Party Ministers of this Government who deplore the type of agricultural policies in Europe which they themselves implement in Australia. One example-a small example but an ironic example, given the timing-was the move by the Government, reacting to pressure from a tiny but rather noisy minority of canned ham producers on 1 May last year, the day after the so-called razor gang report was delivered. We had this new era of small government when, under pressure from the National Country Party, the Government moved to restrict the piddling quantity of canned ham imports and held them at their pre-existing levels. We are accustomed to hearing that sort of cant and humbug from the National Country Party. That cant and humbug was carried to a new high or a new low, however one likes to look at it, in the last couple of days with whines and whinges from the Leader of the National Country Party, Mr Anthony, about alleged misuse of parliamentary privilege to denigrate or make allegations against members of parliament without corroboration, without proof and without substantial evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the party colleague of Mr Anthony, the Premier of Queensland, called a special sitting of the Queensland Parliament in November 1975 to announce that he had documentary evidence to show that Ministers of the Whitlam Government received kick-backs on overseas loans. No evidence was produced on that occasion. The matter was never mentioned by Mr Bjelke-Petersen again. Mr Anthony managed to swallow his scruples on that occasion and made absolutely no protest against Mr Bjelke-Petersen's typically outrageous action. He sat back and basked in the electorate and collected the electoral benefits of that outrageous action. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of this scheme cannot be estimated with any certainty or any precision because it involves assumptions about future market prices. It is, however, I expect, unlikely to be above $5m per year; that is, about 10 per cent of the normal value of production. That would be the highest year. It is possible that there may be no cost to revenue. At that level it would be a 10 per cent degree of price support in the most unfavourable years. This is not, by horticultural standards at least, a very high level of government support, although indirect subsidies are paid to this industry in the form of underpriced irrigation water and an external diseconomy arising from the industry in the form of saline pollution, to a limited extent, of land and, to a greater extent, the Murray Valley. It is, however, relatively efficient by horticultural industry standards . </PARA>
<PARA> There is certainly a great deal more justification for the expenditure of a limited amount of public funds in this area than there is for the scandalous rorts, for example, enacted by the Fraser Government for the benefit, among others, of Pitt Street farmers and, in particular, for that group of particularly notable Pitt Street farmers who, as Sentor Sibraa reminds me, compromise about half the present Federal Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> One of these taxation rorts, for example, enables them to lend $10,000 for one year, to borrow $15,000 for two years and to pick up a $4,500 cash bonus in the process, half of which is tax free. That is a rort which is available to any person with a pie off-farm income and substantial farming interests, a category which includes half of the Fraser Cabinet. There is absolutely no justification for that scandalous abuse of the income equalisation deposit scheme, a scheme which, while justified in itself with proper rules and proper conditions, has been abused by the Government for the potential benefit of half its members and for the potential benefit of a number of other wealthy Pitt Street Farmers. That comprises a scandalous misuse of public funds tantamount almost to a theft. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take your point, Mr President. I was just citing that as an example of a form of so-called assistance to agriculture.

<PARA> I understand that the Democrats propose to move three amendments. I was told by Senator Macklin this afternoon that these amendments would be moved. This was the first I knew about it. I did not actually see them until about 40 minutes ago so there has, of course, been no opportunity to consult with the committee of my party which handles this legislation or a party meeting. This is, of course, the normal procedure. On looking at the amendments, the first one seems to me to be quite trivial. I cannot see any reason for the second one. The third one deletes, among other things, the penalty which is provided to a person who knowingly receives money to which he is not entitled. I cannot see any justification for the complete removal of the penalty. The one provided for in the legislation-I am referring to clause 17-is $2,000 which may be, it could be argued, excessive. I certainly see no justification for removing the penalty altogether. Because of the very limited notice we have been given on this matter the responsibility rests with me to decide what will be done with these amendments. I indicate that the Opposition will not be supporting them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I crave the indulgence of the Senate. The speech which I wish to make is, in fact, in the nature of a statement as the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operation's. Therefore I crave some indulgence to read my speech. I point out that it has been approved by all honourable members of the Committee; I make it as Chairman of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to make some comments regarding the Dried Sultana Production Underwriting Bill. Initially I wish to say that we do not question that the Australian dried vine fruits industry is, and will continue to be, an important contributor to Australian primary production and to Australia's export earnings. Whether payments of financial aid should be made to an industry is obviously a question of policy for the Government to make, particularly where prevailing circumstances in the market for a particular commodity are unstable or uncertain . It is not our function to comment on such policy decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, as part of its continuing oversight of Commonwealth statutory authorities, has, on several occasions, referred to practical effects of providing equalisation support or other financial support to primary industries, particularly if made through marketing authorities. We are concerned at some of these practical effects on the revenue, the industries involved and how such schemes may affect the proper accountability of authorities to the Parliament. Schemes may be open-ended at their establishment. No definite time period is set for the duration of support and no limit is set on financial commitments. Schemes which start with the intention that they apply to a market that prevails at the time legislation is enacted may end only when producers in an industry become uneconomic, or the entire industry becomes uncompetitive. </PARA>
<PARA> We are pleased to see that the Bill contains several provisions which provide a proper basis for avoiding such problems. Clause 3 of the Bill limits the initial operations of the scheme to the selling seasons 1982-85 and is a welcome recognition that legislation may be drafted with the intention that it have a limited life before review as to whether it should be continued. The Standing Committee has discussed such sunset clauses in its various reports and has noted that they may, in appropriate cases-I wish to emphasise the words 'in appropriate cases'-be advantageously used to allow periodic judgment of the effectiveness of such schemes to ensure that they are of positive assistance to the recipients and their continuation is appropriate and warranted. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 7 of the Bill provides that the guaranteed minimum return rate to producers will be set by the Minister and that the return will reflect prevailing world prices for the commodity. It is appropriate that the Minister, under clause 7, sub-clause (4), may have regard to advice from both the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation and, if he so wishes, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. Giving the Minister the choice does not, in any way, detract from the abilities of the Dried Fruits Corporation, but goes some way to ensure that the Minister not only acts on informed advice from the industry but also receives objective advice on market conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 15 provides the Minister with the power to direct the Dried Fruits Corporation with respect to minimum export prices for dried sultanas. This is an important power because it is the floor price which determines the underwriting payments that are to be made. As the Standing Committee has pointed out in the past, legislation can and should be drafted so as to avoid any confusion as to where responsibility for policy decisions and decisions affecting the administration of the statutory authority lies. When a Minister has the power to direct statutory authorities, as is provided in clause 15 in this Bill, particularly with regard to price support, the Minister's involvement in such policy formulation should be disclosed to the Parliament and through the Parliament to the people. </PARA>
<PARA> The powers which I have mentioned relate to only two aspects of the mechanism for fixing the return under this scheme. In addition to clause 7 and 15 of the Bill the Minister is required by other provisions to fix the average return rate for a season, the reduction factor for a season's crop, payment of advances on account of underwriting payments and the payment of underwriting payments to the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation for distribution to growers. I wish to stress the point that decisions will be required from the Minister on a range of matters under this legislation. The Standing Committee's experience suggests emphatically that there will be little, if any, reporting to this Parliament of occasions on which the Minister actually exercises these powers and whether it is on advice from his Department, the Dried Fruit Corporation, or, in the case of the guaranteed minimum return, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. Only when the details of such decision making are routinely reported to Parliament can authorities and Ministers be considered properly accountable for their actions. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have stated, the Committee does not question the principle of support which will be provided by the Bill or the way in which it is to be paid. However , we are particularly aware that members of this Parliament are criticised for failing to comment upon legislation of this sort when it is first enacted and for having the temerity to question the effectiveness or economic wisdom of underwriting schemes when some of the problems to which I have adverted appear at a later date. In this regard I note also that the Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills has studied the Bill and drawn the Senate's attention to aspects of the Bill which, whilst outside the terms of reference of the Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, are most certainly appropriate for consideration by the Senate when debating the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It should finally be recalled that the quid pro quo for parliamentary and public support of underwriting schemes must always be complete and regular accountability to the Parliament. As the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon , said when opening the Agricultural Outlook Conference on 26 January 1982:</PARA>
<PARA> Statutory authorities are a vital part of the marketing of Australian primary products. They must be given as much commercial independence as possible, so they can carry out their job efficiently and return maximum prices to farmers. However, they must also properly account to the Parliament that created them, and to the industries that pay for them. </PARA>
<PARA>We would happily adopt the words used by the Minister. Accountability is the quid pro quo for the passage of this legislation through this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise two items in relation to the Dried Sultana Production Underwriting Bill before the Senate tonight. One item deals with the substance of the Bill itself; that is, the provision to underwrite arrangements to support returns to producers of dried sultana grapes in the seasons from 1982 to 1986. The arrangement that is before us in the Bill has the total support of the industry. I believe that this is an appropriate Bill to be brought forward in the current circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major problems, of course, with the industry are probably only emerging and arise basically from movements outside Australia and over which Australia has no control. I refer here to Greece's entrance into the European Economic Community, the fact that the Northern Hemisphere has recently had excellent sultana crops and that in Greece the crop is likely to increase from 65,000 tonnes to 100,000 tonnes and the fact that Greece will be within the operation of the EEC where prices are likely to be substantially lower than those currently offered on the world market. Indeed, on available figures it would seem that an EEC price equivalent may be $1,250 a tonne as against the average price that Australia has been able to receive since 1978 of $1,650 a tonne. I think those price differentials really suggest that we are likely to be heading into very difficult times with this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Australian Democrats do not take the sort of approach that is currently being taken by the National Country Party. We believe that the EEC is a fact of life and that it is necessary to face up to the fact that the EEC exists and that it has certain policies. It is necessary for the Australian Government to take those facts into account and seek to arrange the industry support within Australia as best it can to meet future contingencies. Therefore, we support wholeheartedly the move that the Government has made in this regard. I believe that the industry itself will be quite thankful to the Government for this move. </PARA>
<PARA> I originally proposed to move three amendments at the Committee stage. However, I will not now be moving amendment No. 1 standing in my name but rather only amendments Nos 2 and 3. These amendments are prompted by the appearance on the legislative scene of the innovative Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills. I believe that this is the first time that the Senate has had the chance to debate a Bill that has had comments made upon it by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. It is my intention to read closely the reports in the areas with which I normally deal as those reports come from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee , and where they are reasonable and point to deficiencies in drafting or undue trespass on the personal rights and liberties of Australian citizens we will be moving amendments to Bills in accordance with the items raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. I give notice to the Senate that in future that will be our position with Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular clauses that have been raised, are relatively simple clauses. The problems, of course, in at least one of those are fairly immense. It is really very difficult in a reasonable amendment to such a Bill to try to solve some of the types of problems that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has raised. I point in particular to the problem raised in relation to the onus of proof. Fairly obviously, it is not possible to come to grips in this Bill with a problem which has caused considerable difficulty for some time. I refer the Senate to the sixty-sixth report of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. On page 6, item 24, the Committee recommended that the matter of statutory provisions imposing burdens of proof be referred to the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Missen" NAMEID="YL7">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That particular item is currently before that Committee and is being studied. I raise that point because the technicalities of that area are obviously extremely complex. It is not possible to meet those matters head on in a Bill dealing with dried sultana production underwriting. We await, as I am sure other senators do, with some anticipation the result of the deliberations of the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs so that future Bills of this kind, when they come before the Senate, might be dealt with more adequately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other two clauses of the Bill that were raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee are clause 16 (3), which relates to the requirement to furnish information that may be incriminating, and clause 17, which relates to supplying information to a variety of organisations. The obligation seems to be unduly harsh. It would seem more simple if a citizen were required merely to report to one body, that is the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation, and if the Corporation were allowed to move further on. I want to raise specific items in the Committee stage but at this time I point to the fact that in future we will be raising those items. The time that might be available for that depends to a great extent on the ability of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee to bring forward the results of its deliberations. The Committee has done, I believe, an excellent job so far but, of course, once its report is published it is then necessary for senators to address themselves to that report and to the Bills before them and in their deliberations to make decisions in relation to the amendments that they might wish to bring forward. Therefore, the time that is available may not be great. The Australian Democrats will endeavour to give as much lead time as possible but this is not always possible, given the necessity to wait on the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and then to read its report in terms of the legislation in its totality. I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of the Australian Democrats to commend the work that is currently being done by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. We believe it has already shown itself to be an extremely valuable addition to the legislative arm of the Senate in its review capacity. We will be looking forward to the types of recommendations made by this Committee being addressed not necessarily only in the Senate but also in the drafting stages of future Bills so that ultimately the Scrutiny of Bills Committee will have fewer tasks to perform. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel that at this stage I should say a word or two because, as has been pointed out, this is the first occasion on which a report of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee in respect of a particular Bill has come before the Senate and, therefore, has been available in debate. I thank Senator Macklin of the Australian Democrats for what he said in respect of the work of that Committee. I think it should be made very clear that the work of that Committee is, of course, to flag problems which it sees in Bills. It is not to recommend solutions or necessarily to put forward a solution that the Government seeks to achieve. I take as an example the amendment that has been foreshadowed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second matter raised by the Committee concerned sub-clause (3) of clause 16 , which contains a not uncommon provision that persons may be required to furnish information notwithstanding that it might be incriminating. This provision alters the Commonwealth's situation. It is generally provided in such clauses that such furnished information is not to be admissible in evidence against the person in proceedings other than proceedings for an offence under the particular section. Of course, this is a restriction on the Commonwealth's position and the objections that people can make, but it cannot be said to be a unique provision. It has been used in a number of other circumstances, including legislation regarding primary products such as we have before us tonight. But it is important for the Committee to raise such questions so that the Senate is aware that it is making that change in the provision when it proceeds, as it probably will, to pass that particular clause. </PARA>
<PARA> The first matter raised by the Democrats' foreshadowed amendment, I understand, is now to be covered by a substitute amendment from the Government to provide a different way out of the problem which the Committee raised with regard to the requirement to furnish returns when it might be onerous to require them in a great hurry or if there is not sufficient time for people to go through the normal course of making things available. Onus of proof was referred to by Senator Macklin, and the Committee raised it in its report. It is a fact that the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs is at the moment deep in consideration of a draft report on the major subject of the reversal of onus of proof which occurs quite often in legislation and in subordinate legislation in this country. Of course, that matter cannot be cured in the provisions of a particular Bill but does require to be looked at so that there can be recognition of and agreement to the general principle that there are circumstances-one hopes that they would not be too frequent-in which the reversal of onus of proof is put into legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be interested to hear the comments of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) on the third matter raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, that is, the problem in clause 17 under which a person is required to inform not only the Corporation but also, in any other case, the department that deals with matters arising under this legislation. It is perhaps a small point, but it may often be difficult for a person to know which department is responsible. This may be covered by some other means, but it rather passes the buck and puts the onus on the person when one feels that the Corporation is perhaps the main body to be notified. These are matters raised by the Committee as being necessary to be brought to the attention of the Senate. It is not for the members of that Committee to move amendments, as Senator Macklin said. It is up to the members of the Senate to decide whether the matters raised are of sufficient importance that they ought to be dealt with in debate. I thank the Senate for the opportunity of drawing its attention to this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their support of the legislation and for the relative brevity of their remarks which will enable us to deal with the legislation in a reasonably expeditious way. I acknowledge the various points that were raised in debate and the additional interest that was generated by the fact that this is the first legislation which was subject to comment by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and that that has given rise to the prospect of some motions for amendment. I will not seek to pre-empt the debate which will take place in Committee. I know how disappointed you must be, Mr President, that you will not be in the chair for that debate, but I am sure that it will be recorded in Hansard for your edification tomorrow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should merely indicate that I will be moving an amendment on behalf of the Government which I understand will be accepted by the mover of the first proposed amendment as a substitute for his proposal. Senator Missen, in his closing remarks, raised a query which was answered in part at least, if not wholly, by an interjection from Senator Peter Rae which, however, may not be part of the record. Senator Rae referred to the administrative arrangements order, which is a public and easily ascertainable list. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that that has now found its way into Hansard. The fact is that it is standard practice not to name the particular department or indeed the particular Minister in legislation. That is done because administrative arrangements can change and to name them would require the endless amendment of legislation to no good effect. One can be assured that the industry will be aware which department has administrative responsibility and which Minister has administrative responsibility. But in the event that some newcomer to the industry is not aware of that, it is a public and easily ascertainable fact. So I do not think it gives rise to a problem which need disturb the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An amendment has been circulated in my name which, as I indicated whilst we were at the second reading stage, I will move, with the agreement of Senator Macklin, as a substitute for the first amendment circulated in his name. The proposal he put forward was that we insert the word 'reasonable', qualifying the amount of time that had to be provided for in a notice. It was thought by the Government in looking at that proposed amendment that one would achieve the effect he wanted with more certainty by putting in a minimum period of time. So I move:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I say, with what any legislative draftsman of the Commonwealth would describe as most becoming humility, that I am not a draftsman. But, like the Opposition, I had relatively short notice of these amendments and hence the amendment I have moved is in a form drafted by me. On behalf of the Government I reserve the right perhaps to insert alternative words when the Bill is returned to the other chamber, if the draftsman thinks that is necessary. I do that simply as a caveat to my lack of expertise as a parliamentary draftsman. Having said that I think that this provision will give greater certainty and ensure that no unreasonably short time is provided in a request for information. At the same time it permits greater periods to be allowed where that would be appropriate. I commend the amendment to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> Page 2, clause 16, sub-clause (3), lines 38 to 43, leave out the sub-clause. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment arises from our consideration of the comments of the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills in relation to sub-clause (3), which read:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . requires a person to furnish information notwithstanding that the information might be incriminating thereby removing a fundamental right of common law although any information so furnished is not admissible in evidence against the person in proceedings other than proceedings for an offence under the section. </PARA>
<PARA>The point that is made there is that the provisions might be regarded as trespassing unduly on personal rights and liberties. We believe that that indeed is the case. They do unduly trespass on personal rights and liberties. Therefore the inclusion of such draconian clauses in legislation is best avoided. The substance of what is being sought in sub-clause (3) might be able to be obtained by other methods which do not violate what the Committee has called a fundamental right of common law. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Government I oppose the proposed amendment, which would delete sub-clause (3) of clause 16. The amendment is moved on the basis that the existing provision might unduly trespass on personal rights and liberties. But I think it is recognised-indeed the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills, Senator Missen, made the point-that there is a question of balance in these matters. It is necessary to balance a possible incursion into the rights and liberties of a person who is refusing to give information against the need to protect the revenue or to take action for some other important purpose. In this case it is necessary to ensure that all the relevant information on the operation of underwriting arrangements is made available. Unless we have all that relevant information it will not be possible adequately to safeguard against fraudulent claims on public money. In saying that I reflect the comment made by Senator Walsh on behalf of the Opposition that one is here looking to the protection of revenue and to the ability to test whether people who are receiving public money are properly receiving that public money. The important point was acknowledged by Senator Macklin speaking in favour of the amendment. Provision is made in the sub-clause that any self-incriminating information is not admissible as evidence against a person in proceedings except in relation to a prosecution for furnishing a return or information that is to his knowledge false or misleading in a material particular. In that sense this clause is not unusual and it does, in the view of the Government, represent a proper balance between public interest and the private rights of the citizen.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Lest anyone should think that the Senate is , from indications which have been received, not sympathetic to the preservation of basic rights, may I draw attention to clause 20 regarding provisions in relation to the access to premises. I think this demonstrates one of the great victories which the Senate achieved in the late 1960s and early 1970s by ensuring that in all of these schemes the special powers to which reference has just been made in relation to clause 16 (3) are not unduly extended to the detriment of the rights of the individual. In fact, a standard clause is now in all of these measures in terms such as those in clause 20, that the access to premises, the right of entry and search, shall not be without warrant as it was for a very long period. It was not until this chamber, at the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s, eventually refused to pass legislation which contained such power that the message got through, and governments have since that time introduced these sorts of provisos. I think that is an essential and important one. But I do go along with the balance that Senator Chaney talked about. I do not see that the scheme would be workable unless we could require the returns. I think the safeguard is there in making them inadmissible for any other purpose than a fraudulent return, that is, furnishing a return of information that is to his knowledge false or misleading in a material particular. Whilst I would heartily endorse what Senator Macklin said about the necessity for vigilance and also endorse what he and others have said about the importance of the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills, I do think that this is one of the occasions when there are adequate safeguards. Therefore, I support what the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) said and do not support the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Page 8, clause 17, sub-clause (1), lines 7 to 12, leave out all words after ' inform', insert 'the Corporation accordingly'. </PARA>
<PARA>Again I refer to the report from the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills, which I think makes a rather telling point about a person who has an obligation under this legislation, and that is that if such a person receives payment to which he knows he is not entitled he is required to inform two specific bodies. The first body is the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation-this certainly seems a reasonable proposition-and the second is specified as a department that deals with matters arising under this Bill. When one looks at the Bill one starts to have thoughts that possibly the department that deals with matters arising under this Bill is not only the Department of Primary Industry; a range of other departments could be involved. The person who receives a particular obligation under this Bill-it is one that carries a penalty of $2,000 or 12 months imprisonment-is required not only to go to the relevant body, the one to which the person would know he had recourse, that is the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation, but is also and at the same time required to go to this other unnamed department that deals with matters arising under this Bill. I suggest that it seems better, from the point of view of the obligations placed on the individual, that he be required to report to only one source-that is the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation-which would quite obviously be the most competent authority to notify whatever department it was that dealt with matters arising under this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) will be able to inform us of the range of departments that would deal with this Bill and that it would be sufficient obligation for the person who had received a payment to which he was not entitled to undertake only that action. It seems to be an undue obligation on the person, once he has done that, that he proceed further and make additional points to other departments unnamed in the Bill. I point out also that the subsequent clause, clause 18, seems to provide sufficient safeguards for the Commonwealth in terms of a debt to the Commonwealth. There would be sufficient strength within the Act to recover any moneys that had unwittingly been paid to a person who was not entitled to receive them. It seems unnecessarily bureaucratic to place a penalty of imprisonment on a person in relation to not paying back that money, and also-this is the one to which we take most offence-to require that person to report to more than one body. We hope that the Minister will be able to accept that the obligation to the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation would be sufficient obligation on a person under this Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the point made by Senator Missen I have already, I hope, covered the point adequately; that there will be no difficulty for someone in the industry who happened not to know which department of state would be responsible for the administration of this Act to find out. I do not think there is a practical problem in that respect. The rest of the amendment is based on misapprehension. I suggest to Senator Macklin that he might even consider withdrawing this amendment. The problem which he mentioned does not arise if one looks at the wording of the clause. The Bill requires a person who has received payment which is in excess of the amount payable to him to inform the Dried Fruits Corporation or, in any other case, the Department of Primary Industry. That provision is there because if one looks at the earlier parts of the Bill, in particular at clause 13 (4), it becomes readily apparent that, under the Bill, payments may be made to growers by the Corporation but they may be also made by the Commonwealth through a department. Where the Corporation is not involved in the payment, it would appear to be inappropriate to go to the Corporation in respect of the overpayment. The clause requires the grower to advise the Corporation if the Corporation is the body which made the payment or, if that is not the case, the Department which is charged with the responsibility of administering the Act, which is the alternative body which will, in that case, have made the payment. The 'or' is in this case certainly disjunctive. One is not looking at a situation where one has to advise two people and where there is doubt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I certainly appreciate the role of the new Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills in drawing to the attention of the Senate and to this Committee the possibility that there are clauses which need careful consideration to make sure that we are not unduly trespassing on rights and liberties. I think a careful assessment of clause 17 shows that the danger which the amendment is seeking to avoid does not, in fact, exist. Whilst it appears that we have a large majority in the Senate opposed to the amendment it may be that, if Senator Macklin agrees with that interpretation, he will see that the amendment does not proceed. </PARA>

However, there is no real problem with the 'Department' referred to in this sub-clause; the department is the Department of Primary Industry, under present administrative arrangements. Whilst one could not reasonably expect every sultana producer to know that, if a payment has been received by someone other than from the Dried Fruits Corporation it will have been paid by some department, with an accompanying letter. So, in practice, I do not think there is any problem for a grower in identifying the authority to which he is obliged by this clause, to report an overpayment.</PARA></TALK.START>

Thus people would be able to ensure that they have some proof of having provided the information. Perhaps consideration could be given by both the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and the Parliamentary Draftsman to any such requirement as this in future being required to be in writing or by some other documentary or recorded means. This could overcome a problem which can be most unfortunate if someone has genuinely done what they were required to do but is unable to prove it because it was not drawn to their attention that, for their own sake, they should have done it in such a way that they could prove compliance.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think that, as a counsel of prudence, what Senator Rae said is absolutely correct. Where there is something like an overpayment, a risk of penalty and an allegation of dishonesty, clearly it would be sensible to make notification in writing. At the same time, I think the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, or, indeed, the Government when looking at these matters, needs to be conscious of the fact that if one put in the requirement of notice 'in writing', one would, indeed, be adding another potential hurdle to a person who might be acting quite innocently. In other words, there are a great number of informal dealings which do successfully handle these matters. Somebody might well ring up or talk to the inspector to do something which he thought put him in the clear, not having a copy of the statute to hand and not understanding that there was a formal requirement to do it in writing. So I think it is a two-edged sword. I am not trying to be definitive or final in my comment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With the usual unexpectedness with which things that have been hanging around for a long while come upon us, I find myself at 10 .15 on a Tuesday night opening the debate on what will be a fairly significant occasion for this Parliament-the consideration of the first major set of amendments to what on any view is a major piece of legislation. The Family Law Act is a major Act. This amending legislation is very important, confronting as it does some quite difficult issues. I for one welcome its advent. The Family Law Act 1975 was certainly one of the enduring legacies of the Murphy Attorney- Generalship. It is important, if it is to go on being enduring, that its more important elements be kept constantly under review and adapted to achieve maximum public benefit in a situation of manifestly changing social conditions. The only note of regret that I sound at the outset, in general terms, is that that process of review has not been more constant and speedier than on this occasion. Certainly, the process by which this legislation has wended its weary way into the parliament would set no world speed record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The basic substance of the Bill derives from recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act which was established in September 1978. It reported in July 1980, reporting to the Parliament formally in August of that year. The response of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) to the Joint Select Committee's report came 14 months later in October 1981. It was not until late November last year that the Bill was finally introduced into the Parliament. Moreover, the Bill, in the form in which it appears before us, does not by any means fully encompass the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee. Not only have a number of its recommendations been explicitly rejected by the Attorney, in some instances for reasons that are supportable and are backed by the views of the Family Law Council, but also a number of proposals, extraordinary as it sounds after the time lapse, have been deferred. It is a matter of some regret to those of us who are anxious to see a workable, streamlined, efficient, equitable system of family law that the process somehow has not been able to be more expeditiously conducted. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate on the Family Law Amendment Bill is not the occasion to reopen the whole tortured and ultimately unproductive debate about the very foundations of the Family Law Act; that is, questions about the ground of divorce, the length of separation required to show the breakdown of the marriage relationship and the related question of whether the Family Law Act has increased or, as I believe, has had no effect on the rate of marriage breakdown and divorce. There are various reasons why that debate should not be reopened, although I doubt whether the indefatigable campaigners, in this chamber and elsewhere, for a return to divorce based on fault will be able to exercise the necessary self- restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons I call in aid are these: In the first place, it is evident that viewpoints on these fundamental issues about family law are ultimately irreconcilable, based as they are very often on deeply rooted moral principles verging on articles of faith-jumps of faith-which do not always allow for parallel intellectual discourse. Secondly, the debate was a very extended one in 1974 and 1975 within this Parliament as it was in the community as a whole. There is simply no evidence of any significant change in relevant circumstances or of any demand in the community at large which would warrant a further airing of these so-called big issues. Thirdly, it must be said that the Joint Select Committee carefully considered the issues of divorce and separation which I have mentioned. After hearing very lengthy and substantial evidence from a number of conflicting viewpoints, including, of course, the viewpoint of Senator Martyr who was a member of the Joint Select Committee, it recommended that there be no change to the ground of divorce or the separation period. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe-although it is false hope, no doubt-that it is inappropriate for us to spend very much time going over well-trodden, familiar and ultimately unproductive ground of this kind. I also believe we should resist attempts to turn the so-called divorce by post amendment-which I will come back to in a moment-into a vehicle for wide-ranging debate on the fundamental character of our family law system. It is a much overrated change in terms of its inherent significance and certainly does not go, in my belief, to the fundamentals of the Family Law Act. No doubt, though, we will all have much more to say on this subject in the context particularly of the Committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I state for the record that I personally-in a sense we are all making personal statements in considering legislation of this kind, it being a free debate and a free vote issue-firmly support the basic principles and philosophy of the Family Law Act. In particular I support its removal of the concept of matrimonial fault , thereby ending the humiliation, bitterness and hypocrisy associated with attempts to show who was the so-called guilty party. Those advances and the establishment of the single ground, no fault divorce, I believe, must on no account be jeopardised. I take the view that, free from the burden of attributing fault, the Family Court can now concentrate on being satisfied as to the fact of marriage breakdown-a much simpler endeavour-and on deciding the most equitable distribution of property, the proper level of maintenance and above all, of overwhelming importance, the best possible arrangements for the welfare of any children of the marriage. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking in a little more detail at the contents of the Bill, it is to be noted that only 27 out of the 72 recommendations of the Joint Select Commitee on the Family Law Act are implemented wholly or in part by this legislation. Of course, of the remainder of the recommendations quite a number are administrative rather than legislative in character. But it is still the case that a number of recommendations have not been adopted, and either rejected outright or deferred for further consideration. The Attorney-General in his detailed response to the Committee report on 13 October 1981 explained which of those recommendations have been adopted, which have been recommended and why. I note with interest the manifest influence of the Family Law Council-whose deliberations and recommendations are recorded in its fifth annual report-in the Attorney-General' s judgment in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not deal in detail at this stage with the provisions of the Bill except to the extent they are relevant to the more general remarks that I want to make. Of course, there will be, as we all know, a lengthy Committee stage on this measure. I foreshadow that I shall move certain amendments-perhaps six or eight altogether-in particular in areas where recommendations of the Joint Select Committee have been rejected or deferred without what I would consider to be good, clearly articulated reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> As a whole, the Bill is a very complicated subject matter. I think the category of things that it deals with are fourfold. In the first place there are matters relating to jurisdiction and standing. The jurisdiction of the Family Court over children and property is significantly expanded. I will say a little more about that in a moment. For really the first time third parties are given standing to bring proceedings in relation to child custody in certain identified circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, a number of matters in the Bill deal with administration which I believe, by and large, contribute to the better administration of the Family Court. I refer to provisions relating to open courts, to the publication of proceedings-subject to certain restrictions-to the power of arrest proposed to be attached to injunctions, to the creation of an appeal division in the court, to the provision allowing for non-attendance in future at undefended dissolution proceedings-the so-called divorce by post provision-and the provision for rules- making power to be vested in Family Court judges. </PARA>
<PARA> The third general subject matter of the Bill is the welfare of children. There is provision made now for the wishes of children to be considered in all cases, not just the limited class where this applied hitherto. Offences currently in the Migration Act 1958 relating to the removal of children from Australia will now be inserted in the Family Law Act. This is long overdue. The distinction between confidential conferences and counselling reports to the Court which has caused quite a deal of confusion in the past is clarified and that will aid quite considerably the administration of family law as it affects, I believe, the welfare of children. The amendment to the principal Act directs the Court, where an Australian custody order conflicts with a registered foreign custody order, to discharge the Australian order unless the welfare of the child dictates otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly and finally the Bill deals with financial proceedings, making provisions for adjournments of significant periods to be granted before orders are finalised so as to enable, in particular, superannuation benefits subsequently accruing to be taken into account. Provision is made for the variation of property orders in circumstances where in the past the rights of the parties have been inflexibly solidified at arguably too early a stage in the dissolution proceedings. There is a clarification of the power to imprison for failure to pay maintenance, which may do something to concentrate the minds of maintenance offenders in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to some of the more specific matters dealt with in the Bill. Perhaps two of the most significant changes in the Bill involve expansion of the Family Court's jurisdiction based on the extended use of the Commonwealth's constitutional powers in relation to marriage and divorce. There is now provision enabling property proceedings, the first of the two areas in question, to be brought arising out of the marital relationship but in circumstances unrelated to proceedings for dissolution. In other words, property squabbles between married people can now be resolved, if this measure goes through-if it survives any subsequent attack in the High Court-without the necessity for there to be full-blown dissolution proceedings operating simultaneously. </PARA>
<PARA> The second of the two areas where jurisdiction is substantially extended relates to children. There is an expansion of the class of children deemed to be children of the marriage, and for the purpose of the Act, to include a number of sub-classes not presently within the jurisdiction of the Family Court at all. In particular, this relates to a child adopted by either party with the consent of the other, a child of either party who is ordinarily a member of the household and a child treated by both parties as a child of their family and who is ordinarily a member of the household. These are all, extraordinary as it sounds, classes of children excluded hitherto from the jurisdiction of the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA> The additional important change in the constitutional area affects standing. There is now to be provision enabling, as I mentioned before, a third party to bring custody in similiar proceedings against one or both of the parties to the marriage. I make it clear that I for one welcome very much the more adventurous use of Commonwealth constitutional power which is inherent in these provisions and which, indeed, is in striking contrast to the very narrow, timid, cautious contractionist effect of the Family Law Amendment Act 1976 which followed the rather disappointingly restricting High Court decision in the case of Russell v. Russell. My party's policy in this area states the objective of the extension of the jurisdiction of the Family Court as being to cover all family law matters. By that we certainly intend a very broad interpretation of the concept of ' families'. That this is the only sensible objective, I suggest, is graphically illustrated by the case of Fountain v. Alexander, the subject of quite a deal of recent publicity, which involved legal action between the foster parents and the natural mother of a 14-year-old boy for the custody of the boy. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, there is not any time to articulate all the details of this case. The foster parents brought proceedings in the New South Wales Supreme Court, which proceedings were opposed by the natural mother, who argued that the proceedings should be determined by the Family Court. The Commonwealth intervened to remove the case to the High Court, where it argued that the case fell within the jurisdiction of the Family Court. The foster parents were supported by the all too predictable intervention of Queensland, Western Australia and Victoria, who argued strongly that it was a State matter and that the powers of the State court must be maintained. The High Court has reserved its decision on the jurisdiction question and in the meantime the custody of this poor child remains in complete limbo. In conclusion I echo the remarks of Justice Helsham of the New South Wales Supreme Court that this is a disgraceful state for the law to be in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. If, as I said to the Chairman of Estimates Committee D an hour ago, Estimates committees functioned on an ongoing basis I would not be speaking in the adjournment debate. Perhaps one day we will reach a stage where Estimates committees operate all the year round. Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs ( Mr Macphee) made a statement earlier today in the other place, some concern has been shown by the Polish community about the specific way in which, for various reasons, those people who are not prepared to return to Poland under the present government find themselves in various parts of Europe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Considerable publicity has been given to a large number of people in a United Nations refugee camp in Vienna, Austria and another group in Germany. The Minister gave the impression today that some 4,400 refugees were involved and that 1,400 people were designated migrants. In the broad context of the Government's latest utterances I fully subscribe to the view that in some cases when people who purport to be refugees seeking asylum have their credentials examined they do not add up. But in the Polish context the case I have in mind involves a person who surfaced in Paris. The letter that has been incorporated in Hansard is rather impersonal. It states that the nomination for entry to Australia was noted and sent overseas and that it was not the practice of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs necessarily to send feed-back or progress reports to the various regional offices. I know that the Department is in a stage of effecting rigid economies, but immigration is a personal matter, particularly the immigration of refugees. </PARA>
<PARA> I speak tonight at the behest of sizable sections of the Polish community in Sydney. We have reached virtually the last quarter of the 1981-82 year and we have yet to complete the 1982-83 period. I am a little concerned by the Minister 's statement. Does it mean that we will take the estimated 4,500 refugees out of the congested areas of Vienna and Berlin? Where do people stand who have surfaced in Paris or at other Australian migration posts in Europe?</PARA>
<PARA> I raise this matter based on the well-founded fears of sections of the Polish community in Sydney. I do not ignore the complexities of the problems that beset the Government. Since the early days of the exodus from Vietnam we have had a situation of large numbers of refugees being in Thailand, Malaysia and even Hong Kong. I am not altogether sure whether we work strictly on the basis of when people were registered at respective refugee camps. I am not sure of the relativities. I repeat that I would like informatoin from the Minister as to whether the numbers of people he has given will apply to the year ending 30 June 1982 or whether they will flow on to the year 1982-83. If it is the latter response, the question I ask is whether there will have to be a cut off point or will it be similar to the situation which applied in respect of Vietnam? For example, if a person's identification with the Solidarity movement was such that he would be classified persona non grata if he went back across the borders into Poland, I want to know by which method such an application would be processed. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that if the Area Director in Parramatta had been more specific I would not necessarily have raised the matter. Leaving aside the Polish intake, there are one or two other countries that come to mind. Honourable senators will be well aware that I am waiting for an answer regarding a group of 50 people from Uruguay who have been placed in a United Nations camp, I think, in Brazil. Those people are waiting to be processed. I am forced to seek some specific response. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs did give undertakings in relation to people whom he regarded as being subject to duress if they returned to their own country. He spoke about a special humanitarian program. He has emphasised-again, I do not quarrel with the decision-that each case should be taken on its merits. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Vietnam situation there was a well orchestrated campaign conducted by people in Australia-I do not question their motives-which tended to ride rough shod over all other groups in Australia which had relatives in countries which were having a fairly torrid time with oppression. I spoke with the Australian Ambassador in Peru when he was in Australia on furlough and there is no question in my mind about the facilities which exist in Lima, Peru. Peru is surrounded by countries, such as Chile, Uruguay, the Argentine and Bolivia, which have military dictatorships. Those countries are similar to Australia in terms of size. People have to travel enormous distances if they wish to go to Peru. </PARA>
<PARA> Initially I dealt with the question of Poland. It may be argued that many Latin Americans, particularly if they are politically inclined or political activists, may prefer to remain in that hemisphere in the hope that one day the military dictatorship will disappear and they will go back to an active political life. I did alert the Minister to what I was going to say. I simply ask him whether he is in a position tonight to flesh out the statement made by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Macphee, in another place about the number of Polish people who are escaping from the current extreme trend that has occurred in Poland. I ask whether the people who make application in Paris to come to Australia have as equal an opportunity as those people who happen to be inmates in a United Nations camp in Vienna or West Germany. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly tonight I complete the record concerning the dispute last year beween the Department of Social Security and, in particular, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) and members of his staff who are members of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association. Secondly, I draw the attention of the Senate to the sort of behaviour that the Government has been indulging in. With one voice the Government bewails the fact that this country cannot afford increased expenditure-that it must cut back on expenditure-and with another voice it is spending a considerable amount of money on matters that one could hardly think are important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to raise the matter of one of the great wastes of money by the Government-that is, the $361,790 media attack which was conducted by the Minister, Senator Chaney, on those members of his Department who were in dispute with him. If we add to that the extra moneys which have had to be spent by, in particular, the New South Wales Department of Youth and Community Services and various voluntary agencies in this community, we are talking about considerably over $1m. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently we were told by way of answers to questions that the funds which Senator Chaney and his Department spent were obtained from appropriation line No . 590/2/10 which is declared to be for publicity purposes. This was augmented in January this year by drawing on the Advance to the Minister for Finance pending Additional Estimates which, as honorable senators know, cover contingencies not foreseen when the previous Budget was put together. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not that no one benefited from this sort of expenditure. We know that one Mr Jonathan Gaul, who is a well-known Liberal Party public relations man, was paid $2,850 for a couple of weeks work during which he gave advice on the exercise in union and Public Service bashing which was conducted by the Minister . He was hired despite the fact that the Minister has at his disposal in the publicity section of his Department 12 public servants who should have been adequate for this sort of work in any circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, various newspapers and radio stations around the country benefited from this expenditure at the time. As well as the usual newspapers such as the Sydney Morning Herald and the Daily Telegraph in Sydney and the Age and the Sun News Pictorial in Melbourne, daily newspapers in Albury, Bathurst, Broken Hill, Dubbo, Goulburn, Grafton, Lismore, Maitland Murwillumbah, Orange, Tamworth and Wagga Wagga in New South Wales and the Bernie Advocate, Hobart Mercury and the Perth Sunday Independent, benefited from publishing what was almost a saga of advertisements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They must have left out the Examiner. I might be able to find it in the list but if it has been left out I am sure that Senator Peter Rae will complain about it afterwards. We had a saga of advertisements, the first being headed 'Message to Social Security Clients'. The next was headed 'A Message to all Pensioners in N.S.W.', and the next 'The Following Message has Been Sent to all Department of Social Security Staff Members in N.S.W. and Vic.'. Then the situation became a little more dramatic when Jonathan Gaul was employed. The next advertisement was headed: 'The Government was Elected/This Union Represents '. Then we had 'An Official Message for Everyone Receiving Pensions and Benefits ' and then another, 'An Official Message for Everyone Receiving Pensions and Benefits'. The final advertisement was appropriately entitled 'Enough's Enough'. I do not know for whom the advertisement headed 'Enough's Enough' was intended, whether it was for the taxpayers of this country or for the people who read the newspapers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While this was going on radio stations in New South Wales and Victoria were similarly receiving advertisements justifying the position of the Minister for Social Security. I am sure that honourable senators will remember that bans had been placed in several areas of departmental work in the Department of Social Security to draw attention to the staff shortages which had resulted in low staff morale, staff being exhausted, frustrated clients and general inefficiency within the Department. By last year all these problems had been removed except that in some offices a ban remained on the recovery of overpayments. This was the case at Budget time when it was not foreseen, we were told by the Minister in his answers, that he would go off on an offensive to prevent and to stop the small number of bans which had been applied by the Department. From mid-November until a fortnight before Christmas the Minister, in a great blaze of publicity, went on the rampage. He was standing down staff and we had introduced into the language a new term. People were being CEEPed. The Minister was CEEPing people for further effect, we assume. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Later, as Senator Coates pointed out, they were de-CEEPed in a de-CEEPing procedure. The results of this little exercise were far more serious for many families. Thousands of people poured into emergency aid offices and came to the counters of the Department of Youth and Community Services particularly in Sydney where over $1m had to be paid out by the New South Wales Government, which had not been a party to Senator Chaney's intemperate decision to mow down his own staff members, to stand down officers in his Department. That half a million dollars, plus hundreds of thousands of dollars from other aid agencies, can be added to the $361,000 propaganda effort, making up the more than $1m that I have suggested was spent on this little episode described by some as Senator Chaney's folly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Throughout the entire action in debates in this place, in debates on television and in the news media and in the sorts of advertisements that Senator Chaney was putting out, Senator Chaney pleaded that he had to be tough and that he could not negotiate while bans were on; but wearing his other hat as the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations he admitted in this place on 23 February 1982 that in dealing with Public Service unions while bans are on:</PARA>
<PARA> It is normal for discussions to continue aimed at securing a lifting of work bans and limitations in order that the merits of claims may be considered in an atmosphere free of industrial duress. </PARA>
<PARA> In practice it is not always possible to totally divorce discussions aimed at removal of all industrial action from consideration of the merits of particular claims that may have given rise to that industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA>But the Minister, Senator Chaney, refused to consider the merits of the ACOA claims, and cost the country $1m-I suggest that that is the sum of money that was squandered by his obstinacy-and created difficulties for many of his social security clients. </PARA>
<PARA> An extra result of this little episode has been a run on overtime to make up for the time and money lost during Senator Chaney's catastrophic last stand. Over three-quarters of the overtime budget of his Department has been spent in under two-thirds of the financial year. As we have been assured by the Minister and by the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) that overtime will not be cut out in his Department, it is probable that there will have to be additional appropriations for more overtime. </PARA>
<PARA> In putting thousands of unemployed single persons and sickness beneficiaries through the ordeal of having to ask for charity during these weeks because their cheques were not processed, Senator Chaney, his Department and his Government have caused considerable personal difficulties to people. He caused a considerable wastage of public funds-over $1m-that could have been put to far better use in staffing and in assistance to clients. The irony of it all is that at the end of the bans and then the lock-out, the Government admitted to the union that there was in fact a staffing problem, something which senior officers of the Department had always said and that reports to the Department had confirmed previously. Senator Chaney agreed to call in an outside consultant to review the Department's staffing. I suggest that this was something that could have been done before he called out the artillery which was at his disposal, before he wasted the taxpayers' money, before he caused the aid agencies considerable expenditure, before he caused the difficulties that were caused to the New South Wales Department of Youth and Community Services, and before he put beneficiaries and pensioners to a great deal of humiliation and anguish during the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> In answers to myself and to Senator Bolkus and, on the Minister's behalf, by Mr Hunt to Mr Free in another place, we have the final summing up of just how futile this whole exercise was and just how costly it was in public funds. Unfortunately, we do not have a measure of how costly it was in personal anguish and difficulties to the various beneficiaries in the community. It is another example of the Minister and the Government forgetting that the Department of Social Security was set up to assist those who are disadvantaged and to assist those in need, and not to create more disadvantage and more need and anxiety for those who are in difficulty in the community. I am sure that when the Additional Estimates come out, Senator Mulvihill, myself and others who are on the relevant Estimates committee will have something further to say about this matter. We may even get finer details than we have from the questions on notice. But in the meantime the matter is on the record in the Senate. I hope that the Minister and the Government will learn from the futility of the exercise they conducted last year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not surprised that Senator Grimes should choose the dead of night when our proceedings are not being broadcast to put the record straight in the manner he has. I am sure the only people who will be aware that he has done it will be his few supporters in the union movement on whose behalf, no doubt, he spoke this evening. But I think it is fascinating that he can speak for some 10 minutes, chiding the Government for its behaviour during this strike, and let not a word escape his lips about the behaviour of a few silly extremists who did so much to try to harm pensioners and beneficiaries in this country. I think that is why the speech was made in the dead of night when we are not on the air.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is, of course, that it certainly was necessary to advertise during the course of that strike. One of the most unfortunate features of the strike was the misinformation put forward during its very early days. Greatly exaggerated claims of the extent of disruption were put abroad. It was highly desirable, in the interests of pensioners and beneficiaries, that the true position be made plain to them. Senator Grimes referred in his speech to the heading on a number of the advertisements: 'Message to Social Security Clients' and 'Message to Pensioners'. I make no apology at all for endeavouring to ensure that the people who are dependent upon the Department of Social Security were aware of the facts and not of some of the fictions which were flying about. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as any question of Public Service bashing is concerned, the fact of the matter is that from the time I have held this portfolio I have tried to make my concerns the concerns of those public servants who man my Department and who draw my attention and the attention of the senior management of the Department to what they see as deficiencies. I took up with the Government a number of matters raised by members of my Department. I refer to the additional funds that were obtained by me from the Government to upgrade office accommodation and the program of office accommodation upgrading which then ensued. I refer to the more than ample staff ceiling cover I obtained for the new functions which were required, which was a direct result of the view put forward that there had been inadequate provision for that in the past. I refer to the increased emphasis on training which was a response to the view expressed that there was inadequate training in the Department. I believe that during the course of 1981 there was ample evidence within the Department that there was a serious attempt to deal with all matters of administrative concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I at no stage claimed that everything in the Department was perfect. I made it quite explicit that in a department with 167 regional offices and nearly 12,500 staff members there would, of course, be points of difficulty, and I would expect to address myself to them. But the fact is that the great bulk of the loyal members of my Department stayed at work at all times. They stayed at work out of loyalty to their clients. In fact the great bulk of payments which were due to be made by my Department were made on time to the people who were supposed to get them. In only two States, New South Wales and Victoria, did a minority of people manage to disrupt payments at all. I very much regret the disruption which occurred and point to the action which we took to minimise the effect on clients. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that the speech which has just been made in the Senate is even vaguely the speech of somebody who would purport to be part of the alternative government of this country. I am sorry the speech was made when it was because I believe that if it had been widely heard it would have been judged by the Australian people as a totally unsuitable speech. There is not a single word of complaint about the fact that, at one stage, a few unionists set out to stop a computer run of a quarter of a million cheques. They tried to prevent the payment of a quarter of a million cheques to age pensioners, sickness beneficiaries and so on, at the same time as they were publicly claiming that they were doing everything possible to help clients. A directive was issued in writing over the signature of a union official, saying that that run should not occur and not a word of chiding was heard in this place about that sort of behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> At all times I also indicated that the position of the staffing of my Department is not and has not been static. A series of changes were made last year and I was more than prepared to examine areas of complaint. As soon as the dispute lifted, I met with the union as I had undertaken to do, and I discussed with it the way that review could be approached. An independent consultant has now been appointed in accordance with the view I expressed on 22 December, immediately following the dispute. I have little doubt that the review will produce information which will be of assistance to me, to the Government and to the management of the Department in doing our job well and properly. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge the fact that the Department is dependent upon the loyal and devoted service of the people who work in it. I acknowledge also that the great bulk of them continue to give that loyal and devoted service to which I pay tribute, and I regret their efforts and the efforts of the Government to serve the people of Australia were interfered with in the way that they were. But there is no regret on my part that, during this dispute, the Government made the position clear to the union, to the people of Australia and to the pensioners and beneficiaries of this country. I believe that we did no more and no less than the people who elected us to govern would expect and, indeed, many of those who did not vote for us would have expected also. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some comments in relation to certain parts of a speech made by Senator Gietzelt last Thursday in relation to the annual reports of 1980-81 for Trans Australia Airlines and Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. As reported in Hansard, Senator Gietzelt said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Trans Australia Airlines report sets forth all of the activities of that organisation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to talk about some of the detail. He then said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is in accordance with the requirements of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the report from Ansett Transport Industries Ltd is a four-page typewritten document which just sets out the financial situation of that organisation with a very short covering letter by the directors. That really is a very inadequate report from the private sector airline-which always claims to be more efficient and more able to present its case to the Australian public- than the report in respect of the Government owned airline.</PARA>
<PARA>Lest there should be any continuing misunderstanding as to the nature of the reporting obligations and the reports actually presented in respect of the two participants in Australia's two airlines agreement, I would like to clarify that the report to which Senator Gietzelt was referring so far as Trans Australia Airlines was concerned is the annual report which, under the legislation establishing the Australian National Airlines Commission, that airline is required to present to Parliament. That is its annual report in full detail. I join with Senator Gietzelt in saying that it is a good and complete compliance with the Commission's requirements under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> However, Ansett Transport Industries was presenting an annual financial report to the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) relating to the operation of air services in pursuance of clause 11 of the 1972 two airlines agreement, which is an entirely different obligation. It is an obligation which arises as a result of an agreement entered into between the Government and the two major domestic airlines and does completely and fully comply with its obligations under that agreement. It extracts from its annual report, which is made under the Companies Act, all of the information which is separated and applicable to its airline operations, which enables a comparison to be made between the airline operations of TAA and the airline operations of Ansett Transport Industries. It is well known that both of them have activities other than operating an airline. </PARA>
<PARA> There are parts of the annual report of TAA which deal only with the airline operation. The document I have is provided to the Minister by Ansett and tabled for the information of the Parliament but the Ansett report to be compared with TAA's full report is the one which I will seek leave to table in a moment. It is Ansett Transport Industries Ltd's 44th annual report which is its full company report under the Companies Act which provides all of the information similar to the sort of information provided in the TAA report. I think that it would be unfortunate if that matter was not corrected for the record. I seek leave, therefore, to table the annual report which is the full report of Ansett Transport Industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Gietzelt went on to make certain other comparisons. Very briefly I would like to say that I think there are some points to be made in relation to the comparison between the success last year and in the past few years of the two airlines. Last year the operating profit before tax of TAA was $46,000; Ansett's was $27,327,000. The provision for tax by TAA was a net benefit of $168,000 whilst Ansett made provision to pay $14,988,000. This is not something which is a novelty arising out of any question of the Government's review of the structure of TAA. Over the past four years one can compare Ansett' s after tax profit of something in excess of $51m with TAA's of just over $15m and the income tax paid by Ansett of $54m with that of TAA at $2.4m. The figures of TAA do not take into account the $180m liability which has now, according to the last report, risen in some eight years in respect of the unfunded contributions to Commonwealth superannuation under which it has an obligation to make payments to the Government but has not made them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that there are bases upon which we can say that, where the observer can see two apparently parallel and equally efficient airlines operating, both providing what I believe to be an excellent service-none of the comments that I make I would wish to be taken as attacking the operations of the airline services provided by Trans Australia Airlines-and where the figures vary as much as I have pointed out, questions arise as to structure and operation. It is legitimate for the Government as the shareholder in effect of the statutory authority to say: 'Let us review the operation'. The comparison is so extraordinary as to need some explanation. I do not pause tonight to endeavour to make any explanation. I do pause to thank the Minister for Transport for ensuring that TAA's reports which have always been prepared in good time but not always made available in good time by the Minister and his Department and Ansett 's obligation under the two-airline agreement have been made available to Parliament months earlier than has been the average over the past few years. As I have been one who has complained in the past about it, I would like to take the opportunity to acknowledge that that problem at least has been overcome. I thank the Senate for the opportunity to make those few remarks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take a very brief time to refer again to a matter I raised last Thursday on page 734 of Hansard in connection with the Grace Bros rip-off. I want to complete the record on that matter. There was quite an amazing response over the last few days. People were delighted to see that some truths were being told about that particular company. They showed that the matter I outlined on Thursday was not an isolated case. Almost the same situation happened to another family in Hobart who came from Canada last year. Their goods, furniture and so forth were shipped from Toronto across to the coast and then to Australia for $2,300. Grace Bros then charged more than $500 to take their effects from the Hobart wharf to its store in a Hobart suburb. There were quotes from other companies of less than half that amount but-this is the important point-because the goods were in a container in which there were other goods they could not get access to them in order to take advantage of the cheaper quotes. They were locked into a situation from which they could not escape. Grace Bros had their goods and were able to call the tune on the price and everything else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I just wanted to report that a number of people added to the complaints about Grace Bros in response to my speech last week. There was another case, again involving the United Kingdom, where the company had been suggested by Tasmania House, which of course does not now exist. Its agents turned out to be Grace Bros. Once again there was no way of avoiding using the firm. I want to refer to the fact that this whole lack of choice, the blackmail involved, the grip on the overseas market by Grace Bros, strikes me as being a restrictive trade practice which I want to refer to the Trade Practices Commission and the Tasmanian Consumer Affairs Council. I am in the process of doing that. The only other point to mention to complete the story is that so far the company concerned has made absolutely no response whatsoever to my complaints. </PARA>

Perhaps in view of the fact that Senator Peter Rae has now tabled the full report of Ansett Transport Industries tonight, in future Ansett Transport Industries might see fit to table in the Parliament a full and comprehensive report of its financial operations as does TAA and then of course whoever speaks on the report for the Opposition may be able to make a true comparison.</PARA></TALK.START>

Perhaps in the future when the report comes in, we may see not the trade name of Ansett Transport Industries but the name Murdoch Airlines. Let us have a look at the whole of Murdoch's operations as against the operations of TAA. As I said, it is well known that Senator Peter Rae would like to see TAA disposed of. He has said that many times in the Senate, if not directly then by insinuation. He would like to see a monopoly airline operating in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Mulvihill raised a matter which is concerning him about the application of Australia's refugee and special humanitarian programs in relation to Polish refugees-I think we could appropriately call them Polish asylum-seekers-in various parts of Europe. Overwhelmingly, Poles seeking asylum are concentrated in camps in Austria, where there are, on the latest figures that I have, nearly 23,000 Poles . There are elsewhere in Europe, of course, some Polish asylum-seekers- approximately 7,000 in the Federal Republic of Germany, only 750 in Italy and some 3,000 in other countries.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Presumably yes. I do not have a specific figure on how many there are in France. The policy of the Australian Government, which was stated today in a full statement by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee), indicates that Australia's contribution to relieving this congestion in Europe of refugees from Poland is on a per capita basis higher than any other country. We have increased our global figure of refugees covered under our refugee and special humanitarian programs by 2,000 for the current financial year. That brings the global figure, I think, to a total of about 24,500. Out of that figure it is expected that there will be 4,400 Polish refugees. That is a significant proportion of our total global program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not able to say exactly from what parts of Europe these 4,400 Polish refugees are coming. I do not think there is any particular quota for specific countries, but I will have that matter checked. The additional 2,000 refugees covered by our programs to help relieve congestion in Austria and Germany was brought about really as a result of those figures that I mentioned. There is an overwhelming concentration of refugees in Austria and Germany. That is not to say that there would not be Polish refugees from other parts of Europe seeking asylum in Australia who would be eligible for consideration. I will have to refer that matter specifically to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to see whether particular quotas have been put on other parts of Europe. I thought it was important that the Senate should know that overwhelmingly the refugees are concentrated in Austria and Germany. </PARA>
<PARA> As a matter of interest, despite what seems to be a very high figure, as I have just mentioned, of those seeking refugee status or asylum, it is estimated that something like 200,000 to 250,000 Poles are resident in western Europe at the moment. They are only temporarily residing in western Europe and are not in fact seeking refugee status. They are simply waiting in western Europe in the hope that the situation in Poland will improve sufficiently to enable or encourage them to return. At the moment those people are not seeking asylum anywhere in the world. The policy of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is that they should not be encouraged to do so but that their future should be assessed as the situation in Poland unfolds. Many of these people are being allowed by western European countries to stay and work in those countries. The policy of these countries is to extend those sorts of conditions to them thus relieving what would be, of course, a tremendous additional increase in refugees from Poland and pressures on refugee programs such as our own. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator Durack</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Panavia Tornado was dropped from Australian contentions in 1978 when the short-list was reduced from six to four. The Tornado was excluded from further evaluation principally because the capabilities it offered were not appropriate to the Australian environment even if a two variant solution, involving a mix of the Air Defence Variant (ADV) and the Interdiction/Strike ( IDS) variant, were pursued. The Defence Department's objective in reducing the New Tactical Fighter short-list to two contenders was to allow a comprehensive comparative assessment to be made of the real program costs of the contenders against Australian requirements in the Australian operating environment. This indepth comparative evaluation of operational capability, and support and life cycle costs, performed by a large team of operational, engineering support, industry and scientific specialists, could not have been done without restricting the short-list to two aircraft. Only a watching brief was kept on aircraft excluded from the competition in 1978 and 1979. Therefore, a data base equivalent to that used for the comparative evaluation of the F16 and FA18 aircraft is simply not available for the Tornado. It follows that, without mounting a new evaluation effort of the same magnitude as that conducted in 1980 -81, an equivalent project cost for the acquisition of Tornado cannot be provided.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The report in the November edition of Aircraft magazine appears to be based on an approach made to the Australian Government in late 1981 by the Panavia marketing organisation. It has to be recognised that costings provided via commercial marketing groups are in no way comparable with the costing exercises undertaken by the Department of Defence which include, as well as the acquisition costs of the aircraft and its engines, the costs of configuration changes to meet unique RAAF operational requirements, and the cost of simulators , spares, test equipment, training equipment and the like. The Defence Department costs also include the cost of new buildings and overhaul facilities at RAAF Bases, the costs of establishing important support capabilities in Australian industry, and an allowance for contingencies. A first order estimation, based on the latest Panavia basic unit fly-away costs would indicate a project cost for the Tornado some four or five per cent more than for the FA18 . If anything, this estimate is conservative in that Panavia provided costs only for the IDS variant, of which 805 are being built. The RAAF would require a mixture of IDS and ADV types. The ADV is likely to be significantly more costly than the IDS because only 165 are being built.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The IDS variant of the Tornado was designed for broadly the same role as the F-111C. However, the Tornado design was optimised for the European operating environment and, in comparison to the F111C, it has significantly less range and payload capability. Also, the Tornado does not have the system redundancy of the F111C, nor does it have a precision attack infra-red/laser system similar to the Pave Tack system currently being acquired for the F111C. Adoption of the Tornado for the RAAF strike role would involve a significant retrograde step from the operational capability of the F111C.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No advantages of any operational or financial significance would accrue. In fact the contrary would be true. That is, even a two variant solution would not meet RAAF requirements in the Australian operating environment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yes. The anti-venom is not freely available. It is currently being used in a clinical trial being conducted by Professor T. Torda and Dr M. Fisher of Sydney. Initially, supplies of the anti-venom were held at seven New South Wales hospitals. More recently, an additional two hospitals in New South Wales have received supplies.</PARA>
<PARA> Approval for the anti-venom to be freely available will require a recommendation to that effect by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee, which must satisfy itself as to the anti-venom's quality, safety and efficacy.</PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the anti-venom's recent use in the clinical trial, there had been only limited testing in animals and no use in humans. It is thus necessary to collect sufficient information to permit the Committee to make a judgement. As the use of the anti-venom is infrequent (only three occasions in almost 18 months) it is difficult to say when sufficient information will be available to permit consideration by the Committee. This will be decided by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in consultation with the doctors conducting the trial and will depend in no small part upon the degree to which both beneficial and adverse effects are observed in each individual patient receiving the anti-venom during the initial period of the trial.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. Reports which my Department has received from our embassy in Manila do not, however, enable me to confirm or deny that the killing was an act of the security forces of the Philippines or that it was part of a specific campaign against the New People's Army.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The incident occurred in the province of Northern Samar where the Australian Government is supporting a major integrated rural development project which includes much more than the building of roads, namely agricultural development, water supplies, rural electrification, telecommunications and training. In fact there are at present more Australian manhours put into agriculture than into roads. While project activities cover the whole province of Northern Samar the village of Sag-Od is almost on the border with Western Samar and in an area remote from any concentration of project activity.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The formal request for Australian assistance with the development of Northern Samar, one of the most underdeveloped areas in the Philippines, came from the Government of the Philippines. This was in accordance with established procedures. Before deciding to participate in the project the Australian Government commissioned several studies including detailed pre-feasibility and feasibility studies. The latter lasted six months, was conducted in the province by Australian personnel and involved discussions with people of all levels.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The military authorities cannot be said to be using roads built with Australian assistance to 'suppress the people of Samar'. The project has in fact built no new roads on the island. All it has done so far has been to upgrade one 6km stretch of existing road from the capital of the province (Catarman) to the next town. Roads whch are being upgraded are some distance from the major areas of military activity.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) I am aware that there is some local opposition to the project particularly from some church representatives. There is no evidence, however, that such opposition is widespread. The Bishop of Catarman and other church leaders, with whom Australian personnel maintain close contact, have commented favourably on the project. The views of church critics have not been taken lightly and our embassy in Manila and project personnel have endeavoured to maintain dialogue with them even though the critics have been reluctant to discuss their reservations directly. I might add that the project is constantly being redefined in the light of feedback from local authorities and people in the project area and that the regular dialogue with local church authorities plays an important role in this process.</PARA>

<PARA> Following his exhaustive fact-finding tour of the United States to determine the effects of herbicides on the Vietnam veterans, has the Minister received, since his return, a letter from the Vietnam Veterans in Congress group which stated its disappointment that the Minister had made no effort to see the group which is vitally concerned with this matter? I ask: Whom did the Minister consult in the United States so that he was able to say emphatically that he had searched high and low for information but apparently was not able to find any?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 18 November 1981 Senator Chipp asked the Leader of the Government in the Senate, without notice (Hansard, page 2263):</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask a question of the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Having regard to the defence risks to the people of Darwin, including the presence of B-52 bombers, the increasing noise pollution caused by the present location of Darwin Airport and the availability of suitable land to the south of the city, will the Government, before allocating additional funds for the upgrading of Darwin Airport, undertake an analysis of the economic and social advantages of relocating the airport to a less populated area and hold a public inquiry into the relationship between the future development of Darwin and its air transport needs?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided me with the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The issue of aerodrome relocation was considered by a broadly based working group following Cyclone Tracy. The group concluded that the high cost of relocation could not be justified by the possible benefits. There is no foreseen need for further analysis of this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator should note that I gave a similar reply to Senator Mason's question on notice, No. 1534, of 12 November 1981.</PARA>

<PARA> I address my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. As it is now 11 years since Australia signed the United Nations Convention on psychotropic substances, why has the Federal Government not ratified that agreement?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to both State and Territory laws were required before Australia could ratify the conventions. These amendments have now been made and steps are currently being taken to enable Australia's formal ratification.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 February 1982 (Hansard, page 474) Senator Gietzelt asked me, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate, a question without notice regarding expenditure cutbacks in the government departments task force report on departmental information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I understand Senator Gietzelt is referring to the report of the Task Force on Departmental Information which was the subject of my recent press release a copy of which I am pleased to provide to Senator Gietzelt.</PARA>
<PARA> The report was completed in July 1980 and a copy is now available in the Parliamentary Library. The report has been the subject of the Government's consideration in the light of other related reviews including the Freedom of Information legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> As I pointed out in my Press release the Government is responding to the report's recommendations concerning the need to improve the quality and effectiveness of departmental information programs. The Government has decided to establish within the Department of Administrative Services, a small group as soon as possible to review, co-ordinate and advise on departmental information programs.</PARA>
<PARA> As I also mentioned in my Press release the Government is still reviewing a number of recommendations of the Task Force and further decisions will be announced as the review progresses.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 February 1981 (Hansard, page 155) Senator Hamer asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it a fact that Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd has offered to sell the Royal Australian Navy its harbour facilities at Yampi Sound and Cockatoo Island as patrol boat bases? If so, what price is being asked? If so, what price is being asked? Is there a need for an additional patrol boat base in this area? If so, what would be the cost of building from scratch a suitable base?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The need for the Commonwealth actually to acquire a site for a possible future patrol boat base in the north-west was examined and resolved during mid to late 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> A review of available sites, including Cockatoo Island (BHP), has confirmed that a site at Finucane Island near Port Hedland would be preferred for any development of patrol boat facilities in the north-west.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister announced on 8 December 1981 that discussions have been held with Western Australia about the siting of naval facilities in the north- west. Programming of any facility would follow detailed examination of the facilities required.</PARA>
<PARA> Pending detailed examination and consideration of options and competing priorities within the Defence programme any statement on cost would be premature.</PARA>
<PARA> A first right of refusal for the Commonwealth to acquire the Finucane Island site has been negotiated and the Western Australian Department of Lands and Surveys has noted the Commonwealth's interest in the site on its plans.</PARA>
<PARA> This action safeguards for the Commonwealth the option to develop facilities at Port Hedland while permitting the consideration of any more suitable site which might arise in the light of any other port development in Western Australia.</PARA>
