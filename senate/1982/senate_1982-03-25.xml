<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister representing the Minister for Transport will recall that I recently asked a question relating to ridiculous air timetables which give scant, if any, regard to the needs of the travelling public. Is the Minister aware that on most days an air traveller from Brisbane to Canberra who leaves Brisbane at 7 a.m. cannot arrive in Canberra until after midday? If the airlines show such lack of regard for their potential passengers, should they be given any consideration when asking for fare increases?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recall the earlier question from Senator Colston in connection with timetables. I have drawn to the attention of the Minister for Transport the concerns of Senator Colston and other honourable senators on this matter. As yet I have not received a response from him. I think Senator Colston would understand that the suggestion which he has advanced as a means of perhaps improving timetabling is a matter of policy which the Government would have to consider. I will bring that part of his question to the attention of the Minister as well.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did the Minister for National Development and Energy note a report in the Adelaide Advertiser of 2 March in which the Assistant General Manager of the giant South African-based Sasol group stated that the direct liquefaction of coal could be still 10 years or more away? Is that the view of the Government? In view of the fact that the Government is contributing this year a further $2. 77m to coal liquefaction research under the umbrella of the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council in addition to the substantial sums of previous years, would it not be wise to provide a better balance and fund such demonstration and development projects as the gasification of the Wakefield coal deposit in South Australia rather than concentrate on direct liquefaction, which might still be said to be at the stage of pure research?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This whole question of deriving petroleum products from coal is receiving very considerable study in Australia and widely throughout the world, particularly in Germany, amongst its coal chemists, in the United States of America and in Japan. Australia is closely in touch with many of these aspects. For example, several years ago I visited a hydrogenation process in Kentucky where in the order of $300m is being spent on a pilot plant and something like $70m a year for maintenance. The general belief was that within four or five years the project ought to be a practical commercial proposition. I do not have the most up to date knowledge. The important thing is that it was looking at getting something like three to 3 1/2 barrels of oil per tonne of coal, and yield is very important. I may not have the most up to date knowledge on the direct hydrogenation process. There are various processes, including the Fischer-Tropsch process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have not seen the Sasol statement. Sasol, of course, operates in South Africa under particular conditions, including, I think, government subsidy, because of the nature of the country. But the general belief around the world is that other more direct projects are likely to be so much better. NERDDC is aware of the various projects. NERDDC, which contains a number of very expert technical people, is advising us in the distribution of our research funds. Australia has a high technological ability in coal and coal chemistry. I believe that we are well advised in terms of world thinking. Nevertheless, I will look at the article and see whether any further comments should be made.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the question asked by my colleague Senator Tate yesterday concerning Australia's relations with South Africa. I ask: After 24 hours opportunity for consultation with the Foreign Minister, Mr Street, is the Government now in a position to reprimand the South African Ambassador for sending crudely racist and untrue propaganda to members and senators and to dissociate itself from and repudiate the actions of 20 Government back benchers who sent a congratulatory message on the creation by the white minority Government of South Africa of a fourth tribal homeland as a so-called independent state?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I referred Senator Tate's question to the Foreign Minister. I have a response to that question which I think comprehends the matters raised today by Senator Button. The Foreign Minister states that he is aware that the Information Counsellor of the Embassy of South Africa has written to a number of Government Ministers and parliamentarians concerning Australian Government policy towards South Africa. The Foreign Minister states that he has not yet seen a copy of the letter and is not conversant with its details.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Please let me finish. Copies have been referred to the Department of Foreign Affairs for examination. The Foreign Minister has directed officials, in addition to addressing the substance of the letter, to give consideration to the propriety of the action taken by the Counsellor. The Foreign Minister states that although he has not read the letter he is aware from media and other reports of its general tenor. It would seem to be based on a totally misguided view of our relations with South Africa. It contains, moreover, references and assumptions which are offensive. To suggest that Australians and South Africans derive largely from common stock ignores the reality of Australia's multiracial society and the racial composition of South Africa and would be considered an insult by many Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The letter, as understood by the Foreign Minister, suggests that Australia and South Africa should co-operate to form a common southern alliance to protect the interests of the Western world. The Government rejects this proposition. It believes that South Africa's policy of apartheid is inimical to Western interests and that instead of combating communism apartheid encourages its spread. Unless there is a change of direction and steps are taken swiftly to dismantle apartheid it is inevitable that the instability already so sadly evident in South Africa will increase, with fearful implications extending far beyond the region. The Foreign Minister reiterates that the policy of apartheid is a major obstacle to peace and progress in South Africa and in the region. There can be no change in Australia's approach to South Africa until that policy is altered.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government's opposition to apartheid and to the concept of independent homelands is well known and clearly on record. Australia, along with the rest of the international community, does not recognise the so-called homelands. Following the declaration on 4 December 1981 of the so-called independence of the Ciskei the United Nations Security Council condemned that development and called upon all governments to deny any form of recognition to the bantustans. The Australian Government has complied fully with that appeal. The Foreign Minister realises that there are some who may have been persuaded to the view that the creation of the so-called homelands is akin to the extension of land rights for the black people of South Africa. Regrettably, this is not so .</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2G7">Senator JESSOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Leader of the Government in the Senate to a statement made in the Canberra Times early this week, indicating that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation will conduct a review of environmental problems in the one million square kilometre Murray- Darling Basin. Can the Minister inform me what interaction will take place between the CSIRO, the River Murray Commission and the Department of National Development and Energy, having regard to the expanding interest in water resources announced by the Minister recently? I further ask whether this will lead to a speeding up of government action to deal with the devastating salinity problems of this great Australian water resource.</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1158" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon Sir J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth Government is moving rapidly towards a better integration and impetus for the overall research and development of water usage in Australia. Firstly, an overview is being developed to try to determine as quickly as we can Australia's water needs to the end of the century. Those discussions are going on with the States. In the background so that, the CSIRO has been asked to look at all the work it is doing in many ways in terms of water to see whether within itself it can get a better co-ordination of water usage both in the aquifer situation and in the qualitative situation, including salinity which is of very great interest, particularly to South Australians. In that regard my Department is endeavouring to pull together the work being done by the Atomic Energy Commission, the Bureau of Mineral Resources and the Department so that we can get a basic overview. The CSIRO in this context will be working closely with us all and there will be a close link with the River Murray Commission. I have a responsibility for it and I will ensure that that is so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am very well aware that whilst there has been some improvement in relation to salinity because of the spring and summer flush down the Murray there are still some worries in this regard. One of the hopeful things is that the Dartmouth Dam has continued to fill-I do not know its present level, but it is between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of capacity-which will offer some hope that salinity can be abated in the future. We are, as honourable senators may know, working with the Victorian Government to get better practices of irrigation by the irrigators along the Victorian border of the Murray because the major contribution to salinity is the lifting of the salt water table by unnecessary floodings and bad water practices. All these things are happening, including the implementation of the Maunsell report. We are setting up through the River Murray Commission a computer model of the whole system in order to develop it. The Government regards this matter as of very serious consequence and is doing everything it can to implement the new policies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that Dr Hurley and others are doing a report on the family medicine program and that the report is being awaited with more than usual interest because those who are associated with the program realise that it is needed for certain important decisions. The report is unlikely to be available by the end of March, as had been intended. As is the way with some of these studies, I think this report will require some more weeks before it is completed. It is expected that it will probably reach the Minister some time during April. A decision will then have to be made by the Government as to how the report will be handled and whether and, if so, when it will be made public.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a rather surprising question from Senator Grimes, as this matter has been an issue of public notice for 12 months or so. It has been discussed at very many meetings of ex-service organisations across Australia over that period. Nevertheless, in connection with the particular meeting to which Senator Grimes referred, I discussed this issue with the TPI association at the national level about a week or so before the introduction of the Bill. I certainly did not refuse to answer or fail to answer any questions on this matter. In fact, I discussed it very fully. There was some confusion, I think, in the minds of those in the association as to precisely what was happening with the Bill. I sought to explain that. Consultation has been undertaken with as many ex-service organisations as have a concern in this matter. I cannot see that there would be any complaint from that point of view. Nevertheless, I am quite prepared to meet with the TPI association again and to discuss the details of the legislation with it in an attempt to settle the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>

However , as I have indicated, we are hopeful that there will be a fair amount of co- operation with the States in the administration of matters affecting human rights.

Is it a fact that numerous complaints about the faulty system have been made to the Department of Transport by passengers and terminal staff? Is it a fact that Ansett Airlines of Australia has erected signs in the terminal which state: 'Due to the ineffective PA system, Ansett requests passengers who have obtained seat allocation to proceed to gate lounges where announcements can be understood'?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand Senator Teague was correct when he said that the trial broadcast took place. Apparently the public response to the broadcast has been very favourable. Open Channel apparently is undertaking research into the potential for retail advertising. It is assessing the audience response in some detail. The results of this work will be the subject of further consultation between public television groups and the Government. Senator Teague asked about the further development of public television. Before the Government can examine the question of issuing licences for public television a number of other issues need to be resolved. These include: Completing the policy guidelines which are still under consideration within the Department of Communications; the place and role of public television, particularly in the context of the Government's consideration of the Dix report on the Australian Broadcasting Commission; and the provision of channel sharing which the Department of Communications is shortly to consider in consultation with industry bodies. Consideration will also have to be given to the impact of new technologies-for example, cable and subscription television-and the use of the planned new satellite. However, there is the opportunity for public television groups to continue to seek the use of spare time not only on Channel 0-28 in Sydney and Melbourne, but also with other telecasters, so there is still some limited capacity for experimentation to take place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister representing the Treasurer aware that a number of tax exempt organisations such as local councils and schools are very concerned about changes to the sales tax arrangements announced by the Treasurer in December last year? Is it true, as some of them suppose, that organisations which are exempted from sales tax can no longer purchase goods free from sales tax by means of a sales tax exemption certificate obtainable from the Taxation Office?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There must have been a number of misconceptions about this matter because I recall having had other representations on it made to me. But the facts are that it is not true that exempt organisations can no longer obtain goods free of sales tax on the production of a sales tax exemption certificate. The possibility of such organisations paying the sales tax on goods purchased at retail and then claiming a rebate directly from the Taxation Office is an option which was introduced by the Government in order to provide more flexibility in the sales tax payment system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendment merely extended to schools, to tertiary education institutions, to government departments, to municipal councils and to public authorities a provision in the regulations which already permitted public hospitals and some benevolent institutions to claim a rebate from the Taxation Office after they had bought goods from retailers at tax inclusive prices. This is an option which is now open to schools and the other tax exempt institutions mentioned. However, there is no compulsion upon these organisations to alter their previous arrangements under which they obtained sales tax exemption certificates from the Taxation Office and were invoiced ex-sales tax by their suppliers.</PARA>

The Australian Liaison Committee on Remote Sensing by Satellite provides information on user needs through the Department of Science and Technology. Industry, including mining companies, is represented on that body through its own committee. The Australian Liaison Committee has set up a working party which investigated the need for updating the Australian Landsat Station and recommended that that upgrading should go ahead. Funding for an upgrading of the Station will be decided in the Budget deliberations. The mining industry has suggested a scheme of possible joint operation. This proposal is also being currently evaluated by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

We do have access to information of this kind. It is clear that one of the very serious problems associated with housing in New South Wales does stem from the difficulties of house and land prices. Particular problems are affected, of course, by the State Government's attitude towards stamp duty. It is true that in South Australia the State Government, on coming to power in 1979, abolished stamp duty on first homes up to an amount of about $ 500. Apparently Mr Wran does not see any need to follow that kind of example to help the young home buyers in New South Wales. I will have to seek further information on Senator Lewis's particular point with regard to the amount of money that is collected from stamp duty in New South Wales. I will be able to provide him at some later time with more detail as to the scheme available in New South Wales for the distribution of help to young home buyers in that State. It remains, as is evident from the cries of the Opposition, that the New South Wales Government feels fairly tender on this point.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that there have been delays in the clearance of goods , in some places and at various times, but in the majority of cases goods have been handled and cleared to the satisfaction of importers and the public generally. Where there have been delays, frequently it is found that most of the causes relate to incomplete documentation or the non-completion of the detailed information required to be presented to Customs officers. As regards importers in these situations which Senator Bjelke-Petersen mentions, it is clear that some of the goods involved may require special attention, as they may be specialised kinds of equipment or drugs of certain kinds which need detailed examination. In that event, I understand, special services are available. It would therefore behove each importer to make known his presence and intention with regard to this kind of import by bringing it to the attention of the authorities in order that special procedures might be utilised.

The traditional basis of giving permission to these publishers has been that they wish to incorporate the material in their own special publications which do contain accompanying material. However, there has been an increasing desire by the publishers to be able to publish, without any accompanying material, certain Acts for which there is a very strong demand. They seek to satisfy that demand ahead of the availability of the official version through the AGPS. We have been discussing the easing of these restrictions with the publishers to provide for some system of permission to be given to certain publishers without having any accompanying conditions such as in the existing rules. As reported in the Bulletin, a meeting was held between representatives of the Government and the publishers in August last year. The proposal was to give effect to the idea I mentioned.</PARA></TALK.START>

Has the Government made an assessment of the recent statement by Sheikh Yamani which explained Saudi Arabia's oil production policy?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has been studying what has been said by Sheikh Yamani and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries following the recent meeting of that organisation. I was fortunate to have prior lengthy discussions with Sheikh Yamani in Saudi Arabia. Basically, Saudi Arabia had been endeavouring to get a stabilising of the OPEC oil price and a stabilising of volume so that there would be no movement over a period and then a movement less than inflation. That, of course, would have produced a fall in the real price of oil. However, there was an underestimation of the degree of conservation by various countries and of the effect of the world recession. Another factor which has emerged is that Iran, in particular, and Iraq are close to exhausting their foreign exchange and must sell oil on the world market to get money to buy food and other goods. Therefore, they are increasing the volume of oil in the world. The effect has been a destabilising one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Saudis and OPEC have taken the view that the first thing to do is to reduce the volume of oil. Saudi Arabia has led the downward trend in volume and others have taken cuts. The Saudis have indicated that at the moment they have no intention of reducing their price. I make the point that holding to their price over a period would, of course, be a real reduction. I cannot assess whether all the other OPEC countries would be able to sustain the lower volume and any lower prices. All I can say is that at the moment it is likely that the present cut in volume may not be enough to remove the surplus and we will need to see whether there will be further cuts in volume. As Senator Thomas said, the Australian prices are pegged to the price of Saudi light crude. That has been one of the cheapest in the world and we have had the benefit of that. At the moment I see no immediate change in the nominal price but, as inflation moves, a fall in the real price of oil in Australia will occur. We can only wait and see what the pressure of supply and demand will be in the months ahead.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 February Senator Giles asked me a question about bringing in legislation on what she described as pensioners' assets, but which was a reference to the Government's announced intention to introduce legislation on income deprivation. I have a more detailed response to add to the answer I gave at the time. I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is still my hope to bring in that legislation during these sittings. When I bring it in will be dictated by when the legislation is ready.</PARA>
<PARA>I now advise the Senate that the Government will not be introducing legislation during this session of Parliament to strengthen the provisions to prevent income avoidance for pension purposes. I announced last year that we would be taking steps to ensure that the income test on pensions is operating properly so that it fulfils its function of enabling the Government to provide more assistance to pensioners in greater need within the limits of total money available. Since I made that announcement officers of my Department have been working with officers of the Attorney-General's Department on draft legislation designed to catch highly artificial arrangements that increase pension entitlement. However, it has proved very difficult to do this effectively in a way that does not touch normal investment activities. We have consistently indicated that we will not take action in this area until we are sure that the arrangements proposed will not have any adverse effect on the normal domestic investment decisions of pensioners. As I said in the Senate on 13 October last year:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of having legislation which will catch the artificial and yet at the same time leave untouched the normal domestic arrangements of the great mass of pensioners who do not enter into such schemes. Until I have legislation which I am satisfied will not be in any sense punitive to those pensioners who are simply carrying on their normal domestic affairs and who are not entering into artificial and contrived schemes, I would not propose to introduce such legislation into this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>As there has been considerable interest in the question of pensioners keeping large sums in non-interest bearing cheque accounts and considerable comment on the suggested figures of $2,000 for single pensioners and $3,000 for married couples as reasonable amounts to be retained in a cheque account, I should make it clear that, in the absence of amending legislation, there is no restriction on the sum which may be kept in such accounts. The introduction of legislation at a later date will depend on whether a satisfactory form of legislation can be devised.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>I move that motion because the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) has , in fact, announced a considerable change in the Government's policy and strategy as announced in the Budget last year. I believe he has also compounded an unfortunate situation which exists in this community at the moment concerning pensioners and their assets and incomes. The Government announced in the Budget last year that it intended to correct by legislation what it believed was a major anomaly in the income testing of pensions in this community. It wished to correct, it said, avoidance by a large number of people of the income test through various means-contrived and otherwise. I quote from the statement by Senator Chaney on 18 August last year, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned that, in the welfare area as well as in taxation, income rigging practices are circumventing the intent of the laws and throwing undue burdens on taxpayers generally. In turn such practices make it more difficult to help genuinely needy people. The Social Services Act already has provisions aimed at preventing people who are well able to maintain themselves from deliberately arranging their affairs so that they become eligible for higher rates of pension. These provisions, like the pension income test, are an essential part of the mechanisms for ensuring that available assistance is focused on those who are least protected and that the already large demands made by the welfare system on taxpayers are not further increased. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> We shall therefore be moving during the Budget session of Parliament to tighten up the relevant legislation so as to prevent income avoidance for pension purposes by such devices as keeping large sums of capital in non-interest bearing accounts or by participation in other income avoidance schemes that are being promoted within the community. For example, there are schemes which produce no 'income' to pensioners but enable them to withdraw capital equal to the amount of income that would be payable under a normal investment arrangement . In other words, income is withdrawn in the guise of capital. </PARA>
<PARA>Questions were later asked in this place by me, by Senator Walters, by Senator Hamer and finally by Senator Giles as to just when this legislation would be coming in. Senator Chaney, in answer to a question by me on 9 September 1981, announced:</PARA>
<PARA>I will follow up the matter very quickly and see what is going on. With respect to the precise legislation which is to be introduced this session, pursuant to the announcements in the Budget, I would expect it to be within the Parliament well before 1 November. </PARA>
<PARA>On 24 February Senator Giles asked Senator Chaney when the legislation would come in. The essence of Senator Chaney's answer at that time was that it would be introduced as soon as possible. What has happened since this announcement in the Budget-an announcement which said that there was considerable avoidance of the income test on pensions, that people were using contrived means to avoid the income test, that there was in fact a serious problem and that the Government intended to do something about it, and quickly-is that there has been continual speculation among pensioners and other retired people in the community as to just where they stood. Some firms, such as insurance companies and so on, have taken advantage of the honourable senator's announcement and have advertised for pensioners and retired persons to join these contrived schemes so that they can receive a pension and health benefits. There has been considerable anxiety and uncertainty among people who arranged their affairs under the old rules as to just what is happening. When people on this side of the House drew attention to this anxiety and uncertainty they were accused by the Minister of trying to frighten pensioners. On one occasion we were accused of trying to frighten little old ladies. </PARA>
<PARA> It is perfectly clear from the Minister's answer to Senator Giles today that when the Minister made the announcement following the Budget Speech, the Government did not know what it was going to do and how it was going to do it. The Government announced a serious legislative change and it did not have a clue what it was doing. At the time the Government created anxiety and uncertainty in the community. I believe that what Senator Chaney has announced here today is that the Government will not introduce any such legislation. What he is saying to us in fact is that when the Government looked at what it was trying to do it found that the whole thing was too hard. </PARA>
<PARA> Further questions now need to be asked. What is the present situation? Is it still true, as Senator Chaney announced following the Budget, that a large number of people are indulging in the activities in which he said they were indulging? If it is true is the Government going to do anything about it? It seems quite clear from the Minister's statement that it will not. Is it true, as I have suggested, that the Government announced this Budget change without knowing what it was going to do and without knowing how it was going to do it? Is this the end of it or are these people, as Senator Chaney said, going to have to sit and wait for months and months before they know just what is going to happen, how they can adjust their affairs in the future and whether the way they have adjusted their affairs will result in them having the same standard of living as they have now?</PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that this is a most unsatisfactory situation. The question is not about who is avoiding the income test, where the income test is being avoided, whether it is fair or whether there should be an assets test. Rather, the question is this: What does the Government intend to do? Does it intend to persist in leaving this uncertain situation whereby thousands of people who have retired or will retire do not know where they stand and do not know how they should adjust their affairs? Are we still to have the situation where finance companies, insurance companies, banks and other organisations in this community are producing contrived schemes which remove money from the revenue just as certainly as do contrived taxation schemes? Are we going to persist with this situation where the Minister repeatedly comes into this place and says: 'We will have the legislation before 1 November. We will have the legislation in the near future'? Now the Minister says: 'We will have the legislation some time if we can work out ways to deal with it'. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the announcement of this change in policy should have been made as a ministerial statement and not sneaked in at the end of Question Time in an answer to a question asked by Senator Giles some time ago. It is a major matter. It deserves full debate. I believe that it is just a demonstration of the incapacity of the Minister and the Government to deal with this problem in a reasonable and fair way and to ensure that people who are retired and are eligible for age pensions in this community know what is going on and have some certainty regarding their retirement and some indication that the Government and the Minister know what is going on. Otherwise we will persist with the sorts of debates we have had in the newspapers in this country since the Budget announcement last August. We will persist with throw-away lines such as those the Minister made in the second reading speech for the social services amending legislation last year, when he talked about $2,000 or $3,000 being the sort of reasonable amount that pensioners could keep in their interest-free deposits before they would be affected by the Director-General of Social Services. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation is quite unsatisfactory. We need a firm and clear statement of what the Government intends to do. The Minister has in his Department probably a bigger staff than any other Minister in the Government. He has research facilities far beyond those of anyone on this side and far beyond those of most other establishments in this country. He should come down with a statement on what he thinks should happen in regard to the situation as it exists so that we can have a proper and sensible debate and so that we do not have a repetition of the nonsense of the Minister making statement after statement in this chamber about his intents and having to retract them until we are now in the situation where what he really is saying is: 'We do not know what to do and it is all too hard'. I do not believe that this chamber, this country and particularly the retired people of this country should be treated in this way by either the Minister or the Government. I hope that in the future it will not happen. In order that in the future we can have a proper debate on this matter, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

I share the disquiet Senator Grimes has expressed on behalf of the Australian Labor Party and join him by expressing the same concern on behalf of the Australian Democrats. In another debate last night Senator Chaney mentioned that there were two million pensioners overall in Australia, 1.4 million of them being age pensioners. He would know, because he has a rapport with those sorts of people, that they are deeply concerned about this issue. I join Senator Grimes in being critical of my friend Senator Chaney on two counts this morning. Firstly, I am critical of the way in which this statement was introduced. I had no notice of it. I do not know whether Senator Grimes had notice, or whether it was just his normal vigilance that made him realise that a statement of this substance was to be tacked on to the end of Question Time as an addition to an answer to an honourable senator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would have thought, seeing the issue has been hanging over the heads of 1.4 million pensioners for such a long time now, that it would have been the subject of a decision. I can understand the Government's problems in reaching a decision on this issue. I agree with Senator Grimes that it is a matter upon which the Government should have reached some finality before now, but the way in which the matter has been introduced to the Senate this morning, I think, does nothing for the Government's or Senator Chaney's credit. I hope that the Government and Senator Chaney can be more definite in giving us a date upon which we can expect a decision and that, when that decision is made, it will be announced to the Senate forthwith in a statement so that it can be debated fully. I just add the voice of the Australian Democrats in a protest about the episode this morning. This morning's announcement will exacerbate the feelings of insecurity among such a large proportion of people in our community. There is no need for me to remind Senator Chaney that 1.4 million age pensioners means that one in every 10 Australian's at the moment is affected by his announcement that he made this morning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Question Time I was asked a question by Senator Lewis with regard to the New South Wales Budget estimate of receipts from stamp duty on housing contracts and conveyancing. The figure which I undertook to get for him was estimated to be $184m in the year ended 1979-80. However, actual collections in 1980-81 totalled $242.7m which is a 100 per cent increase from 1979-80. The New South Wales Government collected $58.7m more than it anticipated in 1980-81. That compares with a consumer price increase in Sydney during that year of 8.9 per cent. However, I am unable to indicate how much, if any, of these funds were channelled into the building of low cost homes or to building societies. Stamp duty collections are paid into the general revenue and are not specifically allocated for housing purposes. However, in 1980-81 the New South Wales Government contributed about $70m to welfare housing programs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday Senator Townley asked me a question concerning the Hobart-Christchurch air link, based on a Hobart Mercury report on recommendations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works regarding proposed airport upgrading at Hobart Airport. The works related to the introduction of wide-bodied domestic jet aircraft to Australian services. The Minister for Transport has provided me with some detail. The proposal submitted to the Committee for upgrading facilities at Hobart Airport was for strengthening the pavements for unrestricted Boeing 727 operations. In addition, proposals were made for turning nodes and widened taxiway intersections to permit use by wide-bodied aircraft. Strengthening the runway for Boeing 727s would permit occasional use by wide-bodied aircraft. But naturally the Committee 's conclusion that the work should be deferred for two years unless pavement distress begins to appear earlier would affect the prospects of wide-bodied aircraft using the airport. The Committee's conclusion that the additional works proposed for wide-bodied aircraft were not justified is also very relevant to the possibility of services by this class of aircraft.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to Sir Robert Law-Smith's statement suggesting the use of A300 aircraft on its Christchurch-Hobart service, I understand that the Department of Transport is consulting with Trans Australia Airlines about changed arrangements under which only TAA will be operating that service. Evidence given to the Committee by the airlines was to the effect that they had no firm requirement for wide-bodied facilities at Hobart, and no formal request to operate this aircraft into Hobart Airport has been received by the Department of Transport. If such a request were received, the situation in respect of the provisions of pavement extensions would be reviewed. It is not possible to provide, as the honourable senator requested, figures for works which would alone be necessary to allow the airport to accept wide-bodied aircraft. The cost in August 1981 prices of overall upgrading works necessary were: Runway and taxiway strengthening for unrestricted Boeing 727 operations, $2.05m; turning nodes and taxiway fillet widening for wide-bodied aircraft, $0.60m; and apron strenthening and extension, $0.80m.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the papers. </PARA>
<PARA>The saga of Nugan Hand continues despite efforts by the Government to contain any public debate and discussion about the issues of that organisation. The report of the Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking, which is an interim report by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), deals with a number of the more rudimentary and routine questions of that organisation. The Parliament is being given access to what can only be described as a very routine and very interim report. The major part of the report has been made available privately to the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button). In the other House today a debate is currently proceeding about a number of matters relating to the activities of the organisation, Nugan Hand. The task force which the Senate is currently looking at deals largely with the drug trafficking aspects of the organisation, Nugan Hand. What the Government does not seem to understand and appreciate is that the problems associated with that organisation will not just go away, and the sooner the Government comes clean about the activities of its agencies in respect of the Nugan Hand group of companies, the better it will be for the Parliament and the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> When one is involved, as Nugan Hand was, in clandestine activities-those activities related not only to drugs but also to currency manipulations and covert activities on behalf of the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States-it is clear that sooner or later those facts will come to the light of day. A much more advanced and progressive attitude about the freedom of information legislation in the United States is now enabling the Congress of that country, the Senate and the House of Representatives, to look at the activities of organisations, particularly intelligence organisations and other agencies. The availability of that information has become a very important aspect of understanding the events of 1975. I will leave that matter aside for the moment. Honourable senators will appreciate that it is difficult to deal in 10 minutes with the ramifications of an organisation that came to the attention of a government agency in 1975-that is now some seven years ago-an organisation that has clearly been involved in a whole range of illegal activities in the Australian community, particularly the importation of hard drugs, heroin. </PARA>
<PARA> Documents that have come into the possession of the Opposition show a very unsatisfactory state of affairs in respect of this organisation, particularly as it relates to the Australian Narcotics Bureau, the Bureau of Customs and, maybe, the Australian Federal Police. I have a copy of those documents which have been referred to only very briefly insofar as the report that is before the Senate is concerned. I will read from a minute paper of the Narcotics Bureau on a memo addressed to the Commander of the Eastern Region. The minute paper is headed: ' Subject: Nugan Hand Ltd. Suspect principals of heroin importations'. The paper reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The original information that Frank NUGAN and Michael HAND were financing the importation of heroin was received on 3.5.77 and is contained in folios 1 and 3.</PARA>
<PARA>I add that I am reading from a copy of folio 14. I have not the complete folios dealing with the matter. According to my information some have been destroyed. The paper continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Preliminary enquiries showed that Nugan Hand Ltd and a number of its associates ; Leslie COLLINS, Robert PIKE, John NORTON, Graham DEMPSEY had come to the notice of the Narcotics Bureau in October 1975, (folios 30 and 31). Both Nugan and Hand travel extensively throughout South East Asia and Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Nugan Hand Ltd., is supposed to be a merchant bank with a turnover in 1976- 77 of $220 million. A BCI check shows that as at 12.7.77 Nugan Hand had made seven importations from Hong Kong and China, five being canned foods, one of furniture and one of golf clubs and balls. </PARA>
<PARA>That might appear to be quite unimportant and irrelevant to the report. But the Woodward Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking was given evidence that furniture and other goods imported into this country were the means by which heroin was brought in. Yet that information, in a preliminary aspect, was in the hands of a government agency in 1975. I make that point because we know what happened in November 1975. From that period on the Narcotics Bureau and the Bureau of Customs were very much involved in several operations, some of which are referred to in others of these documents. Operaton Canopus is one that comes immediately to mind and somewhere in the documents another operation is referred to. All of these operations were concerned with the importation of hard drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> These are documents which my leader, Mr Hayden, attempted yesterday to make available-having been challenged to do so on previous occasions when he raised the matter. Last Thursday, as a very responsible member of the Parliament, he would not make them available because of information contained therein insofar as persons whose names appear in these documents may be embarrassed, compromised and even intimidated in some way. Yesterday Mr Hayden offered to make those documents available to the Parliament so it could have some sort of wide-ranging debate. He was refused leave to do so at the instance of the Prime Minister. The Government is culpable in respect of Nugan Hand. </PARA>
<PARA> Because we have very limited time to debate the matter I will conclude by saying that on pages 1649 and 1650 of the Woodward report of 5 September 1978 the Commissioner, Mr Justice Woodward, said that there was a lack of co- operation by the Federal Government in respect of these matters. He said that in general he did not receive the co-operation of the Federal Government, the Narcotics Bureau or Customs. Not one single officer was made available to give evidence to him and there was no official information provided from the Narcotics Bureau. Yet these documents show that the Bureau of Customs and the Narcotics Bureau were very heavily involved in seeking information and carrying out investigations into the Nugan Hand group. I remind the Senate that we have had three royal commissions inquiring into drugs-the Williams, Woodward and, currently, the Stewart. We are determined as an Opposition that these matters will be brought to light and that there will be a proper public debate. Finally, I will conclude by quoting from a minute paper signed by Brian Bates, the director of the Narcotics Bureau. He said in dealing with the matter of Nugan Hand:</PARA>
<PARA> I desire that this Bureau should not for the time being engage in any active external inquiries into this matter. Until such time as I indicate otherwise, I wish this to remain purely an Intelligence gathering and holding matter, oversighted from Canberra by Mr Haydock-Wilson, OLIA, to whom subsequent information reports connected with the matter should be directed by Regions. </PARA>
<PARA>That paper was dated 22 March 1978. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief because there is not a lot to be said about the Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking report before us. I will make two or three points. Reasons have been given in the report-no doubt Senator Evans will speak about these-as to why the report should not be released at this stage except to the Leader of the Opposition. I cannot disagree with the essential reasons given for that. They are: Firstly, if the report were made public it could be sub judice; secondly, matter contained in the report could lead to legal action and, thirdly, that could prejudice further investigations. Those reasons seem to me to be perfectly valid. I doubt that Senator Evans would disagree with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will refer to what Senator Gietzelt said about the documents from the Narcotics Bureau leaked to the Opposition. I do not relish the thought of being the sole defender in this nation of the former Narcotics Bureau. But I am its defender and proud to be. Of course, there were crooked officers in the Narcotics Bureau, particularly in the latter years. That is inevitable in any law enforcement agency particularly when we are dealing with the commodity heroin which, as Senator Gietzelt suggested, has profits of around $250m a year emanating from its illegal importation. That is a profit greater even than that of Telecom Australia. That is the kind of league drug importation is in. That is the kind of money going into the hands of creatures who care not for any decency , who are totally amoral, immoral and, into the bargain, have formed relationships with overseas connections. I do not think any Australian need be in any doubt at this moment that those Australian criminals have now forged very strong and lasting links with overseas syndicates, particularly the Mafia. It is a serious situation in which we find ourselves. Totally amoral and immoral people, many of whom are known to many of us-we cannot name them because there is no evidence to justify a court action-have formed these associations with the Mafia and are earning profits of the magnitude I mentioned before. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the fact that that kind of illegal money is being earned makes very few policemen in this country safe. I single out not only policemen; all magistrates and all politicians of all political parties are marks if this kind of money is available. An overwhelming majority of policemen, magistrates, politicians and judges would be honest and incorruptible if the potential bribe offered were $100 or $500. However, if the bribe suddently escalates to $200,000 a year, which would be petty cash to groups such as this, one must ask: Who is vulnerable?</PARA>
<PARA> I make two points. I am a bit disturbed at the Australian Labor Party. Mr Hayden started off the denigration of the Narcotics Bureau. I remind Senator Gietzelt, whom I respect and admire in these matters, that the disbandment of the Federal Narcotics Bureau was announced in this Parliament two or three years ago at precisely the time the Melbourne Cup was run. I do not regard that as fortuitous. Something stinks about the reason why the Federal Narcotics Bureau was disbanded. The thing that stinks is the stench that comes from the Queensland Police Force, the Wilsons and the way in which information was leaked . The Queensland Police Force, formerly close to Mr Hayden, would be one of the most corrupt, rotten and contemptible groups of people engaged in law enforcement in the world at this time. I view with disquiet a quotation by Senator Gietzelt, in good faith, from a letter by Brian Bates, an incorruptible policeman if ever I have known one. He said that from now on investigations into Nugan Hand will be covert instead of overt. That in itself is not mischievous but perhaps to quote him solely like that borders on mischief. Why did he do it? I would never believe that Brian Bates or his brother Harvey Bates-while they may have made errors of judgment-would have been got at by Nugan Hand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge Senator Gietzelt's interjection and that is a worrying thing. I do not believe that either. I do not believe for a moment that a Labor Minister, a National Country Party Minister or a Liberal Party Minister was on the take. But there is something that stinks and I hope that this Task Force can get to it. I hope that its report will be better than the comparatively useless reports of the Williams commission and the Woodward commission. If ever there was a joke, a total waste of public money, a waste of at least hundreds of thousands of dollars-I think it got to millions of dollars- it was the compilation of the Woodward and Williams reports. The Woodward commission, having carte blanche to investigate corruption in the New South Wales Police Force, came up with what? It came up with the names of three policemen. The report is almost a joke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would be the last person to cast aspertions on Mr Justice Woodward's character. He is a fine, honourable man. However the report reveals absolute incompetence on the part of these people to unearth something-that the dogs are barking, that the police are corrupt, that magistrates are being got at and that court hearings are being changed suddenly to suit criminals and syndicates. The dogs in Sydney and Brisbane are barking yet a judge, sitting as a royal commissioner, can not find it. After spending $1m of taxpayers' money, all he can do is suggest that three policemen in Griffith or wherever may be on the take. That is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA> When one reads, as I and most honourable senators read, of the infamous kinds of activities in which this covert organisation, the Central Intelligence Agency , is engaging-not just assassinating people likely to be unfriendly to the United States of America but financing the activities of creatures like Gaddafi and financing opium growing in the Golden Triangle-it is enough to send chills of fear through anybody. These facts are on record. There are allegations of a connection between the CIA, Nugan Hand and Australian criminals. I ask the Parliament to look at interim reports with restraint and to look at leaked documents seriously, as the Labor Party is doing. I commend it for that exercise . It astonishes me why the documents were not allowed to be incorporated yesterday in the House of Representatives Hansard. It is a difficult task and one with which we must proceed with great restraint. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Contrary to the expectations generated by Senator Chipp, I do not propose to canvass further any of the substantive questions that arise out of the report of the Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking although undoubtedly they will deserve and demand the attention of this Parliament on a number of occasions in the future. I simply want to spend a few moments drawing the Parliament's attention to a policy matter of general importance which is raised by the conduct of this Task Force and the events of the last two or three days. It relates to the powers that are able to be exercised by these task forces and which set of rules, Commonwealth or State, they should operate under. The creation of joint task forces of this kind is a very significant advance in the efficiency and effectiveness of law enforcement in this country. It is a development that I certainly welcome and the Australian Labor Party welcomes. We believe it should be supported.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, a question has arisen in recent days, following a meeting in Canberra of police commissioners from all around the country, as to the ground rules that should apply in the conduct of investigations by these joint task forces. It is a problem which arises because of the differences in the laws relating to criminal investigation, the powers of the police with respect to arrest, interrogation, search and seizure, and so on in the different jurisdictions involved. Those differences in the state of the law are not great at the moment, although there are some variations, and to the extent that there are variations at the moment, the rules are probably more stringent on Australian Federal Police than is the case for police forces in the States.</PARA>
<PARA> With the passage of the criminal investigation Bill, later this session or at least later this year, there will be some significant differences in the state of the law governing criminal investigation as between the Commonwealth and State level. What has happened in recent days is that the Police Commissioners, meeting in Canberra, have taken it upon themselves to express grave dissatisfaction at the prospect of the passage of the criminal investigation Bill. They met with the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, on Tuesday night and put to him the proposition that the Bill ought-in the words of the police commissioners-to be significantly improved if it is to form the basis of any future co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States. As I understand it, the view-this meeting has been the subject of a public statement issued by the commissioners-put by them to the Attorney-General is that the conduct of both this Task Force into the activities of the Nugan Hand group and related matters and all future joint task forces between the Commonwealth and the States would be gravely prejudiced if the States participating in such task forces were to find themselves in a situation of having to live with the application to such investigations of Commonwealth law as it would be after the passage of the criminal investigation Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply make the point that it is my belief and that of the Opposition that the Government should strenuously resist this approach on the part of the police commissioners, in effect, further to emasculate the Criminal Investigation Bill now before the Parliament. A significant amount of snipping has already been going on with the Bill in its present form as compared with earlier manifestations of it. It would be most unfortunate if the process of emasculation were to be made complete as a result of the police representations to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that much of the police attitude and the hostile attitude of the State commissioners to the terms of the Criminal Investigation Bill is based on a misunderstanding about the effect of its terms. I suspect-I have some direct knowledge of this-that their reaction has been more emotional than rational. Of course this is not the place to canvass the content of the Bill as it now stands . I think it can be simply and succinctly said that overwhelmingly that Bill introduced by Senator Durack late last year simply codifies and clarifies the very messy condition of the present common law governing police investigations to increase police powers in some significant respect so far as particular investigative procedures of stopping and searching, fingerprinting, and the conducting of some other forensic investigations are concerned and only in some limited respects to increase significantly the rights or the protections available to the suspect in the criminal process. The Bill as it now stands is already significantly weaker from a suspect's point of view, or from a civil liberties point of view, than that originally recommended by the Law Reform Commission in 1975. Sir Colin Woods has publicly put on record his view in recent months, that it is perfectly workable from a police point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my view and that of the Opposition that, to the extent that the passage of the Criminal Investigation Bill at the Commonwealth level, roughly in its present form, results in a number of differences in the powers and duties available to and having to be met by police officers at Commonwealth and State levels joint task forces should operate under Federal or national investigation rules and not by the lowest common denominator standards which would otherwise be applicable. It is already the case that joint task forces like the one that we are discussing now are operating under Federal rules to the extent that they are using investigative procedures involving telephone tapping. It is only under Commonwealth legislation that telephone taps can be authorised at the moment. I cannot imagine that it would make any significant practical difference to the effectiveness of the operation of these joint task forces; nor can I imagine that any serious objection in principle could be mounted to the ground rules operating in the future being those rules of the Commonwealth-those relatively stringent, but often no more than what is presently the law, rules that will be created by the Criminal Investigation Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I make it clear that the Labor Party certainly is not happy with every aspect of the Criminal Investigation Bill now before the Parliament. We will be moving a number of amendments when the Committee stage arises. We certainly believe that the present Bill is better than having no Bill at all. We certainly believe that the present Bill that is before the Parliament is better than the kind of Bill which, at the moment anyway, would win the unanimous assent of the present State police commissioners. So if Senator Durack sticks to his guns on this one-as I hope he will and as I hope the Government does-he and the Government will have the full support of the Labor Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Drug trafficking must be regarded as one of the most serious issues before the Australian community. Certainly it is one of the gravest responsibilities of any government, Commonwealth or State. I reiterate that this Government and, I am sure, every member of the Parliament would want to pursue the exposure and destruction of drug trafficking to the greatest degree possible . Against that background I now put the matter into perspective as I see it. It is not for us to sit in this chamber making accusations against some person or some institution unless it is to point in a direction for investigation by others. The right probing must come from some judicial body. The real test is whether any judicial bodies of sufficient competence are in existence or have been in existence and, if so, whether their terms of reference are adequate. If the answer is no we should do something about it. That is the key. If anybody has any information let us give that information to such bodies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I understand it-I am subject to correction in detail-the two royal commissions in existence are the Woodward Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking set up by the New South Wales Government, of which Senator Chipp has been critical, and the Williams Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs set up by the Commonwealth Government. I understand that the Commonwealth Government invited the New South Wales Government to join it in the Commonwealth royal commission but that invitation was declined. It is essential that there should be links between Commonwealth and State governments in any inquiry of that nature. I recall that as a result of those inquiries the two royal commissioners approached the Commonwealth and suggested that a joint police task force should be set up. That was done in May 1979. That Commonwealth-New South Wales Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking exists today. I think everyone would acknowledge that that was a good step forward. Honourable senators will bear in mind that, whatever the arguments about the matter of the Narcotics Bureau-I will come to that matter in a moment-the Commonwealth Police today are led by a police commissioner of international reputation. </PARA>

<PARA> When the Woodward Royal Commission made public its views in its second report it exposed some matters that were of Commonwealth importance such as foreign exchange, importation matters, passports and fraud. On 26 August 1980 the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) proposed to the Premier of New South Wales that the terms of the Joint Task Force be widened to include Nugan Hand Ltd and others. The Premier of New South Wales agreed to that proposal. The Joint Task Force now has that specific responsibility. We have before us volume I of the report of the Task Force. I understand that there will be three or four volumes. The first volume refers principally to Murray Stewart Riley and Harry Wainwright but it has been indicated to me that the second volume will deal specifically with Nugan Hand Ltd. I understand that the second volume will be available in about a month. Yesterday, the Federal Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) was given the first volume and was told what the contents of the second volume would be. He has that information available to him.

<PARA> I shall put another proposition to the Senate: If one wants to do real damage and start all sorts of allegations one should publish a document which makes certain suggestions and leaves names blank. One will do more and not protect the people whose names have been blanked out but put a quite wrong odium on a range of people. I put that proposition quite fairly to the Senate. This problem is bigger than just a political argument across the benches. It is much bigger than that. I, as all honourable senators know, have no support at all for capital punishment in any form. Nevertheless I believe that the greatest mass murderers of our time are the heroin smugglers and pushers. Let me put that in its absolute magnitude: I loathe what they are doing.

I have said that the danger is that the public, when reading it, will put the wrong names in, and that will damage other people. That is the only point I am making. But that is not the important thing. The important thing is that the document should get into the hands of the joint task force because that is where it ought to be identified. That document ought to get into the hands of the Stewart Royal Commission. As I understand it, and I am trying to be as apolitical as possible on what I regard as a major subject, and I believe it to be so, the Commonwealth has said: 'If it is necessary to extend the terms of reference of the Stewart Royal Commission to embrace this or any other matter, tell us the need, although we understand from the royal commissioner it would not be necessary, and we will make that available'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Fundamentally, however one might want to do point scoring in the Parliament on something, this game may be bigger.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is only because of the importance of the Commonwealth-New South Wales Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking and the fact that we are talking about drug trafficking that I wish to make a few remarks. I intend to make some remarks concerning the comments passed by previous speakers. Senator Chipp drew attention to some of the points that I believe should be clarified in this place. Senator Chipp rightly pointed out that because of the large amount of moneys involved in drug trafficking people were open to bribery. He talked about people within departments, politicians, members of this place and members of the House of Representatives. I suppose he implied members of State parliaments. He also talked about the allegations against members of the Narcotics Bureau and of the corrupt police force in Queensland, and that is the major point about which I shall speak.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that this is a very serious matter, particularly the work being undertaken by the Joint Task Force. I refer also to the investigation that will take place in regard to Nugan Hand Ltd and also the information put forward by the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Hayden, in the House of Representatives. Senator Chipp said in general terms that the Queensland police force is one of the most corrupt police forces in the world. I do not believe I should allow that matter to lie there. His speech implied very clearly to me that it was an attack upon the total police force. When I was a member of the State Parliament and a member of the police committee I was probably noted as one of the critics of the Queensland police force-a very strong critic-and some of the action taken by it. But one lesson I learnt was to be very responsible in any attack that I made. I believe that some people in the police force are doing the job they are there to do. I believe they have as great an intention to see the drug problem in Australia cleaned up as have politicians in this place. I believe some protection should be afforded to those people. It is totally wrong generally to make the accusation that the police force is corrupt. </PARA>

Let us not judge on rumours, say so, correspondence or a story which someone has told. Let us not sit here and make a judgment in those conditions. We should let the royal commissions do the job. What I am saying is that an accusation of corruption of the Queensland police force is totally wrong. Members of that police force have families, are involved in the cities and the towns and are as good citizens if not better than some of the people in this place and in other places like it. Those general accusations should not be made until people have evidence to back up the accusations they have made, allow the Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking to finish its investigation or allow royal commissions and the various people undertaking investigations to put their evidence before us. Too often the public says that all politicians are lazy and corrupt. I believe that is incorrect.

<PARA>I wonder why the Senate is being placed in a position in which honourable senators are required, in a 10-minute contribution, to debate this very important policy statement on housing. When it was presented in the House of Representatives last week eight speakers contributed to the debate, four from the Government and four from the Opposition. To suit the convenience of the Senate last Thursday, I agreed that debate on the statement be held over to this week, but in so doing I did not agree that it be dealt with as one of the general ministerial papers because it is a statement of major significance. It represents a great departure from the procedures as well as the policies of this Government. The statement by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) can be seen only in the light of a panic move to deal with the housing problem on the eve of the election in Victoria. I do not want to take time away from my colleagues, but this procedure is a negation of the undertaking that was given that we would have adequate time to debate the statement and not compress the discussion into a few minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the Senate to what is involved in the statement. It is obviously a statement of such significance that the Government, in the last 10 days before the Victorian election, allocated $300,000 in order to popularise and bring to the notice of the electors in Victoria the importance of the statement. Yet we are denied in this place an opportunity, except for a 10- minute contribution from one person, to discuss the matter properly. I remind the Senate what the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said on 22 February during the period of the Lowe by-election. At that time the Opposition and many interested welfare groups throughout Australia were saying that the housing problem was emerging as a major social and political issue in this country. The Prime Minister's response to that view was that the subsidisation of home buyers would be considered in the context of the next Budget. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> We're not going to be run off the main stream of our policies because of a by- election or a State election, and I believe we will have more respect by sticking with and staying with policies rather than offering some short term expedient that would not necessarily be a real answer. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister made that statement on 22 February. Yet, due to pressures exerted upon him by the ailing Victorian Liberal Government, the Premier of that State, the Master Builders Association and the Housing Industry Association, the Government has succumbed to the very short term expedient that the Prime Minister said he would resist. It is a clear case of pork barrelling of public funding because it is a short term, ad hoc approach. It gives to a select few persons a subsidy of about $22 per month to help them overcome the disastrous decision made by this Government to approve a one per cent increase in interest rates on home loans. That is the fifth increase in housing loan interest rates in the last two years, since April 1980. In less than two years this Government has given approval for the finance institutions of this country to increase home loan interest rates to the extent that they have risen from 9.5 per cent to 13.5 per cent. There is no indication that they will stop at that level. Despite the sugar-coated pill which Mr Howard introduced-he often introduces bad news in the Parliament, leaving Mr Fraser to bask in his own reflected glory-interest rates will not stop rising. In fact, as predicted by the Federal President of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Wran, we will see even more horrendous increases in interest rates during 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> What has the Government set out to do? It has given a subsidy to a particular set of people. A survey carried out by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research estimated that, in 1980, 45 per cent of first home buyers, or 202,000 households, had incomes in excess of 150 per cent of average weekly earnings. The people who will benefit from this subsidy are those who earn in excess of $456 per week either as a single income or a joint income. They are the very people who will get the subsidy outlined in the statement. I submit to the Senate that that is a complete misuse of financial resources in this country. We know that only about 15 per cent of the Australian people are in that income bracket. We know that two-thirds of the Australian people receive less than average weekly earnings. Therefore, they will not in any way, shape or form be assisted by this package. It is no wonder, therefore, that the Australian Institute of Urban studies put out the following Press statement:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's latest package only scratches the surface of the housing problem. </PARA>
<PARA> It still totally ignores the shrinking rental market and the mounting public housing crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> It offers a bribe to the greedy but does nothing for the needy, who- unfortunately for them-are still electorally outnumbered by the greedy. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kennett, several months ago, indulged in humbug and hypocrisy when it became apparent that the Fraser Government had reduced by 50 per cent the amount of funds to the States for public housing in its last three Budgets. He placed a series of advertisements in the newspapers and publicly criticised what the Government's policies were doing to those people needing housing, particularly in the public housing sector. Yet he is on the public record, because he is a candidate in an election, as saying that this housing package is a wonderful step forward. His Government has set out to try to match the subsidy by helping not the needy but those whose income is well above average weekly earnings. The rebate will apply only to the purchasers of houses over the last five years, that is 30 per cent of the 1.6 million citizens who are paying off their housing loans. Consequently, the Opposition is in agreement with the Press articles and with the statements made by those involved in the social welfare area that this housing package does not do anything to solve the basic housing problem that exists in our country. It does not solve the problem of homelessness that affects, increasingly, hundreds of thousands of people in Australia. It does nothing to raise to higher expectations those hundreds of thousands of people who dream of coming into the home ownership area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The point that I wish to raise in particular is that although it is nearly three years since publication of some of the items in the Fishing Industry Research Committee annual report 1979-80 it is important to see what has happened with some of the research jobs that have been done. I particularly urge the fishing industry and the committee which distributes this money to see what result has been obtained from many of the research jobs that have been done. I think there is a tendency now in this age of inquiry and report to believe that the carrying out of an inquiry and the issuing of a report is more important than seeing that something is done about the matter. In relation to many of these items I really doubt that the information that has been put together has been adequately circulated. I wonder whether enough people know about it and whether anything has been done on it. I was going to raise the matter that Senator Peter Rae referred to. I completely support what he said in that regard. I trust that we will get the next report as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to make some constructive observations on the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation annual report which is presented with accompanying statement of the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson). One could be led to believe that the CSIRO had the potential to provide a viable alternative to Mr Jacobi's proposal for an institute of freshwater studies. However, the proposals, as outlined by the Minister, do not comprise a response of a quality and level which would, in fact, be a viable alternative to the Institute of Freshwater Studies Bill which was agreed to by the Senate on 25 February this year and which has not yet been brought forward for debate in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's review and proposals do not address some of the key issues and regrettably dismiss others. The review is disappointing and has all the hallmarks of being hastily prepared and put together to provide at least some indication, or at least hope, that the CSIRO is about to set its house in order on water research. It would appear that the CSIRO approach, or rather its priorities are largely in the field of hydrology. Ecological studies figure hardly at all in the proposals and are scarcely mentioned directly even in its list of major research trends. Little reference is made to the limnology and biology management of freshwater ecosystems. In effect, the whole thrust of the Government's proposal for CSRIO is hydrological rather than ecological. Surely the Minister would appreciate that many of the water quality management problems that we face have a biological and an ecological base. </PARA>
<PARA> Research efforts should be expanded in three priority areas; namely, salinity and other quality aspects, ground water and catchment hydrology. Increased salinity problems, typically in the Murray-Darling system and in Western Australia, require basic information on mechanisms for formation and movement of water soluble salts. The level of additional resources involved requires a progressive build up from the present effort involving expenditure of some $4m to an amount of some $8m over a three-year period. This level of expansion would necessitate additional resources being made available to the Organisation. Co- ordination arrangements need to be improved also with other agencies undertaking water research or having policy responsibilities for water resource matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The real issue which this Government has failed to face up to was well summed up by Mr Jacobi in Saturday evening last when he was the guest speaker at the annual general meeting of the native fish Australian organisation which I also had the privilege of attending. I will quote from part of a speech made there by Mr Jacobi. I think it sums up the need for the Government to set about hastily setting up the Institute of Freshwater Studies which was agreed to by this House , as I said, on 25 February. Mr Jacobi said in a paper tabled on 22 February this year that the Government at least appears to have shown enough courage to grasp the nettle. There was a report on that paper in the Australian the next day. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The paper, prepared by the Department of Science and Technology, sets out comprehensive plans to change the role of the Government in scientific research.</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> It advocates the linking of government scientific research with economic and social issues, and the strengthening of ties between research and the needs of industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Jacobi stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We must recognise the many practical shortcomings in water research and management if we are to correctly diagnose and cure our problems. If existing organisations are incapable of producing the necessary solutions then they must be changed, or new bodies must be created. But a so-called national authority, which is nothing more than an aggregation of representatives from State water departments, simply retains the limited perspective of these State bodies. The best answer is the establishment of the proposed Institute of Freshwater Studies , which cannot be shackled by State policy-makers and which can conduct balanced research into our most complex water problems. It can provide also independent and autonomous leadership, and by creating a body directly responsible to this Parliament we can ensure that water resource problems are given their proper priority and that funds provided by the Commonwealth are spent in the most efficient manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The challenge that faces us in water management was summed up by Professor Sandford Clark when he said 'Somehow we must also address, and display for rational decision, the political, social and environmental alternatives which must be weighed in the balance . . . We can provide only the leadership expected of us if we are adequately informed, and it is the duty of the Federal Parliament to seek out the knowledge required. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Jacobi finished that part of his speech by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, this Government refuses to accept that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>I am concerned about the Press release put out by the Minister on 22 March-this week. He said that the CSIRO was going to have a review of the environmental problems in the one million square kilometre Murray-Darling Basin. I do not have time to quote from the release. It appears to both Mr Jacobi and me that this is a ploy being used by the Government to get itself off the hook by giving CSIRO another job to do which it is not fully equipped to do. It is a ploy the Government is using so that it will not have to bring on Mr Jacobi's Bill, which was passed in this place, and have it debated in the other place. This might bring about a split in its ranks. Many Government members agree with that Bill and the work that an institute of freshwater studies could carry out. I am very disappointed, as will be many other people, that the Government is now calling on the CSIRO to perform this work. Under its charter the CSIRO can be directed by the government of the day as to what it ought to do, not what the Organisation thinks it ought to do. Mr Acting Deputy President, I see that you are looking at the clock. I think it would be wrong of me to continue my remarks in the couple of minutes that I will have available to me later, so I conclude my remarks on that note. </PARA>

<PARA> '(4) That, unless otherwise ordered, the days on which Estimates committees meet be Tuesday 20 April 1982, Thursday 22 April 1982 and Friday 23 April 1982, and Friday 30 April 1982 if required, and that the sittings of the Senate be suspended where required to enable the Committees to meet'. </PARA>
<PARA>As the Leader has said, the arrangements which are contained in the motion which he has moved today are similar to the arrangements which applied last year. Those arrangements were not agreed to without considerable reluctance from this side of the House. We believe the Estimates committees are a normal part of the functioning of the Senate. We believe that where possible Estimates committees should meet on parliamentary sitting days. We have moved a compromise motion here which provides for Estimates committees to meet on one non-sitting day, a Friday, and a further Friday if that is required. It is not often required in the case of the Additional Estimates. We can see no reason for extending the sitting week at all in order to cope with Estimates committees. We believe they should sit on sitting days-Tuesdays and Thursdays, and Wednesdays if necessary. We have always taken that attitude. We persist in taking that attitude now. As I say, we have included two Fridays for compromise purposes. There seems to be no great need this year, with the lack of legislation, for the Government to have to squeeze in extra days outside sitting days. It is for that purpose that I have moved the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Sessional Orders of the Senate of 26 November 1980, relating to the days and hours of meeting, the suspension of sittings and the adjournment of the Senate, be amended to read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Days and hours of meeting: That, unless otherwise ordered, the days and hours of meeting of the Senate shall be Tuesdays at 1.45 p.m., Wednesdays at 2 p .m., and Thursdays at 10 a.m. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Suspension of sittings: That, unless otherwise ordered, the sitting of the Senate, or of a Committee of the Whole, as the case may be, shall be suspended from 6.30 p.m. till 8 p.m. on Wednesdays. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Adjournment of the Senate: That, unless otherwise ordered, at 6.30 p.m. on Tuesdays, 10.30 p.m. on Wednesdays and 7.00 p.m. on Thursdays the President shall put the Question-That the Senate do now adjourn-which Question shall be open to debate; if the Senate be in Committee at that hour, the Chairman shall in like manner put the Question-That he do leave the Chair and report to the Senate; and upon such report being made the President shall forthwith put the Question-That the Senate do now adjourn-which Question shall be open to debate: Provided that if the Senate or the Committee be in Division at the time named, the President or the Chairman shall not put the Question referred to till the result of such Division has been declared; and if the business under discussion shall not have been disposed of at such adjournment it shall appear on the Notice Paper for the next sitting day. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not intend to keep the Senate long. This matter has been discussed for a long time in this place. In fact, when first I was elected in 1974, 15 new senators arrived at that time and after a few months many of us were concerned about the sitting hours. It seemed to us that they could be changed to improve the efficiency and the operations of this House and the operating efficiency of honourable senators themselves. Since then many people have been interested in and have from time to time discussed a possible change in the sitting hours. It has been a bipartisan-and in recent times, I suppose one could call it a tripartisan-discussion. Some who were active in it are no longer members of the Senate. The late Senator John Knight was very interested in this subject and, along with Senator Martin and others, had frequent discussions with us on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that these discussions have gone on long enough and that the time has come to put the matter to the Senate. Last year a poll of senators clearly indicted a desire to reform the sitting hours. My motion has been worked out after a contributrion by many honourable senators on both sides and represents a suggested change in sitting hours within the present practice of this Parliament and this Senate of a three-day sitting week with broadcasts from the Senate on Wednesdays. That is the basic premise from which it was worked out . There are, of course, suggestions-many of which I would be attracted to-for changing that basic pattern of sitting hours. But in fact we are restricted by the present three-day sitting structure and the hours have been worked out to cope with that. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose it would be desirable in some ways to introduce a reform of the sitting hours in both Houses simultaneously but I suggest that this is not on at present and that, if reform is considered desirable, it should and could well start in the Senate or it will not occur at all. I make no suggestions about, nor do I intend to debate at the moment, the distribution of business within the sitting hours I have suggested. It is not beyond the wit of those who organise such arrangements, I believe, to come to a satisfactory agreement about this. I am aware that some rearrangement will have to be made to party and committee activities held outside sitting hours. This, I suggest, is equally not beyond the wit of reasonable men and women in this place to arrange. Of course I am aware of the fact that some consensus of agreement will have to be reached about procedural matters such as quorums and contentious issues being introduced during what may be meal hours. This can and should be done to ensure the proper functioning of this chamber. I do not see any great difficulty in this. I confine my arguments to the sitting hours I have moved to establish and not to the details of business within them. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not one who argues for these changes primarily on health grounds. It seems to me that in the past there has been an idea that the best way to improve the health of honourable senators and honourable members in this place is to adjust the sitting hours. It is certainly a fact that the two evenings which will be available during the week and during which honourable senators can take part in recreational or cultural activities or whatever else they might like to do may in the long run have a spin-off beneficial to their health. I suspect, however, that Senator Harradine and many or most of us will in fact use the time for work , either in committee or as individuals. I argue strongly that such work will, in the absence of bells and the other distractions which occur in this place, be in fact more efficient and more satisfactory for the benefit of everyone inside and outside the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In a conversation with Senator Harradine we suggested all sorts of thing that could be done on the night off. He said that we could go and play the poker machines, but he would do so only if we received an extra parliamentary allowance. I believe that many things could be done. But parliamentarians, being what they are, I suggest, will probably work, although I can assure honourable senators that I will not work every night if these hours are agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA> The hours I propose do not represent a reduction in the total sitting time; it is a re-arrangement of the total sitting time. As I said before, I believe it will make the work of senators more satisfactory and more efficient. The effect of the proposal will be to sit from 1.45 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. on Tuesdays and 10 a. m. to 7 p.m. on Thursdays with the exception of probably the first Tuesday of each session when we will start at the later time as we do now. That needs no extra motion as there is no motion to do that in the sessional orders. On these days the Senate would sit through the relevant meal hours although, in the case of the evening meal, I suggest that most people would wait until the Senate has adjourned to have it, but others may not. Certainly, if we sit through meal hours there will have to be some arrangement whereby contentious issues, quorums and other annoying procedures will not occur. That can surely be arranged between reasonable people. </PARA>
<PARA> On Wednesdays, the Senate will sit from 2 p.m. to 6.30 p.m., which is an extension of the present afternoon session, and from 8 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. We recognise that at the moment the Senate is broadcast on that day. It would be difficult and undesirable to change that broadcast arrangement. I suggest that most people would not want to do so. It seems to me that one of the difficulties in working as a member of parliament is that while the House is sitting-let us face it-most of us are doing other work unless we are directly involved or particularly interested in the debate taking place. It is well known that we organise committee meetings of various types. We see groups and delegations during those hours. We cram into our meal hours other committee meetings, both Senate and party. We come in early in the mornings to work a few hours before the sittings commence. When we try to sit on those committees or carry out other functions during the times of the sitting of the Senate we are continually interrupted. We are frequently interrupted by bells. Someone in my position, in the position of Leader of the Opposition or in a Minister's position is frequently interrupted by things to do with the business and procedures in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> The beauty of these sitting hours, I believe, is that they provide, on two nights a week and on the mornings before the Senate sits, time when there will be clear opportunities for us to do the important business of research and committee work and of seeing delegations. The new hours will also provide an opportunity, on Tuesday night and Thursday night, for members of this Parliament to act like civilised human beings, if they choose, and to go to the movies, see a play, read a book, watch television or something else. I propose these new hours of sittings acknowledging the work of Senator Martin over many years, Senator Knight before he died, Senator Peter Baume and Senator Chaney, I believe , before they became Ministers, and various people on this side of the House including Senator Robertson and Senator Sibraa. I urge the Senate to consider seriously the introduction of hours such as these so that we may even show the way to those ladies and gentlemen on the other side of the Parliament who seem to be more reluctant to change than we do. Then we will eventually have a parliament which will, as a whole, sit for far more sensible and civilised hours . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief on this subject. I raise at the beginning a matter that I think Senator Grimes is unaware of and which is confusing a number of honourable senators at the moment. As Senator Grimes indicated in the course of his speech, there have been quite extensive negotiations between him, Senator Robertson, Senator Sibraa, the Australian Democrats and honourable senators from the Government side. As he said in his speech, the sitting hours seek a re-arrangement and not a reduction of hours. In fact, the motion does entail a reduction of hours. Furthermore, we have been circulated, while Senator Grimes was speaking, with another document that shows certain hours of sitting which will involve a reduction of hours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out to the Senate that Senator Grimes's motion should be slightly amended if it is to result in no reduction of hours. As the motion stands at present, sittings on Wednesday would commence at 2 o'clock and rise at 10.30 p.m . In fact, to have the same number of hours of sitting as we do now, it will be necessary for the Senate to sit at 1.45 p.m. on Wednesdays and not to commence the adjournment debate until 11 p.m. At present we have 21 1/2 hours of sitting time which comprises six hours on Tuesday, six and three quarter hours on Wednesday and eight and three quarter hours on Thursday. The motion as it appears in the Notice Paper and on the circulated document means that we will sit for four and three quarter hours on Tuesday, seven hours on Wednesday and nine hours on Thursday. That would give us a total of 20 3/4 hours sitting time as against the present 21 1/2 hours. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes that I have outlined entail sitting at 1.45 on Wednesday and commencing the adjournment debate at 11 p.m. We would sit 7 3/4 hours on Wednesday, which is the same total of hours as now. Those hours were discussed and finally agreed to as meeting all the basic criteria for sitting hours. I suspect that this document and the document on which Senator Grimes's notice of motion is based are out of date. Certainly, at one stage, a document was circulating containing the hours I have mentioned, but it became out of date in the last couple of days. There was some nipping and tucking. Senator Grimes shakes his head. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, Senator Grimes is easy on it. I reiterate that that would be necessary to give us the same total number of hours. The same total number of hours is a matter of some concern and some priority because, at present, there is a division of priorities in the Senate between Question Time, petitions, General Business, Government Bills, private members' business, matters of public importance and so on. The Government, currently, has access to eight and a half hours out of the total of 21 1/2 hours that we sit. That is not very high. Certain things are virtually fixed in our practice, and they are the non- government things. If the hours were to be cut back at all, Government time would be lost. I think the Government could reasonably feel that it was a little hard done by because Government Business does not take a large proportion of the total time of the Senate in any event. It is a detail that has significance in those terms to establish a principle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to speak briefly on the merits of the motion. Senator Grimes indicated that this matter has arisen on a number of occasions but has rarely been addressed formally certainly in the Senate. Only once during the autumn session last year was it formally addressed when certain ballots were announced and certain speeches were made at the conclusion of the ballot. The situation then was that proposals were being considered outside the chambers which would involve both the Senate and the House of Representatives sitting altered times and sitting, basically, the same times. With the decision that there would not be any radical alteration of hours the House of Representatives made a small adjustment to its hours and the Senate continued with its previous hours. </PARA>
<PARA> Now the Senate seeks to move to a rather different pattern of sittings independently of the House of Representatives. Of course, there is no reason why we should not do that because we are masters of our own destiny. The fact is that we have duties, in this place, which are not just confined to the hours when the Senate is actually sitting. Those duties involve members of the House of Representatives. I name the obvious ones, such as joint parliamentary committees which have been created by both Houses of Parliament, party meetings, caucus meetings and so on which have some significance. Additionally there is a large expenditure on support facilities for members and senators, such as a dining room, a library, certain attendants, Hansard and so on. We have to have some responsibility in our approach to this matter to make sure that any change we make will not dislocate either those joint facilities or joint activities. </PARA>
<PARA> After considerable debate and discussion between individuals and, on some occasions, on behalf of other individuals, these are the hours that it is suggested be put forward to the Senate for its adoption. It is a compromise proposal. It is certainly not ideal. I would have thought the proposal that we considered this time last year outside the chambers was a better proposal over all. However, we are in the position of having to find a workable situation in which the Senate can move to sensible, workable hours without disrupting our other activities in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I make a brief reference to Senator John Knight. I first raised this matter of sitting hours in a government context in the Budget session in 1979. That was a matter that involved only the Government parties. Various individuals raised the issue with me in the early half of 1980. In the Budget session of 1980 I was overseas attending the United Nations as one of our parliamentary observers at the General Assembly. On my return, at the beginning of the autumn session last year, Senator John Knight, who was then the Government Whip, raised with me the issue of sitting hours and asked me whether I would restart the discussion on the subject. He indicated to me that there would be considerable support for starting these discussions again. I was feeling a little cranky at the way in which the matter had been treated on earlier occasions and said that I would engage myself in it only on condition that, firstly, there was public support from Government members and, secondly, that Senator Knight made available to me some of the facilities of his office so that it could be handled. That was on the Thursday night of the first week we sat. A few days later Senator Knight was dead. If there are honourable senators on either side of the chamber or, indeed, members of another chamber who think I became almost manic in my obsession with the subject during the autumn session last year, it had much to do with my own personal emotions at Senator Knight's death and the fact that he was the person who had asked me to initiate it. My own personal conviction is that he might not have met such an untimely death if we had approached our duties in a more sensible way. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Grimes has covered a number of the issues. The basic need is a rational arrangement of our working hours, remembering that the public think the only hours we work are the hours that this chamber is meeting and indeed the hours that we actually sit in this chamber. It is not a matter of our working hours; it is a matter of our public hours here and when the workings of the parliament are on display to the general public. I doubt very much that our priorities are right in relation to the sitting of the chambers. If we choose to sit at night when we have already put in a full day's work, we are tired and we do not have the energy or the attention to bring to our duties in the evening that we ought. If we claim that we are working between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. I want to know whom we think we are kidding. While many senators and members are in here while the chambers are working and while certain individuals are working because they have responsibilities in the chamber, most members and senators are just desperately trying to keep themselves on their feet until they go home. Last year I saw a Press comment on the subject of our sitting hours. It described the arrangement of the number of hours that we sit in any week as most inefficient. The comment was that if we set out to find a more inefficient way of arranging our hours it would be difficult to imagine what we could possibly come up with. </PARA>
<PARA> I support Senator Grimes's motion which I hope will be amended by somebody in line with the suggestions that I have put forward. The hours themselves are not magic. They will not assure all things to all people. In fact, a certain amount of good will and co-operation on both sides will be essential if they are to succeed. The matter of calling quorums and whatever cannot, in any way, be restricted. There are some working arrangements in this chamber which I think need to be looked at and thought about fairly carefully. I know there is much concern in certain areas relating to quorums and the adjournment. If we want these hours to work, they will work. If we do not want them to work, it will be very easy indeed to destroy them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support what has been said by many honourable senators both in this place and outside it and what has been said today by Senator Grimes and Senator Martin. It is my desire to reform the sitting hours, but I cannot believe that the reform of sitting hours proposed will be of any benefit to any honourable senator. I was surprised to hear what Senator Martin had to say at the end of her speech. I think that when she reads the Hansard record she will think that something went wrong in what she was trying to say. I do not think that Senator Martin believes that it is not a matter of what our working hours are but a matter of what the public think our working hours are. When she reads what she has said she might change her mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It really is a question of what our working hours are. It is proposed that we start sitting on Thursdays at 10 a.m. I am the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. That Committee has meetings which commence at 9 a.m. on Thursday mornings. Clearly, I will have to start these meetings at 8.30 a.m. So on a Thursday morning my day, and the day of members of that Committee, will commence at 8.30 a.m. I know that other committees also meet on Thursday mornings. I think the Joint Committee of Public Accounts or the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Public Works meet on that day. Clearly, our working day on Thursdays will start at 8.30 a.m. Honourable senators can say: ' All right but you have Tuesday night'. With respect, Senator Grimes said that, not me. He said: 'We have Tuesday night. I will not be working every Tuesday night. People will be able to go to the movies, see a play, read a book or whatever else they want to do'. I suggest that they will want to dine and dance. With respect, I do not believe that that is what honourable senators come to Canberra for. I believe that we come here to put in--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I sincerely believe what I am saying: The day will be extended and not compressed by these hours. In fact what will happen is that honourable senators who meet on committees which now sit during their lunch hour will have less time for those committees but will still try to fit in that work. There are two points to the suggestion of some honourable senators that committees can sit at night. Firstly, I suggest that many honourable senators will find they are unable to go to those committee meetings because some other thing is being organised, for example, a visit to an embassy. We all get invitations to do that sort of thing. Honourable senators may stay on at the embassy longer. Secondly, we all know that politicians talk too much. At the moment when we have a committee meeting from 6 o'clock to 8 o'clock at least we know the meeting will be over at 8 o'clock. But if we start a meeting at 7 o' clock it may not finish till midnight. That is exactly the sort of thing that concerns honourable senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are major problems associated with our task. The first I would like to mention to honourable senators is the problem of late nights. We sit on here far too late at night. Also we have long brackets of sitting hours. Look at what is proposed for sitting hours on a Thursday. On a Thursday in this chamber we would work-apart from what we had done the night before or the morning before-for nine consecutive hours. It is absolutely beyond me how any honourable senators could suggest that it would be of any benefit to honourable senators to try to cope with nine hours continuous work in this chamber. </PARA>

We have the unbelievable suggestion that we sit through until 11 o'clock on Wednesday night just because it happens to be broadcast day. I suggest the change to our sitting hours should be that the Senate adjourn at 10 o'clock every night-Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday nights. We would sit at 8 o'clock and put in two hours to 10 o'clock. There could be some short-I hope they would be-adjournment addresses from 10 o' clock onwards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats strongly support the motion proposed by Senator Grimes and supported by Senator Martin. I pay a tribute to both Senator Grimes and Senator Martin, and to the many other honourable senators who have worked tirelessly for a long period to try to introduce some form of sanity into our sitting hours. The fact they have kept their patience against the kind of addresses we have just heard adds to the credit that must accrue to them. I think I was one of the senators who put to Senator Martin the matter she mentioned. She said that if the Senate set up a committee to report on the most inefficient, most unhealthy, most wasteful and most expensive sitting times possible it would come up with the kinds of hours we are sitting right now. In my mind there is no question about that. The strain on both body and mind is intolerable. As I understand from Senator Grimes and Senator Martin the motion seeks to do two things: One is to acknowledge the insanity of the hours we are now sitting and the second is to try the new hours as an experiment to see whether they improve things. If they do not and if the worst of Senator Lewis's fears are realised, if we find Senator Missen and Senator Walters whirling around in Juliana's Discotheque at unhealthy hours of the morning, we will say Senator Lewis is right.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With great respect, Senator Walters, we do. For example, if we happen to be at an embassy, meeting important overseas visitors and engaged in important conversations, none of us dares be back here at one minute past eight. That demonstrates the schoolboy treatment to which I object. Some honourable senator might try to be a smart-Alick, call a division and catch the other side- if honourable senators will forgive the well known expression-'with its pants down'. Next day there would be a headline 'Government defeated' and all that rubbish just because a couple of honourable senators happened to be at a meeting . I cite the classic case of those of us who like to see the Australian films presented from time to time by various Ministers. A great number of honourable members and honourable senators see those and so they should. If such a film ends a little late, for example at five minutes to eight, does that mean that if honourable senators are back here a few minutes late and a division is called in the meantime a government can be defeated? The way we live here is absurd. I object strenously to that. I think it adds to the tenson and the unnatural way we treat the institution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What could these reformed sitting hours achieve? Certainly they could achieve a better committee system, notwithstanding the real difficulties Senator Lewis has pointed out. Does any honourable senator really believe that the back bench committee system, let alone the select and standing committee system, is working satisfactorily? I have been on back bench committees for 18 years. Everyone knows the system. For example, we meet at 6 o'clock after having done a hard day 's work. We have a drink, talk for a quarter of an hour, have a meal till quarter to seven, listen to a guest speaker for half an hour and then have 20 minutes to question or cross-examine the witness before the bells start ringing at five to eight. </PARA>

With great respect to Senator Walters, I do not know that the concertinaing of discussions on important matters is the best way to come to decisions on very difficult problems. One of the things that attract us to politics is the fact that very few issues are stark black or stark white. There is a grey area which means that on every subject there is a bit of right and a bit of wrong. The thing that is fascinating about politics is that by talking to people and hearing other people's points of view we can come to a consensus. The kind of atmosphere that prevails here between 6 and 8 o'clock, when we are forced to have our backbench meetings, is not conducive to lack of tension and to reaching consensus, particularly when one pursues the more technical and legal matters, as does Senator Missen. Without being cynical or critical I think the Executive or the Cabinet, whether it be Labor or Liberal, has a vested interest in not changing the hours.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suggest that these hours do not help the immediate problem of the luncheon break but they certainly give an opportunity to meet, without a pressurising ending time, in the evening. Senator Lewis put forward the point that politicians talk too much. Committees will go on too late and we will probably find ourselves sitting beyond 11 o'clock. I think there will be a self- disciplining factor within committees. Senator Lewis has been here long enough to know-unless he is one of the offenders-that politicans, while they do have faults and do talk too much, have an incredibly efficient way of dealing with wafflers. In fact a waffler soon has newspapers rustled in his face and people start walking out of the room. I would not have thought that that is a serious objection.</PARA></TALK.START>

How in the name of goodness can anybody have an in depth conversation with a Russian about Afghanistan? How can one have an in depth conversation with a Russian about Afghanistan anyway? However, at least in a civilised time scale one could conduct-even Senator Lewis with his legal training could conduct-a proper cross-examination of a Russian diplomat about Russia's intentions in Afghanistan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to our relationship with the Public Service and outside groups. How many honourable senators have appointments with important people from, say, industry and commerce? We are all stupid because we say: 'I think three o'clock on Thursday will be a non-busy time. We will have an appointment then.' Honourable senators meet top people from industry, the Public Service or whatever. It just so happens because of the way this place works-it is nobody's fault; it is inevitable-that at three o'clock absolute chaos might descend on the Senate or there might be some sort of crisis. This is happening to me right now. I happen to have had an appointment at three o'clock with some important people from the ethnic community. I have had to keep them waiting for half an hour. That has happened to every honourable member in this place and it will continue to happen to them. I believe it is a ridiculous way in which to conduct our affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> One could mention that the relationship between the Senate and the Press could well be improved if more time were given. Relationships between the Parliament and the Ministry could be improved. Let us look at the kinds of question that we face. I will give one example. We understand that amendments to the industrial relations legislation will be introduced into the House of Representatives some time today. We do not know when-we cannot find out-but they are of a controversial and fundamental nature. Is it not the wish of many honourable senators on both sides of the chamber to talk with employers about what effect they think these sorts of amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act will have? Do members not think it is important to talk to trade unions about what effects this legislation will have? Within the kind of time scale that the present schedule allows, can only honourable senator really say: 'Yes, I have two hours when I can sit down with you and discuss these matters at some length' . Most honourable senators who are on committees, who attend party meetings, who attend standing committees, select committees, and party committees and then have to attend the sittings of the Senate find that it is impossible. </PARA>
<PARA> I concede that to change the sitting hours is a bold step. I congratulate very sincerely those who are associated with it. However, it will need good will for it to work. There are people in the Senate chamber who, no doubt for good reasons, call quorums and divisions. I am not questioning their right to do that or the fact that they do it. I am saying that if we are going to give this system a fair go, the calling of quorums and divisions at times-unless they are absolutely fundamental to an issue-could well be sacrificed to give this system a fair go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief. I congratulate anybody who is going to try to get some improvement out of the sitting times that we have at present. I do not think any of us are satisfied with what we have now. The main problem is the time that we finish at night. A proposition which still allows for an 11 o'clock finish, to me, does not constitute an adequate improvement on what we have. The only people that it would suit to be working at 11 o'clock at night are probably not in the chamber now; probably they are having an afternoon snooze. We will not get anywhere without a little more rationalisation all over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to find a way in which we can achieve what we are after without having to sit through the meal hours. I do not think a continuous sitting is in our best interests as those honourable senators who have commitments in the chamber still have to fit in a meal. If a honourable senator thinks that he or she may be the next speaker in a debate or the speaker after that he or she will be in trouble here or in the cookhouse. The staff members of this place also have to eat and some reasonable arrangements have to be made to suit them. We have to accommodate these other people a little bit more. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a problem with things such as joint committees. Senator Elstob and Senator McIntosh, for instance, could attest to the fact that it would be very difficult to have a Joint Publications Committee meeting when the Senate was sitting and the other House was not. There would have to be a break from the normal routine of the committee meetings. A lot of reorganising would be required to avoid interfering with time slots that have been allocated to other business for some years. I realise that these matters can be attended to but we need to take them into account before we make a firm decision. I agree that we have appointments during the day that are nearly always difficult to keep. I have just had handed to me a piece of paper which states that a gentleman is waiting in my office right now. I have to dash off to see him and that is another reason why I will not be speaking too long.</PARA>
<PARA> As one who has never spoken in the adjournment debate since I came into this Parliament I have grave reservations about whether it is reasonable to put constraints on those people who wish to participate in that debate. I believe it represents one of the freedoms that the ordinary back bench member has in this place. Yet if we do not put constraints on them it will be difficult to organise anything. The number of times we get an opportunity to receive visitors or to have a meal on our own, even in the dining room here, is so limited that reasonable arrangements would have to be made if this proposal were to work. I cannot see that this proposal will change the number of hours of any of us who want to work or have commitments which suggest that we should work. Those who do not want to work all the time now will soon find that they can rearrange their hours and still not work all the time. Those who do work will be putting in at least as many hours as they do now, whether it be in this place or outside the Parliament. They will still be doing the same thing.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the important things that I do when I come to Canberra is to see people from departments, from industry, and various lobby groups, as they are sometimes called, or the various interest groups, as I prefer to call them. I want to be able to see them on much the same basis as now. I think we all do. I think we should not make it difficult for them by saying: 'I can see you but not until 9. 15 p.m. I have a meeting at 7 p.m. When we come out of that meeting at 9.15 I will be able to see you'. I do not think it is reasonable to expect people from the Public Service to come to see us at all sorts of ridiculous hours such as that. I think we have to take these matters into account. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to see some changes. I certainly want to see some improvements. I do not want to see our ranks decimated by people dropping over because they cannot take the pressures of the place. At this juncture I am prepared to give anything a go that may be an improvement. I would like to see this proposal run for a period at the end of which, failing other alternatives, we go back to what we now have. I would like to see a change but the change should be a temporary one so that we still have our present arrangement to fall back on. I would support implementing this proposal for the balance of this session if after that we could revert to the present arrangement or come up with some other improvement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the proposal for new sitting hours which is before us today. I am in agreement with what Senator Archer has just said. Of course, this ought to be only a temporary measure at which we ought to look again. If this proposal is implemented until the end of this session I do not think it will be long enough to judge the effect on the members and their activities. It will not be a long enough time to rearrange the sitting times of committees and do the other things which have to be done. I certainly think before Christmas we should look at this matter again to see how it is working and whether or not it is right for us. The points that were made by Senator Lewis should rightly be considered. If honourable senators intend to speak in the adjournment debate for long hours and thus still keep the Senate sitting late at night I for one will not stay here and keep the House for them. I hope that other honourable senators will not stay here either. We must look at whether people intend to treat the adjournment in that way.</PARA></TALK.START>

Nobody expects people to concentrate, morning, noon and night on the one work in the one building.

We do not visit these friends because it is useless if we have to rush away at 7.45 p.m., to be back in the chamber for the resumption. This Parliament plays no part in the lives of the people who live in Canberra and who represent their countries here. Why should they bother to invite us to any functions when we run away very quickly from such functions? It is important that we endeavour to keep some contact with the ordinary life of the community when we are away from the major cities of Australia. We should at least retain some contact with Canberra and with the people whom we know here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important in terms of the health and welfare of parliamentarians and for efficiency with which we conduct out business to give this proposal a trial. The hours which have been suggested have a reasonable possibility of being quite successful. I think parliamentary committees will work in with these hours quite well. We will not want to take up every night with committee work, but I think we will be able to fit committees in better than we do at the moment. At present we have to attend a mass of committees. I have some 11 parliamentary or party committees that I have to attend at one stage or another. One often finds that one has three committees sitting at one time. Therefore, one makes a random choice and attends a different committee every week. I think we could organise these things better if the Parlament did not sit for these long hours at night. To my mind that is the killer, the thing which has endangered the health of members in this place. Another factor might be the food to which we are subjected in Parliament. Recently I had the food prepared in this Parliament analysed as the meals I have had in this place have been absolutely outrageous. I have taken steps and fortunately the parliamentary cooks are willing to fall into line with my thinking on this subject. We should not be the victims of the meals in this place.

If I ate three meals a day that would be one or two too many. I will not become personal, but for many people's benefit it would be good if we did not have any lunch hours at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, there are a couple of quite serious matters I wish to talk about. First of all, Senator Chipp said that a certain amount of good will will be needed to get this system working. I am one of those who have been very much in favour of a change-not a reduction but a change-in hours for quite a long time. As well as a certain amount of good will, we will need a fairly long trial term for this system. We know that we have perhaps another four sitting weeks till the end of this session. Often during that time the Government will have extra work that it will need to get done. That could lead as all to a wrong conclusion about whether these hours are in fact working because we will have to sit some hours, I think, before the end of the session other than these proposed hours that we will agree to in a short time. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T7">Senator TOWNLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree entirely; it is better than sitting until two or there in the morning. I have always said that that is crazy. I have always been surprised that somebody has not died as a direct result of those crazy hours. When we explain to members of the public at large that most politicans come in here some time between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. and do not usually leave the building until 11 p.m. they reckon we are crazy. It is not only ourselves whom we should consider. No Ministers have spoken about this matter, but if I were a Minister I would look forward to having two nights free a week either to work or to go to a Cabinet meeting. I think some Ministers would agree with me. I have noted that none of the Ministers has complained about this change. It has been quite evident that they, without saying so, want to try it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I bet that when we try these hours it will not be long before the House of Representatives adopts them as well. When that happens it will leave room for a lot of other changes that could eventually make these hours much more sensible for everybody in this building. We must not forget the staff who work here. There are people here who have to work for an hour after we leave and yet they have to be back before any of us get here the next morning. There are those associated with the printing of parliamentary papers. A lot of us, unfortunately , take too much for granted. We should be thinking of them. It is not only the individual senators' hours we are talking about; it is the staff hours as well. Admittedly some staff will be a bit annoyed that they will not get as much overtime as they might, but I do not think that is the important thing. Their health is more important, in my mind, than the amount of money that they might get from overtime. The matter is of such importance that we were recently sent a booklet discussing how dangerous the parliamentary lifestyle is. We were also sent a booklet containing helpful hints on healthy living. Whoever wrote this booklet must have written it for politicans because just about everything we do is wrong, according to that book. </PARA>

They will lead to Cabinet being uninterrupted and committees having better areas than they have now. It will help the health of everybody, particularly if they get out of this building. I do not think, as Senator Lewis did, that getting out of this building is a bad thing. He seemed to say it was a crime to go out and have a meal at night. I do not think it is a crime.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the proposals put forward by Senator Grimes which I understand have some consensus approach to what I consider to be the effective working of the Senate. I think they will enable us to have a much more civilised day of activity and will improve not only the health of members of the Senate but also the efficiency of the Senate. I do not believe that when we decided to become members of parliament we also decided to enter an endurance test, and that is what it is. I do not think anybody in this country expects us to cram into three days more than a 40 hour week, and that is what we do. Nobody expects us, in addition to that, to go back and perform our normal duties. Any change, in my view, is beneficial. The sort of change recommended is considerably more than beneficial because I believe the work of the Senate will be considerably improved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not the first time we have made endeavours to change the sitting hours. We have always had some resistance to change. I can remember the period when former Senator Murphy was the Leader of the Government in this place. He introduced for a short period a 6.30 break on Tuesday and Thursday nights, and it was very popular. I remember the Western Australians were very happy to be able to catch a plane back on a Thursday night, but things changed. We somehow got back into the bad old ways and we did not profit. I recall that Senator Martin attempted to put into effect some proposals which would have improved the working conditions of the Senate. I think we have to consider also the working conditions not only of the Senate but also of the journalists who have to put up with our speaking for these long periods. I hope that they will be very interested in the proposals which will keep us within the same number of hours but will enable us to work in a much more rational way. </PARA>
<PARA> I am certainly attracted to any proposition that enables us to find out a little about what happens outside this place. We do not even know sometimes whether it is raining outside because we are in here from 9 a.m. and it is 11 o' clock at night before we go out to enjoy a bit of fresh air. It must surely be recognised that we work during our lunch hours and evening meal periods in the committees of the various parties to which we belong. We do not have the opportunity to get any fresh air, least of all any fresh ideas. I think we all could put up with a few more of those. </PARA>
<PARA> The House of Representatives has already taken a tentative step-the sort of step suggested in the amendment proposed by Senator Lewis. It is not good enough . We have the absurd situation at the moment where, because the House of Representatives meets earlier than the Senate, the party committee meetings start at a quarter to one. We may be sitting in the chamber because we are dealing with Bills. The work of the party committees has begun by the time we get to the meetings. We are ready to keep the battle going and the House of Representatives members are leaving because the House of Representatives begins its sittings earlier. In many ways we are acting as though we live in two different countries instead of working in unison. I agree with the last couple of Government speakers who have indicated that when we take this step we will probably prod the House of Representatives to shift away from the tentative step it has taken to move to a much more realistic set of working hours. </PARA>
<PARA> I am attracted to the idea for a number of reasons. Firstly, we will have an opportunity to know a little about Canberra. Senator Reid, as a Canberra representative, will be happy about that, I am sure. We come to Canberra on Monday nights and leave on Friday mornings. We never get a chance to look at the wonderful city of Canberra. The proposed new sittings hours would give us an opportunity to taste even the Canberra points of view as well as its food which, in this place, has deteriorated alarmingly in recent times. The new sitting hours would give us an opportunity to get to know some of the public interest groups that operate in Canberra. I am attracted to the proposition that Senator Chipp raised. Therefore, I disagree with the point that Senator Missen made. </PARA>
<PARA> I find one thing strange about the Canberra scene. I learned a great deal in local government about the capacity to mix with, socialise with and learn from its full time officers. I was able to be influenced by them and learn from their expertise about town planning, health matters and public administration. We have no access to that sort of experience in Canberra. If we are able to get a public servant to talk at a committee meeting we usually find that by the time we have had a quick lunch and asked a couple of questions the bells are ringing and we have to get back to the chamber. It is a most unsatisfactory way in which to conduct a meaningful dialogue with people who, it has to be recognised, are experts in their particular fields. That is not to say that we have to adopt their ideas but at least they could inform us about matters on which we might want some information. We would then be able to make a much more reasoned and balanced judgment about the matters we had discussed with the Public Service. That opportunity is denied to us at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not sure that the situation will necessarily be easier under the new sitting hours but at least we would have a chance to socialise with public servants if we wanted to do so. We cannot do so at the moment. I know all the prescriptions about the Crimes Act and so on but I would dearly love to get among public servants to find out a little more about how the bureaucracy ticks. It would contribute to the more effective functioning of the Parliament if we had that opportunity. I think any change at all, even Senator Lewis's proposal, would be better than the existing arrangements but I am for taking the more far- reaching step that was suggested by Senator Grimes, which appears to have quite a lot of support in the place. If the Senate agrees with it, it will show again that it is capable of making decisions which will be of some benefit to the Senate and, ultimately, to the House of Representatives. </PARA>

I understand that that is a most important part of the process of government, particularly if members of parliament are interested in foreign affairs. But I think everybody has forgotten that social activities also take place at lunchtime. I will give honourable senators an example. I was invited to a lunch today held by the Pulp and Paper Workers Federation of Australia. I arrived at ten past one and left at five to two. That is not a very long time. I was able to listen to the major speech. I was not able to listen to any other speech. Under the proposed new sitting hours all lunch hours would be ruled out.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My comments will be brief. I hope to touch on at least one ground that has not been mentioned yet. Before I do so I would like to get away from these false ideas that have been created in some people's minds that we will have incessant filibusters during the adjournment debate. I have used, and always will use, the adjournment debate as-Reg Wright, who was not known as a leftist senator, used these words-a forum for injustice. Speeches in the adjournment debate should be short 10 or, at the most, 15 minute rapid fire commentaries. Most honourable senators are involved in such speeches.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On rare occasions, probably when the timetable has gone haywire, there has been a conflict of views and perhaps four or five senators have spoken. Senator Keeffe would know that sometimes in debates on some trade union matters we would have four Democratic Labor Party senators speaking. We would have to mark them, independent of what Government senators might have said. Those were exceptional times when the adjournment debate went much longer than was intended. My main reason for intervening in this debate is to ask: What will happen when we finish on a Thursday? Most of us, as senators, find that we are occupied in our States or interstate at seminars and ethnic community conferences and the like where we learn a considerable amount. The thing that attracts me to the proposal is that if an honourable senator clocks off at half past seven or 8 o'clock at night and flies out on Friday at 7 a.m. or even at 9 a.m. he or she has had an extra couple of hours to charge his or her batteries. Certainly, honourable senators will not be put in the pastures during the next 48 hours. On the contrary, honourable senators will fire better on a Friday night, a Saturday and a Sunday. I know that my colleague, Arthur Gietzelt, who is smiling, agrees with me. With our responsibilities in the Australian Labour Party we could have to go to a State executive or a national executive meeting, a State or a national conference. Our fluency can suffer if we have a very late night in the Senate on a Thursday. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt also referred to fraternising with people. I have related to the Senate oppressions in the Latin American community following the spending of all day at a Uruguayan congress. One can learn more from those congresses about the lower wage people in Australia than from a printed document. I know that Senator Chipp advanced the idea that this proposal would not be 100 per cent successful. If honourable senators get a couple of extra hours in bed on Thursday night they will find that when they go out to cover their responsibilities away from the Parliament they will be more effective instruments in the next two or three days. I make only one postscript; it is particularly for Senator Peter Baume's ears: Even when one does go out in such circumstances plenty of salt on one's steak does not effect one's efficiency. </PARA>

I hope that he has because we should not be one-sided in this debate. I have always endeavoured during my lifetime to stand up for the rights of workers . Whilst I would be quite happy to agree with the proposal put forward concerning Tuesdays and Wednesdays, I have some misgivings about supporting the proposal for Thursday. If we agree to it, particularly members of the Australian Labor Party, we will say that people do not need a lunch break. That is what it means. We will sit here from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. with no lunch break. I want to know whether there will be a roster system involved for all of the staff who service this place and what will be the situation in the dining room. Senator Walters did mention these matters. In particular, I want to know what will happen to the dining room staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is almost certain that the hours in the other place will not coincide with the hours in this place. We will be faced with having to employ extra dining room staff. I would have no complaint about that, considering the high degree of unemployment, but what I am concerned about is whether we will ask the people in the dining room and the kitchen to work longer hours. Goodness me, they work long enough hours now. The same situation applies with regard to the transport officers. Will we still expect those transport officers to be here until midnight or one o'clock in the morning because those laggards who hang about the place want cars? I might say that they are not working; they are doing other things. Some consideration should be given to that. I noted that Senator Chipp mentioned the calling of quorums and divisions. He said that some unthinking people took a great delight in calling quorums and divisions and that people might get caught with their trousers down. Senator Chipp was not a member of this place when one of our senators-</PARA>

The person concerned was Senator Georges. Some years ago we did not have the red and green flashing lights in the toilets. If one happened to get caught in there, as Senator Georges did, one had to run out and have a look at the lights which were over the main door. Because Senator Georges got caught with his pants down we now have the little red and green lights in each cubicle. So one does not get caught in there. That is on the record. It is in Hansard.

The other matter to which I refer-this has been raised by several other speakers-is the fact that the adjournment debate is to commence at 6.30 p.m. on Tuesdays and 7 p.m. on Thursdays. There is another proposition floating around this place to alter the Standing Orders so that senators would be limited to 15 minutes, I think, in which to speak at the first reading stages of Bills and, say, 10 minutes on the adjournment. This will attract more people to speak on the adjournment. If one cannot get a question answered at Question Time-it might relate to an important matter but one cannot get the call because of the long-winded answers of the Liberal Government Ministers-one has to raise the matter on the adjournment. My colleague Senator Mulvihill has had to use this device and I have used it too. What a great opportunity there will be on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The Press will still be here. The newspapers will not have gone to bed. You are asking for people to speak on the adjournment. As I said by way of interjection, I will be quite happy to do just that.</PARA></TALK.START>

Of course, we will reserve that right. Is it proposed that the Standing Orders be added to so that the rights of members are restricted? Are we to have only 10 minutes or 15 minutes in which to speak at the first reading stage of a Bill? Goodness knows, we are restricted enough now because we are allowed to speak to first readings of Bills only on Thursdays. It may be that a matter which a senator wants to raise has become stale news. We are now deprived of speaking immediately to the first reading of a Bill when it comes in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If there are the numbers in this place to carry this motion, what are these hours going to mean? If you have the numbers you can do anything. If the Liberal Party is in government and it has a jam of business, the Leader of the Government-if it is still Senator Carrick-will stand up and move a motion that Government Business take precedence over General Business and away we go. We can go until 3 o'clock in the morning. I have just had a look at a notice of motion which I placed on the Notice Paper on 10 June last year complaining about Senator Carrick keeping us here until 3 o'clock in the morning debating Government Business. Nobody wants to be fooled that that will not take place. No matter who is in government-whether it be my party or the people who are now in government-if the Government has business to deal with, and if it has the numbers, what will it do?

I have in mind the people who have to travel from Western Australia every week to this place in order to sit here for three days. If we could program the sitting of this Parliament so that we have a four or even a five-day week, such as the normal work force has to work-eight hours a day-it would be much more sensible. I work seven days a week in my job. That is why I have no time like the people to whom Senator Walters was referring. Senator Martyr replied that he liked to play tennis.

In conclusion I make the point that not enough discussion has gone into this proposal which is before us at present. It was amended on the floor of the House. My colleague Senator Grimes, who moved it, had to stand up and seek permission to make an amendment to it while it was under debate and then Senator Lewis came in with another amendment to be considered. That proves to me that there has not been enough discussion. There might have been discussion among a few members of parliament by way of sending out a questionnaire, but I am yet to be convinced that any discussion took place with all of the other important people in this Parliament. Sometimes politicians run away with the impression that they are the most important people in the country. If one went out and talked to the general public one would find that, next to football umpires, politicians would be the least important and the least popular people. We do not want to get the idea into our heads that we are the be all and end all of everything. The place could not function without the ordinary work force which does all the chores about the place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said earlier, I am not prepared, as a good trade unionist, to give away that lunch hour on any day of the week. Whatever we decide in here, unless the Standing Orders are amended there is no way that people will be prevented from calling quorums or divisions. I well remember what happened in 1972 and 1975. Members of the National Country Party and the Liberal Party really brought the calling of quorums to a peak when we were in government. We could not interview people who came here. I think that two of our Ministers had heart attacks from rushing to and fro because of quorums and so on. Members of the National Country Party and the Liberal Party set the stage and we would like to follow it. I endeavour to follow it sometimes but I have had the finger put on me by some of my colleagues. But, of course, that may change. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I claim to have been misrepresented. Senator McLaren laid heavy emphasis on the subject of staff. Whilst Senator Walters asked a series of questions which could have been answered-it is a pity they were not asked earlier-Senator McLaren made a series of allegations in relation to the consideration of staffing. The facts are not as stated by Senator McLaren. A great deal of work has gone into the subject of staffing. Those of use who have been working on it have been aware of and have paid scrupulous attention to the effect that any proposal would have on Hansard staff , the dining room, the Department of the Senate and other staff here. I cannot answer all the questions that Senator McLaren asked, but that does not justify his making the allegations that we do not care about that matter or have not thought about it. The simple fact is that arrangements will have to be made with people such as the transport officers, if this motion is passed, to define some reasonable sort of modus operandi for them. I do not believe Senator McLaren's allegations are in any way well justified. If people go into this reasonably, it will be solved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been informed-because it has been researched-that there will be a small difference to the Hansard staff by virtue of the fact that we will be sitting through a lunch hour, but that is a very small difference. I am given to understand that in fact they welcome these new sittings hours in terms of making their life a bit more bearable. There will be a small difference in the dining room. Had Senator McLaren stopped and thought before he spoke he would have been aware that at present the House of Representatives sits at 1.45 on Tuesdays and Wednesdays as proposed in the sitting hours that we have been debating. Had he taken the trouble to find out for himself rather than making allegations, he would have been aware that, as a consequence of that change of hours in the House of Represenatives, services in the dining room are now available at lunch time from 12.30 in any event. The time has been extended there. I suggest to you , Mr President, because you will be the person who will bear at least half the responsibility for this, that the evening meal situation would in my opinion require an adjustment of about 15 minutes. But the dining room staff has been consulted on a number of occasions, as have other staffs. </PARA>
<PARA> Most importantly, as you would be aware, Mr President, throughout there has been close consultation with you and you have sought and given information and advice on the effect of any change of sitting hours on the staff for which you, not I, are responsible. Those details have been attended to. In all the time that this discussion has been going on-three years-only one employee in this building has raised with me any objection to the earlier hours, and that involved losing some overtime. I do not think we are required to sit here so that people can earn high levels of overtime. All other members of staff, most of whom have initiated conversations with me, have indicated how very strongly they want a change. Finally, on the matter of costing, I understand that there is a potential in the Department of the Senate for saving considerable money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it remarkable that today Senator McLaren is being intimidated by the Australian Labor Party. If he has been intimidated before today, his intimidation will be a great deal worse if these sitting hours come into effect. Senator McLaren can look forward to his colleagues getting at him about the adjournment and about the calling of quorums . I wish to address myself particularly to the proposed lunch time sitting hours , particularly on a Thursday but also with respect to the other two days. I concede that there is in my argument a fair amount of personal interest in terms of my life as a senator for the Australian Capital Territory. I think it will apply to a number of other senators as well in that there are held between 12.30 and 2 o'clock a number of functions and conferences which, if we can attend at those times, we can get something out of. The sitting hours that are proposed in this motion virtually eliminate the possibility of taking part in the life of the national capital at lunch time. That is a pity in the sense that that is the time when one may well meet public servants and other people at functions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under this proposal, as I understand it, we will be expecting public servants to float around here at 9 o'clock at night to talk to us-I think that is asking a lot more of them-not to mention the hours that we would be asking Senate staff to work to man committees. I express my very strong regret that the matter is being treated in such a way as virtually to eliminate the possibility of taking part in anything that goes on in the Territory at lunch time on sitting days. As to Thursdays, I think it is absolutely disgraceful for the Senate to embark upon the course of sitting through lunch time. I have no doubt that someone will say that the Parliament of Westminster does so. I am not the least bit interested in that. I am concerned about this Parliament and about the national capital of this country. I think that to tell the world that the Parliament sits through lunch time and that it does not really matter whether members are present there is a disgrace. </PARA>

The Parliament and the Senate should sit on four days a week with the hours spread more reasonably or we should sit for more weeks. From the way honourable senators have been talking, one would think that they were talking about 52 weeks a year. That is not the case. We are talking of a very few weeks in a year. The solution to the problem is to sit for more weeks and to spread the hours more reasonably.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will deal with a number of other matters. I am totally at a loss to understand the reasoning behind Senator Chipp's argument concerning lunch time. Of course, I realise that he has been around this place for a great deal longer than I have and that he perhaps understands some of it better. But I do not see any possibility of improving social life significantly. Senator Mulvihill might get to bed a bit earlier on a Thursday, but he is about the only one in this chamber I can see who would be getting to bed earlier because the others are talking about films, television, Senate committees and a whole range of other activities. I do not think this has anything to do with the time one gets to bed . Certainly the present hours should end. The Parliament should rise at 10 o' clock and should not go on beyond that, in my opinion, on the nights that it sits. But I think that the proposed sitting hours will do nothing to enhance the Parliament in the eyes of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I express the strongest personal regret at the possibility of having eliminated all opportunity to take part in lunch time activities, not to mention functions after work at 5.30 or 6 which, if we rose at 6 o'clock, we could attend so that we could talk to a number of people between 6 and 8. Senator Chipp obviously is invited to all the embassies but has obviously had some fairly bad experiences. He has indigestible food thrust into his left hand. I have never had indigestible food at an embassy; I have always enjoyed it. I concede that there are some fairly crowded cocktail functions between 6 and 8 at an embassy, but there are a number of other places, such as the Housing Industry Association and the Real Estate Institute, where one can meet and talk to groups of people between 6 and 8. If honourable senators suggest that they will have to perform after 9 o'clock-this would occur if Senator McLaren and Senator Mulvihill speak in the adjournment debate-I do not think we will be improving anything at all. I think we are significantly weaking the standard of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief in what is a most entertaining debate. I want to make a few comments. I support the commendable motion which has been moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Senator Grimes) which gives us some attempt to better utilise the time which we spend in Canberra. It is quite clear that this proposition is not all that could be done. We recall the four-day sitting week that we tried; we recall what former Senator Murphy did when he was here; and we recall that attempts have been made to make better use of our time. I am not foreshadowing any of those. Let us look at this proposition. I will not repeat all the arguments in favour of it. I say simply that I agree with most of the things that have been said. I want to comment on a couple of the arguments that have been made by speakers. When Senator Grimes replies he will provide answers to questions raised by various speakers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am very pleased to see that Senator McLaren supports two-thirds of our proposition. This is excellent. I thought that he was totally opposed to the whole thing. So the debate has brought us a little further around than we were before. Senator Lewis suggested, virtually, an inflexibility. He seemed to suggest that, because committees now meet at a certain time, they must meet at that time in future. This is not so. We are not tied to the present arrangements . We are not tied to having a meeting of a committee at 9 o'clock in the morning . It is possible to meet at half past eight or it is possible to meet at night. We do not have to fit in with the present committee arrangements. But I think the most telling point was when Senator Lewis suggested that we will sit locked in the chamber on Thursdays from 10 o'clock in the morning until some time at night. That is a load of rubbish. Most senators sit in this place for about an hour and a half a day beyond Question Time. Honourable senators do not come in and sit throughout the whole day. It is quite easy to organise one's time so that one can make one's contribution. Most of us get to work at 8.30 a.m. and we are here until 11.30 or 12 o'clock at night. This is the very thing that we are complaining about. Because we have to sit late at night there is no way to modify our program. There is no flexibility because of the present hours. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a suggestion that the adjournment debate will be a danger. Senator Mulvihill mentioned this, I think. I believe that the novelty will wear off. Without any doubt there will be a rush of prima donnas who will want to grab the air at 6.30 and speak while they think the Australian Broadcasting Commission is broadcasting. There is no doubt about this; we know it. But let us face it, this novelty will wear off. Senator McLaren rightly made the point that if something needs to be said or if there ought to be a matter raised in the adjournment debate it ought to be done whether it is 6.30, 11 o'clock or 12 o' clock. Certainly, that debate will get a lot more coverage and attention if it is broadcast at 6.30 or 7 o'clock at night. Let us face it; we are here to represent people. We are trying to find the most effective way to do it so that we stay healthy and also make a greater contribution. The last point I make to Senator Lewis is that if there are problems, and he has some, let us try the system. We can always change it later; we are not bound to it. If it does not work we have the opportunity to look at it again. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters' main complaint seemed to be that she was not allowed out of the building and likened the chamber to some sort of school. I suggest to Senator Walters that, if she does need to leave the building-I cannot see why she should need to-then the normal arrangement of getting a pair exists. If she cannot play tennis at 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock then she can do what my colleague , Senator Sibraa, does and play tennis at 7 o'clock in the morning. That is the sort of flexibility she has. She is worried about lunch on the one day a week where there is an imposition on our lunch time. She seems to think that every Thursday she is going to be torn screaming from the dining room because something is going to happen. She is worried about not being able to attend functions on Thursdays. I make those points because I think she has raised what seem to be bogies. We will answer them as we go on. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLaren and others raised a matter relating to costing. I have been provided with information which has been partly given already by Senator Martin. There will be no changes to the cost of running Hansard; the Senate staff will actually experience savings; and there will virtually be no change in the dining room. Costing will be about the same. I make the point that those of us who were involved in coming forward with some recommendations certainly did not, blindly, one night, make up a list of figures and throw them to honourable senators. Consideration has been given to all aspects. I think it is grossly unfair to suggest that the people who have considered this proposition over a period of 12 or 18 months have disregarded every other aspect. </PARA>
<PARA> Some personnel who work here, apart from ourselves, will also be able to get home at night. Surely that is the sort of thing that they want. I make the point quite clearly so that there is no contradiction that, if it is said that the attendants will lose money because there is no overtime and that attendants need the extra money, that is contrary to union principle. The attendants ought to be paid enough for the normal time that they serve in this place without having to look for additional payment. If, as has been said, they need additional money then, with respect, Mr President, that is a matter which you and your officers will no doubt look into. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Archer said that the joint meetings will be a problem. Perhaps they will be. I believe that we can organise that. It is not beyond the wit of the groups to get together and organise joint meetings. Senator Archer also made the criticism that we have not thought about various aspects of the proposition. I assure him, as Senator Martin and others have done, that the dining room staff, the attendants, the drivers, the ABC employees, Hansard and others involved were considered. Perhaps I will be regarded as one of those people whom Senator McLaren mentioned who think politicians are important. I do not think that at all. But I do think that this House operates for the senators who sit in it and for work which they have to do. I believe that the services that come to us from the Library, the dining room and other areas are provided to the people who are here to do a certain job. I think we ought to keep that in mind. Surely it would be ludicrous to say that we had better meet between the hours of X and Y because that is when the gardeners want us to meet or that is when it is convenient for the dining room staff. I am not making the point that we should disregard those people; we have not done so. But I make the point that the chamber is for the senators, and we ought to organise the service arrangements for the senators to suit them. </PARA>
<PARA> Public servants, of course, are already here at odd hours. I thought it was strange that they should be mentioned. They come here at all hours of the day or night; there will be no change to that. I have seen them here at 12 o'clock at night waiting in the corridors for us to adjourn so that Estimates committee meetings can be held. Senator Archer finished on a good point when he said: 'Let us have temporary changes'. That is all we are asking for. I could not agree more. Let us try these hours. If they work we will keep them; if they do not we will throw them away. I will comment briefly on a couple of matters raised by Senator Reid. Firstly, she said that the Goverment was intimidated by the Australian Labor Party. I think that is fantastic. It is a lovely thought. What a pity it is not so. The harsh reality of the situation is--</PARA>

If she lived seven hours away by air as I do and could get home if she were lucky for weekends she would have nothing to complain about. We meet for 60-odd days a year. If she cannot adjust all of the things that she wants to do in her electorate-I commend her for doing them-I think she will experience difficulty. We are here for the work of the Senate and not to attend social functions or any other functions outside of this place. Senator Reid raised the matter of a four- day sitting week. I could not agree with her more. I think that is an excellent idea. She said: 'Let us sit for more weeks'. I could not agree more. I think that is a wonderful idea. But she can see the trouble we are having now trying to change a few hours. What chance would we get of sitting extra days or extra weeks?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I find the hours and the days we sit in this place absolutely absurd. I am astonished at the ossification in attitudes manifested by honourable senators which quite transcends party lines. Somehow or other we seem to enshrine ritual without any respect for what we are trying to do. I could not imagine a worse system than that under which we operate at present. I regard the proposals before us today as the first step on a rather long path back to sanity and some efficient processes of doing our business. What we have done here has just mindlessly perpetuated a mediaeval system of operation. I say that with care. We have a mediaeval system which, in relation to the Budget session and the autumn session, relates to getting in the harvest and the climatic conditions of Europe 500 or 600 years ago. The times of day we sit are related to those gentlemen in the city of London who, after they had a good dinner, would toddle off and, in a part time way, deal with the affairs of what was at the time a small nation. The business of a great and developing nation cannot be run on the principles and practices of 500 years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A most important point in this respect is that good management practices do not necessarily guarantee good results. But as sure as God made little apples, bad management practices make the attainment of good results very difficult, if not impossible, to obtain. These bad management practices that we follow have a major effect on our efficiency. Who can deal with great matters of State at 2 o' clock, 3 o'clock or even 4 o'clock in the morning as most of us in the chamber have tried to do over the years? It is absolutely silly to continue a practice like that. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not labour the health effects. I do not think being in politics is a stress free existence, whether one is in opposition or in government, or whether one is in the Ministry or on the back bench. To add unnecessary traumas and stresses to the pattern of life that we have again is inexcusable. I do not see why we cannot work in daylight hours in the way that every other human being wants to and does. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator can make his speech later. The chamber is his when I have finished. I do not see why we cannot work the daylight hours that other human beings work. I do not see why we cannot work a four or five day week. The organisation of this Parliament turns on the convenience of those honourable senators and members-they are in the majority-who come from Sydney and Melbourne and, to a lesser degree, those who come from Canberra. Those of us who come from Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania find that we have to spend most of Monday and Friday travelling from and to our electorates. In a three day sitting week, we effectively end up losing five days in the process. That situation does not apply at all to the people who go to Sydney. Canberra is only 20 minutes flying time away from the Sydney airport. They can do a full day's work on a Friday or a Monday. The current sitting hours present no inconvenience to them at all. They get two full days in their electorate doing the essential business of a member, which is denied us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have every sympathy for Senator Robertson, who spoke previously, about the difficulties he faces in going to Darwin. He has a great difficulty compared with someone who lives in Sydney or Melbourne. Furthermore, those of us who represent the big States have to travel. We cannot do our business from Pitt Street or from the centre of the city; we have to travel very great distances and that inevitably involves time. I support this motion. I think it is the first step we have made towards looking at an intelligent assessment of the way in which we are working. I hope we go much further down this track in the near future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add, very briefly, to the debate. It has shown that there are probably as many opinions about sitting hours as there are members of this chamber. I do not wish to oppose the proposal for the changed sitting hours. Being what might be regarded as on the radical wing of the apathetic mass, I am prepared at least to give it a try, although I think it is something that I would not have bothered to spend any time on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am amazed that I find myself actually contributing to the debate. My concern is that, if the proposal is taken up on a trial basis, part of the trial will be as to how effective the committee system can be. I regard the committee system as an important part of the party processes, an important aspect of the democracy within the parties and an important aspect of the parliamentary operation. It is my fear that the new sitting times will adversely affect the times available and the availability of honourable senators for both the party committee meetings and the parliamentary committee meetings. I hope that I will be shown to be wrong. Time will tell. I hope that it will be very carefully borne in mind that, if the price that we are to pay for the changed sitting hours is the destruction of the committee system, it will have been a pyrrhic victory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree that the current sitting hours represent the worst possible combination of hours other than the ones that have been proposed. I feel that the proposed hours do not really have regard to two matters: Firstly, the expressive function of parliamentarians-that is to say, their parliamentary responsibilities which have just been adverted to by Senator Peter Rae-and, secondly, the constituent responsibilities of individual senators even when they are in Canberra. Enough evidence has been adduced to support the proposition that , in fact, the proposed hours will interfere with the expressive functions of members of parliament as envisaged not only within this chamber but also within the committee systems of the Parliament and the committee systems of the various parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all, we have a built-in situation in which on Thursdays members of parliament must absent themselves from the chamber. Of course, we all need to do that at present. This is not allowed for in the current hours. On a Thursday it is proposed that we sit from 10 a.m. until 7 p.m. Built into the proposed hours is the suggestion that members of parliament must absent themselves for eating purposes. That might be okay for members of political parties who have their Whips to say what is coming up and what arguments are likely to be put for and against and who have determined policies on those issues. This is not a satisfactory situation for an individual senator. Important matters may come up before this Parliament on a Thursday during the lunch break when the dining room is open, from 12.30 p.m. to 2 p.m. If I did not have an individual policy on them, I would have to sit here for all of that time and listen to the debate. That is part of my expressive function. People might say: 'That is bad luck. You are not in a political party'. I feel that I have as much right as anybody else to express my opinion as to what form the hours should take. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me hasten to say to the proponents of this proposition that I do not intend and would not use the forms of the House to disrupt these proposals; in other words, to call quorums while honourable senators were out having lunch and I was sitting here. I certainly will not be doing that. It is not my intention to speak in the adjournment debates, although it will be a very attractive proposition when they commence at 6.30 p.m. on Tuesdays and 7 p.m. on Thursdays for an individual member of parliament who might want to get something off his chest and into the Press. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point concerning the expressive function of members of parliament was dealt with by a number of honourable senators including the last speaker, Senator Rae. Built into the proposal is a feature that means there can be no joint meetings of parliamentary committees because on the two nights we will be twiddling our thumbs in Canberra, from 6.30 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. on Tuesdays and 7 .30 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. on Thursdays, members of the House of Representatives will not be available to join in those committee meetings. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was just about to say that. On the two nights honourable senators are free, members of the House of Representatives are not free. If, for example, honourable senators need to speak to public servants it would be a matter of bringing the public servants here in their free time when I think they should be getting their well-deserved rest. If there was a matter that an honourable senator wanted to speak about in respect, for example, his electorate and he wanted to get one or two of the House of Representatives members involved in that discussion, it could well be difficult to achieve that. As the situation is at the moment we can do that during the lunch break. I believe that the proposal will inhibit the expressive functions of members of Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point relates to the constituent responsibilities of members of parliament. As all honourable senators know, at present we do not shed our constituent responsibilities just because we come to Canberra. We all spend a great deal of time on the telephone speaking from Canberra. However, the proposal will mean the use of certain free time presently available during the day. It will be put into the evenings, which will then limit the opportunity that members of parliament have to contact departments and constituents back in the home State. I believe the proposal interferes with other responsibilities of honourable senators. It would be fair enough if, for example, the sitting time on Thursday were brought back so that we could catch a plane home and have the whole of Friday in our constituencies. That might make some sense. To have the adjournment at seven o'clock on Thursday means that there is absolutely no hope of any of us-as I think Senator MacGibbon said-from outlying States getting home that night, no hope whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it would be worth a try to give the hours that are currently observed by the House of Representatives a go. Let us not forget that this proposal emerged from the general dissatisfaction expressed by honourable senators as to the lateness of the hours we have kept time and again. Am I correct in saying that? I think I am. Under those circumstances let us for a start bring back by at least half an hour, or an hour, the times we sit at night. We could make up for that at another time. For example, we could start at 1.45 on Tuesday instead of 2.30 and 1.45 on Wednesday instead of 2.15. We would already have made up the time, particularly if we started at 10 o'clock on Thursday morning. I have not calculated the exact saving but I think it makes up for the time lost. We could then knock off at 10 o'clock and overcome the principal objection that we all have to the current sitting hours, that is, that they keep us here too late at night. I assure those proponents of the motion that if it is carried I will attempt to co-operate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks on the sitting hours of the Senate will be very brief indeed. I have had misgivings about whether this proposal will work. Having listened to the debate I still have those misgivings but I am certain that we have to give it a trial period. Therefore, it is my intention to vote for the motion proposed. In the time I have been in this chamber we have had a number of trials. When I first came here about 20 years ago the hours we were working were the same as the hours we are working now but the pressure of business was nowhere near as heavy then as it is now. For instance, I well recall that when I first came here every honourable senator who received an answer to a question on notice had the right to ask that question on notice in the chamber and have the answer prepared by public servants and given to the Minister read by the Minister. That invariably took up one or two hours each day. As time went on pressure caught up and that system had to be changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Reid suggested that we have a four-day sitting week. I well recall that at one stage-I think in the early days of the Labor government-we had a four day sitting week with two weeks on and two weeks off. We sat on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and came back on Sunday night and sat Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Of course, that suited some honourable senators and did not suit others. It tended to suit those who lived far away because they had two weeks off but it did not suit those who came from Sydney or Melbourne. So that system was changed. I remember that we then had a period when we sat through our meal breaks. A sort of agreement was made-an unofficial agreement-that no quorums would be called during the meal break. That system broke down-I think rightly so-because some honourable senators felt their rights were being taken away. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that in this trial sitting period-despite the fact that we should not set out deliberately to frustrate the workings of the Parliament-any honourable senator who feels aggrieved should have the right at any time to use the forms and forums of the chamber to express his grievance. I do not think there should be any criticism of any honourable senator who, for whatever purpose, may decide to call for a quorum, a division or whatever. I emphasise that so far as I am concerned if this means sitting through meal breaks there should be no deprivation of any honourable senators' rights in the use of the forms of the Senate. During the final period of the Labor Government we sat on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays but the House rose at 5 p.m. on a Thursday. We introduced General Business at 3 p.m. on Thursdays and it concluded at 5 p.m. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EK7">Senator DOUGLAS McCLELLAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the very point I am going to make. Is the Government making provision as to when General Business comes on? Under this proposal will General Business come on at 4.30 p.m. Thursday and be debated until 7 p.m. or will it come on at some other time? I think that is a matter that must be sorted out. It will have to be determined one way or the other by the Government. Eventually the Government will have to bring in a recommendation to the Senate on that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There seems to be an impression abroad that because the hours laid down now are the hours that we have been using for two or three years they must per se be the hours that we should continue to use. I completely disagree with that principle. I remember when we were in government and the Senate rose at 5 p.m. I was manager of Government Business and I ran the wrath of the then Prime Minister because the Senate was not sitting when the House of Representatives sat. Eventually, at the end of our Government, because through political circumstances we could not get Supply through, we had to extend our sitting hours. I understand that when this Government came into office it was determined that the Senate should sit roughly the same hours as the House of Representatives. I do not agree with that. I think we should be masters of our own destiny, of our own times, and make a determination along those lines. If we can get our work through in 17 hours, rather than 20 hours, we should make that determination. </PARA>
<PARA> I have great misgivings. I certainly agree with my colleague, Senator McLaren, about the problems that could arise on Thursdays between 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. If General Business is to be discussed on Thursdays, I think some consideration should be given as to when it is brought on. However I believe it is worthwhile having a trial period. Because our present hours are exhausting I believe this motion should be supported. </PARA>

I have not seen so many honourable senators in this place for so long for a debate on any topic for a very long time. I am glad that honourable senators are interested in it. When I moved this motion I said that I was proposing to rearrange the sitting hours; that we should sit for the same number of hours as we do now but merely rearrange those hours. I suspected before I spoke that a lot of debate against those hours would relate to the sort of thing that Senator Reid objected to-losing one lunch hour on Thursdays each sitting week. I am not compelled by that argument. Apparently Senator Martyr is. He seems to believe that that is the most compelling argument against this motion.</PARA></TALK.START>

They were paired during the sitting hours of this place. The same thing happens on Israeli National Day and the same thing can happen to Senator Reid if she urgently needs to go to some lunch-hour function on a sitting Thursday. I do not see that as an objection at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second problem-in the order that I am going to mention them-was raised by Senator McLaren who made the extraordinary claim that unnamed honourable senators on this side had been intimidating him, stopping him calling quorums and stopping him speaking on the adjournment. I have never attempted to intimidate Senator McLaren. I would not be game. I have had many requests from Government senators to intimidate Senator McLaren but I have told them that that would be an impossibility and I would not be able to do it. There is nothing in the motion that I have moved that takes away any of Senator McLaren's rights. I have said, and I repeat it, that for this proposal on sitting days to work properly, on those occasions when we sit through meal hours, there may have to be give and take on both sides-one side agreeing that nothing contentious will be brought up in that hour and the other side agreeing that unnecessary quorums, or any quorums at all, will not be called. I would not intend having those matters put into the Standing Orders, nor would I think it necessary. In London the Parliament sits through all its meal hours and it manages to survive. It has done so for a very long time and I do not see why this Parliament cannot survive . </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the problem of the adjournment debate. In 1981 the Senate sat for 72 days and on 49 days, someone spoke on the adjournment. Senator McLaren spoke on many of them. The average speaking time on the adjournment was 10.8 minutes. The longest adjournment debate was one hour 29 minutes and on only two days did the adjournment debate go longer than an hour. It may be that because the adjournment will be earlier in the night and honourable senators can not think of anything else to do, honourable senators may speak in the adjournment debate more often than they used to. What we do about that is in the hands of the Senate. I am not suggesting that we take away the rights of honourable senators to speak on the adjournment. However I am suggesting that honourable senators should be reasonable and not speak on the adjournment just because it is earlier any more than they do now. Are honourable senators trying to tell me that a serious person such as Senator McLaren will abuse the adjournment after 7 p.m.? He speaks only on important matters and did so on only 49 days at the most of the 72 sitting days last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course Senator Harradine is right. We will have to make new arrangements for the hours during which we will discuss General Business. I suggest that a sensible time for General Business may well be from 4 o'clock, 4.30 or whatever on Thursday afternoon until the adjournment time. However that is a matter for the Government and honourable senators on the Standing Orders Committee to consider. Surely it is not beyond the wit of people in this place to make sensible arrangements to divide those hours so that people do not lose anything. If people really suggest that it is beyond our capacity to organise those hours I suggest we should not be here at all and we have no right to represent the people of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe Senator Martin effectively answered Senator McLaren's accusations concerning the alleged lack of concern for staff by the people who put up this proposal. In fact the one complaint that I have had about staff working conditions under these new hours is not that they will have to work too long. A couple of them are worried that they will not get as much overtime as they are geting now. I take another trade union principle. If people have to depend on overtime to get a living wage it is up to senators and it is up to unions to get them a proper living wage so that they do not need that overtime. It is quite wrong to suggest that we should sit the hours that we do to provide people with overtime. We should provide people with proper wages and proper conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that this debate has demonstrated to me is that not all the conservative people are on the other side of the House, although it seems that most of them are. People seem to have a great fear of the unknown. Some people are actually frightened that, on Tuesday night and on Thursday night, they will not have anything to do. Senator Harradine said that honourable senators would be twiddling their fingers. I repeat that I am sure that most of us will do then what we do now on Tuesday nights and on Thursday nights. We will work, but we will work more effectively, uninterrupted by bells and the sorts of procedures which some of us have to deal with in this place. I believe that that will make this a more sensible chamber and it will make for more sensible debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Honey (Export Inspection Charge) Bill and the Honey (Export Inspection Charge) Collection Bill are related to provisions for recouping a protection of the cost borne by the Commonwealth for the inspection of honey for export from Australia. It is recognised that two questions arise in relation to this matter which have nothing to do with the question of whether it is reasonable that there be some cost recovery from the industry concerned. The first relates to the cost recovery of a proportion of the provision of the service provided, and the proportion which has been provided for in the Honey (Export Inspection Charge) Bill is 50 per cent. The second question relates to the reasonableness of the amount allocated to be recovered, including the method of operating the service and calculating the cost. The second matter has caused some considerable concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposal is that an amount of $6.75 per tonne be imposed by regulation under the Bill. This would provide for a maximum amount of $14 to be charged. The total amount involved is a relatively small one of $49,000 which may or may not be reasonable. Much concern has been expressed in the industry with the suggestion that it is about three times as high as would be reasonable. Another concern is whether the proposed method of charge is equitable between honey producers. Dramatic examples have been put forward to support claims of inefficiency, administrative extravagance and the like. These may or may not have some validity. </PARA>
<PARA> The position is that considerable concern has been expressed. The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations has considered this matter and is unanimously of the view that it would be desirable for this Bill to be referred to that Committee and for the Committee to have the opportunity to look at the second of the two questions which arise; that is, the reasonableness of the amount to be recovered and the method of operating the service and of allocating the costs by the Department of Primary Industry. I seek leave to move a motion. Briefly, there is no opposition to the principle; rather the Committee seeks an opportunity to examine the basis of the allocation of inspection export charges and the reasonableness of those charges. The Committee will investigate without delay and report by 28 April. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators by now will be familiar with the practice of introducing an omnibus miscellaneous amendments Bill during each period of sittings of the Parliament as an expeditious way of making amendments of a non-controversial character to a large number of Acts. I said in the Senate on 25 November 1981 that provided this form of legislation is properly confined to non-controversial matters, it is a convenient way of approaching the situation. That has been the guiding principle in preparing the present Bill. The rest of the speech is a fairly lengthy detailed account of what I hope are non-controversial matters. I seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The short title of the Bill has been numbered 'No. 1' to indicate that a further omnibus Bill will, in the normal course, be introduced later this year in the Budget sittings. The numbering takes up a useful suggestion to this effect made by the opposition in another place on 17 November 1981, when the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1981 was being debated. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the amendments are made by the Bill to correct printing or drafting errors. Others make drafting or other technical amendments. These provisions do not call for particular comment. </PARA>
<PARA> Other provisions go into matters of substance in varying degrees. I propose to explain in some detail the nature and effect of those provisions. In addition, a detailed explanatory memorandum covering all the clauses of the Bill has been circulated. </PARA>
</SPEECH>
</DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><DEBATE TYPE="Miscellaneous" PAGE="1210"><TITLE>ACTS INTERPRETATION ACT 1901</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In a statement to the Senate on 26 May 1981, I advised that the Government has decided to give effect to a number of recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances on matters relating to parliamentary disallowance of delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed by the Bill to the Acts Interpretation Act give effect to two of those recommendations. One is ensure that upon the dissolution of the House of Representatives after a notice of motion for disdallowance of a regulation is given in the Senate, the regulation shall be deemed to have been tabled on the first sitting day of the Senate after the dissolution of the House of Representatives. The amendments in paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 4 of the Bill have that effect.</PARA>
<PARA> The other matter is to provide that on the disallowance of a regulation which repeals, in whole or in part, an earlier regulation the repealed regulation will be revived from and including the date of disallowance of the repealing regulation. This is dealth with by paragraph (c) of clause 4 of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (c) also deals with another matter. During the course of its preparation a question was raised whether the effect of sub-section 48 (3) of the Acts Interpretation Act upon a failure to lay regulations before each House of Parliament as required by paragraph 48 (1) (c), is to make such regulations void ab initio. If it did, any rights or obligations which accrued under the regulations between the date of making the regulation and the final date for tabling would be lost. The Bill clarifies this situation by amending sub-section 48 (6) to ensure that, upon the voiding of a regulation under sub-section 48 (3) , the regulation is regarded as having been repealed. The provisions of section 50, in relation to the repeal of regulations would then apply.</PARA>
<PARA> The principles contained in these amendments have also been applied by this Bill to the tabling of Ordinances and other instruments of a legislative character under the following Acts:</PARA>
<PARA> Ashmore and Cartier Islands Acceptance Act 1933</PARA>
<PARA> Australian Antarctic Territory Act 1954</PARA>
<PARA> Christmas Island Act 1958</PARA>
<PARA> Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955</PARA>
<PARA> Coral Sea Islands Act 1969</PARA>
<PARA> Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974</PARA>
<PARA> Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act 1978</PARA>
<PARA> Heard Island and McDonald Islands Act 1953</PARA>
<PARA> Norfolk Island Act 1979</PARA>
<PARA> Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I mention that the Bill applies sections 48, 49 and 50 of the Acts Interpretation Act to Rules of Court by the High Court, the Federal Court of Australia and the Supreme Court of the A.C.T. These amendments are also intended to give effect to the general policy referred to by me in the Senate on 26 May 1981 that there should be uniform application of the provisions of Part XII of the Acts Interpretation Act in relation to the tabling and disallowance of statutory instruments. It is considered that such provisions should also apply in the case of Rules of Court. The amendments to this effect are contained in clauses 67, 155 and 161 of the Bill.</PARA>
</PROCTEXT>
</DEBATE><DEBATE TYPE="Miscellaneous" PAGE="1211"><TITLE>ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL ACT 1975</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes a number of changes to the membership structure of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and to the provisions governing the mode of operation of the Tribunal. The changes reflect the growing status of the Tribunal and its increasing workload. Many of the changes will give effect to recommendations of the Administrative Review Council and proposals of the President of the Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal now has jurisdiction to review decisions made under more than 100 statutes. It covers decisions in fields such as social security, immigration, repatriation, Commonwealth employees' compensation, patents, customs, air navigation, superannuation and export grants. The Tribunal's caseload grew from 227 in 1979/80 to 652 in 1980/81 mainly due to additions to its jurisdiction of social security and Commonwealth employees' compensation matters. Its caseload is expected to increase substantially in the current financial year.</PARA>
<PARA> The already increased workload and the further increases expected from the freedom of information legislation have highlighted the need to make changes in the membership structure of the Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the main purposes of the changes now proposed is to rationalize the membership structure of the Tribunal, having regard to the role played on the Tribunal by Judges of the Federal Court of Australia. Although both Judges and non-judges may now be appointed as Deputy Presidents, in fact only Judges of the Federal Court have been so appointed. The Act as it stands does not distinguish between the roles of Judges and of non-judges.The Judges of the Federal Court who have been appointed as Deputy Presidents have played a valuable role, particularly in some areas of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. With the increasing workload of the Tribunal it is necessary to have additional members of Deputy President status but there is, of course, a limit to the extent to which Judges of the Federal Court can devote time to sitting on the Tribunal. Consequently, one purpose of the proposed amendments made by clauses 8, 9 and 40 will be to distinguish those presidential members who are Judges from Deputy Presidents who are not Judges, and to reserve certain critical powers for presidential members who are Judges. At the same time, the Bill recognises the existing practice of appointing a Judge of the Federal Court as President of the Tribunal, by requiring that the President shall be a Judge of the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA> The greater part of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is in fact exercised by the senior non-presidential members, either sitting alone or as chairman of panels of the Tribunal. Full-time senior members are presently appointed for terms of years only. It is now proposed that a full-time senior member be appointed to the age of 65 years, to emphasise their independence in performing their functions on the Tribunal-see clause 10. Further, the role of the senior member in dealing with questions of law requires that he ordinarily have legal qualifications. This is recognised in the amendments made by clause 9.</PARA>
<PARA> Provision is to be made by clauses 14 and 38 for those members appointed to the Tribunal in future to take an appropriate oath of office, to mark the importance of the jurisdiction they will exercise.</PARA>
<PARA> The present complete bar on outside employment by full time members of the Tribunal is to be replaced by a provision expressly authorizing service with the Defence Force and permitting other employment to be undertaken with Ministerial approval-see clause 15.</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 22 of the Bill makes certain changes regarding statements of reasons under section 28 of the Act. First, the Tribunal is to be empowered to review a refusal by a decison-maker to give a statement of reasons for a decision when requested to do so under section 28 of the Act. The Tribunal is also to be empowered to review the sufficiency of a section 28 statement. Secondly, a number of other changes to section 28 will bring it, so far as appropriate, into line with the equivalent provision in section 13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. In future, a certificate by the Attorney-General preventing disclosure of certain material in a section 28 statement will not result, as at present, in the whole statement being withheld, but only so much of the statement as is covered by the certificate. The whole statement may be withheld only where omission of the matter covered by the certificate would render the statement false or misleading.</PARA>
<PARA> The working of the Tribunal will be aided by the provisions giving the President a wider power of delegation (clause 13), authorizing a wider class of members to exercise interlocutory powers (clause 17) and to give procedural directions (Clause 26). The agreement of all the parties will no longer be required to the holding of a preliminary conference (Clause 27).</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 25 of the Bill will empower the Attorney-General to intervene in proceedings before the Tribunal where the Commonwealth has a special interest in the proceedings and would wish to put argument on relevant matters to the Tribunal. Provision is made for payment by the Commonwealth of any increase in costs attributable to such an intervention.</PARA>
<PARA> The Act provides for the President of the Tribunal to rule on certain claims by the Attorney-General to privilege in respect of documents and oral evidence. Because this jurisdication is given at present to the president as such as such, and not to the Tribunal constituted by the President, the right of appeal to the Federal Court from a decision of the Tribunal does not apply to such a ruling. The effect of clauses 30 and 31 of the Bill will be to vest the power to make such a ruling in the Tribunal which will be required, for this purpose, to be constituted by a Judge of the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA> It is often convenient for the Tribunal to be able to hand down a decision, with oral reasons for the decision, without the delay involved in the preparation of a written statement. As the Act now stands, it is doubtful whether this may be done, even where a written statement is provided later. Accordingly, clause 33 of the Bill empowers the Tribunal to give either oral or written reasons at the time it hands down a decision. If it does not then give written reasons, it must do so if requested to do so by a party to the proceedings. This provision is designed to avoid delays that now occur in the decision of the Tribunal being available in those cases where it has come to a conclusion at the end of the hearing, but must now delay the handing down of the decision until reasons for the decision have been reduced to writing. The change will be of particular benefit in many social security cases, where an early decision is desirable.</PARA>
<PARA> The remaining amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act are largely consequential to those I have already mentioned, or make minor changes to facilitate the working of the Tribunal.</PARA>

</DEBATE><DEBATE TYPE="Miscellaneous" PAGE="1212"><TITLE>AGED PERSONS HOSTELS ACT 1972</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Part IV of the Bill amends the Aged Persons Hostels Act 1972, which is to become known as the Aged or Disabled Persons Hostels Act 1972. The key amendment is made by paragraph (a) of clause 45, which amends section 5 of the Act to extend to disabled persons as well as to aged persons.</PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will enable organisations to accommodate disabled persons in hostels originally approved or constructed with grants under the Act for accommodation of aged persons only. Accordingly, the amendments also provide that where an organisation has made an agreement with the Director-General of Social Services undertaking to continue to use a hostel as a home for aged persons only, the undertaking will be deemed to have been given with respect to continued use of the hostel as a home for persons who are aged or disabled.</PARA>
<PARA> These amendments will bring the Act into line with the major legislation in the Government's program to house aged and disabled persons, the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954, which was amended in 1974 to extend its coverage to disabled persons. The amendments will allow organisations greater flexibility in the operation of homes funded under both Acts ''under the one roof'' and will materially assist disabled persons in those areas (especially in the country) where the only available form of specialised accommodation is a hostel built with a grant under the Aged Persons Hostels Act.</PARA>

<PARA> The amendments proposed by Parts XV, XVI, XXVII and XXXVI relate to the package of legislation which comprises the co-operative companies and securities scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> On 22 December 1978 the Commonwealth and the six States executed a Formal Agreement that provided the framework for a co-operative Commonwealth/State scheme for a uniform system of law and administration in relation to company law and the regulation of the securities industry in the six States and the Australian Capital Territory. A copy of the Agreement is set out in the Schedule to the National Companies and Securities Commission Act 1979.</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 8 (1) (a) of the Agreement provides that the Commonwealth will submit to this Parliament legislation which has been unanimously agreed by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities, and shall take such steps as are appropriate to secure the passage of the legislation. The relevant amendments in these Parts have been unanimously approved by the Ministerial Council only after detailed discussion and consideration. Also, the amendments are of a kind considered appropriate for inclusion in the Miscellaneous Amendments Bill. The effect of the particular amendments is set out in detail in the explanatory memorandum that has been circulated. I draw attention to the following features.</PARA>

<PARA> Under the amendments of the Companies Act made by Part XV of the Bill, the provisions of the Act relating to inspection of registers kept by companies and the availability of copies of these registers will be standardized. See, for example, clause 95. Other amendments result from on-going work on preparation of the regulations to be made under this Act. Some of the amendments are not intended to change the operation of the principal legislation, but simply to ensure that it does, in fact, operate as originally envisaged.</PARA>
<PARA> A significant change to the Act is in the area of registration of charges. It had originally been intended that details of charges contained on registers maintained under the pre-existing law would be transferred to the new registers to be maintained under the new priority system. However, because of administrative difficulties in some States relating to the transfer of information on existing charges to the new register, the Ministerial Council has decided to retain the existing registers for a twelve month period at least. This will enable the Ministerial Council to review the provisions relating to the register.</PARA>
<PARA> For this purpose, a new section 215A is to be inserted in the Act by clause 105 of the Bill.</PARA>

<PARA> The amendments of the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act are made by Part XVI of the Bill. The time within which the National Companies and Securities Commission may declare an acquisition of shares or other conduct to be unacceptable has been extended from 14 days to 90 days after the acquisition has taken place or specified conduct has been engaged in. The amendment is to be found in clause 132.</PARA>
<PARA> Once the Commission has made such a declaration, it will be able to make certain orders which are to be published in the Gazette-see clause 133. These will include orders restraining the disposal or acquisition of an interest in specified shares, restraining the exercise of voting rights, or directing a company not to issue shares to a person who holds shares in it. These orders will generally expire after 30 days, although a person aggrieved by an order will be able to apply to the Supreme Court for its variation or revocation.</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, in exercising its powers under sections 45, 47, 48, 57 and 60 of the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act, the Supreme Court will have the power to make interim orders and will be able to make orders without requiring undertakings as to damages-see clause 131.</PARA>

<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the amendments made by Parts XVII and XX of the Bill to the consular and diplomatic privileges and immunities legislation is to assist in preventing the misuse of the customs duty exemptions provided by that legislation. Pursuant to the obligations in the two Vienna Conventions on diplomatic and consular relations respectively, Australia accords, by way of that legislation, customs duty exemptions to members of foreign diplomatic missions and consular posts in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> It is currently possible for most diplomatic and consular personnel and their families to import into Australia for their personal use motor vehicles free of sales tax and customs duty. Those vehicles may then be sold or otherwise disposed of without the payment of duties or taxes after they have been retained for two years. Luxury vehicles can thus be sold at a considerable profit.</PARA>
<PARA> The amendments increase from 2 to 3 years the period within which persons entitled to customs exemption under either of the Acts may not dispose of motor vehicles without restriction. The 3 year period corresponds with the usual period for which foreign diplomatic and consular personnel are posted to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the number of vehicles which can be imported free of customs duty by each family under the Acts will be reduced administratively.</PARA>
<PARA> These measures are consistent with international practice.</PARA>

</DEBATE><DEBATE TYPE="Miscellaneous" PAGE="1214"><TITLE>COPYRIGHT ACT 1968</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Copyright Act 1968 contained in Part XVIII of the Bill are concerned entirely with the provisions of that Act providing for the Copyright Tribunal. Having regard to the nature of applications currently before the Tribunal and applications expected to be made to it in the near future, the Government has concluded that the existing provisions of the Act requiring members of the Tribunal to possess legal qualifications unduly restrict the range of possible candidates from which members may be appointed. It is felt that the deliberations of the Tribunal could be helped by the presence of members possessing expertise in other occupations relevant to the subject matter of applications before, or likely to be coming before, the Tribunal. Accordingly clause 139 of the Bill broadens the range of qualifications for eligibility for membership.</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, by analogy with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act, only Judges of the Federal Court of Australia are, under the Bill, to be eligible for appointment as President and Deputy President of the Tribunal. In this regard I point out that under the existing provisions of the Copyright Act, the President and Deputy President have more onerous duties than other members.</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 144 modifies the provisions of the Act permitting a Tribunal to continue hearing an application after one of its members ceases to be available. The Bill will make the authority of the Tribunal to continue in such circumstances dependent on the continued presence of the President or Deputy President on the Tribunal for that hearing.</PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity has been taken in the Bill to make other amendments to the Copyright Act to substitute new provisions regarding the termination of the appointments of members of the Tribunal (clause 140), the authority of the Deputy President when acting in place of the President (clause 141), and the fixing of the remuneration and allowances of Tribunal members (clause 142). The provisions substituted by the Bill follow the pattern of provisions for similar bodies in other Acts that have been enacted more recently than the provisions of the Copyright Act being replaced.</PARA>

<PARA> These amendments are primarily designed to provide a legislative basis for the payment of a Presiding Officer who, though himself no longer a member of the Parliament, continues to perform for a period the statutory functions of the office until the election of a successor.

There was, however, no provision for him to be paid any allowance.</PARA>
<PARA> In such circumstances an appropriate ex gratia payment has customarily been made.</PARA>
<PARA> It now seems appropriate to put the matter on a proper footing, and at the same time to repeal obsolete provisions of the Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952 which relate to allowances now prescribed by the Remuneration Tribunal.</PARA>

<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Student Assistance Act 1973 outlines the broad provisions of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme (TEAS) and the Post-graduate Awards Scheme. The clauses which form Part XXXIV of the Bill will amend the Act to repeal those provisions which are no longer relevant, to make minor changes to facilitiate the administration of the two schemes and to make certain changes to the procedures of the Student Assistance Review Tribunals which review decisions of the Department of Education on individual students' entitlements. The proposed amendments do not reflect changes in Government policy and will not restrict entitlement to benefits.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as the administration of TEAS and the Post-graduate Award Scheme is concerned, the amendments will provide that the Minister for Education may approve part only of a course in addition to the existing authority in relation to a course as a whole (clauses 223 and 226). For example, a course may comprise an academic component which is suitable for approval and periods of employment experience which fall outside the scope of educational assistance. The amendments will also enable regulations to be made which would provide for the payment to persons under TEAS of amounts associated with travel to and from an institution, other than by way of reimbursement of fares (clause 224).</PARA>
<PARA> There are clauses which concern procedures to be followed by Student Assistance Review Tribunals. They will enable an appellant to withdraw a request for review if, for example, in the light of further information the decision being appealed against has been reversed in the appellant's favour (clause 232). An appellant will also be given the option of having his appeal heard by a two member Tribunal where, for example, the third member is found to be unavailable on the day the appeal is scheduled to be heard (clause 233).</PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will provide two further measures which are consistent with the Government's experience with other review bodies and the recommendations of the Bowen Report on Public Duty and Private interest, and are in the interests of appellants. They will require a Tribunal member to declare any interest he may have in the proceedings under review (clause 233), and will enable the Tribunals to safeguard the confidentialy of certain documents presented and evidence given in respect of a particular hearing, where there is good reason for doing so ( clause 238).</PARA>

We believe that, given goodwill on both sides, the Committee's recommendations will work. I seek leave to have the Government's response to the report incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This statement arises from the Government's consideration of the report of the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing, tabled on 19 August 1981. While the recommendations in the report essentially deal with the Senate, the Government's response covers, and is therefore being made in, both Houses of the Parliament. I note in passing that the current procedures for considering the parliamentary Estimates were to be reviewed in any event for the 1982-83 Budget. The Government acknowledges the valuable work of the Committee. In developing its response it has had the benefit of their further views and discussed the matters raised by the Committee with the presiding officers. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of reference of the Senate Select Committee were to inquire into and report upon Parliament's control of its own appropriations and staffing, and related matters. The central theme in the report is that Parliament should have greater independence and autonomy in regard to its own internal arrangements and operations. Control of Parliament's appropriations and staffing is seen by the Committee as essential to achieving this independence.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government, of course, agrees that the independence of Parliament as such from executive control is a central principle of our Constitution which must be upheld. But just as the Parliament must exercise its rights and meet its responsibilities, so must the Government be able to fulfil its constitutional obligations, in this case the control of the expenditure of public money. </PARA>
<PARA> In responding to the report, the Government has had to devise a balance between these fundamental principles bearing in mind the provisions of the Australian Constitution and the development of parliamentary government in Australia. I believe that the detailed measures I will outline a little later meet this challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> This balance assumes there will be a continuing dialogue between the Parliament and the Executive, and it remains the Government's firm intention that such dialogue is effective, and recognizes the proper roles and responsibilities of each party. The fact that this response has taken the time it has flows in part from our commitment to such discussions at all stages. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Government's response to the specific major recommendations of the Jessop Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The report contains recommendations on five main topics:</PARA>
<PARA> Parliament's control of its own funding</PARA>
<PARA> a separate parliamentary appropriation Bill</PARA>
<PARA> transfer of items in appropriations of Government Departments to the parliamentary appropriation Bill and parliamentary administration</PARA>
<PARA> control over staffing and terms and conditions of employment</PARA>
<PARA> a parliamentary appropriations and staffing committee. </PARA>
<PARA> On the first and key issue the Government believes firmly that it needs to maintain control over the total amount of funds available for expenditure by the Parliament because of the constitutional responsiblity of the Government for budgetary policy and for the level of public expenditure. Moreover it is the Government which has the odium of raising the revenue which funds that expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government recognises that detailed control over individual expenditure items is not necessary. The Government therefore proposes that it simply approve overall figures, broken down into a capital and a recurrent item, for each of the Senate, the House of Representatives and, as a group, the three joint departments. This arrangement properly balances the overall government responsibility for the level of public expenditure with the responsibility of the parliamentary departments and the presiding officers to determine (subject to parliamentary approval) the direction of that expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also proposes that, commencing with the financial year 1982-83, there be a separate parliamentary Appropriation Bill which, consistent with the Select Committee recommendations, will not be treated as a Bill for the ordinary annual services of the Government, and will cover all recurrent and capital expenditure items currently administered by the parliamentary departments. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also say that the arrangements for consultations between the presiding officers and the Government (and consultations at officer level) during the Budget process will, of course, be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the total figure for parliamentary departments, the Government is also suggesting an advance to the presiding officers as recommended by the Select Committee, provided that such an advance is operated in the same way as the Advance to the Minister for Finance. The Government will be proposing an amendment to the Audit Act in due course to facilitate the use of this advance. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of the transfer of certain items from appropriations of government departments to the parliamentary Appropriation Bill and parliamentary administration, the Government proposes that the two aspects be considered together and therefore that these items should be the subject of further discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the topic of control over staffing. The Government has most carefully considered the need to maintain a measure of control over the total number of public sector employees. The Government's policies in this regard are a matter of public record. Suffice it to say that the Government does not wish public sector employees to have any pace-setting role and expects that due regard be paid to principles of wage restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis that the presiding officers undertake to consult with the Public Service Board before determining staff ceilings for individual parliamentary departments, and provided that the presiding officers publish projected ceilings in advance, with the previous year's actual ceilings, by reporting annually to the Parliament, then the Government is willing to give control over staff numbers to the presiding officers. </PARA>
<PARA> On terms and conditions of employment of parliamentary staff the Government is also asking presiding officers to give an undertaking to consult with the Public Service Board before determining (as they are now empowered to) those terms and conditions, and that such determinations should also be published annually when the presiding officers report to Parliament. The reason for this is to avoid any undesirable 'leap-frogging' in terms and conditions between parliamentary and executive departments. I should make it clear that these consultations would be on the basis that the final powers reside with the presiding officers, that they agree to consult, but there is to be no statutory requirement on them to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The decisions of the Parliament in these areas should be subject to the same types of scrutiny, inside and outside the Parliament, as those of the Government . It is up to the Parliament to prove its managerial ability in the same fashion as the Government. It is for this reason that the Government is proposing that the presiding officers report annually to the Parliament on the numbers, classification and disposition of staff, as well as any variation in terms and conditions of employment. They should also provide a detailed breakdown of previous and proposed expenditure within each of the items contained in the parliamentary Appropriatoin Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Given these arrangements, a number of further powers will be transferred to the presiding officers as recommended by the Senate Committee. The Government will be proposing amendments to the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill 1981 now before the Parliament, to vest in the presiding officers power to create, classify and abolish offices, and to make appointments below the level of permanent head. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Select Committee proposed the establishment of a Senate appropriations and staffing committee. The Government considers that it is appropriate for the Senate itself to decide on the mechanisms it wishes to establish to advise the president on his responsibilities and, therefore, proposes to leave this recommendation in the Senate's hands. For the House, the Government will not be proposing any similar committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I am confident that the revised arrangements as I have outlined will provide the basis for a reasonable balance between the need for the Parliament to have a greater degree of autonomy in relation to funding and staffing and the need for the government to retain a limited number of overall controls in the execution of its proper responsibilities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I know that the notice of motion standing in Senator Jessop's name has now been adopted-as I understand it , unanimously-by the Senate. Therefore, in the near future the Senate will proceed to the establishment of a committee to bring down recommendations on annual estimates and additional estimates for the Senate. Page 3 of the statement by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However the Government recognises that detailed control-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, control by the Government-</PARA>
<PARA> The Government therefore proposes that it simply approve overall figures, broken down into a capital and a recurrent item, for each of the Senate, the House of Representatives and, as a group, the three joint departments. This arrangement properly balances the overall Government responsibility for the level of public expenditure with the responsibility of the parliamentary departments and the Presiding Officers to determine (subject to parliamentary approval) the direction of that expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA>The second last paragraph on page 5 of the Minister's statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Select Committee proposed the establishment of a Senate appropriations and staffing committee. The Government considers that it is appropriate for the Senate itself to decide on the mechanisms it wishes to establish to advise the President on his responsibilities-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise those words-</PARA>
<PARA>and, therefore, proposes to leave this recommendation in the Senate's hands. For the House, the Government will not be proposing any similiar committee. </PARA>
<PARA>I rise merely to indicate that Senator Jessop's motion which has been adopted, goes further than the Minister's statement. Paragraph (3) of Senator Jessop's motion states:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Committee-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) in relation to the Estimates-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) determine the amounts for inclusion in the Parliamentary Appropriation Bills for the annual Estimates and Additional Estimates, and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) report to the Senate upon its determinations prior to the consideration by the Senate of the related parliamentary Appropriation Bill;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I also had intended to draw attention to the difference between the language of the statement which the Government has put down and the resolution which has been carried. The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) might be able to clarify what is meant on page 3 of the statement. Page 5 of the statement refers to a committee being set up merely to advise the President on his responsibility, but it has been pointed out that it does a lot more than that as the terms of reference make clear. Paragraph (3) of Senator Jessop's motion states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Committee-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) in relation to the Estimates-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) determine the amounts for inclusion in the Parliamentary Appropriation Bills for the Annual Estimates and the Additional Estimates. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that the expression used in the motion is 'determine the amounts'. One could have, by accident and not by design, a clash in this case. I think we ought to know the situation. The Government, on page 3 of its statement, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government therefore proposes that it simply approve overall figures, broken down . . . </PARA>
<PARA>One needs to know whether this means that the Government will automatically give its approval to the figures which are recommended by the Committee which is to be set up by the Senate, or whether it means that the Government has, as at present, a veto power and that the Bill it introduces will include the Government's total and, therefore the Committee will not be determining this matter at all. I think is is important that these matters should not remain in an uncertain stage. We ought to know what is the intention of the Government in that regard. I agree, as Senator Douglas McClelland has said, that there is a great deal of movement in regard to the other matters in the statement. I think very useful things which could work well were proposed. But I think it is important that that be clarified. Is there to be merely an automatic approval of overall figures or will the Government retain its right to determine the maximum figures, which is the situation at the moment?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The statement, of course, is quite clear. On page 1 in the bottom paragraph it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But just as the Parliament must exercise its rights and meet its responsibilities, so must the Government be able to fulfil its constitutional obligations, in this case the control of the expenditure of public money. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement has made it perfectly clear that, in one aspect-that is, the overall quantum of money for the Parliament-the Government will, indeed, discuss at great length and in detail forward estimates and Additional Estimates and will have maximum and continuous liaison. But the final decision on the overall quantum will lie with the Government. That is spelt out very clearly in the statement. </PARA>
<PARA> As to another paragraph on page 3, the Leader of the House, Mr Sinclair, and I have had discussions with the Presiding Officers as to whether a global figure is enough-that is, a single line figure-or whether, for example, there is a need for five different lines: One for the Senate; one for the House of Representatives; one for the Joint House Department; one for Hansard and one for the Parliamentary Library. There was a clear view-certainly Mr President had a very clear view and I think this report has also-that there should be a separate figure for the Senate itself. That was determined. The Government is perfectly willing to provide a global figure for the three departments; that is, for Hansard, the Library and Joint House. If in time it emerges that we want to have three lines for them the Government would be perfectly happy about that. What in fact has happened is that overall, in virtually every request that has been made by the Jessop Committee, other than the final one that there should be an open door for the total quantum of money, the Government has acceded to the requests in the report. I would not fret too much about the second last paragraph. The basic situation is this: The Government is not intending to seek to influence the Senate. Honourable senators will note that I did not seek to do so at all in this debate. This is a matter of judgment for the Senate. In all other respects I direct honourable senators' attention to the front page of the statement which points out that however co-operative we may be, in the end, as with every other function of government, the bottom line must be determined by the Government. We propose so to do. </PARA>

When the Leader of the Government in the Senate rose to seek leave to incorporate this document responding to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing he referred to the report from the Jessop Committee. Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek some guidance from you. It is becoming very prevalent in this place that committees, whether in the Press or even in this place, are referred to as the committees of certain senators. I have had to raise this matter before . These committees are Senate committees of which a certain senator is a chairman. Much confusion could arise here. I have had a quick look through the Notice Paper. I see that Senator Jessop is a chairman of no less than three committees. Mr Acting Deputy President, you yourself are chairman of a committee . Many other Government senators are chairmen of more than one committee. I ask that some ruling be given so that in future, all committees are referred to by their proper titles. If honourable senators want to give some credit to the person who is chairman they can add that Senator so and so is chairman of a particular committee; it is not his committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek leave to incorporate the statement in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to inform the Senate that I have received a report from the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies on the social impact of uranium mining on Northern Territory Aboriginals, for the six month period ending 30 September 1981. I now present that report and seek leave to make a statement concerning some of the issues raised in it. </PARA>
<PARA> Before commenting on aspects of the report itself, I should like to draw your attention, Mr President, and the attention of Honourable Senators, to the fact that the Institute personnel who are operating in the Alligator Rivers Region have established fine working relationships with other governmental and non- governmental bodies in the region. Perhaps the most valuable of these relationships is the one that Institute personnel have established with the Standing Committee on the Social Impact, which is doing excellent work on the spot, as a decision making and co-ordinating body, aimed at ensuring that the social impact of uranium mining does not become detrimental. Aboriginal representatives-both from the Northern Land Council and from the local community -as well as Institute personnel hold membership on this Committee, along with representatives of the Territory and the Commonwealth Governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I turn now to a discussion of aspects of the Institute's report, particularly those aspects which-as it is proper for it to do-draw my attention to unfavourable possible developments in the region. I should like to draw your attention, Mr President, and the attention of Honourable Senators to these developments, and to indicate in brief outline what steps the Commonwealth Government is taking, in association with the Northern Territory Government and other bodies, to alleviate and correct them. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the matters raised in the report is an apparent insufficiency of information and education available for Aboriginals on matters of safety connected with the uranium projects in the region. This matter has now been taken under cognisance by three of the bodies operating in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> First, the Bureau of the Northern Land Council accepts that this is an area in which it has a major role. I have been informed that the Bureau will be increasing its efforts in the area of environmental safety information and education. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, the Supervising Scientist, whose function it is, among other things, to develop measures for protection of the environment, is aware of Aboriginal concerns about safety and has acted to provide information to Aboriginals in the region on the work of his Office and of the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute. </PARA>
<PARA> And third, the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute, which monitors the technical aspects and the physical effects of uranium mining, held an open information day at Jabiru East last November. This was attended by a significant number of local traditional owners who took the opportunity to learn about and to discuss the roles of the Institute and the Supervising Scientist in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> Other agencies, including the Ranger and Nabarlek Liaison and Advisory Committees, will also be encouraged to improve the flow of information to local Aboriginals on safety matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The report speaks of inadequacies in adult education facilities in the region. I understand that the difficulties in this area are due at least in part to the high mobility of the people in the region, and indeed an adult educator was withdrawn last year from Oenpelli due to the lack of enrolments in the courses offered. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the problem is one which is recognised as requiring sympathetic consideration and solution. A new adult educator has been appointed for Oenpelli , and I understand that he took up his duties in mid-January of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The report notes that two significant Aboriginal associations are now functioning: the Gagudju Association in respect of Ranger mining income beneficiaries, and the Kunwinjku Association in respect of Nabarlek. These associations were established by Aboriginal communities, with the assistance of the Northern Land Council, to manage the funds received by the communities as a result of mining activity, and to maintain other administrative functions of the communities concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Institute's report suggests, however, that the proliferation of other small clan-based uni-functional associations will need to be watched, and an effort made to fit them into the wider-based associations in the region. This concern was raised at the Standing Committee's recent meeting and it was decided that, while the issue is primarily one for the Northern Land Council to resolve, a working party of the Standing Committee should examine the question and provide assistance to the Northern Land Council in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The report suggests that there may be an excessive degree of consultation and information being imposed on Aboriginal communities and individuals in the region. Indeed the Standing Committee has commented that the dissemination of information presents the Committee with one of its greatest difficulties, because of the need to provide effective information and to consult Aboriginals on important issues, and yet not to impose too heavy a load on the people of the region. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Northern Land Council has offered to research this whole question and to report back to the Standing Committee on the wishes of the people and on ways of meeting their requirements. The Communication Planning Section of the Department of the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory is examining similar issues and will maintain liaison with the Northern Land Council. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the problems of alcohol, which have again been highlighted in the report. The question of access by Aboriginal workers to the Nabarlek ''wet'' canteen appears to have been resolved for the time being. The management of Queensland Mines Limited and the local Aboriginal people have agreed that the mine manager and several of the influential traditional owners will determine who may have access to the canteens. </PARA>
<PARA> In the wider region, the report refers to three alcohol-related road deaths of Aboriginals. The local communities are concerned, and rightly so, at this development; and over recent years they have been taking a growing number of measures, with Government support, to bring the alcohol problem under their control. These measures include the purchase of some of the liquor outlets in the region, the declaration of ''dry areas'', and the making of submissions to the Northern Territory Liquor Commission on matters relating to the licensing and re-licensing of liquor outlets. </PARA>
<PARA> The report refers to problems of accommodation and education at the Coonjimba Camp, which is within the Ranger Project area. Most of the residents of the camp have, I understand, expressed a wish to remain on the site and to have the camp upgraded to the status of an outstation. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter has been discussed between the camp residents, Ranger, the Northern Land Council, and the Gagudju Association. I understand that the Gagudju Association has accepted some responsibility for upgrading the facilities at the camp and, possibly also, for providing a building and other facilities for an outstation school. Discussions are continuing. </PARA>
<PARA> The report cites the need for improved banking facilities in the region and the provision of advice to local communities on investment, saving, and trading matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of provision of full bank facilities concerns only Oenpelli, as Jabiru will have a full banking service available by April of this year. Jabiru is, of course, a sizeable town and it is a viable proposition to provide that level of service. Approaches to the banks concerning similar facilities for Oenpelli have not been successful, and it is unlikely that they will be until such time as royalty income to the Oenpelli community reaches a level which is sufficient to warrant more than the present savings bank agency of the Commonwealth Bank. That Bank has, however, offered the services of its advisers to visit Oenpelli as needed to provide advice on general banking matters. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of investment advice, I am informed that the Gagudju Association has on its own initiative sought out the advice of financial advisers. The Kunwinjku Association can be expected to do the same. In addition, the Northern Territory Development Commission has offered its services to put both these Associations in contact with investment consultants. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the report, on page 54, makes one new recommendation and it also refers back to five recommendations in the previous report. I should like to refer here, Mr President, to the measures that have been taken or are to be taken in relation to these six recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> The new recommendation is that there should be a systematic review and assessment of induction programs provided by mining companies, government departments, and other authorities for their personnel in the Alligator Rivers Region. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been informed that the Northern Land Council is presently examining the question of mining company induction programs, which are provided for in the Ranger and Nabarlek mining agreements, with a view to making them more effective . </PARA>
<PARA> One of the recommendations in the previous report related to the introduction of a course in Gunwinggu-which is an Aboriginal language widely spoken in the Alligator Rivers Region-for the benefit of mining and government personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter is now under consideration by the Standing Committee on the Social Impact, several of whose members are expert in the Gunwinggu language, and who know of other personnel and facilities that can be utilised in the preparation of a course in the language concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Another recommendation in the previous Institute report was that serious attempts should be made to involve Aboriginal people from the region in the work of all committees which review and make decisions about the region. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation, Mr President, is that local Aboriginals either directly or indirectly through the Northern Land Council-already are represented in some of the committees whose work affects the land and people of the region. I recognise , however, that the extent of Aboriginal representation on these committees could be increased. One of the reasons put forward for low Aboriginal representation is the involvement of potential committeemen in a range of other activities such as employment, local council affairs and, indeed, on other committees. Another is the degree of formality in the proceedings of these committees which might be acting as a deterrent for more local Aboriginals becoming involved in them. Once again, Mr President, this is a matter for which a number of solutions has been proposed and which the Standing Committee is currently examining. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet another of the recommendations was that there should be a systematic comparison and review of the various agreements that have been contracted between mining companies and Aboriginal groups in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not quite sure from the wording of the recommendation what the purpose of such a comparison or review might be. Nor am I sure who the best person or body might be to conduct such a project. In any case, there is nothing in the commission to the Institute that would prevent it from undertaking this project itself, if it thought that the project would serve a useful purpose. My own view , however, is that the Northern Land Council, which both liaises with the local communities and negotiates the agreements with the mining companies, has by now built up considerable expertise in these matters. Northern Land Council negotiators are able to draw on that expertise. </PARA>
<PARA> Another recommendation contained in the last Institute report was that a program should be initiated to assist the Aboriginals to maintain their culture in the face of mining developments and associated activities in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to point out Mr President, that Aboriginals in the region are already active in maintaining their culture. This can be seen through their efforts in the setting up of numerous outstations in the region; in the development of outstation schools with the use of local languages in teaching; the teaching of aspects of culture; and in the increased attention given by Aboriginals to arts and craft production and to the teaching of associated skills. The Government is assisting Aboriginals in their efforts to maintain their culture through such means as financial support for the outstation movement, the Aboriginal Crafts Board, the Aboriginal Dance Theatre and for the range of activities supported by my Department's culture and recreation appropriation. </PARA>
<PARA> The final recommendation in the previous Institute report was that Land Councils should be encouraged to prepare long range land management schemes, and that they should be provided with resources that may be necessary to assist them in this task. </PARA>
<PARA> I am able to advise the Chamber, Mr President, that the Bureau of the Northern Land Council has recently undergone a major restructuring and upgrading of its administrative and financial resources. The Bureau now possesses the capacity to engage in long term land management planning of the kind that the Institute envisages in its recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> This concludes my comments, Mr President, on the critical aspects and on the recommendations contained or referred to in the report which I am tabling today. I should add that, on the matter of Aboriginal employment and training in the region, which has been referred to in a number of Institute reports the work of a special working party of the Standing Committee on the Social Impact has only recently been completed. I will be able to comment on this subject when I table the next Institute report. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, Mr President, I want to state my satisfaction at the fact that there are in the region significant positive social developments which are also related to the uranium development projects in the area. I can do no better than to quote the latest Institute report on this matter, when it says:</PARA>
<PARA> ''Mining has brought to the Aboriginal people of the region access to financial resources which provide a basis for a degree of independence from government funding and presence . . . (and there is) increasing confidence of important decision makers to confront major issues . . .''</PARA>
<PARA> This Government will continue to foster Aboriginal independence and Aboriginal confidence, as it will continue in its efforts to ameliorate any deleterious effects of mining activity on the Aboriginal inhabitants of the region. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The major comments on the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies report on the social impact of uranium mining on Northern Territory Aboriginals will be made by the shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Ryan. I would like to make a few comments as well. First, I comment on the fact that we are able to react only to the statement that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) put down. We still have the unfortunate situation of the report not being available to us in time for us to do some detailed study of it before we make our statement. This, to me, makes reasoned debate very difficult. I am not critical of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs at this time because it is a practice that has developed. We have raised this matter before; I raise it again at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> We ought to have the reports-embargoed if necessary-two or three hours before the Minister tables them so that we can make some sort of reasoned comment. It is possible that the Minister's statements might neglect elements which are unfavourable to the Government. I am not saying that they do; it is possible that this is so. We could not do anything about that. When the report is put aside for later debate we have to wait for several months to speak on it. Quite clearly, when people are reading Hansard they do not pick up one copy and then another one that is six months later. I think it is unfortunate that we have this approach. It is a traditional one; we have tried to change it. I hope that we will be able to take some action soon to do so. I believe that a government that talks about co-operation and adopts this sort of attitude breeds only mistrust. There is no reason we should not have the document beforehand. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall make a few comments on the statement of the Minister; that is all that I can do. Firstly, the staff of the Institute are working in a most interesting area and one which is for them very difficult-more difficult than it need be; but I will not go into that. When I represented the Australian Labor Party on the AIAS I found it a very interesting period of my time. The fact that the Northern Territory is involved makes this report more important to me. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of aspects were raised by the Minister. The first that concerns me relates to safety connected with the uranium project. Let me make the point that although the Minister said that the Northern Land Council would accept responsibility for doing something about this-by 'something' he is talking about education-we were told that the mining is safe, that there are not problems with dust, that the tailing dams are safe, that there is no possible runoff and that there is no danger with the transportation of yellowcake. If there are no dangers what is the problem with safety? Why has there been an expression of concern about which the Aboriginal people need to be educated? If any safety measures are required at the mine site these are clearly the responsibility not of the Northern Land Council but of the company concerned. Every company that operates, regardless of the industry, has its own safety measures. We certainly do not want to go to the Northern Land Council and say: 'You must not go to that area because there are some tailing dams there and you might have a runoff; you might get affected'. So it is the responsibility of the mining company to operate effectively. If there are any problems I believe that not only the company but also the Minister have some pretty solid questions to answer because we are told that there are no problems. We are told that the Supervising Scientist is aware of the concern of the Aboriginal people. I make the comment again that if the Supervising Scientist is concerned, what is he concerned about ? What are the grounds for this concern if there is no danger in mining in that area?</PARA>
<PARA> The report speaks of inadequacies in adult education facilities in the area. It makes the comment that sympathetic consideration is part of the solution to the problem and that a new Adult Educator has been appointed for Oenpelli. I accept this proposition. We all know that sympathetic consideration is important in the job of an adult educator. But let me make the point strongly that the job of the Adult Educator is to meet the needs of the region, particularly the community on which he is based, and not to do the job of the mining company. I trust that there is no doubt that he will work with the standing committee and the group from the AIAS to mitigate the effects of mining, if any. Of course, we know that there are some. We are not talking about the physical effects, but the social effects. It is the social impact of mining about which we are concerned. The Adult Educator can play a major role but it is not for him, as suggested by the Minister's statement-unless I read it incorrectly-to do the job of the mining company, which is to make sure, firstly, that the mine is safe and, secondly, that people who may move near the mine are protected. </PARA>
<PARA> I was most disturbed with the comment in the Minister's statement where he said that the report suggests that there may be an excessive degree of consultation. It has been my experience that the Aboriginal people have handled very well the transition from being poked, prodded and measured over the first 30 years or 40 years. That was the situation. They have moved and they have handled the move very well. I am concerned with the comment about excessive consultation because I am afraid that it might mean pressurising and hard selling, the sort of thing for which Gallarrwuy Yunupingu received a silver pen. Information is not so much a problem unless it is part of similar progress. Induction programs are mentioned and I believe these are vital. We need a systematic review and an assessment. That is vital also but it must be related to the total policies of the area. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a suggestion that we might have courses in Gunwinggu. This is excellent for the people who are going to stay there for a long time. This is the sort of thing with which the Minister agrees and I support him wholeheartedly. Gunwinggu is a difficult language to learn because of its complexity, as are most of the Aboriginal languages. So we would be concerned only with giving a brief course for those who will be there for a short time and a longer course for those who are staying longer. It is a step in the right direction if it indicates on the part of the mining company and the Government of the Northern Territory a respect of the culture of the Aboriginal people. That is the first step in learning the language. As honourable senators who have lived in the area or who have moved through the area know, if one moves into a community and indicates that one has learnt a few phrases of the language it is enough to open the door because the community realises that their culture is appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA> Another recommendation in the previous report of the Institute was that serious attempts should be made to involve Aboriginal people from the region in the work committees which review and make decisions about the region. I commend this. The Minister said that this should be increased but people are busy and there is a degree of formality which might upset the unsophisticated Aboriginal people. I do not accept that proposition. They must be involved in the decision making which affects their region. Mining companies seldom do this. They are paternalistic by nature even with their own people-that is, the white people-so they will be more so with the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> The employment and training of Aboriginals in the area is the only other aspect I wish to raise because we are running short of time. The Minister promised to comment on that when he is tabling the next Institute report. It is a pity that he cannot do it earlier.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some comments on the report of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies concerning a uranium project for the period from 1 April 1981 to 30 September 1981 and on the statement put down by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume). The letter of presentation from Professor Colin Tatz on page 3 of the report indicates that this report was presented to the Minister on 12 October 1981. Again, we have a report which is at least six months old being presented to the Senate. I put it to the Minister that, in view of the amount of activity both in terms of mining and Aboriginal land rights which is taking place in the Alligator Rivers region, it is very important that the Parliament receive up to date information. When reports come into the Parliaament as late as this they are of limited use in keeping the Senate up to date with what is happening in the Alligator Rivers region. I would ask the Minister to ensure that in future the Senate receives these reports as soon as possible after the conclusion of the report period.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that six months is required for printing. I ask the Minister to see whether we can have the reports more quickly. Otherwise, with the amount of activity that is going on, we do not know from reading this report today what is happening in the Aligator Rivers region. One of the most disturbing features highlighted by this report is the rising alarm among Aboriginal communities in the Alligator Rivers region about the effects on the physical environment of uranium mining. I draw the attention of the Senate to page 16 of the report where it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> News of the Queensland Mines Limited spillage reached the Oenpelli community in August and Project staff report a high degree of concern, coupled with a low level of knowledge of detail. . . . The possible development of the Jabiluka and Koongarra deposits makes assurances about safety mechanisms and their operation of the utmost importance and urgency. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 58 the report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> In the previous report the Committee stated with some confidence that 'there have been no contamination or other gross disturbances of the environment'. That confidence has been shaken in the light of the reported spillage at Nabarlek. . . . Aboriginal anxieties have now been expressed to the point where the Committee-and we believe, Government-cannot disassociate those facets of uranium mining from what have hitherto been seen as social impact factors. </PARA>
<PARA>Reports coming into my own office over the last few months confirm the distress and uncertainty being felt by many Aboriginal people and communities. I believe many Aboriginal communities, specifically those involved in the Jabiluka negotiations, feel themselves to be under intense pressure. Since this report was written, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has announced the granting of land rights to part of the Alligator Rivers land claim which includes 95 per cent of the Jabiluka project area. Last week the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, gave the go ahead, subject to Aboriginal approval, for mining of the Jabiluka deposits. This has significantly increased the pressure on the traditional owners. I believe many of the traditional owners feel that they need more time and information before they can make a declaration on Jabiluka. On page 16 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> To date Aborigines have had very little-and even then, poor quality-education on these matters. They complain of little or no communication on safety from those organisations responsible for monitoring the physical environment. </PARA>
<PARA>Another worrying factor related to the issue of education is consultation. The report expresses a certain amount of concern on page 45 at the relationship between the Northern Land Council, the umbrella organisations, Gagudju and Kunwinkjku, and the growing number of small unifunctional associations which have sprung up in the area. It is my concern that the Aboriginal people of the Alligator Rivers area are becoming confused at the myriad of organisations, both government and non-government, with which they have to deal. Some of the information from the Northern Territory suggests that the consultation process in some cases is in very real danger of breaking down. I urge the Minister to look into this situation and, if necessary, to do something about it. The report states on page 49:</PARA>
<PARA> Consultation and information flow continue to remain issues of concern. Even the most casual observer is aware of the tremendous pressures placed on individuals summoned to meetings convened in the name of consultation. </PARA>
<PARA>I endorse the view expressed by my colleague Senator Robertson that consultation needs to be something real and not a token exercise. Another area of concern is alcohol, which continues to be a major problem. The figure for alcohol-related arrests at Jabiru during the period of the report was an extremely high 211 in an area where the local Aboriginal population rarely exceeds 40. In the month of May alone there were three alcohol-related deaths among Aboriginals in the region. The report states that it is important that the project locate a full time staff member with a close watching brief on the Jabiru situation. I hope that the Minister has noted that the report states that the new proposal is impossible within existing staff resources. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to employment and training, I have noted in earlier reports that the uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers area has brought almost no benefit to Aboriginal communities. This report points out that a working party to examine the question of Aboriginal employment in the mining industry with representatives from various government departments, the Northern Land Council and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies has been establshed. I wish this working party well and I hope that it can suggest measures to effect an increase in Aboriginal employment in the mining industry. However, no progress in this area has yet occurred. The Minister promises to tell us more on this when he tables the next Institute report. </PARA>
<PARA> The report does have some progress to report in the solution of other matters of concern to Aboriginals emphasised in earlier reports. The issues of entry on to Aboriginal land and use of roads on Aboriginal land have become less contentious. I would like to commend the hard work carried out by the Uranium Impact Project Steering Committee team in preparing these reports. It does a very complex job with limited resources. I urge the Minister to take note of the numerous references throughout the report to important work that cannot be done because of limited staff resources. The Minister, on page 8 of his own statement , suggests that it is up to the Institute to undertake further reviews and further projects if it wants to do so. I am pleased to see that he would accord it that flexibility. However, if resources are unavailable the work cannot be done. I draw the Minister's attention to that truism. </PARA>
<PARA> The report states on page 17 that without additional funds provided by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Australian Institute of Criminology the project would not have been able to fulfil as much of its brief as it needs to. The report expresses its concern that few of the recommendations which have been made by various social impact reports have taken up. Despite the assurances in the Minister's speech that recommendations not implemented are under consideration, I am concerned that the recommendations of the social impact statement should not be ignored by the Government. I am not at all confident that all is well in what has become known as the uranium province. I urge the Minister to ensure that the rights of Aboriginal people in this area are protected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report draws attention, as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) has said, to the apparent insufficiency of information and education for Aboriginals on safety connected with uranium projects. However, in the statement the Minister has incorporated in Hansard we find mainly good intentions. On page 2 particularly we find paragraph after paragraph of good intentions. I am certainly not against good intentions. However, there seems to be in the statement very little regard to the need to breach cultural differences and to provide that information within the framework of the Aboriginal communities themselves, rather than to use methods appropriate to our more formal educational system. In this context I think that the inadequacy of the adult education facilities described in the report surely must be of great concern. The Minister mentioned that it is planned, after a considerable time, again to appoint an adult educator to Oenpelli. However, he did not comment on the report's suggestion about the appointment of a specialist educator in radiation and other mining impact problems. I hope that at some stage the Minister will make some comments on that . Neither does he refer to the suggestion on page 18 about a community-based radio station at Oenpelli.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The importance that the Australian Democrats place on such education in an informal, sensitive and continuous way, I believe, is borne out by the report's discussion of possible excessive amounts of information being imposed on Aboriginal communities and individuals. The Minister responded to that by making a statement that the Northern Land Council and the Northern Territory Chief Minister's office will research this problem. This seems to ignore the fact that there are already in the Northern Territory people and institutions with long years of experience in building positive relationships with Aboriginal people. I point to such agencies as those operated by the Uniting Church which surely could assist and could be immediately put to work in this process suggested by the report. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I believe that this point is linked with the need for appropriate induction processes for mining company employees, as is stressed in the report. To the extent that there is a shortage of people who can do this with the requisite sensitivity and knowledge, what does the Minister propose-there do not seem to be any comments on this-might be done to train more adult educators of the calibre and skill required? In other areas of this statement the Minister is able to say only that discussions are continuing, for example, on improvements to housing and banking facilities. Similar trends emerge-when he responds to specific recommendations of the Committee in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> Induction programs are being examined . . . Language courses are under consideration . . . Increased Aboriginal involvement in decisions affecting their land are currently being examined. </PARA>
<PARA>So it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendation that there should be a systematic comparison review of the various agreements between mining companies and Aboriginal groups receives not even token support. The Minister says that he cannot imagine the purpose of such action or who could do it. To us the purpose seems eminently clear. Mining companies are in a position to retain highly trained and expensive lawyers. It is simply a matter of equalising resources, surely, and if the Department is serious about its responsibilities to Aboriginal people one would expect a little more than a vague reference to the Northern Land Council in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The treatment of the next recommendation is even more offhand. The response is that the maintenance of a cultural heritage can be left to the Aboriginal people who are already doing it. I do not accept that that is a statement that the Minister really would support, given the types of things that he has said here in the past. Aboriginal culture and customs are under serious and continued threat from the relentless pressure that has been put on them by the white community; that is, the economic, social and legal systems of the majority culture. It seems that the battle of the Aboriginal people to preserve their own heritage before it is lost is something for which the white community also must have an intimate concern and that it must seek to provide safeguards and assistance to allow the Aboriginal people to have a fighting chance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is certainly correct in saying that mining has provided the Aboriginal people with the financial resources which might give them a degree of independence from government funding and presence. We certainly hope that may be the case. However, an off-handed proposition seems to have been put that this should be coupled in some way with our willingness to withdraw. Certainly, we ought to have a willingness to withdraw, but in a way which gives the Aboriginal people a reasonable chance to establish their independence and their culture in a continuing and progressive manner. We hope that, in subsequent statements on these reports-we certainly commend the Minister and the Government for their previous initiatives in this regard and for the fact that we do have such reports-the recommendations may be treated in a more in-depth fashion and that we may, indeed, have more time in which to debate what is a very serious matter. I am sure that the Minister shares our wish that that will take place. Because the Government wishes to bring on some business now, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the following matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Education and the Arts:</PARA>
<PARA> The development and implementation of a co-ordinated language policy for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I regard this reference as important to the current and continuing pattern of decisions of this Parliament and the reference is of very considerable national significance. There has never before been such a unifying inquiry into national language policy, nor has there been such a study of Australia as a multicultural society. The Senate Committee on Education and the Arts is, I believe, particularly well placed now to undertake it. Whilst the particular words of the motion precisely describe the reference to be directed to the Committee, there is merit also in indicating some of the aspects that may be involved in this inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> Without committing the Committee to these exact terms I envisage the reference may include the following ten aspects: (a) All aspects of, including guidelines for, a national language policy; (b) the role of English as a first and second language and its relationship to other languages in Australia; (c) the present use of languages in Australia including use in the community, in the media- including newspapers, ethnic radio and multicultural television-and in the arts and to extend equality of access to services and to the institutions of Australian society; and (d) the particular requirements arising from the community and educational use of Aboriginal languages. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to have the remainder of my speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The remainder of the speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the current state of, and trends in, language teaching and learning in primary and secondary schools, tertiary education and other formal and informal programs in the community;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) the extent to which existing policies, practices, attitudes, resource allocations and programs are adequate to provide for the appropriate development of Australia's language resources;</PARA>
<PARA> (g) the language requirements in Australia necessary for trade, diplomacy, defence, tourism and cultural exchange especially taking into account Australia' s regional and other international relationships;</PARA>
<PARA> (h) the special language needs of the deaf and other persons with disabilities;</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the ways and means of stimulating continuing public awareness of and interest in the development of Australia's language resources;</PARA>
<PARA> (j) arrangements for the on-going implementation of a national language policy including the identification of priorities and the allocation of resources. </PARA>
<PARA> By setting out these points it is my intention to provide some clarification of what is intended by this reference. In particular, I hope this will allow interested groups in the Australian public to have a substantial period to begin any preparations of their own which they may see helpful towards developing submissions eventually to be given to the Committee once the conduct of the inquiry is underway. </PARA>
<PARA> I want also to add that it is not at this stage possible to indicate when advertisements could be placed in newspapers calling for submissions but these advertisements will not appear before June or July this year. Nor is it envisaged that public hearings could begin until the final quarter of this year. The Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts is at present fully engaged in its enquiry into 'Tenure of employment of Academics in Australian Universities and Colleges', and for this reason the Committee will not be able to add to the indications which I am able to make in these introductory remarks. Accordingly any question directed to the Committee over the next three months will be met simply by the circulation of general remarks such as I am now making here in the Senate. It will only be when this reference is publicly advertised in newspapers that the particular definitions of the inquiry will be confirmed and on that basis public submissions would then be called. </PARA>

<PARA> That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Grimes moving a motion concerning the posting of leaflets by the Department of Social Security on behalf of the Victorian Government for election purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>I do this because today, and in the last two days, the Department of Social Security in sending out pension cheques to pensioners in Victoria has enclosed a document entitled 'Benefits for pensioners from the Victorian Goverment'. The content of this document is written as a message to Victoria's pensioners and is signed Lindsay Thompson, the Premier and Treasurer of Victoria. It continues to give a list of what is purported to be the benefits available to pensioners in Victoria from the Victorian Government. It advises them to seek further information from another pamphlet. I do not wish to canvass the matter. I believe that this is a serious breach of normal proprieties before election time and I believe that the Senate should debate this matter. Therefore, I move that Standing Orders be suspended so that we can properly discuss the matter and so that I can put my case and the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) can , in fact, reply. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This places the Australian Democrats in a difficult position. Senator Grimes came to me earlier in the day alleging that 100,000 or thereabouts pieces of paper had been printed and produced by the Victorian Department of Community Welfare Services and that they had been enclosed with pension cheques mailed out by the Federal Department of Social Security presumably last night. Senator Grimes and Senator Button did not have a copy of the paper. The piece of paper purported to indicate to Victorian pensioners the various benefits available to them from the Victorian Department of Community Welfare Services. On that information, which is totally hearsay to me-I am the only member of my party who has been spoken to about it to my knowledge-prima facie it is a very serious case. The mail of the Commonwealth, and the facilities of the Commonwealth Government Department, have been used for blatant electioneering in a State election; I am saying that prima facie that is the case.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Chaney's staff understood that Senator Grimes was to have moved for the suspension of Standing Orders at 8 o'clock. I immediately asked my colleagues to come into the chamber to hear the debate. I asked the Democrat Whip, Senator Macklin, to confer with the Australian Labor Party Whip, Senator Robertson, who stated he knew nothing about when the proposal was coming forward. Senator Macklin said to me: 'This sounds an interesting proposition. Would it not be better to get the papers out of the way at 8.26 and have a debate on it then?' The two Whips, Senator Robertson and Senator Macklin, were in the process of walking out of the chamber to discuss this matter in Senator Robertson's office when Senator Grimes came to the table and moved for the suspension of Standing Orders.

What has happened, in fact, is that I have moved for the suspension of Standing Orders, as Senator Chaney says, because this is a matter of urgency and because this is a matter that needs to be dealt with tonight. Firstly, it is a matter of urgency because it happened only in the last day or so and it was drawn to the attention of members of this Parliament only today. Secondly, it needs to be dealt with tonight because, as Senator Missen and his colleagues know, the Parliament rises tonight and does not meet for three weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is necessary to deal with the matter tonight because after tonight we will not have the opportunity. Of course, I realise that I can rise, if this motion is defeated, on the adjournment tonight to air the matter. But I believe it is an issue of such importance that the Senate should debate it now. Senator Chaney is the one honourable senator in this chamber who objects to people raising matters at what he calls the dead of night; in other words, on the adjournment. I am trying to bring the matter on for debate at 8 o'clock because that is a reasonable hour when we can have a rational debate. I believe that I have given a prima facie case that in fact that document did go out and was distributed by the Department of Social Security. Therefore, it is necessary to debate it now.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats take the opportunity of the presentation of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation annual report for 1980-81 to look with some jaundice at the Government's apparent withdrawal, as demonstrated in this report, from research into renewable energy resources, especially solar and wind power. One has to read well into this report to find out that what I say is the case. In the early part of the report soothing generalities indicate that all is well. Renewable energy resources will get their share of attention, funding and staff. For instance, on page 30 it is stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A working party's study has led to the identification of six areas of energy research appropriate to an expanded CSIRO effort in accord with the high priority afforded by the Executive to this aspect of its activities. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the six areas is renewable energy. From there I turn to page 33 of the report where again I find a list of renewable energy areas which are broad goals for CSIRO, including solar conversion, solar energy research, solar engineering units, solar energy storage, wind energy, and renewable energy resources engineering. So far so good. As one gets deeper and deeper into this document one finds the picture beginning to change. At page 110 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> That the overall level of activity in energy R &amp; D by CSIRO should certainly be maintained, and, if possible, increased, perhaps by internal redeployment of resources. </PARA>
<PARA>Turning to page 114 of the report, what do we find? We find this bald statement:</PARA>
<PARA> Under the heading 'Wind Energy', the Committee concluded that CSIRO's resources could be more effectively deployed elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA>The Executive of CSIRO agrees. A little further on, on page 115, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Under the heading 'Solar Energy', the Committee concluded that resources presently devoted to large-scale solar engineering, photochemical solar energy storage and low energy greenhouses could now be deployed more appropriately on other energy programs. The Executive agrees. </PARA>
<PARA>We have a change of statement which we find most peculiar. What is happening? The Executive of CSIRO has apparently decided that its Organisation no longer needs to concern itself with renewable energy research. In the light or darkness of the present energy crisis in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, and the predicted energy crisis in Victoria, this seems to us to be an extremely foolish decision. </PARA>
<PARA> What is now happening in CSIRO with regard to renewable energy research? My understanding is that most solar and wind energy research was carried out in the division of mechanical engineering. This was closed down on 1 September 1981 and a new division of energy technology was created. This new division does work similar to that done by the division of mechanical engineering except that now almost no work is done on solar energy, wind energy or biomass. The one person who worked full time on wind energy in the old division was told that he would be working full time on fossil fuel research in the new division. This was until the leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) in the other place put questions on the Notice Paper regarding renewable energy research in CSIRO. I understand that the person in CSIRO was told that he would be able to spend 25 per cent of his time on wind energy research. That is not much time but it is enough for Mr Hayden to be truthfully answered that someone is still working on wind energy research. That represents one quarter of a person. </PARA>
<PARA> This can be contrasted to a world scene in which solar and wind generators in the megawatt range have been operating successfully for some years in Europe, the United States of America and Japan. It is now estimated that the United States gets 7 per cent of all its energy needs from renewable resources, mostly from government-encouraged and subsidised passive solar heating facilities in homes and other buildings. The Southern California Edison company, one of the major electrical generating companies in the United States, and private enterprise, has dedicated itself to providing one third of its future additional generating capacity from renewable means. Its first major solar power station- Solar One-is now complete and ready to contribute not minuscule amounts of power but ten megawatts to the state grid. It uses 1800 mirrors to concentrate the sun 's rays on a boiler, the resulting steam being used to power conventional turbines. </PARA>
<PARA> Hawaii plans to generate 9 per cent of its total electricity needs from wind power by 1985 and is engaged in a wind farm project in which 20 machines will not provide minuscule amounts of power but 80 megawatts of power. That is almost half of what is proposed for the new billion dollar dam in South West Tasmania. These things are going on throughout the world. This is an established technology and instead of advancing within it we are retreating from it. In Australia, one of the world's most favourable locations for solar and wind power , we are persisting in a Rip van Winkle mentality in which our government and scientists at the policy level-because of stress at the policy level; other scientists are keen enough-seem determined to live in the past. No doubt this is an attitude which makes it possible for them to indulge in the comfortable state of learning nothing, considering nothing, and doing nothing. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to raise a matter about which I have spoken before in the Senate. It is relevant as the next Budget is being considered. I want to make clear my view that there should be only one body in Australia responsible for the distribution of funds to arts bodies. That body is the Australia Council. As it states in its annual report, there are areas in the arts over which it has no control. The overall funding for the arts is a right and proper decision for the Federal Government but the method of distribution should be left to the Australia Council. It is not a job for Cabinet or the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The report makes it clear that it is not true to say that there was no increase in funding for the arts this financial year. In fact there has been an 11.2 per cent increase over the 1980-81 figure. These funds are being given in a rather eccentric fashion. There has been a 35 per cent increase in funding to the Australian National Gallery, a 10.3 per cent increase to the National Institute of Dramatic Arts, a 10 per cent increase to the Elizabethan Trust orchestras, the Australian Ballet and the Australian Opera and a 4.8 per cent increase to the Australian Film and Television School. These increases are offset by the fact that there has been no increase in the funds available to the Australia Council for general support for the arts, funds that go to most arts bodies in Australia. Worse still, because the cost of administration of the Australia Council, due to salary rises, rose by 10 per cent this year over last year it now amounts to $4.3m-the amount available for distribution to arts bodies has decreased in money terms, even allowing for the $800,000 supplementary grant made late last year. Of course this has created very real problems for most arts bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> What I think is disturbing in the arts community is the way in which particular bodies, the opera, ballet and trust orchestras, are singled out for direct funding by Cabinet-they get a substantial increase to keep pace with inflation- while all the other arts bodies get a sharp decrease in real terms. These individual votes are ultimately decided by Cabinet. I do not think this is an acceptable version of the arm's length system of administering the arts which is supposed to have been adopted here as well as in other countries. In my view the Government should decide the total amount available for the arts and leave it to the Australia Council-a body of experts set up for the purpose of developing policy-to decide the actual distribution of grants between the many competing applicants. This I think is essential. Cabinet neither is qualified to nor has it the time to make these grants. Worse still, it is terrible politics. People in ministerial positions tend to fancy themselves as latter-day Medicis, but making arts grants is very unrewarding politically. For every friend that one makes with a grant one makes 10 enemies among these people who did not get a grant but thought that they ought to have. It is important both for political reasons and for the proper administration of the arts that the Government should delegate to the Australia Council the full responsibility for distributing the funds made available to it by the Government. It will make the decisions and it will take any resentment from the arts community. That is a proper role for it. It is qualified for it and that is how we should leave it. The decision should be made by those having specialist knowledge of the art forms. That is the platform of the Liberal Party and it is a policy I think we should adhere to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australia Council 1981 annual report is about six months late. Perhaps the Government could explain to the Parliament why it is late. The report again reflects the difficulties that the Council has encountered in trying to maintain and develop its activities in the context of shrinking government support. On page 9 the report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Council, like many other organisations in the current economic climate, is under pressure. It is facing increasing difficulty in supporting the many valuable and exciting initiatives brought before it, ranging from assistance for larger organisations to direct grants to individuals. The practical effects of financial stringencies have been visible in, for example, the awarding of fewer literary fellowships-down from 76 . . . in 1976-77 to 49 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In real terms the Australia Council's funding has declined significantly over the last 6 1/2 years of the Fraser Government. That decline has been evident in all areas of the activity of the Australia Council. It has been evident also in the funding available to the Australian Opera, the Australian Ballet and the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust orchestras although, of course, I express the view that I think Senator Hamer was expressing when I came into the chamber that allocations to these organisations ought to be carried out by the Australia Council just as allocations to all other arts organisations and individuals are made. </PARA>
<PARA> During 1980-81 cuts in funding precipitated a crisis in the performing arts in Australia. The Council was forced to make an unpalatable choice of either allowing the erosion of support to individual artists to continue or to cut funding for the performing arts. It chose the latter and funds for a wide range of performing companies were cut. The Government knows what the effects of this action were. For a time it seemed that several theatre companies would close. Australian actors, writers and performers mobilised. Rallies were held around Australia on a day called Stage Crisis Day and a delegation of prominent Australian actors and writers came to Canberra to lobby with Government members for their case. It is a case which the Australian Labor Party believes is wholly justified. </PARA>
<PARA> As this annual report points out on page 9, Commonwealth Government support through the Australia Council represents only 20 per cent on average of the income of arts organisations. I think it ought to be stressed that artists and performing companies are not asking for handouts from government. They are seeking a level of subsidy which allows their entrepreneurial, economically productive activities to go on. Certainly, those involved in, for example, resource development or manufacturing industry or agriculture are not shy about asking for subsidies. They are not shy about asking for taxation concessions or infrastructure assistance. The Government has not been reluctant to grant assistance to these forms of economic activity. The arts, however, have an even stronger claim on public funds because of their contribution to the individual and commercial development of the nation, to our national image abroad and, of course, to the creation of employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, after the lobbying exercises by arts workers the Government made an additional allocation available to the Australia Council. The Government granted it an additional $809,000 late last year. However, it ought to be pointed out that $500,000 of the additional allocation was earmarked to reinforce the challenge grant scheme under which the Government agreed to grant $1 for every extra $3 raised by arts bodies from private enterprise. What this means, of course, is that unless private enterprise is forthcoming the Federal allocation set aside for matching private donations may not even be spent. It means also that money will go to those companies which are the most successful in raising funds privately rather than to those companies or individuals that have most need of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I put the Government on notice that the Labor Party does not believe that the Commonwealth Government's responsibility for arts funding can be shunted off to private enterprise. It is essential to maintain an adequate level of public subsidy to the arts. The fact that the level of support provided by the current government is inadequate is reflected throughout this report. I make it clear to the Government also that the Labor Party believes-as do some Government senators , particularly Senator Hamer-that all government subsidies for performing art companies should go through the Australia Council. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. While the so-called flagship companies-that is the Australian Opera and the Australian Ballet-provide high standards I point to the great success of other less traditional Australian performing companies such as the Sydney Dance Company or the Flying Fruit Fly Circus. These groups also achieve excellence and international recognition in their fields. They ought to be treated on an equal basis in terms of funding decisions with the opera and the ballet. Of course, in line with this philosophy I should point out that the Labor Party does not support an idea advocated by the current Minister responsible for the arts, the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, Mr Wilson; that is, the formation of a third national company, or flagship, as the Government likes to call it, in the form of a national drama company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Labor Party has reservations about the restructuring of the Australia Council which has been carried out recently. It seems to me that the restructuring will have the effect of centralising the administration, which could lead to-this is where we have reservations-a diminishing of the role of boards. Of course, their role has already been diminished through previous government changes to the Council. The recent reorganisation of the Australia Council was carried out without consultation with the arts community. For that reason alone I think we have to have reservations about its appropriateness. Bearing in mind the Council's statement of purpose on page 4 of its annual report, I believe that it is essential that the arts community be consulted on all major decisions affecting them. Part of the reason for the restructuring is to save money. It is a great shame that decisions such as these have to be made not on the grounds that they would bring benefit to the arts community but simply on the grounds of reducing expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council's report highlights the greater emphasis being placed on international activities and cultural exchange. I believe that most Australians would welcome such a move. I only regret that here again Budget cuts are limiting the Council's effectiveness. On page 13 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The stringent limits imposed by the Government's Overseas Visits Committee on trips abroad by Council representatives-only four visits were approved in 1980- 81-seriously impair the Council's ability to meet its international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA>I draw to the Council's attention a belief held by many artists in the Aboriginal community that their unique contribution to Australian culture is not being fully recognised. For example, I understand that two visiting Bulgarian poets who were guests at the Adelaide Festival recently stated publicly that they would have dearly loved the opportunity to meet Aboriginal writers and musicians while they were in Australia but they were not given the chance. I ask the Australia Council to ensure that the Aboriginal contribution to cultural exchange is not ignored in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Other concerns expressed in the report which deserve comment are the inadequacy of training programs for artists and arts administrators, and concerns about the standards of governance of many Australian arts companies. There is not this evening the time to go into these areas except to say that they are concerns shared by the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I should like to acknowledge the fact that during the period covered by this annual report Professor Geoffrey Blainey finished his four-year term of appointment as the Chairman of the Australia Council. I should like to add my congratulations to Professor Blainey for the contribution he made to arts in Australia. I think the reviews of various activities by the Council which Professor Blainey instigated have been very useful and constructive in making availble to the Council information as to how Council can better pursue its objectives. I also note that during the course of the period covered by this report two outstanding board chairmen retired. I refer to Dr Bob Brissenden, who had been Chairman of the Literature Board, and Brian Sweeney, Chairman of the Theatre Board. I should also like to congratulate those two chairmen on the excellent work they carried out for theatre and literature during the period they were chairmen. It is no coincidence that the activities both of the Theatre board and of the Literature Board during that time have borne fruit in the success of the Australian film industry of which we are all so proud. My time has almost elapsed so I must finish my comments at this point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(Western Australia) (8.41)-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper.</PARA>
<PARA>A good deal of the 10-page statement by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) is devoted to the need for moderation in wage claims in order to prevent inflation soaring, with the consequential damage that it will do to economic growth and employment. We might well ask: 'What economic growth?' I will leave that matter for the present. What ought to be done, and what will be done by a Labor Government sometime within the next 18 months, is that employment and economic growth will be stimulated by more expansion in fiscal and monetary policies. It is true, I believe, that if that were done in isolation, inflation would very likely soar and the Government which resided over those circumstances would probably not survive the next election.</PARA>
<PARA> What a Labor Government will do, and only a Labor Government can do, is reach a national consensus and give leadership for a national consensus on a prices and incomes policy, something which is absolutely essential to stimulating economic growth and therefore reducing unemployment with acceptable rates of inflation. Because a Commonwealth government has almost no coercive power in the area of prices and incomes or social contract, or whatever one likes to call it, necessarily, such a policy rests upon consensus, and to achieve a consensus a government must have moral authority. Moral authority is precisely what this Government does not have and cannot ever have. How, for example, could any government, the Deputy Prime Minister of which still holds a 4 3/4 per cent housing loan, a government in which the Prime Minister's wife and her relatives have public finance at 4 1/2 per cent and a government which only last year established the conditions under which any person with a high off-farm income and a significant farming income may borrow $15,000 for two years, lend $10,000 for one year and receive a $4,500 cash bonus, half of which is free of tax, have any moral authority? Anyone who meets those requirements, and half the Fraser Cabinet meets those requirements, is able to do that through the income equalisation deposit scheme. Such a government, so tarnished by the self- interested actions of its own Ministers, cannot ever hope to have any moral authority.</PARA>
<PARA> The other point upon which I wish to touch briefly is this: The early part of the statement of the Minister is replete, as usual, with lies and wishful thinking about how relatively well the economy is going and how successful the Fraser Government has been in economic management. For example, on page 3 of his statement the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia is on the right track in creating the conditions for reduction in unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>That is patent nonsense. It is, however, consistent with such assertions as the one taken from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Survey , Australia, released in January 1982 which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Since 1978, real GDP has increased at more than twice the average rate for the OECD area as a whole . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Of course in the remainder of that OECD Economic Outlook, No. 30, of December 1981 the statistics actually show that in the 30 months from December 1978 to June 1981, the most recently available statistics, real gross domestic product in Australia increased by 7.1 per cent and in the OECD as a whole by 6 per cent. As I remarked yesterday, even the typical Country Party back bencher should realise that 7.1 is not more than double six. I received a complaint by way of letter today from Mr Stone, the Secretary to the Treasury, regarding the question which was asked on that matter yesterday and subsequent interjections. I do not have time to go into the substance of that matter now. I replied to Mr Stone by letter and I shall be releasing both Mr Stone's letter and my reply in the near future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are considering a motion relating to the ministerial statement on the purchase of HMS Invincible to which Senator Sibraa has moved an amendment to refer a number of matters to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, namely the relevance of an aircraft carrier to Australia's current and perceived strategic environment, the role of an aircraft carrier in the Defence Force structure of Australia and the effects of the purchase of an aircraft carrier on the future defence procurement program . As the thrust of such an amendment is critical of the decision to acquire HMS Invincible and also of the strategic need for it, I will make a few comments, firstly, on the strategic situation; secondly, on the role of an aircraft carrier and HMS Invincible in particular in that role; and, finally, the suitability of the proposal by Senator Sibraa to refer the matter to a joint parliamentary committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have to look at what our strategic requirements are. Too often, we have looked at what other people's strategic requirements are. In our forward defence planning we must look at what are the requirements for Australia. It is clear to me that there are four areas of strategic requirement for this country. The first is that we have a very great interest in the prevention of a global nuclear war. Whether we are a target or not, such a war would destroy civilisation as we know it. It must be our policy to do what we can to deter the outbreak of such a war. That is the justification, and the only justification, for our having joint communication facilities for operations with submarines in the North West Cape and joint facilities in Central Australia. Their role is to deter the outbreak of a global nuclear war and they are justified because it is in Australia's interest that such a war should be deterred. The Defence Force has no relevance to such a task although it might possibly have relevance in the aftermath of such a war. </PARA>
<PARA> The second strategic requirement we have is to defend our sea communications. We are one of the great overseas trading nations of the world. Virtually all our overseas trade is carried in ships and 95 per cent is carried in foreign flagships. We have also a considerable coastal trade. On a ton-mile basis, half our interstate trade is carried by sea in Australian flagships. Although some people manage to do it, I cannot conceive of a global non-nuclear war in which there will be submarine and aircraft attacks on sea communications. That does not seem credible to me. The manifest inability of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation powers to defend the sea communications of the Atlantic makes it quite certain that if such a war broke out it would inevitably escalate into a nuclear war. So I do not see our requirement as being to defend sea communications in a worldwide war in which they are attacked. Nor do I see, even in a limited bilateral war between Australia and some other regional power, that our overseas trade would be seriously threatened because virtually all of it-95 per cent, as I said-is carried in foreign flagships, nearly all of which would be neutral. It would seem a very provocative and unnecessary action by a bilateral enemy of ours to attack neutral shipping. What our enemies would do, I think without doubt, if they had the capability would be to attack our coastal trade and certainly any military convoys we used. With our communications system and our defence needs as such we would have to have a substantial amount of movement by sea of military stores and men. They would be vulnerable to attack in the event of a bilateral war. </PARA>
<PARA> The third strategic requirement that we have is to defend our territorial integrity. We do not want anyone else's territory but we have a right and a determination to defend what we have. Our country is under no immediate or even foreseeable external threat, but we must have in this country the military infrastructure by which we can build up the necessary defence forces in the time scale in which such a threat might arise. That, of course, is the argument for having the Army Reserve and comparable forces in the other services. But I think we should make it quite clear that we have in this country a wonderful strategic shield. While the archipelago of islands to our north is firmly held in friendly hands, there is no possible way in which an invasion of this country could be mounted. So it must be the first objective of our foreign policy and our defence policy to see that that island chain to our north, our strategic shield, remains firmly held in friendly hands. Our Defence Force must be equipped, if necessary, to intervene in those areas. Whether we want to intervene in particular circumstances will depend on those circumstances. But it must be an option available to the Government, otherwise the Defence Force is failing in its duty and its structure. </PARA>
<PARA> I give one example of when the Defence Force, which at the time was structured mainly as a component of allied forces, could not carry out a role it should have been able to carry out. During the period of the Whitlam Government, Australia was still responsible for the defence of Papua New Guinea and its internal security. You may remember, Mr Deputy President, that the island of Bougainville was in a state of near secession. The chiefs of staff at that time were asked whether, if we wished to put a battalion into Bougainville, we could do it. The answer they gave, perfectly properly, was that we had no amphibious assault capability or airborne assault capability. They said that we could put a battalion in but only if the airfield were firmly held in friendly hands. As it turned out, they did not need to put troops into Bougainville but they might have done. We must have a Defence Force that is capable of doing the things Australia might have to do on its own. That must be the guiding light of our Defence Force. That is shifting. I gave an example of where it failed and I will come later to the way in which an aircraft carrier fits into that role. </PARA>
<PARA> The final strategic requirement we have is that we must be able to defend and police our exclusive economic zone. We have declared the area 200 nautical miles around Australia, which is nearly as big as the whole continent of Australia. If we claim it we must be able to police it and, if necessary, deal with anyone who enters it without our permission. This is, at the moment, not a role for the Defence Force although it does assist. Sooner or later-the sooner the better-it will have to be taken over by the Defence Force and done properly. As I said, we must structure our Defence Force so that we are able to do the things we might have to do on our own without United States assistance, in particular. We must also, when looking at major equipments, be prepared to look 20 years ahead because major equipments such as HMS Invincible and the F18s will remain in service well into the next century. We must look ahead. We cannot look backwards . </PARA>
<PARA> How does a carrier fit in with those strategic requirements? Its first role is the defence of shipping and it contributes in two significant ways. The first threat that it might have to counter would probably be a threat from patrol boats firing missiles at our shipping. The carrier, by extending its radius by helicopters or possibly fixed wing aircraft well over the horizon, can probably counter patrol boats before they get into missile firing range. This is a very important defensive part of an operation of this type. Secondly, it is very important in the defence of our shipping against submarines, which, as I said earlier, could comprise our coastal shipping or our military convoys. </PARA>
<PARA> Some rather extraordinary remarks have been made in the Senate about anti- submarine warfare. I will just take a little time to explain how ships are defended against submarine attack. I think in the time scale that we are looking at-20 years ahead-we can reasonably assume that all the submarines which we are trying to counter will be diesel-electric submarines. They use their electric batteries when fully submerged and their diesels, for which they have to put an exhaust and an intake mast above the surface, to recharge their batteries and to give themselves mobility. Their range on batteries alone is extremely limited- only a couple of hundred miles. I do not think there is any likelihood in this time scale that any potential bilateral enemy, which is what I am talking about, is likely to have nuclear-powered submarines. There would be an entirely different problem if that arose. I will not deal with that because I think it is unlikely. </PARA>
<PARA> If one is trying to counter a diesel-electric submarine one has to look at its limitations. Dealing with this type of submarine is extraordinary like dealing with an insurgent war. I sometimes thought that if the Americans had had enough sense in Vietnam to put an experienced, anti-submarine warfare admiral in command of their insurgent operations they would have done a great deal better than they did with the generals they used. The parallels are irresistible. What one must do against diesel-electric submarines is, first of all, hamper their mobility. If one can fly aircraft patrols with radar over the area one will prevent them using diesel; they cannot recharge their batteries. One limits their mobility. If they get into an attack position one wants helicopters with sonar to detect the submarines in depth out from the convoy. Finally, one has ships which also provide sonar protection. All these have weapons too. The ships have the facilities for command and control to co-ordinate all the various elements of the defence against submarine attack. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators can see how the various elements fit in. We use Orions or Trackers to harass the submarines, to restrict their mobility and to ensure that if they attack they do it in a low battery state. They are armed with sonobuoys which are very limited in capability. The development of sonobuoys has gone on more slowly than the development of quietness of submarines, but they have some limited use-they restrict the mobility of the submarine. As a localising device for attack they are almost valueless. They impose this hampering limit on the mobility of the submarine. That is the role of the fixed wing aircraft-whether carrier-based, in the case of HMAS Melbourne, or land-based. The helicopters necessarily have to be based on ships. The four FFGs which we are getting from America-two have arrived, two are under construction-can carry two helicopters each. They do not carry any at the moment. It is not clear yet what type of helicopters they are to be fitted with. Helicopters on escorts or destroyers are much more limited, both because of problems of maintenance and because they might become weather-bound in very heavy weather, than helicopters on a carrier. The role of the HMS Invincible, which could carry 22 or so helicopters, is obviously an enormous addition to the defensive power of this type of group. </PARA>
<PARA> The third type of attack, which I think is highly improbable, would be a sophisticated air attack with high performance aircraft using stand-off weapons. I do not think, in the scenario that I have painted, that is at all likely. If one wants to defend against that type of attack one has to go to something like an American carrier task group with a very large carrier, F14 aircraft with long range missiles, airborne early warning aircraft and electronic warfare aircraft. A carrier task force of that type is enormously powerful in defensive role but such a task force is well beyond our capability. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the point that I made initially: We must structure our defence force around the roles that we might have to perform on our own. That necessarily limits the war in terms of both scale and sophistication. If things are beyond our capability then we will have to rely on allies. Let us optimise our force for the things that we might have to do on our own. I think defence against this type of attack is not a thing which we could possibly cope with on our own. In any case, the Invincible would make a negligible contribution to that, except possibly with its jammers and its missiles. It would not be a significant contributor against that type of highly sophisticated attack. So much for the defence of shipping. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the other area which has received very little attention when people have talked about these ships-the problem of brush fire wars. I cited the possibility of intervention in Bougainville. I believe that in our strategic requirement we must have a capability to put relatively small forces into trouble areas. Normally, one would expect that there would be a request to the government concerned to act in co-operation with people in those areas. A mobile force, moved in fast in a few days, could be of enormous value in preventing troubles developing in our region that might in the long term erode our strategic situation. In the Invincible, which can carry a commando of troops, which has its own helicopters, which, if it is fitted with AV8Bs, will have a tactical strike capability-and in the HMAS Tobruk, which also carries about a commando of troops, vehicles and so on-we have the capability of having a mobile force which could, in my view, provide a very important element of our strategic requirements. It could not be used in that form without other support against highly sophisticated enemies. Probably the most important role of our Defence Force would not be operating in that sort of environment. In all our defence requirements we have to be quite clear about what sort of environment we are talking about. We do not want Rolls Royces to do a job that a Holden could do better. We must optimise our force for the role we think that it will perform. I think for this sort of role we need an Invincible type carrier which could provide a capability which could not be provided in any other way. This could be very significant in the defence of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been a number of objections-firstly, to aircraft carriers in general and, secondly, to the Invincible in particular. I will deal with just a few of these. It is alleged that aircraft carriers are peculiarly vulnerable. I do not know why it is-I think it stems mainly from junior Royal Australian Air Force officers-but it has been a constant theme that aircraft carriers are particularly vulnerable. It was an article of faith among Air Force officers before the Second World War that an aircraft carrier could not possibly survive within range of shore-based bombing attack. One has only to look at the way in which the American Fifth Fleet dominated the Pacific and dominated shore-based Air Forces there to know that that was quite untrue. Just looking at this issue of vulnerability, over 200 aircraft carriers were operated by both sides in the Second World War. In the six years of the Second World War the number sunk by shore-based bombing attack was one-one out of 200 in six years. These were the vessels that, in those days-the same sort of confident statements about their being vulnerable are being said now-we were told could not possibly survive in the face of shore-based bombing attacks. That is one aspect of vulnerability. </PARA>
<PARA> Aircraft carriers have been used in virtually all the wars since the Second World War. As we all know, wars have been going on almost continuously. Although they have provided irreplaceable tactical air power none has been sunk or damaged in the 35 years since the Second World War. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; HMAS Melbourne damaged herself; she was not damaged by the enemy. That is a different problem. Some people may say: 'Ah, but that is referring to old fashioned bombing attacks. What about sea-skimming missiles?' Senator Mason in particular made some quite extraordinary remarks about this problem. Those missiles are obviously a way that a sophisticated, well-equipped enemy would attack shipping. It would use missiles fired from long range-say, 40 or 50 miles-flying about 20 feet above the surface of the water. They are difficult to counter, but they are by no means invulnerable. Defence against that type of attack-as I explain, honourable senators will see where an aircraft carrier fits in-would be, first of all, to push the offensive force-it has to be airborne-out so that the enemy cannot get within launch range. This is possible and is relatively easy if the launch vehicle is a patrol boat. It cannot be done , of course, if the launch vehicle is a submarine. I think that in the environment which I have painted it is most unlikely that potential enemies would be launching this type of missile from submarines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second defence would be by using intercept sets, jammers and decoy launchers to ensure that the missiles launched by the enemy were rendered ineffective. This is what Churchill called the wizzard war. It depends a lot on factors such as how well we know the capabilities of the missiles, how effective our equipment is and how good our co-ordination is. That is where a ship such as the Invincible comes in. All the ships will have intercept sets, jammers and decoy launchers. Tight co-ordination is essential if that defence is to be efficient. That cannot be done from a small ship. It would not have the space or the equipment. At the moment the Australian Navy has no ship that can effectively co-ordinate defence against that type of attack. The Invincible can and does. That deals with the question of vulnerability. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter that has been raised is that the aircraft carrier would not be available and what is the use of having just one. The first thing I should say is that an aircraft carrier, even while being overhauled, never goes beyond 48 hours notice for operations. Secondly, our intelligence would be very bad if we cannot predict the need a long way ahead. It is the job of intelligence forces to see that our forces are readied before the need arises. In the sort of eventualities that I am talking about, particularly in the brushfire war area, our intelligence should certainly be adequate to ensure that the ship is available when and where required. </PARA>
<PARA> The third objection to aircraft carriers-the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden, was very eloquent on this-is that they need a large number of escorts to protect them. Mr Hayden managed, by counting the costs of the escorts, to get the bill for the Invincible up to $2,000m. This is a very perverse way of looking at a naval force. It is like looking at an Army division. It is similar to a proposal to re-equip the artillery and in the costs of the artillery one counts in the costs of the three brigades of infantry which are associated with divisional artillery. A naval task group normally operates a number of ships together. They are collectively offensive and defensive. The carrier adds very considerably to both the offensive and defensive capability of the force. If the aircraft carrier were not there a number of other ships would be required to replace its capability. In some cases it would be quite impossible to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> These more general objection to carriers have also turned into particular objections to the Invincible. I am glad that Senator Evans has come into the chamber because, when checking through the Hansard report, I saw some rather astonishing statements made by him in his earlier discussion on this motion. I wish to deal with them very briefly. I do not think that he quite thoroughly read his brief. Looking at the various objections to the Invincible in particular, the first relates to the cost of the ship. The cost of the ship-it has been quoted to us in pounds sterling and it depends on the exchange rate- looks like being about $300m sail-away. That would be less than the cost of a new FFG frigate from America and substantially less than the cost of such a ship built in Australia. We are getting the Invincible for less than the cost of a newly built frigate. When one considers the capability of the ship-it carries 22 helicopters alone whereas the frigate would carry two-one can see that it is not a high cost; it is a tremendous bargain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said that it was the sail-away cost of the ship. I will come to the cost of the equipment in a moment. I am glad that Senator Evans interjected. It shows that he is paying attention. He made some rather odd remarks-I did not understand his second point-about the range being below our requirements. It is true that the present range of the Invincible for North Atlantic operation is below our staff requirement, but there is no difficulty in carrying an additional 450 tonnes of fuel which will bring it within the staff requirements which we lay down. That would cause a drop of something like half a knot in her speed which, by the way, is 31 knots, not 18 knots as Senator Mason seemed to believe. Senator Evans also said that the sea dart missile system in the Invincible was not inter-operate with Melbourne's old radar systems. I am sorry that he has left the chamber because no one could have possibly assumed that it was supposed to be. There is no way that the Melbourne's radar system would have been working with the sea dart of the Invincible. The Invincible's radar systems , I hasten to say, are perfectly adequate for the control and direction of her missile system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Evans also made some rather odd remarks, which quite honestly I could not understand, about the IFF and navigation aids which were to be fitted in the ship. Having re-read his speech, I do not think that can make any sense at all. He also said that the radars in the Invincible would need changing if she were fitted with Sea Harriers. She is carrying Sea Harriers now and no change of radar is needed to operate those aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point for which the Invincible was criticised was that her accommodation was substandard. Senator Mason said this. As a matter of fact, that could not be more untrue. Her accommodation will be the most luxurious of any warship in the Australian Navy. It was also alleged that the ship was not air conditioned. That is just pure fantasy. It was further said-this is the sort of nonsense that has been said in what I thought was a thoroughly dishonest campaign to denigrate the ship-that her crew was 1,300. In fact it is 900, which is 300 less than the Melbourne. It was said that the ship was not compatible with our existing ships. Operationally there is no difficulty. She is fully compatible with all the other ships. The only ones with which she will not be compatible are the FFGs, which are being built in America, which initially will not be fitted with a data link so that their own internal automatic data system can link into other ships in the fleet. The Invincible will be capable of operating with all the other ships in the Australian Fleet. Those FFGs will be fitted when their American sister ships are so fitted and it will be done in the next year or so. The delay has nothing to do with the requirements of financial stringency. It is solely because the Americans have not yet decided which data link system to fit. When they decide our ships will be fitted. Logistically the ship will have some extra equipments which are not in current service with the Australian Navy. I do not think those will provide any great difficulties logistically. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to refer to the question of whether this is a suitable subject to be considered by a parliamentary committee. Parliament here, under our Westminster system, traditionally does not interfere directly, unlike the American system, in the purchase of equipment. I think that is very much more satisfactory than the American system of parliamentary committees and the Senate making, in effect, equipment decisions because they do not have the information. Let us consider the problem of vulnerability about which people have been talking. Let us take one example-that is, the vulnerability to sea skimming missiles. One would have to know before one could decide whether a ship was vulnerable-there is no way that a parliamentary committee could ever be told this-what the performance and method of homing were, where were the sea skimming missiles, how effective the intercept sets were, how effective the jammers were and how effective the decoy systems were. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no way that a parliamentary committee with the best will in the world, and even if it were fully qualified for the subject, could possibly make useful judgments on such matters. I do not think that anything useful will come out of this proposed referral to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. Not only will nothing useful come out; it will also do active harm. Service morale is a thing about which this Parliament should be very concerned. There were difficulties with the Fleet Air Arm when the question of whether the Melbourne was to be replaced was in the air. The Government has now made a decision to replace the Melbourne, but for it to appear to the servicemen concerned, who have their careers to look to and their futures to consider, that the whole thing has been thrown back in the melting pot, I believe, will do a great disservice to the efficiency of our Defence Force. Therefore, I strongly recommend that this amendment be rejected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak briefly in this debate on behalf of the Government because the Government is deeply concerned by the proposition that the decision which it made recently to go ahead with the purchase of the H.M.S. Invincible should be referred to a parliamentary committee with a view to reopening the whole question and, as Senator Hamer said, perhaps having some effect on the morale of the Royal Australian Navy in relation to such a major equipment purchase which the Government has decided upon. It certainly is a rather new development for it to be proposed to the parliament that matters of this kind, which are very much matters of expert and discussion and in relation to which, of course, a good deal of highly classified information is required to make a decision of this sort, should be brought into the arena of a parliamentary committee. For those reasons the Government believes that this amendment should be rejected by the Senate and hopes that it will be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I would like to raise a few matters although I believe that Senator Hamer, in the valuable contribution that he made, dealt with most of the arguments that were raised against the decision by the Government. The Government, in considering this very important decision, gave very earnest and lengthy consideration to all the arguments that I heard before the decision was announced and have heard since the decision was announced. It was not a decision that the Government took lightly or hastily. Although the matter was decided finally only a few weeks ago, it has been given very close consideration within Government-not just by the present Cabinet-for quite a period. The decision followed years of comprehensive study. In 1980 the Government announced that it would acquire a ship to replace the Melbourne and that, in principle, it would have the sort of capabilities that the Invincible offers. So, the decision to have a sea-borne platform, as it is referred to in general terms, has been included in the long term defence planning of the Government, and the decision to purchase the Invincible was taken simply because the opportunity presented itself to obtain a vessel of this capability and character at a very cheap price . We took advantage of that golden opportunity. I emphasise that the decision was not to have this vessel as anything additional to our defence program. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the matter has been under consideration for some time and our long term defence planning, which we are following, made provision for the acquisition of such a capability. The concern we had was whether we would have been able to afford to purchase equipment of this calibre, size and expense had it not been for the opportunity presented by the British Government to purchase the Invincible at a very low price. Any alternative that we could see in the years ahead as a replacement for the Melbourne would have been purchased at a very high price, which would have been a very considerable addition to our program costs as we are estimating them; whereas the purchase of the Invincible, certainly with some readjustments to costs at an earlier stage than we had perhaps planned, will be possible within the program that has been provided for.</PARA>
<PARA> There have been some suggestions-I think Senator Evans took up this point-that the purchase is contrary to views expressed in the Defence Force capabilities paper of 1981. That view was based upon a misreading of the paper because it simply dealt with priorities for additional capability over and above those that were present and planned for our defence forces. That paper was written on the basis that a new carrier would be acquired and it simply talked about priorities in addition to that. There is nothing inconsistent between that paper and the decision to purchase this carrier. </PARA>
<PARA> The Invincible, of course, is a highly modern, highly sophisticated and highly successful piece of equipment. It is not something which is being built or which has to be proven. It is already in operation and has proved very successful in exercises in which it has been engaged. It was rather surprising that Senator MacGibbon should have said that senior officers of the Navy do not appreciate the vulnerability of capital chips of this kind in a missile age. He suggested that that was the reason that the British Government was selling the Invincible. But, of course, the British Navy is building two sister ships to the Invincible, which it is keeping, and would dearly love to have kept this carrier, as we know . It was only because of other enormous defence expenditures that the British Government decided to assure that this ship ever came on the market at all. It is certainly not for reasons of the kind suggested by Senator MacGibbon that the British Navy and senior naval officers wanted to dispose of the vessel. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, Senator Hamer dealt with most of the arguments that have been presented both while the Cabinet was engaged in making its recent decision and since. All of those matters were given very close consideration by Cabinet in coming to its decision. Few other decisions in which I have participated have engaged the Cabinet in such a lengthy and detailed consideration as this decision. I emphasise the very great attention that was paid to all the arguments before the decision was made. </PARA>
<PARA> The relevance of the maritime power for Australia is obvious. On an average day there are about 195 merchant ships in our ports and about 175 in transit to and from Australia. In fact, I am told that today there are 294 merchant ships in our ports so that gives some indication of what the total number could be on any one day. The passage of these ships to and from Australia is, of course, of vital importance to us as is the passage of vessels on our coastal trade. There is some view that our trade routes need only be protected off our ports as this will be where enemy submarines will be concentrated. In the early stages of conflict the enemy may be expected to concentrate its efforts there. But defences close to Australia should drive the submarines further away and protection will be required at greater distances. With the development of ocean surveillance systems, the submarines problems of intercepting mid-ocean shipping have eased. This factor leads to an increased requirement for mid-ocean protection. That is one of the major reasons for our acquiring this carrier and points to the value of the particular vessel that we have obtained. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, air power is fundamental to maritime operations. But it can be provided both by shore-based and seaborne aircraft. The value of shore-based aircraft to Australia's maritime defence will remain of particular importance for as far ahead as one can see. The carrier will provide the government of the day with additional options, particularly in areas further from our shores and remote from military airfields. As I said, there is this very large overseas shipping component. If we were involved in a conflict we would have to provide protection, probably, for convoys coming to our shores. This is where the particular importance of having a vessel such as the Invincible becomes obvious. When the ship arrives in Australia in 1984 it will be immediately available for operations. It will be capable of operating anti-submarine helicopters and acting as a task group command ship. Six Sea King helicopters which were previously operated from HMAS Melbourne are already available. A further two will be delivered with the ship and an order for a further one is planned. The Invincible will certainly be able to provide a much more effective and economical operation of these helicopters. The Invincible was designed to carry 14 Sea King types but could carry up to 22 aircraft if all deck parking were used. </PARA>
<PARA> The other important aspect of the Invincible is as a command ship. The control of maritime operations, of course, with air, surface and submarine units with a variety of weapons is a complex task. The speed of modern warfare demands fast and accurate command decisions. Destroyers and frigates can carry out some supporting command functions, but they cannot provide the facilities necessary for task group command. Invincible has exactly those facilities. The Invincible carries an area defence missile system capable of contributing to the defence of itself and ships in company with it. This, of course, bears on the question of vulnerability. I do not propose to add anything to the detailed and interesting comments that Senator Hamer has made on this subject. But it is important to emphasise in this regard-when one comes to debate the particular types of defence facilities it has-that the Invincible will be operated as part of a group, the collective defences of which will exceed the individual capabilities of any unit. It is the task group concept of a number of vessels which one has to look at to see what the defences of the whole group are and not just what the defences of one ship in it may be. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested that more ships would be required to provide this protection support, but that is just not true. These ships already exist in the Royal Australian Navy. Their primary purpose is not to defend the carrier but to provide with it the mix of capabilities required for the maritime operations of the kind to which I have referred. The Invincible can embark a battalion group with equipment for a limited period. This troop lift capability provides a useful extension to that in other ships available to the Royal Australian Navy. In peacetime this capability can offer a spin-off in the event of natural disasters when evacuation or assistance on a large scale is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it has been shown clearly that the Invincible has proved herself as a powerful and effective warship. Her capabilities will complement those of existing and planned ships and aircraft. Together with destroyers, frigates, submarines and aircraft such as the F111, the F18 and the P3, the carrier will contribute to a balanced Australian maritime force. Let their be no doubt that the possession of this ship in the Australian Defence Force will be a powerful factor in the perceptions of any future potential enemy in our area and thus an important element in our deterrent posture. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there has been, as I said, a great deal of consideration given to the decision to acquire this vessel. I believe that there has been a very full public explanation by the Government of the reasons why it came to this decision. It is a decision which was made after very lengthy consideration going back years. The decision to have a capability of this kind within the Australian Defence Force has been included in our planning for the future. A golden opportunity has been presented to us with the offer of this vessel at a remarkably low price. We have been able to acquire it without making any major additions to the planning costs in our defence program in the coming years. For all these reasons, the Government believes very strongly that the right decision has been made. Absolutely no good purpose will come from a parliamentary committee reviewing the whole subject as is proposed in this motion. I trust that the Senate will reject it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of Senator Martyr and in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, I present the forty- fifth general report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Public Works. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a tabling statement relating to the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This general report reviews the activity of the Committee during 1981. The report includes a reference to departments improving the standard of their submissions. We have set out in the report some key factors which should be included in the departmental submissions. These include:</PARA>
<PARA> The need for the proposed work;</PARA>
<PARA> the alternative solutions which have been examined prior to the decision to proceed with the work;</PARA>
<PARA> an indication of the priority of the work in relation to other planned works by the Department;</PARA>
<PARA> details of any cost-benefit studies;</PARA>
<PARA> details of any environmental studies;</PARA>
<PARA> information of negotiations or discussions with other departments, state and local authorities, companies, unions and the public in relation to the work. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to environmental factors, the Committee has signalled its intention to more fully examine compliance with the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is frequently advised that proposed works require urgent attention, early completion of the works being necessitated by certain factors. Responsible departments should co-ordinate their planning and resource allocation with a view to giving the Committee sufficient time to publicise its enquiry, for interested groups and organisations to provide submissions and for the Committee to hold public hearings and report to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears to the Committee that the works become urgent because of lack of foresight and a lack of timely commitment in the Government of departmental decision making and administrative/budgeting machinery. </PARA>
<PARA> Also in this general report is a section dealing with the construction of airport works which pre-empted consideration by the Committee. Authorisation and completion of these works without investigation by the Committee was a matter of concern. </PARA>
<PARA> On a brighter note, the Committee observed the adoption of its recommendations in respect to defence housing. Full and regular consultation now appears to be taking place between service families and the Department of Defence, the Department of Administrative Services and the Department of Housing and Construction on the needs and problems of occupants of defence housing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has commented on the Commonwealth's contribution to the National Heritage. The Committee believes the Commonwealth expenditure in designing and constructing new buildings to complement historic buildings or areas should be recognised and that the public should be made aware of the Commonwealth's contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee has drawn to the attention of the Government the need to clarify further the precise definition of a public work as noted in sections 5 and 18 of the Public Works Committee Act. The question of the definition of a public work arose over the proposed construction of an oceanographic research vessel for CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA> 1981 was a busy year for the Committee with 12 reports being presented, and some 54 meetings being held in the year. </PARA>
<PARA> The works examined totalled $207.9 million with works costing $190.45 million being recommended for construction by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The work load on committee members and staff has been heavy, and as Chairman I wish to record my thanks to them. </PARA>
<PARA> During the year, the vice-chairman, Senator Jean Melzer, retired and the Committee wishes her well for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, on behalf of the Committee, I now place on record acknowledgment of the help and assistance received from departments, particularly the Department of Housing and Construction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Whips on both sides for their courtesy in enabling me to speak on this matter. I will almost certainly be in Africa at the conclusion of the Inter-Parliamentary Union meetings and will not, therefore, be able to record my vote or take proper part in the further stage of this Bill. I desire, therefore, to put on record my views on the subject on which I am well known to have held views for many years. I seek leave to take the unusual course of incorporating this speech in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I make it clear that I have for a number of years supported the concept of a fixed term Parliament, originally enunciated by Senator David Hamer in this Parliament and subsequently incorporated in this Bill. I have also expressed a number of criticisms of the terms of the Bill. Two of my three major concerns have now been overcome by the proposed amendments which Senator Evans has announced he is making to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently I believe this Bill, as amended, deserves to be given a second reading by the Senate and I will vote for that second reading if present. Defects in the Bill can be remedied at the Committee stage. If absent I make it clear that I will not be paired in opposition to the second reading. As to decisions that may occur in the Committee stages or on the third reading I am aware of Senator Hamer's attitude to the Bill, which accords with mine, and I leave it to his discretion to determine whether I should be paired in such divisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the general argument which Senator Hamer will be raising in his second reading speech and warmly support his views. I believe the fixed term proposals provide a realistic practical solution to the type of deadlocks and crises that have poisoned the political atmosphere since 1975 and that, if adopted, the issues of Senate powers over supply will fade into insignificance as there would really be no benefit for Oppositions to deny moneys to Governments when such action cannot bring down the Government. Consequently I see the section of the Bill (Clause 8) which seeks to remove the Senate's supply power (or reduce it according to Senator Evan's latest amendment) as quite extraneous to the Bill and most likely to heighten political anomosities, leading to the defeat of a referendum. I believe these provisions were a later embellishment, by the Labor Caucus, on the Evans Bill and trust they can be removed rather than jeopardize the success of this reform. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say that, in any ideal climate, I would cheerfully see the removal of the Senate's ultimate power to refuse supply or defeat money bills. I do not see it as essential to the Senate's real work, as a house of review of legislation and as a powerful investigatory House. It is a weapon altogether too potent and destructive, a blunt instrument which may be used at any time by the politically ambitious-usually residing in the House of Representatives. I do not regard the use of this weapon in 1975 as a sign of Senate power but rather of weakness. I well remember the pressure in 1975 came from Opposition leaders in the House of Representatives and those residing in the Senate were overborne by the weight of numbers. The Senate has since suffered much calumny from its use and and only years of positive work by the Senate since 1975 has restored its prestige. </PARA>
<PARA> But unfortunately we do not have an ideal world and we cannot ignore the fact that many political leaders have painted themselves with corners over the controversies of 1975. It is a roadblock on dispassionate constitutional thinking and should be avoided. Moreover various State leaders will readily fear the worst if alteration of Senate powers is suggested. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1975 I have endeavoured to promote widespread discussion of constitutional reforms and to seek concerns across the political barriers. As a patron of the Committee for Constitutional Change I have sought new ideas and solutions to seemingly insoluble constitutional attitudes and I regard Senator Evans Bill as a serious and genuine attempt to provide solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important for us to recognise the haphazard nature of many of our constitutional provisions and the need for early consideration of reform. I do not see, as a practical proposal, any 'new' constitution emerging and I believe that those who attack such proposals are really setting up their own Aunt Sallies just to knock them down. But undoubtedly the division of powers in Australia is not well matched with present national responsibilities and there is an overwhelming case for renewal and amendment of many aspects of our Constitution. It is not a sacred and immutable document and the Australian people should see in the 1977 referendum results an encouraging development in fluidity of opinion. The shame is that the initiative has not since been maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the haphazard aspects of our constitution stands the double dissolution provisions (Section 57) which were used in 1975 to break a deadlock. You will recall the odd circumstance that the new Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser was granted a double dissolution only because there were defeated Bills of the Whitlam Goverment that were made the basis of that dissolution-yet Mr Fraser had not the slightest intention or re-presenting any of those Bills. If they had not been defeated and laid aside, no double dissolution would have occurred and the Senate would not have been required to face the people after bringing down a government. It is clearly an unsatisfactory, random situation calling for change and indeed I have always doubted the constitutionality of the use of those Bills . Recent statements of our High Court have strongly suggested that it might well look into the proper use of a power by the executive (or a Governor-General). As we know, in 1975 the Chief Justice chose to give his personal advice to the Governor-General (a highly dubious course of action) and the crisis of 1975 was not in fact litigated before the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA> In the arguments about 1975, there is usually a simplistic answer delivered by those who applaud the exercise of Senate power over supply-it enabled the people to vote and they rejected the Whitlam Government at the election. Of course it cannot be said that the people voted in 1975 on the basis of the constitutional argument. As one clearly involved in that election I express the firm belief that the people did not vote generally on constitutional arguments but on the basic argument as to which Government would prove to be the better economic manager. </PARA>
<PARA> But leaving that argument aside, I believe that it is no solution to have more elections. Responsible government involves governments being in a position to make responsible and sometime unpalatable decisions. They must often impose restrictions, extra taxation and incur temporary unpopularity because of long term national interests. The case for four year terms of Parliament (instead of three years) is indeed based essentially on the need for security of government and its ability to make more responsible decisions. It is a reform that should also come. Consequently I have always rejected the facile arguments that appeal to the people, the 'Gallop Poll' mentality, are the solution to problems. Governments should have security of tensure (unless they lose support of the majority in the lower House) and this Bill is largely predicated on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA> One other haphazard constitutional provision deserves a mention. The existing Constituion gives no guarantee of continued simultaneous elections of both Houses. It only takes an early election of this Parliament to throw the Houses out of alignment again. It is clear that the people already resent the excessive number of elections in this country, remember that since Federation, we have had an average 2.4 years duration for each Parliament. Recall also that in 1977, while the referndum on simultaneous elections became befogged in the peripheral States and was lost, it enjoyed the support of 62% of the vote over the whole of Australia. If handled more wisely in the earlier stages, it undoubtedly would be the law today. The Evans Bill, as one of its benefits, will secure simultaneous elections of both Houses of Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1975 we, the Politicians of Australia have so far failed to secure constitutional compromises that would have majority support in Australia. We have not been prepared to accept genuine compromises and I am sorry that a Federal Liberal CP Government has not fought harder at a time when it had majorities in both Houses. At the Constitutional Convention meetings, much rhetoric and heat has been wasted on supporting the rival 'Whitlam' and 'Court' proposals for alteration of Senate powers and resolving deadlocks. Neither has a ghostly chance of acceptance at a referendum by a constitutional majority of Australians. The 'Whitlam' proposal denudes the Senate of its power over money bills and immediately raises a coalition of foes. The 'Court' proposal is little better. True is provides an automatic double dissolution on refusal of money bill and is not dependent on fortuitous and dubious 'double dissolution' bills. It also removes the Governor-General's discretion. But it is based on the fallacy that a Government, elected by the people can be brought down at any convenient time (by that, convenient to an Opposition) and that a popular vote solves any problems. There remains a very real possibility that an Opposition, fed by ambition, will again exercise its powers and do a reverse 1975 action. Imagine the absurdity that Mr Hayden, using his Senate members, might deny supply to the Government, be offered a commission as Prime Minister and then use the Fraser Government's defeated bills as a basis for a double dissolution. A practical solution must be found to avoid continued crises that might ultimately destroy democracy in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans' Bill therefore requires serious consideration by the Senate and the Parliament generally to see if it can provide an acceptable practical solution. One major effect of his fixed terms proposal is to remove a Prime Minister's extra power to call for early elections with all the insecurity and economic disruption that it involves. Many times we have seen business, organisations and people generally unable to make decisions over 9 months or so because of the possible use of this tactic. It is not one that the USA has to fear. It is not inherent in responsible government that Prime Ministers enjoy such a power and it would be for the real economic growth of this country that such tactics be brought to an end. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Austin Lewis has contributed to this debate with a paper which sets out arguments against the fixed terms proposals. I give him credit for a thoughtful examination and explanation of his opposition. But I reject his view that the proposals removes 'an essential element of responsible government' or that under the Bill 'a weak and debilitated government could be kept in office till the end of its appointed term, unable to carry out its major policies, and unable to resolve the situation'. The problems of dissident Government MP's changing a Government without recourse to the people occur under the present system, for example Gorton's replacement by McMahon was not confirmed by a vote of the people. The problems Senator Lewis sees can well occur now but there is no inherent right of Governments to enjoy the tactical weapons they enjoy today any more than Senate Opposition should be able to bring down Governments without being responsible to the people, as they can do today. </PARA>
<PARA> The arguments raised by Senator Lewis and the Attorney General Senator Durack against the fixed term proposal are hypothetical and unreal but they will be dealt with in more detail by Senator Hamer. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the terms of the Bill I say that there were indeed defects in Senator Evans' original Bill and in part they are overcome. His original proposal, somewhat complex, to restore the fixed dates after an extraordinary House of Representatives election would have robbed the fixed term of much of its validity and enabled Governments to connive in reducing Senate terms. The new proposal, which means that after an extraordinary House of Representatives election, the new Parliament will only serve out the balance of the fixed term is much better. It will discourage 'adventures' in the House of Representatives and discourage dissident groups from forcing earlier elections thus making for stability. Senator Evans' second change, the removal of the provision for a joint sitting of the Houses as an alternative for a double dissolution is welcomed. With large majorities in the House of Representatives and little or no majorities in the Senate (due to proportionate representation) the House of Representatives would always win. </PARA>
<PARA> The third variation of the Evans Bill is less happy. He now proposes to import a distinction in respect to 'major Bills', whatever that may mean and reserve the Senate's power over them only. I have not seen the drafted proposals and reserve final comment. However, I cannot see how this distinction could be sustained. Who would decide which bills were 'indispensible to a Government's capacity to govern', the Opposition or the Government? One must await the form of the amendments but one cannot but ask whether a proposal should be endangered by the overlay of such a complex and probably unnecessary provision. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust that Government Senators will give careful attention to this Bill, putting aside the rhetoric, the 'excursions and alarums' and seeing whether it may indeed provide a real and practical remedy for the problems which at present add uncertainty and danger to our Constitutional position. </PARA>

That would, of course, involve serious risks to this country. Our participation in that greater effort would make us a nuclear target, if we are not already.

Other people say we ought to support our major ally in such desperate circumstances for the United States, the world and, indeed, ourselves. I submit that that debate, no matter how worthy it is, has nothing whatsoever to do with the rights and wrongs of this motion. I must stress that the Australian Democrats do not see this motion as any kind of paranoid attack against the United States, as anti-United States feeling or anything of that kind. I renounce in advance any cliches we may hear later in this debate to that effect. This really comes down to a matter of sovereignty, a matter of Australia's own right to do what it wants to do and our own responsibilities as a democratic sovereign country to decide our own affairs . </PARA>
<PARA> It is for that reason that I have suggested in the motion that the Senate might quote as its opinion that this question of nuclear arms should be written into the agreement, which is not the case now. The only guarantee, such as we have, is, I understand, a verbal agreement between the Minister for Foreign Affairs ( Mr Street) and the American Secretary of State, Mr Haig. We are given to understand that this is recorded in the form of an unsigned minute which was shown to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden). The Australian Democrats do not believe that this is sufficient and that there is no reason in the world why this very important, indeed this crucial and basic, question of the upgrading of role to nuclear weapons should not be included in a reasonable formal agreement with another country. I cannot see any reason why there should be any objection to it from that other country. Surely our citizens would applaud that. </PARA>
<PARA> We must look at what might or might not happen in war. That simply cannot be forecast. We have no way of assessing the circumstances in which it might happen and it is pointless and futile to try to predict them. We in this country, as in the other democracies, elect a government with certain policies to make those decisions for us. While the Australian people continue to elect governments which support the United States alliance, this question of upgrading of role must fairly be a responsibility of government. However, we do not have elected governments so that other powers, even the most friendly ones, can operate within our territory independently of our government in such important regards. We believe that it is essential that this whole question of upgrading of nuclear weapons should be a matter of government decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the motion seeks to secure amendment of article VII of the agreement to require approval by the Australian Government of developments affecting the staging operations rather than consultations on such developments. To clarify that I will read article VII of the agreement. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Arrangements shall be made for consultations to ensure that the Government of Australia has full and timely information about strategic and operational developments relevant to B52 staging operations through Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe, and the Australian Democrats believe, that it is most important that this should be clarified. It is a matter of concern in basic relationships between small and large partners that there should be a liberal and just series of terms-as just terms as possible-from the larger partner to the smaller partner. This would certainly relieve the fears of many people about the B52 matter and improve United States-Australian relationships. I believe that it would have an important value in that latter regard also. It is a fact that during the intervening months since I gave notice of this motion the world has moved gradually towards a more perilous situation. There is a new policy in the United States. Many people in that country, including Senator Kennedy and Senator Tsongas, are speaking outrightly about this. These people are not on the left wing fringes; they are responsible senators of the Republican and Democrat parties in the United States. They, themselves, are seriously concerned about the prospects of nuclear war. All I say is that the Australian Democrats believe that the situation has not improved with regard to this agreement since the time I originally gave notice of this motion. To the contrary, it is fairly obvious that the risks of nuclear war or nuclear engagement are much greater than they were previously. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter dealt with in the motion is the review of Article 2 to secure the location of the B52 aircraft and their support aircraft away from Darwin to a location well removed from major population centres of Australia. As honourable senators who have been in Darwin would know Darwin Airport, which is also a defence airfield, is virtually a part of the city. It is also a considerable distance from the Indian Ocean, which is the indicated area of surveillance for the B52 flights. This seems something of a mystery to us. We would have thought that if surveillance of the Indian Ocean were the whole purpose of this operation it would be a very good thing if the aircraft could have been located somewhere closer. Perhaps some co-operation between the United States Government and the Australian Government would have expedited that. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested that there would seem to be good reason for the revival and upgrading of the existing Royal Australian Air Force base at Learmonth in Western Australia for that purpose. I have never heard from the Government-I do not think any of us have-why that base was not considered, the reasons against it. Last year I met a number of United States congressmen familiar with the B52 situation. They were rather interested in this matter too. They said as far as they knew Learmonth had never been considered. Some of those congressmen and senators were on the relevant committees. I would have thought that our Government may have at least gone to the United States Government and said: 'We are going to have the B52s. It would be a very good idea to have them much closer to the area we want to keep under surveillance. We have this mothballed airfield at Learmonth which could be upgraded, perhaps with some financial assistance from the United States'. That would have had the effect of giving Australia a much better and much more powerful potential defence situation in the west where we need it. After all, that is where I would have thought a defensive strike into the Indian Ocean would have been most beneficially placed- at Learmonth, not at Darwin. I will be interested to hear from the Government, if Government senators take any part at all in this debate, the reasons against that choice because it would seem to be an excellent idea. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has made the point repeatedly that our co-operation with the United States in the Indian Ocean is a very important consideration for the United States. I can see that in a way it could be a very important consideration for us but I wonder whether the Prime Minister's view of the United States image of that situation is illusory. I refer to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies Washington Paper for 1981, Paper 87: Geopolitics and Maritime Power, which I recently scanned. In chapter 2 'The Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf' Australia scarcely rates a mention. There is one reference only on page 27 where an international force for the Persian Gulf, specifically in Turkey, is discussed. There is this single reference:</PARA>
<PARA> Britain has contributed a token force and Australia could also help. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a fairly authoritative American study background paper. That is the only comment made on Australia's position. That of course might change with this agreement. Our degree of concern is that this agreement, like all such things, tends to be sanctified by the passing of time. That is the last major point I would like to make on this matter. When these matters are left, time passes and it becomes more and more difficult to amend or adjust them in the way they should be adjusted. That is our degree of concern with this agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I reiterate that to the Democrats this is not a matter of global politics, not a matter of one's view of global war and not a matter of bias towards any zonal area-whether it be the United States or the Soviet Union-but purely a matter of Australia's right to decide its own affairs and the reasonable courtesy that we feel should be extended to Australia by one of our neighbours and a friend. I think one should expect from a friend courtesy, consideration and an agreement which can be read as meaning something but not containing matters such as Article (VII), which I will read again. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Arrangements shall be made for consultations to ensure that the Government of Australia has full and timely information about strategic and operational developments relevant to B-52 staging operations through Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>We suggest that this is not enough. There is at least a case for the Senate making a statement on this matter. All we are asking for is that it be stated that in the opinion of the Senate this agreement should be renegotiated. We feel that there is a clear case for that. I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) That the following matters be referred to the Standing Committee on National Resources:</PARA>
<PARA> Animal welfare in Australia in relation to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Interstate and overseas commerce in animals; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) codes of practice of animal husbandry for all species. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That the following matters be referred to the Standing Committee on Science and the Environment:</PARA>
<PARA> Animal welfare in Australia in relation to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) wildlife protection and harvesting;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) animal experimentation; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the use of animals in sport. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask leave of the Senate to incorporate my speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> In introducing this measure, the Democrats are taking the initiative to develop safeguards and guidelines for the treatment of animals of all species found on the Australian continent on which the human race has an effect, both the relationship for economic gain or entertainment. </PARA>
<PARA> All commercial animals and pets would fit into this category, and also those animals upon which humans by virtue of their actions, have a significant effect including wildlife species. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been our policy to extend care and concern to animals in a meaningful form and we have an animal rights policy balloted and approved by our members which says in the preamble:</PARA>
<PARA> 'While man is, or should be, responsible for the welfare of all life on the planet, he is himself both part of that life and dependent on it for his survival. He shares with other higher animals both consciousness and sensitivity to pain. A difference in species does not, any more than a difference in race, justify a limitation to this respect for other animals, or his concern about the responsiveness to their suffering. Animals do not have a vote, but concerned people do. The Democrats must present strongly and clearly and advanced and enlightened policy on animal welfare'. </PARA>
<PARA> Now as a positive step to put that principle into effect, this motion will see a select committee appointed which will look into all aspects of animal welfare and where it finds deficiencies will recommend the means needed to overcome them . </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that uniformity be applied to Animal Welfare, across the nation and that response to pressure groups be balanced and not just an ad hoc reaction to a particular situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that all areas of animal lives are included. The Select Committee will be expected to inquire into all areas where animal treatment has become almost traditional because of the time which the treatment or procedures has been practised. It is essential that unnecessary suffering of animals be prevented. </PARA>
<PARA> We feel sure that most commercial animal breeders have an affectionate regard for the animals under their care and would cooperate with reasonable controls and suggestions to reduce stress or pain inflicted on their animals. Many will welcome help in identifying procedures which can be moderated or changed to the advantage of their animals. Particularly as they realise that the Select Committee is giving an evenhanded view balancing the requests from Animal Liberationists where necessary, with the practical considerations of animal husbandry. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular references listed in the motion ensure that the inquiry will cover most important areas of animal concern in particular:</PARA>
<PARA>(A) Overseas and interstate trade and commerce in animals: Transportation of stock animals in Australia is a seriously neglected area of animal welfare (any farmer will tell you how the cattle arrive with tails badly damaged from friction against the back of a truck, permanent sores forming on the hip from jolting and bruising for hour after hour, and animals with crippling foot injuries due to improper flooring.)</PARA>
<PARA> Animal production loss in each state differs but in general there is no stipulation that animals shall only travel for a certain number of hours. There is no requirement which makes one person responsible for the animals at each point of the journey and so responsibility for injury and death is abnegated or denied. Local abbatoirs are closing down with the result that stock animals are being transported further and further across state borders making the issue a federal matter. Horses for instance may be loaded in Queensland, travel 2 or 3 days in a truck as it is being loaded in various points then stand 2 days in a sale yard at Homebush without food or water to be trucked out that evening to a knackery. This apart from the obvious cruelty involved, is also economic disaster because the farmer loses money in sick and injured livestock. A large component of which is bruising alone. In 1975 there was a loss of $20 million per annum from bruised carcasses and this does not include death, weightloss, height damage or contamination of carcasses. An inquiry is urgently needed into ways of supervising journeys of stock animals, of improving sale yard conditions , or relating the types of transport used in moving animals to prevent unnecessary injury and stress and of defining the responsibility of sellers, transporters, buyers, auctioneers and agents. </PARA>
<PARA> A subject which has caused public outcry is the shipping of live animals overseas for slaughter. For instance last year over 100 horses were sent to Japan to be fattened and killed for eating and 5.7 million sheep were exported live mostly to the Middle East. (Conditions under which the sheep travel are quite appalling; three sheep crowded into an area of one square metre; Hygiene problems such as the decks cannot be kept clean and the problem of disposing of sick and dead sheep during the voyage. </PARA>
<PARA> On arrival in the Middle East the animals are held in very crude conditions and the ritual slaughter means that the animals have their throats cut without prior stunning. We must have the regulations to ensure that if we do send Australian sheep overseas that their suffering is reduced to a minimum during the journey and when they are slaughtered. </PARA>
<PARA> The British Veterinarian Association policy is that animals should be slaughtered as near as possible to the point of production and this is certainly not happening with the overseas trade in livestock. </PARA>
<PARA>(B.) Wildlife Protection and Harvesting: It is estimated that at present about 30 Australian native species are threatened with extinction. An endangered species act is needed for the protection of the habitat of these species and we urgently need scientific research to find out the extent of the range of each endangered species and the factors which threaten their continued survival. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is a signatory to the International Agreement-C.I.T.E.S. (Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species). We need funding to set up a monitoring service to prevent wildlife being smuggled out of the country and to police illegal traffic. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government is breaking down the prohibition on kangaroo exports which was established by the Whitlam Government. The Australian Government has been making strong representations to the U.S. Government requesting that it lift its ban on importing kangaroo skins and products and this was done so as of 29 May 1981. Recently, the E.E.C. overwhelmingly decided to ban the importation of seal skins and products and this was particularly important in terms of the world wide reaction to the annual seal hunt in Canada. </PARA>
<PARA> Rural surveys of some blocks of north-west New South Wales during mid-1981 showed a sharp drop in kangaroo numbers since the 1980 survey. The red kangaroo' s numbers have dropped from 8 million in 1980 to 7 million in 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> Poaching is widespread and because overseas sales are lucrative the temptation could arise to harvest these animals and eventually extinction could occur for some species. In this respect more well trained rangers are needed to patrol the kangaroo population and ensure that such a situation does not arise. </PARA>
<PARA>(C.) Animal Experiments: Perhaps one of the most disturbing aspects of all animal welfare matters in Australia is the use of animals for experiments. Although many questions have been asked in State and Federal Parliament over the years we still have no figures available as to how many animals are being used in experiments in this country, what types of animals are being used or for what sorts of research. There is virtually no legislation to protect animals used in experiments. </PARA>
<PARA> The various State Acts are totally inadequate, therefore we have a situation where anything can be done to a dog or a cat behind closed laboratory doors without the researcher being answerable to anyone except his own peers. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Health and Medical Research Council does have a code of practice to govern the use of animals in experiments which states that 'procedures likely to cause pain of more than a trivial extent must not be carried out without the administration of an anaesthetic'. However, this code is, we believe, not being enforced. We are appreciative of honourable members (such as Ralph Jacobi) who have raised these questions from time to time. We believe this is a bipartisan matter of moral and ethical concern which should not be related to party politics. </PARA>
<PARA> What is (urgently) needed is a system which is publicly accountable such as that in Great Britain where statistics are collected by the Home Office and it is known how many animals are used. </PARA>
<PARA> No animals should have to suffer pain in any experiment as modern analgesic and anesthetics are now more sophisticated. The Government must encourage the use and development of alternative techniques and animal welfare representatives should be represented on committees involved with animal experiments within the research establishment (as is the case in Sweden). </PARA>
<PARA>(D) Codes of Practice of Animal Husbandry for all Species: Recently there has been much publicity about the keeping of hens in confined cages all their lives to produce eggs cheaply. Up to 4 hens can be crowded into a cage with a sloping wire floor where each hen has a quarto page space in which it lives virtually its whole life being constantly jostled by its companions. Pigs also are crowded indoors on cement or slashed floors, they are fed on artificial foods, never knowing sun, fresh air or exercise. As long ago as 1965 the Bramble Report, a committe of agricultural experts in Britain stated that even animals that were kept indoors for generation after generation did not lose their instincts to scratch in the soil, to make a dust bath etc. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to stress that draft codes of practice just prepared by the Sub- Committee on Animal Welfare within the Australian Agricultural Council-a hasty response to agitation by animal liberation groups-totally neglect the most essential feature of factory farming; there is no statement in the code of practice on pig welfare which deals with the ethological or behavioural means of the animal. Many eminent scientists such as Dr Van Putten of Holland who have made a life-long study of pigs have stated that if an animal is permanently confined frustration may be expressed in disease or death. For instance pigs suffer heart attacks and ulcers and there is the sudden death syndrome of poultry, the cause of which is still not known. </PARA>
<PARA> The transport and slaughter is doubly traumatic because these animals are not accustomed to outdoor environment. </PARA>
<PARA> In Europe there are parliamentary committees examining these questions. Animals are voiceless but there are many people who will vote on their behalf. These people are seriously concerned with the way in which animals are treated as machines and not as living, feeling, sentient creatures capable of knowing pain and emotion. </PARA>
<PARA>(E) Animals in Sport: Finally, I want to make reference to animals in sport. Senators will recall the recent outcry about rodeo events such as calf-roping.</PARA>
<PARA> A calf may be travelling at 30 or 40 kilometres an hour when it is busted or suddenly thrown by a rope tightened around its neck. Overseas studies have shown a calf roped even once suffers injury such as bruising of the larynx and rupturing and haemorrhaging of muscles possibly paralysis. </PARA>
<PARA> Other sporting activities using animals are also of concern. The use of the whip in horse racing should be investigated and extraordinary events such as wild cow milking, greasy pig chasing ought to be assessed. There is also the problem of indiscriminate shooting of wildlife. All these issues must be investigated. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for its indulgence. The reason that I changed the wording of my motion to refer to two standing committees is that the Senate is creaking along at the moment with too many select committees. I think every honourable senator is on one committee or more and would know the burden that that system is placing on the Senate and its resources. I have been persuaded-I did not need much persuasion-that it would be unfair to press the creation of another select committee on to the Senate. The chairmen and the members of the two standing committees were gracious enough to say that they would increase the loads on them and their committees in order to take on those terms of reference. I sincerely thank those chairmen and members of those Senate committees for their co-operation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I quite briefly indicate the Australian Labor Party's very strong support for Senator Chipp's motion. I suspect that in an ideal world we might have preferred the matters which are the subject of his motion to have been integrated into a single reference to a single committee. After all, the basic principles at stake here about animal welfare are in fact common to the terms of reference proposed for the separate committees. It is a realistic division of labour in terms of resources available and it may well have been that without this proposed division of labour it may not have been proved practicable for the reference to be made at all. On that basis we support not only the principle of a Senate inquiry into animal welfare but also the particular procedures that are proposed tonight. I think there is a disposition to regard animal welfare issues as curiously the preserve and preoccupation of little old ladies in tennis shoes but I think it ought to be appreciated--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps sandshoes, to acknowledge Senator Chipp's continued robust interest in that sport. I think it ought to be acknowledged that animal welfare is increasingly being perceived by a great many people in this community , spread across a great many occupational groups and other interest groups. There is a growing awareness that in talking about animal welfare we are talking about something that is very much a legitimate preoccupation for ordinary, concerned citizens. I think there is a growing appreciation that the basic issue involved in the campaigning of increasingly visible animal welfare lobby groups is a very basic issue of suffering which deserves attention and compassion by all civilised human beings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To disregard the suffering of animals simply because they are not human is to perpetuate, in many ways, the prejudice that has brought about their present situation. Some people treat living and suffering creatures-I will indicate in a moment some of the contexts in which that suffering does take place-as if they simply did not matter, just as in earlier times racists treated people of other races-I fear it is still the case in some places today-as though they did not matter. This is a point that has been made very successfully and very effectively by Professor Peter Singer of Monash University who has been one of the world leaders in developing an articulated consciousness, on the part of Western societies at least, in animal welfare and, as he has described it, animal liberation. I think it is important to get rid of the lingering prejudices that so many of us have against taking seriously the interests of lives and beings of a different species. </PARA>
<PARA> There are innumerable areas in which animal suffering is regrettably an omnipresent reality. There is the area of experimentation. Of course I do not mean all scientific experimentation but the undoubtedly quite considerable unnecessary experimentation that takes place in medical schools, colleges of pharmacology and a whole variety of other research establishments, but more particularly teaching establishments around the nation. Issues arise with which we are all familiar in the context of the transport of animals, especially live sheep. There is the even more obnoxious phenomenon that again we are regrettably all too familiar with of cosmetic testing of animals through the application of the various dosage tests that are applied and which are really quite grotesque in their implications for the suffering of the beings in question. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the question of slaughtering methods in the context of certain ritual killing in particular which does not allow for initial stunning of the beasts in question. There are methods of hunting, especially of kangaroos, which has given rise to other kinds of concern in that context. There are animal husbandry practices, particularly in respect of pigs and poultry and, to a lesser extent but perhaps increasingly, various methods of cattle raising. There is the question of the use of animals in sport. In this respect one cannot help but notice the controversy and outcry which quite legitimately arose in the context of the rodeo which was held in Melbourne and subsequently in Sydney. There are even questions that arise, and I think deserve some attention, so far as vermin control methods are concerned. I do not want to unnecessarily extend this recitation of the contexts in which I believe man has demonstrated its inhumanity to other species. However I do want to say that I, in common with Senator Chipp who has moved this motion, and other honourable senators and members in this place, abhor cruelty. I abhor needless violence. I abhor undue pain and I abhor it, perhaps even more strenuously, where those events are occasioned by commercial motives, by cost cutting or reasons of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA> For all those reasons I think it is very important for the Senate to acknowledge the initiative that has been taken by the Australian Democrats, and indeed by other parliamentarians in support of the Democrats, in response to what is clearly a growing concern in the community. I know that we cannot realistically expect, given the timetable of present projects of the committees in question, very quick responses to be made by the committees. However, the passage of Senator Chipp's motion tonight at least will mean that these matters are now on the agendas of the respective committees. It will mean that projects can be set in train, that perhaps some research can be prompted or stimulated and that submissions can be sought. In the months ahead-perhaps some time ahead- when it becomes possible for the committees to devote their whole attention to these matters, I am sure that they will do a very careful and very responsible job of treating systematically, carefully and in many ways for the first time in Australia's history what I believe is an issue of very great importance indeed. Accordingly I commend Senator Chipp's motion and recommend it to the favourable attention of the Senate. </PARA>

This is an acknowledgement of the reality of the work borne by committees and of the difficulty of doing all of the desirable things that members of this legislative chamber would like to do.

On checking with the people who arrange the business in this chamber after 8 o'clock I thought that this matter would not come on until a much later hour. However, events have transpired and we now find that Senator Chipp has moved an amendment to his original motion that a Senate select committee be set up. I was not made aware of that. I am a member of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources. I was not aware that Senator Chipp's motion was going to be amended and that part of the reference would be sent to the National Resources Committee . That is all news to me. When I walked into the chamber I was not even aware that that had happened. However I guess that that is what the Senate will agree to. I do not know how the motion has been divided, which part will be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment and which part will be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources. I am interested to know-I have not had time to look at the Notice Paper because I did not know the text of Senator Chipp's amendment-whether his party has a member on either of those committees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is all right. Therefore the Australian Democrats are going to play some part in the inquiry. No doubt in a week or two more will be said in other places about what has transpired tonight. I have risen in this chamber on many occasions and expressed my abhorrence at the cruelty that has been meted out in the transport of livestock, particularly the transport of live horses to Japan. One of the first matters I raised in this chamber a couple of years ago was the cruelty being meted out to live horses being tranported by ship from Melbourne to Japan. Because of the public outcry those horses had to be unloaded in Sydney and taken care of by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals at great cost to that organisation. I have yet to be able to find out whether those people shipping those horses and, no doubt, making a profit out of them ever compensated the RSPCA for what it cost it to care for those horses in its custody on whatever property it was able to find on which to agist them and give them the necessary care in or near Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter that I raised which caused great concern to the RSPCA inspectors concerned the time that a planeload of horses was being loaded at Tullamarine Airport and being transported to Japan by an American air freight company known as the Flying Tigers. When the RSPCA inspectors went to Tullamarine they were refused permission to inspect the conditions in which those horses would have to live during the time that they would be transported from Tullamarine to Japan. Of course, we know that people who engage in this sort of profit-making business are not concerned with the welfare of animals. All that they are concerned with is the making of a quick buck. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose I could rightly say that apart from Senator Thomas in this chamber I have had a closer association with animals and their welfare than any other honourable senator, having been born and bred in the country, having been a shearer for 21 years and having handled many thousands of live sheep, having worked in abbatoirs and having been a poultry farmer for some 11 years. I have a great deal of experience in the handling of livestock and the way in which they ought to be cared for. One of the things that disturbs me about people who have as much concern as I do for the welfare of animals is where they may be misinformed in the care of live animals, particularly in the poultry industry. Now that we are concerned with splitting up this public inquiry between the two committees I hope that these people will be duly advised through the Press that the inquiry is taking place, that they will be able to come along to each of those committees, make public submissions and put their point of view. I hope that those people who have an opposite point of view will come along and put their view also. When the findings come down I hope that the committees will be able to satisfy the people who share my concern for the treatment of animals in Australia, whether they be domestic animals or the semi-wild animals which are being tranported out of this country so some people can make a quick dollar. When the recommendations come down I hope that they will embody some strict recommendations to the Government so that we can lay at rest for all time the possibility of ill-treatment of animals and ensure that the people who have charge of live animals care for them in the proper way. </PARA>
<PARA> I am greatly concerned also about the transporting of sheep and cattle by road and sometimes by rail-although they are better cared for by rail-to abbatoirs. As one drives along the highways of this country one comes across three-decker transporters. Because of the haste of the driver in trying to get from point A to point B he slews the vehicle around corners and it is not long before the weaker sheep or cattle are crowded into a corner and trampled down by the stronger ones. On some occasions one can see legs and heads sticking out of the vehicle. No doubt this causes great concern to animal lovers. As I said earlier, I hope that when the committees bring down their reports they recommend very stringent regulations for the transport and care of live animals. </PARA>
<PARA> They ought also to look at the care of domestic animals. Whilst a lot of criticism has been levelled at the commercial poultry farmers about battery hens I venture to say-I say this with some credibility-that much more cruelty is meted out to laying fowls in backyards where people keep them in small pens, particularly in wintertime, when they are bogged in at least a foot of mud in some places and are fed on kitchen scraps. That is also something about which people should show some concern. They ought to be concerned about people who neglect cats and dogs. People buy pets for their children at Christmastime. When the animals grow to a bit of a size and they have to be fed and looked after they turn them out in the street. That is why we have an overabundance, particularly of cats which in turn molest the bird life of Australia. All of these things should be given consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not seen the new terms of reference which have been put before the Senate tonight. But I hope-and I say this with all sincerity-that when the Committees both bring down reports the Government takes immediate heed of those reports, whichever government is in power. The way things are going it might well be our government. We could be in government very soon. Of course we have great animal lovers on our side of the chamber. Senator Mulvihill is one such animal lover. He repeatedly stands in his place in this chamber and talks about the cruelty to animals. He tries to do something for their welfare. I conclude by repeating that this is a worth while reference. I hope that it serves a good purpose and that people on both sides of the chamber will be happy at the outcome of the public inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly I apologise to the other members of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, of which I am chairman. I discussed this matter with each of the members of that Committee but , like Senator Chipp and other senators, I did not expect this matter to come on for debate tonight. I was hoping to have a meeting of the Committee and then to discuss with Senator Chipp the terms of our reference. I am very pleased to have this reference. I reiterate for the benefit of Senator McLaren that Item (a) of the motion states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>interstate and overseas commerce in animals;</PARA>
<PARA>Item (d) states:</PARA>
<PARA>codes of practice of animal husbandry for all species;</PARA>
<PARA>The remaining three items are being referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment. In that regard I apologise to the other members of the Committee although they were aware of this possibility. I am particularly pleased to have this reference. I have been involved in stud sheep all my life. I am a third generation stud sheep breeder. It has been very much in my interest to make sure that the sheep that have been under my charge have been well looked after. This applies to most people who handle stock. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to try to offset some of the slight emotionalism which was brought into the debate by some previous speakers. As far as I know, apart from some of those odd people whom Senator Evans mentioned regarding experimentation with animals, everybody who makes a living from animals has a great deal of interest in the health of those animals. Farmers in particular who rely a great deal for their income from wool and meat would be in dire straits if the animals that they had charge of were not in very good health. Quite often the degree of the health of the animals is outside the farmers' control through weather conditions and many other situations. But I assure honourable senators that, if animals get any setback at all during the early part of their lives they are of no commercial value whatsoever to a stud sheep breeder. To that degree I certainly have a great deal of interest in the subject. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge the particular interest that Senator McLaren has shown in this subject. His interest is well known. One of the other members of my Committee, Senator Bjelke-Petersen, is well known in rural areas in Queensland. She certainly would be able to contribute a great deal to our discussions as well. Of course, Senator Watson gets around Tasmania pretty often. He would bring quite a degree of learned knowledge for the Committee's considerations. I am sure that the amount of evidence that this inquiry will attract because of the great deal of interest in Australia on the subject will make the inquiry a very rewarding one. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee on National Resources that I chair is currently involved in an inquiry. We hope to finish that inquiry towards the end of this year. It is a matter for the Committee to determine its own priorities as to the time it will be able to take on this inquiry. I hope it will be done fairly quickly and fairly expeditiously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Saturday the people of Queensland go to the polls to vote in local government elections. One of the local authorities is the Brisbane City Council. The election for this Council is a very important one . The Brisbane City Council is a major local government authority providing services for approximately three quarters of a million people. The people of Brisbane have been ably represented by a Labor council for the past 21 years. The composition of the Council at present is 11 Labor aldermen, Nine Liberal aldermen and one National Party alderman. The National Party alderman was not elected as a National Party alderman. This lone National Party member is a defector from the Liberal Party and faces an uphill battle to retain his position on the Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the first time, the National Party, in an attempt to extend its frontier from the rural areas of Queensland, is entering this election campaign for the Brisbane City Council. The National Party has not hesitated to spend freely from its ample cash reserves in trying to entice the voters of Brisbane to support its candidates. Nevertheless, I expect that its efforts will be in vain. But I ask tonight: How can the people of Brisbane expect the National Party or the Liberal Party to look after their interests at the local authority level? I ask this in view of the way that the National-Liberal Coalition Government in Queensland has attempted to emasculate the Brisbane City Council. In particular, the State Government has taken over two major revenue sources of the Council, namely, water supply and electricity supply. In doing so the costs to the Brisbane citizens have increased. It is worth noting in passing that electricity charges in Brisbane are expected to rise by 40 per cent in the next year because of the State Government's bias against Brisbane consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> But I would like to hear what the National and Liberal Party candidates have to say about their State colleagues withholding $47m of Commonwealth Grants Commission funds which should rightfully have gone to the City Council. During the Council election campaign, the National and Liberal party candidates have not cared to mention this vital issue which significantly affects the transport service of the City of Brisbane and the level of rates payable by the citizens of Brisbane. I have raised this matter in this place previously, and I will continue to raise it until the Queensland Government takes note of its responsibility to the people of Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA> For those honourable senators who are interested in reading my earlier comments they are on pages 2548 to 2553 of the Senate Hansard of 25 November 1981. Briefly, however, the situation is this: Since late 1975 the Commonwealth Grants Commission has taken into account the cost of the Brisbane City Council's transport undertakings in determining the grant to Queensland as a claimant State. Since that time, the State Government has received a total of $65m from the Commonwealth Grants Commission due to metropolitan road transport being included in Queensland's assessed needs. However, in the same period, the State Government has made only $18m available to the Brisbane City Council for transport-a shortfall of $47m. When I raised this matter in this chamber last November my comments were reported in the Brisbane Courier-Mail. The report stated that I had said that $47m earmarked by the Commonwealth Grants Commission for metropolitan road transport in Brisbane had been deliberately withheld by the State Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I would stress that I did not use the term 'earmarked' in my speech because the Grants Commission does not earmark funds which it recommends should be payable to States. However, since certain funds were given to the State Government because of the Brisbane City Council's transport undertakings, I do not think that anyone could logically argue that morally the money does not belong to the Brisbane City Council and the people of Brisbane. As a result of the Courier- Mail report to which I referred, questions were asked in the Queensland State Parliament. In response, the Queensland Treasurer, Dr Edwards, said he believed that my statements were not correct but he would ask for further information and make a public statement on the matter that afternoon. He said that on 26 November 1981. I checked with his office not long ago and I was informed that no such statement was forthcoming. Obviously, Dr Edwards found that my statements were correct and, clearly, the Queensland Government has no justification for its actions in withholding $47m from the Brisbane City Council. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise this matter again tonight because I believe that it is important that the issue should be aired again before the Council election on Saturday. The Liberal and National Council candidates are promising the world. But at the same time, their colleagues in the State Government are ham-stringing and cheating the Brisbane City Council and the people of Brisbane. The interests of the people of Brisbane would not be looked after by candidates who will not stand up for the rights of those whom they purport to represent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter on the adjournment debate tonight which I spoke about at some length on 12 November last year when we were debating, in the Committee stage, Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1981, and that is the matter of cheap home loans to Liberal and National Country Party Ministers. Of course, the fact that I raised it here then attracted the attention of quite a lot of people in Australia. I raised the matter some years ago but because interest rates on housing loans were not very high nobody took any notice of it, but now that interest rates are going through the roof many people are very concerned that well-paid members of parliament, particularly Ministers-some of the highest paid people in the Commonwealth-are able to get dirt cheap home loans for a 45 year term. So much furore was created over that matter which I raised on 12 November that the next day the front page of the Adelaide News stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ministers accused. Storm over cheap home loans claim. </PARA>
<PARA>The newspaper went on to quote chapter and verse what took place in this chamber on the night before. I give great credit to the correspondent, Warwick Costin, for exposing to the people at large just what some of these Liberal/Country Party Ministers-and these are Country Party Ministers we are talking about-will do to get a cheap buck at the expense of the under-privileged people in this community. On 16 February this year, the day the Parliament resumed, I put a question to Senator Messner. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> I preface my question to the Minister representing the Minister for the Capital Territory by reminding him of the debate during the Committee stage of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1981 on 12 November last year dealing with the expenditure for the Capital Territory. It was then revealed that the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, and the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon, had been given 45-year term home loans by the Liberal-National Country Party Government at fixed interest rates of 4.75 per cent and 6.25 per cent per annum respectively. In view of the public outcry at this very selective, favourable treatment for two Ministers of this Government, I now ask the Minister: Firstly, has either Minister or have both of the aforementioned Ministers divested themselves of these loans since I raised the matter in Committee; and secondly, if the answer is that they have not, will the Government now extend the same generous, long term, low interest rate loans to the many thousands of young couples who are now in desperate straits trying to maintain a roof over the heads of their families?</PARA>
<PARA>In reply Senator Messner said:</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the problem here is that having been reminded by Senator McLaren of the debate that occurred last November I have not had the opportunity of consulting with my colleague as to the current state of play. At this point all I can offer to do is to consult with Mr Hodgman and bring down an early reply for Senator McLaren. </PARA>
<PARA>That question was asked on 16 February. Today is 25 March. I was handed a partial reply to my question. Nearly every day on which the Senate has sat this session I have presented petitions from concerned citizens, complaining about the privilege loans of which these two highly paid gentlemen were in receipt and asking that the same generous terms be extended to many people who are in desperate straits trying to get a roof over their heads. Last week the Government announced a home loans package which it says will benefit many people . In my view and in the view of all my colleagues, whilst it may benefit some, it will disadvantage more than it will advantage. The bank interest rate on home loans is going up by another one per cent but the reply I received to my question indicates that one of the Ministers to whom I have referred will escape . </PARA>
<PARA> What really annoyed me was that when Mr Fry, the honourable member for Fraser, asked a question on 18 November of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Prime Minister tried cheaply to discredit Mr Fry and Mr Morrison who had also, not as members of parliament but as citizens of the Australian Capital Territory , availed themselves of cheap loans. He tried to use that as an excuse for Mr Anthony and Mr Nixon also having cheap loans. Despite the fact that both Mr Fry and Mr Morrison took points of order, Mr Fraser still tried to belittle them. The document that Senator Guilfoyle tabled in the parliament during the consideration of the Appropriation Bills proved to one and all that these people had paid off their loans before they were elected to the Parliament. Yet the Prime Minister still stooped to that low trick of trying to implicate them in the same way as his two chums, the Country Party Ministers, are implicated. On Tuesday of this week, 23 March, my leader, Senator Button, received an answer to Question No. 1613 which he had placed on notice. The question stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 24 November 1981:</PARA>
<PARA> Have either Mr Anthony or Mr Nixon at any time since the taking out of their respective Commonwealth home loan mortgages lent money out at interest to any person or organisation, for any substantial period of time; if so, what are the details of such loans. </PARA>
<PARA>An answer was provided by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Carrick. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator' s question:</PARA>
<PARA> I refer the honourable senator to my answer to Question No. 1153 on 23 February 1982 (Hansard, page 287) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The answer to which the Minister referred was given to Senator Walsh who had asked:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Did the former Member for Boothby, the Hon. J. McLeay, while a member of the Ministry inform the Prime Minister that McLeay Brothers Pty Ltd or any other McLeay family business enterprise was in financial difficulties; if so, on what date. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) If he did not do so, did he breach the Government's guidelines on declaration of pecuniary interests. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Button was referred to that answer. It has nothing to do with cheap home loans but it was fobbed off as an answer. He was also referred to an answer given to a question without notice in the House of Representatives on 18 November and to question No. 1153 asked in February 1982. That was in the Senate Hansard but I do not have that with me. That had nothing at all to do with these cheap home loans either. That is the way the Prime Minister has tried to duck out of this issue, to try to explain away why he sanctioned these cheap loans. He did not give them to these two chaps because they gave them to themselves when they were then Ministers for the Interior. That department has now been changed; it is now the Department of Administrative Services. One of the excuses that Mr Fraser used for these people getting these cheap home loans was that they had to spend a long time in Canberra and that they were parted from their families. So they of all people-Ministers, mind you-should have cheap government homes in Canberra at low interest rates! Of course we know that Mr Anthony was not living in that home for quite a lengthy period because he let it out to a Mr Stallings who is one of those people who are now well known to have been members of the Central Intelligence Agency. One of the purposes of Senator Walsh's question, and of some of mine at various times, was to find out whether those people are allowed to let out government homes which they are buying at cheap rates, and in particular, to let them out to a member of the CIA and get a high rent for them while they are buying those homes at a very cheap interest rate on a long term loan. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course the other thing that now comes to mind is: How does Mr Anthony- because he is the one who still has the loan, I will refer to him-get on with this house, as a Minister? This relates to Mr Nixon also. Do they declare those homes as their home base and then every time they go away from Canberra get the travelling allowance to which members of parliament are entitled-under the Remuneration Tribunal guidelines members of parliament have to declare where their home base is-or do they declare their home base as being where they live? If they do that, Mr Fraser's argument is knocked flat because they are not using these places they have in Canberra as homes. Mr Anthony was using his place for quite a period as a money-making venture by letting it out to a member of the CIA. I will refer in a short time to the answer I received today from Senator Messner but I first want to quote a couple of extracts from newspapers. An article in the Canberra Times of Tuesday 2 March is headed 'Ministers' house loans', and states:</PARA>
<PARA> Low-interest housing loans held by two Government Ministers in the ACT should be repaid, Senator Reid (Lib, ACT) said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> 'I personally think it would be preferable if both ministers concerned repaid the loans and refinanced their houses in another way,' she said on radio station 2CN. </PARA>
<PARA> But she said the ministers could not be forced to repay what were 'quite legal mortgages and quite legal interest rates.'</PARA>
<PARA>Nobody doubts the fact that they are legal, but they are morally wrong in the minds of many people. The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary--</PARA>
<PARA>The article does not say 'Industry'--</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Nixon, has recently paid off his loan, at a fixed interest rate of 6.25 per cent, according to a spokesman for Mr Nixon. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Trade and Resources, Mr Anthony, was still repaying his loan at 4.75 per cent a spokesman for Mr Anthony said. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course we know that Mr Anthony is on record in regard to this matter. In my haste to get here tonight it looks as though I have left his statement behind. It was made in an article in the Clancy column of the National Times. Mr Anthony is quoted as having said that he has no intention of paying off his loan. That is most unfortunate. As I said, as the Deputy Prime Minister he is on one of the highest salaries it is possible for any person in the Parliament to receive, and he also receives one of the highest travelling allowances. I received an answer today from Senator Messner. I am at a loss to know why it was not given to me when we first came back, in view of what is embodied in it. </PARA>
<PARA>I quote the answer:</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 16 February 1982 Senator McLaren asked a question without notice seeking information relating to Government Home Loans. The Minister for the Capital Territory has supplied the following information in reply to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr P. J. Nixon) discharged his Commonwealth of Australia loan in December 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>That is one good thing that has come out of the vigilance of members of the Opposition on Estimates committees and their bringing the matter before the Committee of the Whole. At least we have forced Mr Nixon to pay off his home loan. After many years he has come to see the light. I do not know who forced him to do it. I have been told that there was quite a dispute in East Gippsland among the Country Party members who are desperate to retain a State seat there. The dogs were barking that the Country Party was in trouble if it was going to indulge in things such as this to help its Ministers in the Federal Parliament. That might have been one of the reasons-I do not know how true it is-he got busy and paid it off. The answer continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Mr Anthony and Mr Nixon purchased their government-built houses with the assistance of fixed interest rate Commonwealth of Australia mortgages in December 1964 and August 1970. </PARA>
<PARA> Before September 1974 all Commonwealth of Australia mortgage documents relating to the purchase of government houses in Canberra made no provision for variation of the interest rate that was applicable at the date a mortgage was granted. It was recognised that this was an anomaly and after September 1974 all new applicants to buy their government houses were required to enter into mortgages with variable interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we all know that it was a Labor Government that changed that. We were in government in 1974. The Labor Government was not going to stand by and see Ministers of the Crown or anybody else getting these very favourable interest rates. No doubt people on some very high salaries in Canberra also availed themselves of those low interest rates. The answer goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Under existing law it was not legally possible to vary mortgages entered into by mortgagors, including Mr Nixon and Mr Anthony, before that date. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) said, of course, that it was not legally possible. Of course, it would have been morally possible for them to pay off those cheap loans. The answer goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Since 1974 government housing loans have been made available to low income earners on generous terms and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>Nobody disputes the decision that the loans ought to be made available to low income earners. I am in full agreement with that. The answer continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Such loans currently commence at an interest rate of 5 3/4% (effective) per annum, with this rate escalating by  1/2% per annum until the full non- concessional rate of 11 3/4% (effective) is reached. Where a mortgagor can demonstrate that the annual increase would cause undue hardship escalations may be deferred. </PARA>
<PARA>We find that these people, who were financially disadvantaged and were able to get one of these long term, low interest rate home loans in 1974 at 5 3/4 per cent, with the half per cent per annum escalation would now be paying 9 3/4 per cent on their home loans. Yet we find that that interest rate is nearly the double the rate that Mr Anthony is still paying on the loan which he refuses to pay off. I ask: Is that justice? What will the young people of this country think when I acquaint them with this? I will be contacting all of the people who have signed those petitions and sent them to me-I have presented them in Parliament-because I have kept a copy of their names. I will be sending Mr Hodgman's answer to them. I am sure that they will not be very happy. I hope that when the Press picks this up the Liberal Government, and particularly the Country Party candidates, in Victoria will not be too happy either. </PARA>
<PARA> The people in Victoria have to make a decision about whether they will vote into office next week members of the Country Party who condone the Deputy Prime Minister, who is a member of the National Country Party, availing himself of this long term, low interest loan when he can well afford to pay it out. As my colleague Senator Walsh said in a Press release, we wonder how much of this money which he has got at low interest rates he has invested in some other way at a very high interest rate. As Senator Walsh, would say if he were here speaking on this matter, this is double dipping. Of course, we see this is nothing new when we have a look at some of the other things that have been going on. Senator Walsh has raised those matters on many occasions; I have no need to raise them here tonight. Again I place on record my disgust that the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia still has available to him this 45-year home loan. He has paid very little of it off in the time he has had it. He is still availing himself of the loan at 4 3/4 per cent per annum interest while the other people in Canberra who have taken out loans since 1974-even those people who are financially disadvantaged-have to pay double that interest rate. This is something that just will not go away. It will not be swept under the carpet whilst I remain in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, I will have to tell the people who are sending these petitions that they will have to alter them. I am sure that, when we return here after the three week break, plenty of people will still be petitioning the Parliament through me to call on Mr Anthony to do the decent thing for once in his life and to pay out that loan. I hope that these petitions will have the same effect on him as they had on Mr Nixon. At least the people who signed those petitions will be happy to know that they have forced one of those jackals into the position of having to pay off the loan. I hope we will be able to do this through one avenue that is available to the electors of this country. I hope that by petitioning the Parliament we will finally force the Deputy Prime Minister at least to have some degree of moral standard and pay back that loan which in my view he is not entitled to at the rate of interest he is paying. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not keep the Senate long. I apologise for speaking in the adjournment debate. In particular I apologise to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) who believes that any honourable senator who speaks after 10.30 p.m. on a Thursday is speaking in the dead of night. But I did try to raise the matter on which I wish to speak earlier in the evening. It was due to the effort of Senator Chaney and his colleagues that I was unable to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Members of the Opposition in the other place today received calls in their electoral offices from pensioners in Victoria who had received with their pension cheques what can be only described as an advertisement for the Victorian State Government booklet purporting to outline the benefits available for pensioners provided by the Victorian Government. We in the Opposition thought this was a bit rich although we should not have been surprised that this sort of activity would go on just before the Victorian election. In recent weeks, of course, we have seen the Minister for Housing, Mr McVeigh, setting off on a $300 ,000 advertising campaign for the Government's new, rather belated and inefficient housing assistance program-advertisements which are being broadcast on radio and television. A disproportionate amount of the money which is available to be spent on that advertising campaign is, of course, being spent in Victoria where there just happens to be an election coming up in a couple of weeks, an election in which, according to the polls in this country, the Liberals are in some difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also seen the Minister for Social Security on another occasion spending a considerable amount of money-again something over $300,000-on an advertising campaign when he was indulging in industrial warfare with one of the trade unions in his Department-the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association. That was one of the matters I raised in what Senator Chaney called the dead of the night a couple of weeks ago. First of all, I would like to contrast this behaviour with the behaviour of the Government since 1975. The Government has, in fact, cut advertising of social security benefits in this country by some 50 per cent since 1975. The publicity budget has gone down by 50 per cent in real terms. The Department has been reluctant to use the most effective means of advertising its pensions and benefits-particularly the disadvantaged health card -on radio and television. It is only too willing now to use this media to advertise its housing policy for electoral purposes. Now we also have the Department including with its cheques to pensioners a document advertising the services available to pensioners from the Victorian Government. It is not unusual, of course, for the Department of Social Security to advertise benefits that are made available by State departments. In fact, a booklet called 'More help for pensioners' has been distributed for many years. The booklet lists the social security benefits that are available from the Department of Social Security in each State and benefits which are available from the Victorian Government and other State governments. It is a detailed booklet which gives in straight terms what is available. But what has been advertised now by Senator Chaney and by the Department of Social Security in conjunction with the Victorian department is I believe a much more blatantly political document. The document started off by stating: 'A Message to Victoria's Pensioners', and concludes: 'Lindsay Thompson, Premier and Treasurer of Victoria'. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA> Victoria's 430 000 pensioners have collectively made a tremendous contribution to this State's current prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Government is committed to caring for pensioners by ensuring that the living standards of Victoria's pensioners are maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> This booklet 'Benefits for Pensioners from the Victorian Government', is the most comprehensive booklet of its kind, produced by any Government in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> It is our way of explaining, clearly and concisely, the range of benefits available to you for both your use and needs. </PARA>
<PARA>I have no objection to the production of such a document. I think that the more documents that are available and the more adverising that is carried out to let pensioners know their rights the better. The problem I have is with the timing. I believe that Victorian pensioners have deserved to know their rights from the Victorian Government and the Commonwealth Government for many years. But there has been no such effort to make this information available in either the bland form made available by the Department of Social Security or in the more political language of the Department of the Premier and the Department of the Treasury in Victoria until there is an impending election. The Victorian Government, under Mr Thompson, realising that it is in some difficulties, has prepared a document presenting itself in the best light, in a political way, to the pensioners of Victoria. And what better way to distribute this document than with the assistance of its Federal colleagues, the Liberal-National Country Party Government, which is in power in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this is a futile exercise. The Minister probably realises it is a futile exercise too. I think that the electors of this country-particularly in Victoria-as they are the ones who are involved at the moment-will not fall for a trick like this and will not be convinced to vote for the Victorian Government merely because it and its Federal colleagues have produced a document of this type. It is important that all the electors of Victoria, not only pensioners, know how the Federal Government and the Federal Minister is willing to use his Department for what is blatantly a political propaganda exercise just before an election. I believe that the timing is appalling. One can imagine the screams that would have occurred in this place if a Federal Labor Government had indulged in such activities just before an election in, say, New South Wales or Tasmania. We are told, of course, that originally it was planned to include the whole document in the pension mail-out, but it was too big. We are told that arrangements were made by bureaucrats and not by the Minister, Senator Chaney, to distribute the document which has gone out today. We are told that this was an apolitical decision, that in fact it was nothing to do with the Minister and was arranged through officials. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it has come to my knowledge that the Minister signed not just one but two letters to his Victorian counterpart authorising that this be done at a time when he and his Victorian counterpart knew that a Victorian State election was imminent. We also understand that the intention was to send out approximately twice as many of the cards which went out today but there was some difficulty with printing and getting them in with the cheques. As I say, I merely raise this matter to draw the attention of the Parliament and the people of Victoria to the tactics in which the Government will indulge. That just adds to the list of abuses of the information services of the Government-in particular, the Department of Social Services in this case-for political purposes. The Government is always complaining about the information services of previous Federal governments and certain State governments and about the activities of information services in various States and governments of its opponents. I find it rather strange that this Government should indulge in this sort of activity because I believe it should have learned from the backfire of last week's announcement by Mr McVeigh. </PARA>
<PARA> I merely raise this matter to put on record the depth to which the present Government will go to assist its colleagues who are in such desperate straits in Victoria. The Government will not succeed. People are not conned by this sort of thing. People understand the political process sufficiently to know what is going on. It is about time the Government learned that the people understand, and it should understand that it cannot get away with this sort of thing without its being raised and exposed in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since Senator Grimes has gone to some trouble to put on the record, as he puts it, various sins and omissions of mine, it is unfortunately necessary for me to put on record my rejection of the charges that he has laid. The main points that seemed to come through his wildly political statements tonight are that, firstly , the Federal Minister is prepared to use his Department for political purposes. If one analyses what Senator Grimes said, it is clear that his basic concern is the question of the timing of the inclusion of a slip which went out with some of the pension cheques in Victoria this week. For the purpose of keeping the record clear, I would like to repeat that the slip, which was included in approximately 100,000 pension cheques which went out this week, reads as follows :</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A new booklet giving full details of all pensioner benefits provided by the Government of Victoria is now available at all post offices. </PARA>
<PARA>The message is a short and simple one of three lines, indicating that a booklet giving details of all pensioner benefits is available at the nearest post office . The complaint is made that this is being done with an eye to the Victorian elections and that in some way I have caused that to happen in an attempt to be of assistance to my Victorian Liberal colleagues. I simply reject that. I will set out the history of this matter, which I trust will satisfy the record, if not Senator Grimes, that there was no political intervention on my part. I had no part in making a decision, political or otherwise. The matter was one which indeed picked up the sorts of concerns which only two nights ago Senator Grimes was expressing so vehemently in the Senate chamber. I would like to refer to what Senator Grimes said two nights ago when he was complaining about other advertising by this Government and about a lack of effort by this Government to draw the attention of pensioners to their entitlements. I read from page 1073 of the Senate Hansard. Senator Grimes said:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1973 the Henderson Commission of Inquiry in to Poverty found that there were some 17,000 poor householders who were entitled to social services who were not receiving them whether through-to quote the report-'ignorance or pride'. The Task Force on Departmental Information which reported to the Government last year found that socio-economic and information disadvantage usually go together and have a mutually aggravating effect on each other. People in these areas just do not know what is available to them. The means used by the Government to make information available to them is just not getting the information through. </PARA>
<PARA>Later in the same speech, Senator Grimes said:</PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the Government is refusing to publicise, by the use of this media-</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to television-</PARA>
<PARA>at other times during the year, benefits that are vital to the most needy. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say, in referring to my Department, that Mr McVeigh had said:</PARA>
<PARA> If you want to accuse me of helping people, so be it. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Grimes then said:</PARA>
<PARA> That is something of which we could never, in the same context, accuse Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, Senator Chaney or the present Government when we look at the publicity budget that is devoted to social security recipients in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to the question of the Federal Department. Senator Grimes read into the record a summary of what is contained in the information which we are indicating to pensioners is available. The booklet points out that there is a clear and concise explanation of the range of benefits available to pensioners for their use and needs and then sets out some of the things which are available. The booklet contains more detail on these matters which are of interest to pensioners. So there is no concern from either side of this chamber, it would seem to me, on the principle that we should be trying to inform pensioners of their entitlements.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to the timing too. Senator Grimes expressed concern that many forms of advertising do not get through to pensioners and he pointed to his concern about the decline in the social security publicity expenditure. Let me refer very quickly to the record of social security publicity expenditure . In the last year of the Labor Government $1.185m was spent on advertising by the Department of Social Security. Of that, over $850,000 was specifically related to advertising of Medibank. For the next four years the budget for the Department of Social Security for publicity purposes ranged from $459,917 through some minor declines, but still over $400,000, to $487,000 in 1979-80. In 1980-81 the budget was over $1m, of which half a million dollars approximately was for the International Year of Disabled Persons. This year, 1981-82, the budgeted amount was $1.174m, which included $416,000 for IYDP. However, the Government subsequently devoted $176,000 additional to advertising the Disadvantaged Persons Health Scheme and $100,000 to advertising pension increases and new pension limits late last year. An amount of $400,000 was spent on advertising relating to the industrial dispute and $50,000 went on other increases in costs. That makes a total of $1.9m. I have been quoted recently as saying: 'You are damned if you do and you are damned if you don't in the Department of Social Security'. When we started spending money advertising the Disadvantaged Persons Health Scheme, one Labor shadow Minister told us that we were using government money for propaganda. Another said that we were not advertising the program sufficiently to make it available to the people who need it. Quite frankly, I suggest that we get down to the facts. The facts show a very considerable recent increase in the attempts of the Department to get through in ways about which I would have thought there was largely no argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me turn now to the question of how this particular exercise came about and how the timing came about, because I wish to meet the points which were raised by Senator Grimes. The proposal actually had its origin in a suggestion from a Labor member of Parliament in Victoria made in 1980 in the House of Assembly in that State. I have with me an extract from the Hansard of the Victorian Parliament. It is the Hansard of 16 April 1980. Mr Gavin, the member for Coburg, said:</PARA>
<PARA> A list of all available concessions for pensioners could cut out the anomalies that exist. From memory, either on the first or second day of this sessional period the Treasurer said he would try to have such a list compiled. If the Treasurer made that commitment I ask him to stand by it. Members of Parliament should know what concessions are available, and what categories of pensioners are entitled to receive concessions. </PARA>
<PARA>He then referred to lists being available and to the fact that they were not up to date, and continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Pensioners have done enough for society and should be given any possible benefits. The production of such a list might cost money but it would be of assistance. I hope the Treasurer will note my comments and answer them. </PARA>
<PARA>In the same debate on the same day, Mr Thompson, who was not then the Treasurer- -</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Gietzelt" NAMEID="RG4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator Gietzelt</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has taken them two years to organise it.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful for the continued assistance of Senator Gietzelt, but I would prefer him to let me do it in my own way in my own time. Mr Thompson , responding, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a good case for bringing out a document which explains clearly to all honourable members exactly what concessions are available for the various classes of pensioners so that they can answer the many queries about pensioners' concessions. Meanwhile, the Government will be taking care to ensure that all people receiving benefits under this legislation will be notified . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, it was from that debate in 1980 that this booklet eventually emerged. The Government promptly set about asking all Victorian departments to marshal the information which related to benefits available to pensioners in the State of Victoria. For reasons which have not been explained to me in detail-my information comes simply from a telephone call, because I knew nothing of this background until this matter blew up this afternoon-I was advised this afternoon that the collation of that material continued until about August of last year and that the production of a booklet was then commenced. </PARA>
<PARA> The booklet was not completed until later in the year, or early this year, but in December my Department was approached by the Victorian Department and asked about means of getting this booklet out to pensioners. There were discussions about the possibility of the booklet itself being distributed. Indeed, that was a matter which was investigated in the earlier part of this year by the public servants involved, but was found not to be a practicable proposition. It was then decided that a card insert could be enclosed with cheques-clearly, that is physically possible-simply advising pensioners of the availability of the booklet. </PARA>
<PARA> That action by departmental officers resulted in further action being taken on 4 March 1982 by officers, who put to the Acting Director-General of Social Services a recommendation to proceed with arrangements for the inclusion of the insert in cheque envelopes. Because of the complexities which were involved in the production and enveloping of hundreds of thousands of cheques, the first available pay-day which could be used for the insertion was 25 March. The dimension of the job was such that it was not possible to do them all in one batch and a decision was taken to spread the insertion over two or more paydays, commencing with that of 25 March 1982. In line with standard practice, the Acting Director-General determined that the request was in accordance with departmental guidelines, and approved it. </PARA>
<PARA> That summary omits my own part in this matter, which I would wish to be quite clear to this chamber, albeit empty, so at least it will be on record. I was referred to in this process. I had no part in the events which I have described, but let me now describe those in which I did play a part. </PARA>
<PARA> On approximately 27 January, I received a letter dated 20 January from the Acting Treasurer of Victoria, Mr W. A. Borthwick, who wrote to me in these terms :</PARA>
<PARA> At the direction of the Treasurer, the Honourable L. H. S. Thompson, M.P., a booklet has been prepared detailing concessions available to pensioners from the Government of Victoria. It is now necessary to distribute the booklet to each pensioner. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been informed that your Department will, with your consent, arrange to mail the booklet with the pension cheque sent to each pensioner. Therefore, I am writing to seek your agreement to your Department providing the necessary assistance. In this way you will preserve the confidentiality of the pensioner and may, hopefully, alert some persons to an existing right or concession of which they are not aware. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely, W. A. Borthwick</PARA>
<PARA>That was the first I had heard of this proposal. I wrote on the letter:</PARA>
<PARA>Dept-if this has been arranged early confirmation please</PARA>
<PARA>initialled it and dated it 27 January. On 11 February, I signed a form of acknowledgment-it is one of the two letters referred to by Senator Grimes in his statement-prepared by my Department in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 20 January 1982 concerning the distribution of a booklet detailing concessions available to pensioners from the Government of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> I will write to you on this matter as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA>I had nothing further to do with this matter until, on 11 March, I received a reply prepared by my Department, with respect to which there had been no consultation with me. That reply was signed by me and sent to Mr Thompson. It is in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Thompson</PARA>
<PARA> I am replying to the honourable W. A. Borthwick's letter of 20 January 1982, which he wrote whilst Acting Treasurer, regarding the distribution of a booklet with pension cheques issued by my Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the operational impact on time-critical cheque issues, I do not normally favour the forwarding of material with cheques. However, approval is granted from time to time for material to be inserted with cheques and each request is considered separately. </PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that contact was made between officers of our Departments and a test run revealed the impracticality of attempting to enclose the booklet with pension cheques. A substantial proposal to enclose a card insert informing pensioners that the booklet is available from Post Offices and Social Security Regional Offices has been considered by my Department and has been approved by my Director-General. I understand that subject to the cards being available the distribution will take place over two paydays namely 25 March 1982 and 9 April 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> I was presented with this draft making it clear that a decision had been made administratively with respect to the distribution. I had not seen the booklet. I had had no part in any of the discussions which led up to that point. However, I did, on the day that I signed that letter, which was 11 March-it was dispatched and dated on 12 March-speak with him about it. One of us-I do not recollect who- raised the fact that between those two dates of distribution there was an election. I did not feel, in light of the fact that the decision had been taken in the way that it was and in light of the sort of material being enclosed, that it was my job to try to change the decision which had been taken administratively. I cheerfully acknowledge that I was aware that this was going out and of the relevant dates. I can now advise the Senate that approximately 100,000 cards went out today and something like a quarter of a million cards will go out in a couple of weeks time. That, of course, is a period after the Victorian election. I suggest that if I were seeking to make some political point it would not have quite fallen out in that pattern. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry to hold the Senate for such a long time, but I do feel that the honest management of my Department by me has been impugned. I wish simply to make sure that a reasonably full explanation of what occurred is before the Senate. With respect to the use of direct mailing, and accepting that there is a problem in getting information to the less privileged people in the community, it has become a quite accepted practice that we use the income maintenance system which provides payments to nearly two million less well off Australians as a means of getting information to them. The previous Government-I am not criticising it in saying this-commenced the practice with respect to Medibank Private where information about it was provided through the pension system in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give honourable senators an example of the sorts of things which have been done since that time to provide information to less advantaged Australians. The Department has despatched information on the Perth City Council housebound readers library service. That is something which obviously was not sent to pensioners in Victoria, New South Wales or anywhere else. It was sent to pensioners in Perth who might use that service. We sent out a notice from the Tasmanian Branch of the Reserve Bank of Australia about cheque encashment facilities for pensioners-a very relevant problem for pensioners. We sent out notices from the Queensland Consumer Affairs Council, with reference to consumer education programs directed at low income consumers, the Commonwealth Department of Education regarding the secondary allowance scheme, and the Commonwealth Department of Health regarding information on health insurance for fringe beneficiaries. With respect to the State of Victoria in 1980, we have on a number of occasions sent out, on behalf of the Victorian Roads Safety and Traffic Authority, a leaflet entitled 'Pedestrians, be seen, be safe'. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the administrative background under which my officers who dealt with this matter were dealing. I do not appreciate having their bona fides impugned in this place by Senator Grimes. I do not believe their bona fides should be impugned. He, of course, impugned me. But I think that the summary that I have given has indicated that my part in this was not one that shows any political interference at all or any decision being made on the basis of the politics of the coming election. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important that people are able to trust the government and what it does. In the administration of my Department I try to ensure that there are no abuses. I do not believe that the actions of the officers of my Department or , indeed, my own actions can be impugned in the way that they have been. Certainly, they cannot be impugned fairly. So, I reject the points which have been made by Senator Grimes on behalf of the Opposition tonight. I wish that politics in Australia were conducted on a level where there might be some attempt to ascertain what the full facts of the matters are before speeches are circulated to the media in advance of their being made in this place and before statements are made which I believe reflect on my integrity. I reject the imputations and regret that they have been made in the manner in which they have . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to get too involved in this debate. We have heard Senator Grimes this evening and we have heard Senator Chaney's explanation which superficially establishes the fact that he and his Department did take certain steps to increase the knowledge of social security beneficiaries of some of the activities of the Federal Department. The fact that the Minister has given us such detailed information indicates that he is concerned at the criticism raised by Senator Grimes on behalf of the Opposition. If we were to isolate it may be there would be more value in what Senator Chaney said. But we are, after all, living in a political climate in which the Victorian Government is conceded by all political commentators to be somewhat besieged, beleaguered and on the defensive. Even Ministers of that Government are conceding that the Australian Labor Party could probably win the election by 48 per cent to 52 per cent. That is one of the Minister's own assessments made in discussion with a commentator only a few days ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the Opposition would still have to take the view that it was an injudicious thing for the Department or the Minister not to recognise the political pitfalls that emerged as a result of the decisions that may have been taken. I do not dispute that the process began in 1980 and that the due processes proceeded over the intervening 18 months or two years to the point where they were ready to be sent out to those in receipt of social security payments. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely it is the responsibility of departmental heads, as indeed it is of the Minister, to recognise and concede that in an election period, when political interest is heightened, when people are looking for issues on which to contest an election and are watching carefully the attitude taken by political parties and governments in respect of the contest that takes place during an election period, the Opposition is entitled to say that nothing would have been lost if those leaflets had been sent out in a fortnight's time. No criticism could have been levelled at the Department or the Minister. But to give approval for 100, 000 leaflets to be included in Commonwealth envelopes certainly leaves the impression that there was connivance or an attitude that the Opposition believes does or could affect an election result. This would happen particularly when we know that a decision was made in respect to the housing package, which decision had the effect again of using Commonwealth resources for the purpose of popularising election candidates in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> The amalgamation of those two incidents has certainly created a reaction by the Opposition. After all, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) and the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) have defended the expenditure of funds in respect to that housing package out of proportion to the amount of total moneys that were allocated in that instance. This occurred in the fortnight before the election took place. </PARA>
<PARA> We are all aware that, in the sort of political climate in which there is a contest of the type we have seen in Victoria over the last weeks, it is the role of the Opposition to examine closely what the Victorian Government and its counterpart, the Federal Government, are doing. The Opposition has drawn the conclusion that there has been some collusion and we take exception to it in respect to housing as indeed we have taken exception with respect to social security payments. I would have thought that on reflection the Minister would probably concede that it would have been better to have left the exercise to be carried into effect after the Victorian election rather than in the week or ten days immediately preceding it. A procedure has been introduced. If the Minister is approached by the New South Wales Government, will he make the same facilities available? Will it be the practice, the tradition, the procedure which the Federal Government will adopt with respect to all of the other States?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Grimes has made the point-certainly we on this side of the chamber will always take the view-that it is the responsibility of government to communicate to beneficiaries all of the benefits that are available to them. I am sorry that the Minister feels that he, personally, has been put in the firing line. He has to concede that, in the electoral climate in Victoria in which his own party is likely to be defeated, every action which is taken by a Federal department or a Federal Minister will be closely examined by the Opposition. </PARA>

People who objected to sitting on these days had the opportunity then to vote against the proposal. I do not care what the majority of the Committee said or how it was lobbied. So far as I am concerned, the Senate agreed that the Estimates committees should sit on particular days and those are the days on which they should be sitting. If any private arrangements are to be made they should be made with the consent of the Senate. I object strongly to private arrangements being made.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know what Senator Walters is talking about but I am talking about Senate Estimates Committee D and there is no Senator Evans on it. Senator Walters can make her Liberal objection later. I am objecting to something real and Senator Evans does not come into it at all. So far as I am concerned, I am a member of Estimates Committee D and the Senate agreed for that Committee to sit on particular days. If private arrangements have been made they should have been made with the consent of the Senate as a whole. As a member of Estimates Committee D I object to flying from Perth on a Sunday to attend a meeting on the following Monday. It does not suit me to have the Committee meet on that Monday. Therefore, I am lodging my objection now. Senator Walters had the opportunity to object at the time this matter came before the Senate. She could have voted against certain sitting days. I wish to lodge my objection.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that I should make a brief explanation in response to the objection which has just been recorded. As the Chairman of Senate Estimates Committee A I was asked by the whole of the Committee at a meeting this evening to see whether it was possible to arrange for a swap to be made to a day which would enable more than half the Committee to be present. I sought to arrange that with any of the three committees which were due to sit on the Thursday rather than the Monday. I was informed later, after consultation with the membership of Estimates Committee D, that a swap would be made. I am grateful to the majority, apparently, of the members of Committee D who have enabled Committee A to sit with more than half its members present. I am sorry if that has adversely affected one member. It was done, might I add, primarily at the request of one of the members of his party.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In October 1981 the Australian Embassy in Washington expressed to the United States Administration its concern about any possibility of plutonium separated from spent nuclear fuel from civil nuclear power stations being used for nuclear weapons. The Government drew the attention of United States officials to the fact that the bilateral agreement between Australia and the United States Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy provides for the peaceful non-explosive use of all items subject to the agreement. United States Department of Energy officials advised our Embassy in Washington that our points would be registered with the US Secretary of Energy Mr James Edwards. The bilateral agreement between Australia and the United States excludes the possibility of any nuclear material supplied from Australia under the agreement being used in warheads in the United States or in any other country.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. The Government has accepted the responsibility to ensure through the negotiation of bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements that nuclear material supplied by Australia under those agreements is used exclusively for peaceful, non-explosive purposes. In the case of the United States the relevant Agreement is that concerning peaceful uses of nuclear energy signed on 5 July 1979.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Australia does not enter into treaty commitments on the asssumption that they will be dishonoured. As with all of Australia's nuclear safeguards agreements that with the United States of America provides for sanctions such as suspension of further transfers in the event of non-compliance with stipulated obligations of the agreement including the prohibition of explosive or military application of the items supplied under the Agreement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) All non nuclear weapon states, that is all countries other than the five existing nuclear weapon states recognised by the Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT), which are not parties to the NPT are not eligible to receive Australian uranium or to enter into bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements with Australia. The question does not, therefore, arise for such countries.</PARA>
<PARA> Nuclear weapon states retain the right to use nuclear material for weapons as well as for peaceful purposes. Australian policy requires that we may export only to those nuclear weapon states whether or not they are parties to the NPT, which give Australia an assurance that the nuclear material we may supply for peaceful purposes is not diverted to military or explosive purposes and accept that the material be covered by International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. Australia has entered into bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements with Britain and the United States which are parties to the NPT and France which is not a party to the NPT. Our agreements with these three countries as with all of our bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements meet Australia's policy requirements including the incorporation of Australia's prior consent rights over retransfers , reprocessing and high enrichment. Nuclear material supplied by Australia under the agreements with these countries is subject to IAEA safeguards which provide assurance that the uranium we may supply for peaceful purposes is not diverted to explosive or military purposes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 1971 there has been provision in the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme for the preservation of superannuation rights, in certain circumstances, of persons moving between Commonwealth employment and other employment, including employment with a State of local government authority.</PARA>
<PARA> For a person leaving the Commonwealth scheme, preservation may be effected by means of:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the payment of a transfer value (a lump sum that includes an employer component) to an approved scheme; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) where the person does not become a member of an approved scheme, a deferred benefit (generally a pension payable on age retirement, invalidity or death).</PARA>
<PARA> An approved scheme is one where the employing authority has entered into a reciprocal arrangement involving the payment of transfer values between schemes.</PARA>
<PARA> Although many State university schemes are approved schemes for the purposes of the preservation arrangements under the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, most State Governments have so far been unwilling to enter into preservation arrangements with the Commonwealth that would facilitate the payment of transfer values between schemes. Consequently, where officers meeting the requirements for preservation elect to preserve their Commonwealth superannuation rights on transfer to State or local government employment, their only recourse is to accept eligibility for the deferred benefit alternative.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 16 February 1982 (Hansard, page 9) Senator McLaren asked a question without notice seeking information relating to government home loans. The Minister for the Capital Territory has supplied the following information in reply to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr P. J. Nixon) discharged his Commonwealth of Australia loan in December 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Mr Anthony and Mr Nixon purchased their government-built houses with the assistance of fixed interest-rate Commonwealth of Australia mortgages in December 1964 and August 1970.</PARA>
<PARA> Before September 1974 all Commonwealth of Australia mortgage documents relating to the purchase of government houses in Canberra made no provision for variation of the interest rate that was applicable at the date a mortgage was granted. It was recognised that this was an anomaly and after September 1974 all new applicants to buy their government houses were required to enter into mortgages with variable interest rates. Under existing law it was not legally possible to vary mortgages entered into by mortgagors, including Mr Nixon and Mr Anthony, before that date.</PARA>
<PARA> Since 1974 government housing loans have been made available to low income earners on generous terms and conditions. such loans currently commence at an interest rate of 5 3/4 per cent (effective) per annum, with this rate escalating by  1/2 per cent per annum until the full non-concessional rate of 11 3/4 per cent (effective) is reached. Where a mortgagor can demonstrate that the annual increase would cause undue hardship escalations may be deferred.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 18 February 1982 (Hansard, page 141), Senator Keeffe asked me a question without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry in the Senate. His question concerned the 10 per cent of Japanese beef tenders usually allocated to the private quota.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In response to the senator's question concerning what control the Government has over beef exports to Japan, I would point out that such exports are subject to all the requirements of the Exports (Meat) Regulations and conditions and restrictions imposed by the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation on the licensed exporter. The Government has no control over the handling, distribution or sale of the beef in Japan. That is a matter for the relevant Japanese authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to reiterate that all imports of beef into Japan are subject to a global import quota. The annual level of the quota is set by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) in consultation with the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). The quota comprises a general quota which is usually around 85 per cent of the total quota and various special quotas accounting for the rest. These special quotas comprise those for Okinawa , boiled beef, school lunches, hotels, ship and airline stores.</PARA>
<PARA> The general quota is split into two segments, 90 per cent of which is handled by the Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation (LIPC), a Japanese Government organisation, and 10 per cent by private importers.</PARA>
<PARA> The private quota is allocated by MITI on advice of MAFF, to end-users in the ratio of 70 per cent to the All Japan Meat Traders' Co-operative Federation, 20 per cent to the Japan Ham and Sausage Processors' Co-operative Association and 10 per cent to the Japan Meat Canners' Association. The quota is allocated amongst a set number of designated importing companies who sell the meat to the above-listed end-users according to the entirlement which these groups hold. The meat purchased for the private quota may be sourced from any country approved by the Japanese authorities including Australia.</PARA>
