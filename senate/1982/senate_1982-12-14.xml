<TITLE>Aircraft Manufacturing Industry</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Senators in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Aircraft Manufacturing Industry has suffered serious setbacks since its creation, because of the lack of a coherent Australian Government Policy for the industry, as illustrated by:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Reduction in RAAF flying hours.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Cut backs in the Grumman Tracker.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. It refers to files released yesterday by the Australian War Memorial and the information that apparently the Department of Defence, from 1969 until 1971 at least, placed automatically in a Defence Department file called 'Herbicides- enemy propaganda campaign' articles concerning the possible side effects of the use of herbicides in Vietnam, including such articles as the one referred to in the Canberra Times this morning, an article from the New Yorker of 7 February 1970 which I believe on anybody's reading of it would be considered to be a scientifically sound and historically correct article. Was this and is this the practice in the Minister's Department-that reports of this type and quality are put in files labelled 'Enemy propaganda campaign'? Is it the attitude of his Department that anyone who questions the use or the side effects of herbicides in Vietnam or elsewhere is indulging in an enemy campaign against this country?</PARA></TALK.START>

I am not sure whether the item to which Senator Grimes has referred, an item which appeared in the New Yorker, which I have not seen and about which I do not know, is included in the library of the Department of Veterans' Affairs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention has been drawn to the letters which appeared in the Age and the Australian newspapers and which inquired about the possibility of the freeze affecting pensioners. I am sorry that pensioners have been put to concern. I indicated to the Senate some time ago that I had some inquiries and, as a result, issued a news release on 16 November confirming the Government's statement, which had also been made by the Treasurer, Mr Howard, that the proposed pause would not affect the indexation of pensions and benefits. That release was not given any coverage in the media. The matter was then raised in the Senate-by Senator Colston, I think. I answered a question. I re-issued a Press release. Once again, there has been little or no Press coverage of that. The letters published this morning indicate that it is a matter of public interest and, for some pensioners, a matter of concern. I welcome the question asked by Senator Bonner, because it gives me a chance again to put on the public record the fact that the Government does not propose to interfere with the indexation arrangements; that is, that the twice-yearly adjustments to most pensions and benefits which occur in November and May will proceed in the normal course. I merely use this opportunity to appeal to the media to cover that aspect of the Government's policy to avoid any unnecessary worry on the part of pensioners and beneficiaries.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O97">Senator ELSTOB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. I refer to the recent Australian Council of Social Service pensioner phone-in survey. The survey report has revealed the continuation of acute problems within the Social Security and Health departments in dealing with the invalid pensioner -particularly the 85 per cent eligibility rule, the insensitivity of medical officers and the severe difficulties faced by sick and elderly people forced off the invalid pension on to unsuitable benefits or none at all. Why has the Minister seen fit to continue using 'unsympathetic and hostile' medical officers -to use the report's words-to conduct pension eligibility examinations? In view of the dramatic increase in social security tribunal appeals and all the unnecessary hardship that this causes to genuine cases, why has the Minister not implemented his own Department's recommendations for medical officers to accept and practise consultation with social workers to provide a more effective and efficient assessment of invalid pensioner applications?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3421" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of the invalid pension has been raised on a number of occasions. I am, of course, familiar with the phone-in which was organised by the Australian Council of Social Service and the report it prepared on the basis of the people who telephoned. It did not require the ACOSS phone-in or that recent action to get me and my Department to direct attention to the problems in the administration of the invalid pension. The matter has, of course, been raised in the Senate on a number of occasions and I have outlined the steps which have been taken to remove the difficulties which have been experienced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I notice that Senator Elstob referred to me personally in his question when he asked: Why has the Minister seen fit to continue using unsympathetic doctors? The position is that the doctors used are medical officers under the supervision of the Department of Health. In other words, we go to the Department of Health for the medical assessment which is required as part of our obtaining information to decide whether someone is incapable of work. I do not accept that there is a general use of unsympathetic doctors. Of course I cannot deny that some doctors may not be sympathetic. The difficulty in dealing with the sort of allegation which has been made by ACOSS, and which is repeated by the honourable senator, is the lack of specific complaint. On a number of occasions I have asked ACOSS to be particular in the complaints it makes so that they can be followed up properly. The Australian Council of Social Service has declined to give us the particulars which would enable us to check individual cases. I can say only that the Government has no wish to use people in this area who are not sympathetic to the claimants. I have no direct, hard evidence that any particular doctors who act as Commonwealth medical officers are not behaving in a proper way. I suggest that if there is any such evidence it be given to me, my Department, the Department of Health or the Minister for Health.</PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Elstob's information about the increase in appeals might be a little out of date. I have previously commented in the Senate on the fact that there is a larger number of appeals than we would wish, particularly in both Queensland and New South Wales, that we have been tackling the question of the primary decision making-in other words, trying to reduce the number of decisions which give rise to appeals-and that we have been acting to streamline the appeals procedure. I recently gave some statistics to Senator Colston who raised questions about the delay being experienced in Queensland. I think the present position would be that the number of appeals is declining, rather than increasing, as we direct more attention to the improvement of primary decision making.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as the last part of the question is concerned, it was not absolutely clear to me just what recommendations of my Department it is said I have not followed. I can say that some discussions have been held on whether the Department ought to revert to having its own medical officers. The advice which I have been tendered-my own view is the same-is that we should not go into the business of having our own separate set of medical practitioners for social security matters. I think that would be inefficient and costly and would not advance the cause of the invalid pensioner. If that is not the point of the honourable senator's question, he might look at the Hansard 'pinks' of his question and my reply and either ask me another question tomorrow or place a question on notice. The general position is that we use medical practitioners through the Department of Health. We are in the process of producing a rather more detailed form for the use of doctors conducting those medical examinations, which I think will more accurately document the non-medical and social factors which are relevant to these cases. We certainly intend to continue trying to improve our decision making in this area.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I understand that about 118 countries have signed the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea this year. Some countries did not sign it or deferred a decision on signature for a variety of reasons. In some cases, this was due to deficiencies that they saw in Part 11 of the Convention dealing with mining of the deep sea bed. We also have some difficulties with Part 11 but have taken the view that the overall benefits of the Convention outweigh its disadvantages. Australia continues to hope that the Convention will come to be universally supported and provide an agreed framework for all aspects of the use of the seas. The principal reason why we became a signatory to it is that there is a necessity for an agreed framework for the use of the seas and all aspects of that. As was stated or implied in Senator Watson' s question, some countries have not signed it. For instance, the British Government has referred in its statement on signature to the possibility of amendment of the Convention in ways that would make it more generally acceptable . If realistic proposals to this end could be devised, this would obviously have our closest attention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another aspect to take into account is that, as we consider ratification of the Convention, we would be looking at any aspects of our position that unfolded as a result of other nations' approach to it or recommendations that were put forward. Having given very close consideration to the desirability of having a law of the sea convention, with as many countries as possible becoming signatories to it, we considered that at this stage we would become a signatory to it. Most of our neighbours have signed the Convention. I will see whether the Minister for Foreign Affairs wishes to detail any particular arguments, as requested by Senator Watson. But, in general terms, we see the desirability of the application of the law of the sea amongst the countries which would need to work together in its use. Subject to any particular amendments that we may wish to raise during the ratification process, I think it is a desirable objective to achieve.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Treasurer a question concerning bank profits. I have given her a broad hint that I might ask this question. I refer to the substantial profits of banks during 1980-81, most of which represented increases in the order of 25 per cent to 30 per cent. Is she aware that, in contrast to most other industries, the profits of most banks and other financial institutions have continued to grow unabated during 1981-82? I refer also to finance institutions such as Custom Credit Corporation Ltd which reported a profit increase of 26 per cent to $30.8m in the last year. Is she aware that banks-including, astonishingly, the Commonwealth Bank-further increase the effective rate of interest to borrowers by making additional charges called 'service fees' and a whole host of other imposts in addition to interest and normal bank charges? Does she agree that banks and all other lending institutions should be required to cease immediately all charges except interest and a service account charge so that the hapless borrowers who have no way of disputing these extra imposts can budget for their commitments and so that banks which enjoy a part-monopoly because of legislation of this Parliament cannot, by sneaky and surreptitious means, increase the real rate of interest being charged to their customers?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I will need to obtain more specific information on some aspects of Senator Chipp's question. But, as I am advised at present, bank profits in Australia in 1981-82 have not kept pace with inflation. Indeed, profits from banking operations of the three major private banks and the Commonwealth Bank have declined in nominal terms in 1981-82. Bank charges are related to the cost of the individual services provided. If bank charges were lowered, banks would have to raise interest rates charged to borrowers. One measure of protection afforded to depositors is the level of capital reserves available in bank balance sheets. As profits are the major source of resources, profits must keep pace with inflation if capital reserves are not to be depleted and depositor protection endangered. As I said, there are some specific matters on which I am not yet advised and I will advise Senator Chipp as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>

I ask: Does she agree that bank profits in 1980-81 rose by 25 per cent to 30 per cent and that they have continued unabated in the same fashion in 1981 -82? Does she also agree that the Custom Credit Corporation reported a profit increase last year of 26 per cent, namely, $30.8m?

Indeed, the banking operations of the three major private banks and the Commonwealth Bank declined in nominal terms in 1981-82. That is the information as I have it.

In view of the article in the Sydney Morning Herald entitled 'Justice Murphy criticises diversion of funds', will the Minister, for I believe the hundredth time, explain to the Senate and all who want to listen and understand the system of funding of government and private schools by the present Federal Government?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3423" SPEAKER="Baume Sen The Hon P.E." NAMEID="ME4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="EDUCATION" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I saw the article in which certain remarks were attributed to Mr Justice Murphy. He is, of course, not the only member of the Senate who has the record of having been a pupil at a New South Wales public school and he is not the only one who is proud of his time at a New South Wales public school. I do not think his assertions on funding are correct, but in any case I will answer Senator Lajovic's question briefly by reiterating that there are three partners in the funding of education in Australia. The three partners are the Commonwealth Government, the State governments and non-government sources, private sources. When one adds together the inputs from the three partners in education funding, the figures that emerge show that at the secondary level the government secondary schools have the greatest number of dollars to spend and the government secondary schools have the best pupil-teacher ratios.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On that basis alone there are no grounds for asserting that government schools in Australia are disadvantaged. They run a good system, well supplied with resources and with appropriately small class sizes. Those who do not recognise those facts simply do not want to recognise what the truth is. The truth is that , when the contributions of the three funding partners are taken into account, the government schools in Australia are well resourced. If one looks at the non- government schools, one finds that that is where the poverty is in education, particularly in the Catholic school system. There are large class sizes and small inputs of dollars. Even for the independent non-government schools, the non-Catholic ones, the resource inputs are generally less than or at about the same level as those of government schools.</PARA>
<PARA> People tend to confuse the assets which schools have available with the income and resources which they have available to run them from year to year. The assets have been built up over generations. The amount of money available to run the schools is what the debate is about and in that debate there is no validity to the claim that the government system is disadvantaged or that it is failing.</PARA>

I refer to a recent newspaper article headed 'Heart attacks-Aspirin new hope'. In that article it was detailed that a study of some 1,300 men suggested that an aspirin a day cuts in half the chance of having a heart attack, due, most probably, to the aspirin's known ability to inhibit blood clotting. Will the Minister comment on such use of aspirin and ask the Minister for Health to issue guidelines based upon research into this matter that has been carried out already throughout the world in the way of using aspirin as a preventative against such serious things as heart attacks?

I reiterate that the factors to which we have to be directing most attention if we are serious about reducing heart attacks in Australia-after all, this is the single largest cause of death among adults-is to control high blood pressure, to reduce the incidence of smoking, to get people to keep their weight under control and, most importantly, to get them to select carefully the genes which they inherit; in other words, to choose their parents well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can elaborate but in the interests of the Standing Orders of the Senate I will not elaborate at great length. The announcement which was made by the Government yesterday has not yet evinced a response from State Ministers but they received the communication only yesterday. I make no criticism of them for that. I am confident that all State Ministers will welcome the suggested use of some of the moneys which can be found from a wage pause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the Premiers Conference a number of States made it clear that they would be interested in seeing extra expenditure in that area. That view comes from both sides of the political fence. I do not think there is any doubt, having met with housing Ministers in Darwin over the last few months, that they will both wish to obtain these funds and be able to utilise them effectively. Subject to the passage of legislation the Commonwealth has indicated that it would be prepared to make money available on a monthly basis commencing in January. There will be no delay in the flow of funds to the States if this option is picked up.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the third part of Senator Archer's question, we estimate that an additional $100m would build about 2,000 houses. I do not have a break-down of that into smaller units. It may well be that some of the money will be spent on smaller units such as pensioner units, particularly if there is building in some of the areas where there is high unemployment but where there may not be a demand for family accommodation. But, looking at this expenditure in terms of family accommodation units, it should add another 2,000 units to the total of welfare houses built next year.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will be aware that the Commonwealth supports a number of umbrella organisations in the social welfare field. It supports the Australian Council of Social Service, which acts as the representative body for some 2,500 welfare organisations which are affiliated with it. It funds ACROD, the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of the Disabled, which performs a similar function for organisations which deal with people with disability. We also fund ACOTA, Australian Council on The Ageing, at a Commonwealth level and the Australian Early Childhood Association. The general policy which has been followed by the Commonwealth in this area is to fund umbrella organisations rather than the myriad single organisations which exist. I think it was the University of New South Wales which said that there are some 37,000 welfare organisations around Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite clearly it would become a very difficult matter if the Commonwealth were expected to have direct funding responsibility with such a plethora of organisations. With respect to Disabled Persons International, I think that the move which gained such strength during IYDP to have disabled people speaking on their own behalf is one of particular significance. Therefore, I have been concerned to try to do what I can, consistent with the policies that we follow in this area, to help Disabled Persons International to become established. In that regard we made some money available to assist disabled Australians to go to Singapore for an international meeting. Recently I have had correspondence from DPI which has requested assistance with respect to, I think, a national conference.</PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the general attitude we have to support of organisations, I have examined that proposal and I have asked my Department to examine it further with a view to seeing whether some form of assistance could be provided for that meeting. I would hope that the assistance would come through and from ACROD rather than directly from the Government because of the policy which I outlined in the earlier part of my answer. I express the view that Disabled Persons International is an important development in the field of advocacy for the disabled in Australia. Subject to the concern that I have to maintain a direct Commonwealth funding relationship with umbrella organisations and not with, as I say, the tens of thousands of organisations which exist in the various social welfare fields, I hope that we will be able to do something to advance the cause of DPI in Australia.</PARA>

Under the Special Youth Employment Training Program a recent directive was issued whereby the subsidy is no longer available to employers with regard to the employment of a member of an employer' s family. Will the Minister reconsider this directive so that officers of the Commonwealth Employment Service can use their discretion in this matter? Representations made to me recently indicate that some examples exist where unnecessary hardship had been created by this directive and, further, that it has encouraged dishonesty and abuse of the scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Special Youth Employment Training Program is an important program which is administered by my colleague the Honourable Ian Macphee. It provides a supplement to the wage cost of somebody who has been unemployed for a considerable time. That supplement is available to people who have been out of employment. Until very recently it was restricted to the young unemployed. I think the Minister has recently announced a wider approach to it. Schemes of this sort need to be administered very carefully because they are open to abuse. Sometimes one reads of complaints that the scheme is being used not to subsidise additional employment but merely to reduce the costs of employment which would have occurred anyway. That is not the object of the scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have discussed that with Mr Macphee and he is satisfied, I think, that the monitoring of the program is adequate and that it is applied to create employment. Certainly it has been effective in obtaining employment for people the greater proportion of whom stay in employment at the end of the subsidy period. I think that is an important indicator of its success. I was not familiar with the restriction against family involvement, but I can imagine that this is, again, simply one of the measures one takes to try to avoid the abuse of public moneys. I can see that if one allowed the general employment of people in a family the scheme could be open to abuse. If the honourable senator has evidence that this is causing hardship in cases where in his view a subsidy would be appropriate I suggest that he draw the particular circumstances to the attention of the Minister to enable the point that he has raised to be considered.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While it is true that Aboriginals in Western Australia do not hold freehold title to the reserves, they have a title which can be altered only by affirmative action by the Parliament of Western Australia. There is a very real protection for them in the kind of tenure which they hold, and this is often forgotten. Aboriginal reserves represent about 8 per cent of the area of Western Australia. As I say, affirmative action by the Western Australian Parliament would be required to alter the tenure. I understand that, for some years, the Pitjantjatjara people generally-Senator McIntosh referred in his question to the Ngaanatjara people-have been seeking land rights over the areas traditionally associated with the Pitjantjatjara people of Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory. Of course, they regard themselves as one people with one language and one land. They have been consistently opposed to divisions in land tenure arrangements which have resulted through the accident that some of them are in the Northern Territory, some in South Australia and some in Western Australia where different arrangements apply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As early as 1976, the Commonwealth took the initiative at a meeting of the Aboriginal Advisory Council to urge the Ministers concerned to investigate the manner in which a common land rights title for the central reserve areas could be given to the Pitjantjatjara people. I understand that the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs argued for the implementation of this proposal through State and Commonwealth legislation, pointing out, of course, that the Commonwealth had already laid the basis with the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. Subsequently, there has been the enactment of the Pitjantjatjara land rights legislation in 1981 in South Australia. Therefore, the problem is one that concerns Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> As I say, the tenure arrangements in Western Australia are more secure than is generally realised. I understand that the Western Australian Government has consistently maintained that its Act-the Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority Act-provides the best possible protection for Aboriginals for reasons which I have set out already in my answer. Accordingly, the State Government will not consider granting freehold title in respect of Aboriginal reserves administered under that Act. That is what I understand the position to be. I read in the newspapers that there had been a march and that there had been a meeting. I understand that the Western Australian Premier, Mr O'Connor, reiterated the State Government's policy of maintaining the existing status of the reserves. I simply say once again that an Act of the Western Australian Parliament would be required to change the tenure of reserves and for that reason tenure is secure. It would require a very public decision and a very public declaration if anyone wished to diminish the rights of the Aboriginal people who are involved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the editorial, which seeks to make the point that it is important that there should be better and closer relations and understanding between Indonesia and Australia. I think that it is a timely reminder to all Australians that this should be so. Indonesia, our nearest neighbour, has some 140 million people and this number will increase to some 200 million by the turn of the century. It is a stable, non-communist country which plays a very important role in not only the Association of South East Asian Nations but also the Western Pacific generally. Its role will become increasingly important. I have observed, having travelled very widely in many parts of Indonesia over a lifetime, the very rapid uplifting of the living standards of its people in the last 20 or 30 years in the face of enormous difficulties posed by its having some 3,000 islands stretched over a distance of 2,000 miles. This presents tremendous difficulties for a country that some 30 years ago had only a very low standard of living. I believe that Indonesia is making very strong efforts in that regard and wants to bring to its people higher living standards.

Had the Labor Party done that, then the people who voted in Tasmania would not have been under a misapprehension. They were left under the misapprehension, by the Lowe Government and subsequently at the elections, that their vote at the ballot box was sovereign. In fact, the reason that the Labor Party changed was that the Lowe Government was defeated. Had the Lowe Government remained in power it would have built the dam and there would not have been a squeak from the Labor Party. Let the record be perfectly clear. Let it also be clear that the very centralist policies of the Labor Party under the Whitlam Government, which Senator Murphy espoused from this very table, were those that destroyed the Labor Party. Let it go to the people and say that it will intervene in the States, that it will take over State responsibilities and destroy federalism, and then let it see where the issue will lie.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Government and I reject the idea that this Government would suffer at the ballot box. This Government will be respected by the people of Australia for upholding the sovereignty of federalism. Make no mistake at all, the Whitlam Labor Government was rejected and put out of office because of its centralism. The Hayden Labor Party will be rejected in the same way. I reject anything that suggests the use of a centralist power to take over the responsible jobs of the States. No, this Government would have no part of it. It would say that the people of Australia, particularly the people of the less populous States, who know the threats of Labor centralism, will reject any intervention by the Labor Party. The Labor Party now is on the back of a tiger. It got on it because the Lowe Government lost. It would have supported the dam had the Lowe Government won. Because a Liberal government won, it is seeking to capitalise now. It will find that it is riding on the wrong tiger.</PARA></TALK.START>

It highlights the importance of the Government's current actions in another place, and subsequently in here, to bring about a wages and hours freeze . It highlights the fact that what has happened to Australia is that competitively, because of huge wage rises, we have costed ourselves out of world markets and we have created serious inflation and seriously high interest rates here. It draws attention to the fact that the road to recovery and the road to restoration of trade is an abatement, a restraint, of wages.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Chaney, the Minister for Social Security. It relates to the administration of the Commonwealth Employment Service, particularly regarding unemployment benefits and the maintenance of the CES applicant register. Is it true that there has been considerable discussion within the CES regarding the new administrative procedures? In particular, has a feeling developed amongst CES staff that current arrangements do not constitute a lessening of the clerical work load and that this is inhibiting their efforts to concentrate on what they see as their prime task at the moment-the acquisition of vacancies for job seekers? Is it the case that the drop in CES administrative work load that was supposed to occur as a result of the abolition of personal lodgment of the CES card by applicants has in fact not yet occurred?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it true that as a result of these new arrangements confusion has arisen between the CES, which maintains a register of job seekers, and the Department of Social Security, which administers the unemployment benefit? In particular, as a result of these new arrangements, is it true that some CES clients, such as Aborigines and Islanders in Queensland, have been lost to the CES register and therefore lost to CES services, only because of the problems of distance, time and the vagaries of the past? Therefore, will the Minister ensure that the Department will address itself to these problems, not only with the provision of more staff but also with a review of the administration of unemployment benefits and the CES applicant register and the relationships between the CES and the Department of Social Security?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All of those questions suggest a situation which I understand not to be the case. But the question is raised with respect to the operations of a department which I merely represent in this place. I shall therefore need to refer the various questions which Senator Gietzelt has raised to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. It was certainly my understanding that there had been a definite lessening of the clerical tasks required of officers in the CES, as Senator Gietzelt correctly stated in his question, for the purpose of freeing up time within the CES to concentrate on the primary job of matching people who are registered for employment with jobs. I am somewhat surprised, therefore, to hear the assertion in the question. I will check that with the Minister along with the other parts of the question. I do not know of any present confusion between the CES and my Department as to functions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The CES accepts people for registration for employment and conducts various activities which try to match up the registrants and the jobs available. My Department is clearly responsible for the payment of the unemployment benefit. The two departments work substantially, I think, down their separate paths and without the need for a great deal of contact between the two, although there is some interaction. In view of the significance of the points raised, whilst my general impression is that the facts are quite otherwise than those which are suggested by Senator Gietzelt in his question, I will refer the matter to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and endeavour to obtain a reply . In view of the wide-ranging nature of the question I am not sure that I will be able to get a reply before we rise, but I do not think it is the sort of question of which urgency is so much a matter as some proper examination of the points raised.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As was indicated by the Acting Prime Minister when he reported on the Premiers Conference, one of the measures which the Government proposed if it obtained a wages pause was an experiment with some form of community projects program. The object of that would be to provide part time work which would enable people to earn on a voluntary basis the equivalent of the unemployment benefit plus $35 a week, with the people involved in the project being free to seek other part time work as it became available. This proposal is in response to suggestions which have been made, I think throughout the life of the Government and indeed before, that it is a pity to be paying out large amounts of unemployment benefit and not seeing some worthwhile community return. I think following the Regional Employment Development scheme there has been a fair amount of reserve on both sides of the chamber about the practicability of running this sort of work creation program. Certainly there is a concern on the part of the Government that these sorts of approaches may not be cost effective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In view of the seriousness of the unemployment situation and the continued interest of both States and of local government in something along these lines, it is now proposed that there should at least be a trial which would involve, say, 1,000 places to see whether it does produce both socially beneficial and useful results in terms of what is achieved by the work at the end of it. These matters are still in the course of development. The Government has drawn up a set of guidelines which it believes are appropriate. I am today despatching those guidelines to State Ministers and to the Australian Council of Trade Unions and I will be seeking an early response from the States with respect to the proposal. I am optimistic that the response will be positive because prior to the Premiers Conference at least two Premiers, Mr Gray from Tasmania and Mr O 'Connor from Western Australia, indicated their interest in such a scheme, and subsequent to the Premiers Conference Mr Wran went back to New South Wales and I think announced such a scheme. There does appear to be a lot of support at the State level. I would be happy to release the proposed guidelines and I will be putting out a Press release this afternoon giving some more detail.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill amends the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 to repeal section 14 of that Act. Section 14 of the Act imposes an obligation on the Minister not to take action which is inconsistent with the obligations of Australia under international agreements relating to trade. The repeal of this section is principally designed to remove for practical purposes the grounds for any application to the Australian Courts raising the issue of Australia's non- compliance with international agreements, including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Codes and any bilateral agreements, relating to anti-dumping and countervailing duty action. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act enable the Government to take anti-dumping and countervailing duty action against imports. Both actions are designed to offset export prices which are not established on a fair commercial basis. Australia is a signatory to the GATT and the related Codes which establish rules of conduct for anti-dumping and countervailing actions. The Codes, which elaborate on the relevant provisions of the GATT, were part of the outcome of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations, Tokyo Round, concluded in 1979. Australia acceded to the Subsidies and Countervailing Duties Code on 21 September 1982 and to the Anti-Dumping Code on 21 October 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The Codes require that signatories must take all necessary steps to ensure that their domestic legislation conforms with the provisions of the Codes. The Customs Tariff (Anti-dumping) Act was amended in 1981 so that it conforms with the codes. Anti-dumping or countervailing duties cannot be imposed unless it is determined by the relevant authority in the importing country that the goods in question have been dumped, that is, exported at less than normal prices in the country of export, or subsidised and as a result, an industry in the importing country has been injured or threatened with injury. The Codes also limit the extent of countervailing or anti-dumping action to an amount equal to the amount of subsidy or of dumping or the extent to which injury is occurring, whichever is the lesser. </PARA>
<PARA> Where a preliminary affirmative finding of dumping or subsidization is made by the Department of Industry and Commerce as the relevant authority, and there is evidence of material injury or threat of material injury to the domestic industry, the GATT Anti-Dumping and Subsidies and Countervailing Duties Codes permit the taking of provisional action in the form of securities which in Australia, are taken under the provisions of section 42 of the Customs Act. The Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act has facilitated proceedings for injunctive relief in these matters before the Federal Court of Australia. The related Customs Securities (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill which I will introduce shortly contains a provision to remove from the scope of that Act decisions to take securities under the Customs Act as provisional anti-dumping and countervailing measures. That provision will supersede the regulations with similar effect introduced on 24 November 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> In the injunction proceedings before the Court exporters of goods to Australia have used the provisions of section 14 of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act as the basis for arguing that the method by which the Department proceeds to the decisions to require provisional anti-dumping and provisional counter-vailing measures is contrary to Australia's international obligations. Whilst the Department meets the requirements of the Codes in principle these arguments have nevertheless enabled interim injunctions to be obtained. As a consequence the Department has been prevented from taking provisional securities and this has operated to the detriment of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The world wide economic recession has led to a dramatic increase in the number of dumping and countervailing complaints in Australia. The Government is therefore concerned that there should be no impediment to taking quick and effective action to combat unfair trading practices which operate to the detriment of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The repeal of section 14 of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act, as proposed by this Bill, will not effect Australia's adherence to the relevant international obligations. The Government's view is that issues concerning Australia's obligations under the international agreements relating to anti- dumping and countervailing duty action are more appropriately considered within the context of the dispute settlement provisions of the particular agreements rather than in the Australian Courts. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is twofold. It amends the Customs Act to place beyond doubt that securities may be validly taken under section 42 of that Act for the purposes of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act. It also amends the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act to remove from the scope of that Act decisions made under section 42 of the Customs Act to require and take securities in respect of duty that may be payable under the Customs Tariff (Anti -Dumping) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act is the legislation which enables the Government to take anti-dumping and countervailing duty action against imports. This action is designed to offset export prices which are not established on a fair commercial basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Where a preliminary affirmative finding of dumping or subsidisation is made by the Department of Industry and Commerce and there is evidence of material injury or threat of material injury to the domestic industry, provisional action in the form of securities may be taken under the provisions of section 42 of the Customs Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The securities are held in accordance with the time limits specified in the Customs Act until, after inquiry, a final decision is made as to whether dumping or countervailing duties are warranted. </PARA>
<PARA> If the final decision is in the affirmative the securities held are adjusted to the amount of the duty to be imposed. If the decision is that dumping or countervailing duty is not warranted the securities are returned to depositors. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of litigation in the Federal Court the department has been restrained from taking provisional anti-dumping and countervailing securities in respect of the importation of certain goods into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been argued in these proceedings that the terms of section 42 of the Customs Act do not authorise the taking of security for the purpose of protecting Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments in Clause 4 of the Bill provide an express link between section 42 of the Customs Act and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act. This is proposed to remove any doubt as to the validity of requiring securities under the Customs Act for the purposes of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In my Second Reading Speech relating to the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1982 I explained how exporters of goods to Australia have been able to use the existing law to prevent the Department from taking provisional securities. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of Clause 6 of the Bill are designed to minimise the opportunities to prevent the taking of such securities. Under this clause decisions relating to the taking of the securities will be exempted from the scope of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Regulations with similar effect to this clause became operative on 24 November 1982. The provisions in this Bill will however, supersede those regulations and it is the Governnemt's intention that the regulations will be repealed after this Bill receives the Royal Assent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that the removal from judicial review of decisions on provisional securities is essential if anti-dumping and countervailing measures are to be effective in combatting unfair international trading practices which operate to the detriment of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> On 28 October 1982 the Senate amended the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No . 2) 1982 to delete provisions that would have prevented State and Territory Governments from levying special taxes on health insurance organisations registered under the National Health Act. On the same day the Minister for Health moved that the House of Representatives agree to the amendments so that the Bill could pass and the substantial benefits provided for in that legislation would not be delayed. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time, the Minister foreshadowed that the Government would reintroduce the deleted provisions. The Bill now before the Senate contains those provisions . I draw the attention of the Senate to clauses 4 and 6 which preclude the application by any State or Territory of any tax based on or calculated by reference to any matter connected with the business of health insurance. A tax based on the number of contributors or the amount of contributions would be such a tax. </PARA>
<PARA> As indicated during the debate on the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) , the Victorian Government has imposed a levy on health insurance organisations in that State. That levy is at the rate of 80c per week per family contributor and 40c per week per single contributor for basic hospital tables. It has been imposed since 1 August 1982. The levy purports to finance outpatient services provided to insured persons. </PARA>
<PARA> As a further development, the New South Wales Parliament passed legislation on 2 December 1982 to impose an identical levy to Victoria for outpatient services from 1 January 1983. However, the New South Wales Government has gone a step further; it has introduced an additional levy to finance a service that is in no way related to the scope of the basic hospital benefits table, namely, the New South Wales Ambulance Service. The ambulance levy to be effective from 1 February 1983 is at the rate of 60c per week per family contributor and 30c per week per single contributor for basic hospital benefits. There is a total levy on hospital funds in New South Wales of $1.40 a week family and 70c a week for single contributors. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe I should once again place before the Senate the main principles at stake in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated during the debate on the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), this issue raises directly the division of responsibilities between the State and Federal Governments for the hospital systems. </PARA>
<PARA> In September last year the Federal Government introduced new funding arrangements for State hospitals. In all States but South Australia and Tasmania it abandoned the 50-50 cost-sharing arrangements which the Jamison Commission said had 'rewarded the expensive and punished the efficient'. Under the cost- sharing scheme the States were reluctant to accept managerial and planning responsibility for their hospital systems. Because financial responsibility was divided the States had not, in general, bothered to manage their hospitals efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes made last year have been effective in this regard. The States have, in general, begun to make the difficult managerial decisions necessary for efficient hospital systems. There have been difficulties in the transitional phase. There have been disagreements over the revenue-raising capacity of some of the States. The Commonwealth viewed their difficulties sympathetically at the premiers' conference, although some states-most notably Victoria-believed they should have been more generously treated. </PARA>
<PARA> One of Victoria's and New South Wales' major problems has been the institution of an effective revenue collection system for its hospitals, particularly for outpatient services. In communications with the Federal Government the Minister for Health, Mr Roper, has acknowledged that this is an administrative and managerial problem. He has referred to this 'incapacity of Victorian hospitals to devote the requisite resources to the pursuit of fees for all chargeable occasions of (outpatient) service'. The Minister for Health for New South Wales, Mr Brereton, acknowledges that the same problems apply to New South Wales hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> Apparently unable to implement the necessary mechanisms, the Victorian and New South Wales governments decided to abolish outpatient charges for insured patients, and to impose a special levy on them through insurance funds. As stated earlier, New South Wales has decided it will also finance its ambulance services this way. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government cannot object to the Victorian and New South Wales governments' decisions to abolish outpatient charges for insured patients, although it considers it to be an unwise course. The Government's concern is with the particular mechanism these State governments have adopted to finance the resulting revenue shortfall. They have selected a discriminatory tax on a particular group of their residents-those who have been prudent enough to take out health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> The State governments can charge for their outpatient services in whatever way they like, provided they meet the shortfall out of their own funds. Victoria and New South Wales are free to fund their hospitals, as Queensland does, from general taxation or other revenue. The objection of the Federal Government is to this discriminatory levy on those who have health insurance with a registered health insurance organization. </PARA>
<PARA> In adopting this course the Victorian and New South Wales governments have exceeded their responsibility for hospital funding and encroached on health insurance which is the Commonwealth's constitutional responsibility. Parliament has given the Federal Minister for Health power to declare standard hospital fees for health insurance purposes. To protect the insured and to prevent the abuse of the insurance system, the Federal Minister has power to determine the benefit liability and contribution rates of funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The imposition of a levy on the funds by Victoria has altered their financial situation, pushed up contribution rates and reduced the Commonwealth's ability to meet its obilgations to health insurance contributors. The same will now apply in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is also particularly concerned for those pensioners who, though entitled to free health care, have insured themselves in order to have choice of doctor while in hospital. These people, who are already paying for that privilege, now find themselves having to pay an additional cost imposed by the Victorian Government. This unfortunate effect of the levy was brought to the attention of the Government in correspondence from Victorian pensioners who found themselves in this position. Pensioners in New South Wales with basic hospital insurance will be worse off. In addition to the outpatient levy, they will have to find 60c or 30c per week extra for the ambulance levy.</PARA>
<PARA> I would repeat that although the Federal Government acknowledges the power of the Victorian and New South Wales Governments to abolish direct charging for health services, and to replace them with a general tax on their residents, it does not consider it a sound course of action. The implementation of the user- pays principle has had a clear impact on hospital utilisation rates and the abolition of this discipline in Victoria and New South Wales must contribute to an excessive use of very costly and scarce resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Another of the Federal Government's major concerns has been with the fact that the Victorian levy will raise revenue in excess of that required to pay the utilisation of outpatient services by those with health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has estimated that the total annual income to the Victorian Government from this levy will be $44m. Again, on our best estimates, if the Victorian Government were collecting all the outpatient revenue that it should from insured patients by individual charging, it would be collecting $31m at the current level of charges. At this point I should advise honourable senators that further increases in hospital charges in Victoria will occur from 1 March 1983. There is no indication of whether the levy rate will increase. There is a difference of $13m involved, an important $13m since it is a direct tax on the insured to pay for other aspects of the Victorian health system. </PARA>
<PARA> Victoria says that it has suffered in the Grants Commission and the Premier's conference. Very well, let it take the matter up through the established mechanisms like every other State. That course is open to the Victorian Government. I cannot guarantee that it will be successful. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to New South Wales, our estimates indicate that the amount of revenue will be raised by the outpatient levy will closely approximate the amount the Commonwealth estimates should otherwise be raised in that State by individual outpatient charges. However, this in no way detracts from the principles applicable to Victoria as I have stated above. That is, this levy cuts across the Commonwealth's responsibility in administering the health insurance system and runs contrary to the user-pays principle. </PARA>
<PARA> The ambulance levy in New South Wales raises different considerations. This levy does not, as I mentioned earlier, even remotely relate to the benefits available under the basic hospital table. Where will it stop? We may next see a levy on health funds to finance inpatient services with a complete breakdown of the Commonwealth's insurance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of the income tax rebate on the levy raises a very important issue. When introducing the legislation into the New South Wales Parliament to impose the levy, Mr Brereton referred to savings that would be made by current contributors to the ambulance scheme in that state because of the tax rebate that will apply to the ambulance levy. Mr Brereton has made an assumption that is by no means certain at this stage. The whole question of the tax rebate on the levies is a complex one and is being examined by the Taxation Office. If the rebate does apply to the ambulance levy then we could have a situation where the Commonwealth, and therefore taxpayers throughout Australia, are subsidising the New South Wales ambulance service to the extent of about $12m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> I now briefly turn to some of the specific concerns with this legislation raised during the debate on the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some concern that Victoria was not treated equitably in relation to its hospital revenue-raising capacity in the discussions leading up to the Premiers' conference. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not accept that argument. In my opinion considerable leeway was given to all the States to enable them to cope with the transition to the state of full managerial and financial responsibility. However, the Government has made it clear here and in the other place that Victoria can raise issues relating to its share of tax revenues at Premiers' conferences. These are matters which are broader than health funding alone, and are properly matters for discussion between heads of Government and Treasurers. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to correct an error repeated several times by the opposition in the course of the earlier debates on these provisions while they were part of the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) the actions of the Victorian Government do not, in any way to which the Federal Government objects, resemble the funding system of the Queensland Government for its hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> What concerns the Federal Government about these levies is that they are directed at a section of the population for whom the Federal Government has particular concern, for whom it has constitutional responsibility and to whom it provides a special tax rebate-those with health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> By comparison the Queensland Government funds its hospital system from the casket lottery and from general taxation revenue. I say here, as the Minister for Health has said on previous occasions in the other place, that if the Victorian Government (and also the New South Wales Government) want to fund hospitals in that way-through lotteries and from tax revenue, then the Federal Government will not stand in its way. That is entirely a matter for these States . </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Government has protested that up to 2,000 jobs could be lost if it does not make up a shortfall of $20m in health funding. </PARA>
<PARA> Accepting for now the $20m figure and assuming that such a shortfall were recoverable in no other way-both dubious propositions-the unemployment argument may provide a reason for some sort of tax, but it is no case at all for this very discriminatory levy. It is not a sufficient argument for this levy that workers will lose jobs if it is not imposed. Other courses are open to the Victorian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> However I do not accept that the Victorian and New South Wales Governments cannot collect this money. Other State hospital systems can manage it. I remind honourable senators that this levy will only collect money from the insured section of the population. It leaves those without health insurance to be billed in the same was as any ordinary commercial debt, so some billing system is already in place and will remain. </PARA>
<PARA> These arrangements help the Victorian and New South Wales Governments make up a shortfall that exists because it has not pursued the debts of insured patients. What sort of an administrative system, does a State have when it cannot collect debts from a limited number of insured patients? That is the question the Federal Government has been asking. It is the question the Jamison Commission asked, in effect, and it is the reason why the Federal Government in September last year gave the States full responsiblity for the expenditure of hospital funds. On this point Mr Brereton indicated that the New South Wales Government has bad debts of 10 per cent of bills raised. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I draw the attention of the Senate to clause 2 which provides that the Bill will come into operation on a date to be fixed by proclamation. This will allow the Victorian Government time to reintroduce individual charging systems (and for New South Wales to repeal its legislation). Finally, let me emphasise that the proposed amendments do not affect the basic responsibility of the States and the Northern Territory to determine charges for public hospitals. The pupose of the amendments is to ensure that the Federal Government has the power to carry out its full responsiblity in the area of health insurance and to protect contributors' interests. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This was not the sort of agreement which the Australian Labor Party believed we had reached today. But I understand that that is the result of a misunderstanding and I believe it can be overcome. Bearing in mind the nature of the legislation on the Government's program, the time of the year, the sorts of things which we have to get through, the concessions that the Government has made on the program and the undoubted desire of most honourable senators, if possible, to finish business this week, the sort of program which has been put down by the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) is in fact the sort of program to which we had agreed if it were necessary. We would prefer to proceed day by day depending on how we are going. The program involves long sittings even though it allows for meal times. My personal view is that with a little co-operation and sensible debate we may even be able to finish by Thursday evening, 16 December. But I want some sort of guarantee from the Minister other than adding the words 'or until the day's program is completed' to tonight's program. I think it would be reasonable to add those words to the motion relating to Thursday night's sitting. If we find we are in the situation where we have to sit on Friday it would be better to do so after having done a sensible day's work on Thursday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We on this side of the House believe that we have acted responsibly. No Government Bill on the program has been unduly delayed. In fact, any delays have been due to filibustering and States rights battles on the other side of the Senate. In a letter to Senator Sir John Carrick from Senator Button on 19 November we agreed that we would co-operate with the Government within normal sitting hours. Providing that the Government co-operates with us in normal sitting hours this week we believe we can get the legislation through the Senate . If there is a repetition of the sort of filibustering and nonsense that went on last week and the sitting hours are no longer normal we will no longer feel obliged to co-operate. I think the program can be finished by Friday with proper debate and with proper consideration of the legislation. Indeed, it may be possible to finish it by Thursday. But if we do not get the opportunity for proper consideration and proper debate on the matters we will be back here next week, depending on the views of the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine, who I assume have been consulted on this matter. </PARA>

If the business is presented in such a way here that Bills to which we have already foreshadowed amendments come up after the House of Representatives rises we will not feel inhibited in our right to move such amendments.

No consultations have taken place with me on this matter nor, may I say, on the other matter which was adverted to previously. Mr President, I think it is for you to ensure that members of this Senate are consulted about important matters of times of sittings. The only advice that I received was during the lunch hour when a document came up to my office which indicated that we would be sitting tonight. That is the sum total of the difference. As I understand it there was no suggestion that the Senate would meet on Friday. There was no suggestion in that document that we would be meeting on Thursday night. In fact, the proposition sent to my office was that the Senate would sit on Tuesday, 14 December from 1. 45 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. and from 8 p.m. to 11.30 p.m.; on Wednesday, 15 December the proposal was for the Senate to sit from 10 a.m. to lunchtime and from lunchtime to 11 p.m.; and on Thursday, 16 December the Senate was to sit from 11 a.m. until 7 p.m. There was no suggestion in that document that we would sit on Thursday night.

<PARA> I think it is important for the efficient running of this Senate and also for the information of honourable senators who have to re-arrange their activities that consultations take place with all senators in this place. Those consultations should be of a representative character through party Whips or, in the case of those of us who do not have Whips, individually with senators. There is no power, of course, under Standing Orders which you, Mr President, could exercise to ensure that this takes place. I understand that. But at least I feel that a message could quite properly be given to the Government that it ought to consult with every honourable senator in this place about such important matters as sitting hours. If this does not happen, of course, people will get their noses out of joint and express their dismay and discontent about lack of courtesy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week, when this debate was interrupted, I was canvassing an argument that road users should perhaps pay for road construction and maintenance but had outlined the fact that already road users were paying substantial taxes to State and Federal governments. I indicated that the crude oil levy and excise on petroleum had yielded to the Federal Government , over the last three years, about $12,500m and that of this sum about 15 per cent, or $1,978m, had come back to road users. I suggested that perhaps the figure of 15 per cent was far too low, that there was available sufficient money to ensure that additional taxes would not be needed to finance the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program. But, of course, increased taxes will have to be paid by motorists throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Prior to the introduction of the Budget in August excise totalling 5.155c a litre was levied on petroleum products and road diesel fuel. To allow the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program to proceed that excise level was raised by 1c to 6.155c a litre. For those who were brought up on the use of the term 'gallon', that is equal to an excise of about 28c a gallon. I found that interesting because the excise alone is now more than the total amount I paid for a gallon of petrol when I began driving. </PARA>
<PARA> The story of the increase of 1c a litre does not end there. Next year the surcharge will be doubled, to 2c a litre, in addition to all other fuel taxes imposed. To speak in terms of one or two cents a litre, or even the 6.155c total that applies at the moment, does not illustrate what the impost really means to the Australian motorist. The Minister for National Development and Energy ( Senator Sir John Carrick) said in his second reading speech that a charge of 2c a litre would cost the average motorist, travelling 15,000 kilometres a year, about an additional 67c a week. That may not sound very much, but it amounts to some $35 a year, a significant sum when we realise that it is in addition to what the motorist is already paying. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the Minister cited the experience of a driver of a 38-tonne truck who travels from Sydney to Melbourne, suggesting that as a result of the imposition of an extra 2c a litre he would spend an additional $18 in fuel on a round trip. Again, if the same driver undertook a return journey from Brisbane to Melbourne his fuel bill would increase by $45. It would be naive in the extreme to believe that those additional costs will not be passed on and thus have an inflationary effect on the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> In speaking to the Bill last Thursday I mentioned that it was a pity that steps had not been taken many years ago to establish a national roads system of which Australia could be proud. Unfortunately, in real terms, under the Fraser Government, there has been a steady reduction in Commonwealth spending on roads. The Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt) stated earlier this year, in replying to the Labor shadow Minister for Transport, Mr Peter Morris, that in the five years to 1980-81 there had been, in real terms, a reduction of $517m in Commonwealth road grants to the States. The Minister's answer revealed that in Queensland, the State that I represent, the loss over the period amounted to $ 95m. The expenditure of an additional $95m would not have solved the road problems of Queensland but it would have gone a long way towards alleviating some of the urgent problems that the State faces. </PARA>
<PARA> One aspect of funding for the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program which must not pass unnoticed is that many users of diesel fuel will be contributing towards the program though their industries are not related to transport. Bakers, brickworks and off-shore tourist resorts will all contribute one cent a litre, and two cents a litre next year, to the road program. Perhaps the most ironic of all the requirements is for State railways to pay the levy on diesel fuel and so contribute towards road construction. Because of the immense loads that diesel engines haul they use a tremendous amount of fuel. A passenger train like Queensland's 'Sunlander' uses one litre of fuel for every 250 metres that it travels-four litres a kilometre. Some of the long coal trains in Queensland have a tremendous thirst. They consume a litre for every 50 metres travelled-about 20 litres a kilometre. </PARA>
<PARA> All that fuel attracts an excise of 6.155c a litre whereas it did not attract any excise prior to the August Budget. That 6.155c includes one cent a litre for road funding and next year that will be increased to two cents a litre. I would have thought that assistance to rail authorities would ease the burden of road construction and maintenance. Surely if rail freights are more competitive then heavy freight will be carried more by rail than by road. The policy of requiring rail authorities to pay the fuel levy, as well as the total excise where no excise was previously payable, seems to be a deliberate attempt to reduce the competitiveness of the rail authorities, and thus put more emphasis on road freight and therefore a greater need for road construction and maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the Senate's attention to that part of clause 23 of the Bill which states that tenders must be called for roadworks funded under the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program. I express some concern about the effects that tendering is having on employment in country areas and in particular on small country towns. I have spoken to workmen in rural areas who have been dismissed and to others who have been threatened with dismissal because local authorities cannot compete with private contractors. I fully understand the difficulties in coming to policy decisions about the need or otherwise to tender . However, the social consequences of these policy decisions must be carefully examined because where no alternative work is available the effect on rural workers who lose their livelihood and on the small community in which they live is simply devastating. Finally, I make some comments about Queensland's roads. I made some comments last week but I would like now to follow them up. The Minister for Transport and Construction, Mr Hunt, in his second reading speech on the Bill in the House of Representatives indicated that earlier this year he undertook an inspection of the Bruce Highway between Rockhampton and Townsville. He reported on that inspection as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the condition of the road was, to put it mildly, totally inadequate for a national highway which was serving an area undergoing such rapid development. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister's comments were certainly mild compared to those of some people who have used the same section of the Bruce Highway and of those many people who have to use it regularly. It is a pity that Mr Hunt did not motor past Townsville. His comments then may not have been so mild. North Queensland residents do expect that their roads will be upgraded and they are looking for substantial funds from the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund for that purpose. Along with other senators from Queensland and Queensland members of the House of Representatives, I will be examining with great interest the details of the funds allocated for that part of Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in supporting the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund Bill. In the interests of the Senate's rising this week I have severely abridged the speech I had prepared . This is a particularly important piece of legislation for Queensland. The Bill is probably one of the most constructive and refreshingly innovative that we have seen before this chamber for some time. Simply, it will give us better roads sooner. I hope that the Government can see its way clear to accelerate the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program so that the work we are going to do and the roads we are going to build under it, can be advanced to provide a benefit to employment now, when it is needed, and all the spin-offs that will come from that. Although the days of unskilled labour and building roads with picks and shovels are no longer with us, accelerating this program will have an effect on the unemployment figures in this country. Also, it will put the country in a more competitive position by lowering our costs of production. Transport is a large component of the production costs of Australia. It is a vast country and surface transport is the predominant way of moving. It is an inherent part of our way of life. All the public transport programs in urban areas have failed because people have failed to recognise the inherent part that cars have in the Australian way of life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apart from New South Wales and Victoria-I suppose that even there the roads could be better, in the best of all possible worlds-the roads in Australia are poor. I have thought for many years about the desirability of introducing toll roads in this country. I first used them 18 years ago in the United States of America and I am impressed with the concept. In a sense we will have a toll here . The figure of $35 a year that Senator Colston brought up is in a sense a toll that we will pay for the accelerated production of roads. An amount of $35 is a miniscule cost for the enormous benefits we will get. I do not agree with Senator Colston that $35 is much of an impost because the true cost of running any car is probably well over $1,000 or $2,000 a year. Very few people appreciate what it costs to keep a car on the road. These funds provided by this Bill will be additional and separate from the $3.65 billion provided under the existing funding program, and together they will provide $914m in 1982-83 and $1 ,208m in 1983-84. That contribution will have a significant effect on the rate of road construction. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the important parts of this Bill is the caveat that the States will be compelled to maintain their ratio of fundings. If they fall fack on what they are spending at present, then the benefit that they achieve under the Bicentennial funding program will be curtailed in the following year. Certainly in my own State, under the Minister for Main Roads, we have seen in the past a reduction in State funding as Commonwealth funding has increased. The State has then got stuck into the Commonwealth and attacked it for not spending as much money on roads in Queensland. That is quite incorrect. As Senator Colston said, we have no less an authority than the Federal Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt) saying that the Bruce Highway between Rockhampton and Townsville is the worst national highway in Australia. That has to be related to the importance of the north and the large number of people who live up there. It is important for trade in Australia and indirectly because Queensland has the greatest length of national roads-something like 24.45 per cent of Australia's national roads-which have to be maintained and expanded. </PARA>
<PARA> The benefits that will come from this program are many. The one that is predominant is that of safety. Quite some years ago the United States highway trust funds were set up to build 42,000 miles of road and it was found that, as a result of that highways trust funding road construction, there were significant savings in the accident rate and in human lives. The cost of road deaths is appalling. In Queensland in 1980-81, 594 people were killed and over 9 ,000 people injured. In 1981-82 we had 609 killed. The cost of road accidents cannot fully be measured, but in looking after injured people and in the damage caused it is probably in excess of $3 billion a year. We have to remember that 92 per cent of all ground traffic in Australia is in cars, and those cars use roads, but apart from the human suffering, we have a cost on our cost of production, and 25 per cent is estimated to be the on-cost to the movement of goods in Australia because of qualitative defects in the road systems, the delays occasioned by the poor roads and the cost of repairs-unnecessary repairs- to the transport vehicles by using those roads. </PARA>
<PARA> Where will this money go in Queensland? What are our prime requirements? The first priority is to get some all-weather roads. The Bruce Highway is not an all -weather road. It passes through areas which are subjected to high rainfalls, flooding cyclonic rains, and it is absolutely essential that the great centres such as Cairns, Townsville, Mackay and Rockhampton have access to the rest of Australia by all-weather roads. Many of those roads are poorly engineered. They were built originally as cheaply as they could be built, and they follow the line of least resistance, often up valleys, and they have low bridges over creeks which frequently go under in any sort of flood rains at all-but even storms will put some of those bridges under. The other defect of the bridges in that area is that they are often one-way bridges. It is a particularly fatal form of Russian roulette, even though they have a 'give way' sign on them on one side, when southern tourists and semi-trailers battle it out with the locals as to who should have the right of way on a bridge. The consequences of that are nearly always tragically fatal. </PARA>
<PARA> So our requirement is to raise the level of the roads in a physical sense, to get them above flood levels and to get some wider and higher bridges so that they are not innundated after the first downpour. We certainly want to improve the location and alignments of roads and we certainly need wider sealed surfaces . Many of those roads are far too narrow. The roads being narrow, the shoulders break down, particularly at times of high rainfall and we end up with a narrower ribbon of bitumen, which again has inherent safety problems. I do not see why road engineers cannot build roads, even if they are going to build them narrow, with a flush concrete edging like a kerbing on a gutter that is sunk into the road so that the bitumen cannot break down and cannot spread. I do not see why bitumen cannot be supported by 6 inches or 12 inches of concrete going down maybe 12 inches to 18 inches into the road surface. That would contain the bitumen and stop it breaking up in times of bad weather. </PARA>
<PARA> In a general sense, our last requirement is for more bypasses on the Bruce Highway. Nambour is a classic example where the whole of the traffic from the north has to go down a steep hill, on a narrow road through the centre of a very busy country town. Apart from physical benefits, there will be enormous benefits socially. Australia is a large country. Communication between the people in various parts of it is important from a social point of view. There will be benefits in the reduction of fuel expenditure because time will be saved and there will be savings in the cost of repairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill provides that the work will be done by tender. Senator Colston and Senator Bjelke-Petersen have spoken against the tender system. I am very firmly in favour of the way in which the Commonwealth Government, for some years now, has said that for national highways construction work will go to public tender. In no sense does that deny a local authority the right to tender. But as the members of this Parliament disbursing public funds we have an obligation upon us to get the maximum value for each dollar that we spend. The simple fact of life is that if we do work by tender we get twice the length of roads built as we do if we put the work to an in-house deal with the local authority. The Australian Labor Party and the National Party of Queensland have a vested interest-it is perfectly legitimate; it is just party politics-in supporting the local authorities there, because many of their professional politicians come up through shire and city council ranks. It is important there from a vote getting point of view, particularly in smaller towns and hamlets, to have a road maintenance crew of maybe 20 or 120 men living in a town who are dependent on the local authority for their work. That is just a fact of political life. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very conscious of the social consequences raised by Senator Colston that if the local authority does not get the road construction work those men do not have employment and, therefore, their position cannot be maintained by the council. It is not a loss of maybe 20 jobs but a loss of maybe 20 times three, when their families are included. In a small country town it can be a very significant factor if those people leave. But there are two answers to that. The first is that if a local authority, knowing the area, cannot compete with a contractor who probably comes from 500 or 1,000 miles away and who has no knowledge of local conditions then, bluntly, that authority should not be in the business and the public purse should not be supporting it. The second thing is that if the social consequences are so severe that no other employment can be found for these employees, the correct thing to do is to pay a subsidy directly to the shire or city council involved. Let us support people openly by direct subsidy so that we know what it costs. Let us not do it indirectly by giving them work on specious economic grounds, where the true cost of supporting those people is hidden and not known. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Labor Party, whilst giving support to the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund Bill 1982, is cognisant of its many shortcomings. To that extent, we have moved a second reading amendment to the Bill, as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) recognises the special roads needs of the various regions of Australia and deplores the failure of the Government to make provision in the Bill for an equitable allocation of national roads funds between the States and the Northern Territory; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) condemns the Government for its discriminatory decision to allocate an inadequate level of funds to local government bodies for local roads'. </PARA>
<PARA>In case senators on the Government side think that our amendment is moved just for political purposes, let me say that the second reading speech of the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick) gives credence to our amendment, because on page 3 of his speech he said that the Commonwealth acknowledges that the level of its funding of roads in recent years has not kept pace with increases in road construction costs. We in the Australian Labor Party are well aware of that too. That is the reason we have moved the amendment. I hope that it will be carried. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to give a brief history of road funding going back over the last seven years. Between 1975-76 and 1980-81 the Fraser Government slashed real federal funding for roads by $517m. The effective cutbacks in each of the States was as follows: New South Wales, $92m; Queensland, $95m; my own State of South Australia, $77m; Victoria, $112m; Western Australia, $111m; and Tasmania, $30m. In the same period, annual Federal fuel taxation revenue more than quadrupled. The Commonwealth cut its share of total road funding by 20 per cent between 1975 -76 and 1979-80. To compensate for this, the States' share rose by 28 per cent over the same period. That means that States had to find more money out of their general revenue to maintain their road programs. Local government, likewise, has been severely hit by reduced Federal road funding. That is borne out, again, by the figures given by the Minister in his second reading speech to which I shall refer later if I have time; like the previous speakers, I have had to cut my remarks short. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently about 19 per cent of total Federal revenue from fuel taxation is directed to road works. This includes expenditure under the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program. The paucity of Federal road funds forced the States and local government to direct an increasing share of available funds away from new construction to maintenance works. Full Federal responsibility for national highways was first established by the Labor Government in 1974. We are very proud of that achievement. Last year the Fraser Government abolished the discretionary power of State road authorities to determine which national road projects would be constructed by their own authorities and which should go out to tender. This has caused a substantial job loss from State road authorities, particularly from country depots, reduced roadworks carried out by local government bodies, created inflexibility and long delays in projects and increased paper work and supervision costs as well as forcing up the costs of many works. When one talks to local government authorities, particularly to council clerks, my words are well borne out. Unfortunately the tendering procedure has been extended to cover urban and rural arterial roads and urban public transport projects funded under the ABRD program. The compulsory tendering procedure will be reviewed when the Labor Party returns to Government because we feel a lot of anomalies exist in this compulsory tendering system under which we now operate. </PARA>
<PARA> Federal road funds for arterial and local roads are allocated to the States under the provisions of the Roads Grants Act 1982. In 1982-83, $734m is being provided with $778m in 1983-84 and $825m in 1984-85. The amounts represent increases in cash terms of 7 per cent, 6 per cent and 6 per cent respectively over the previous year's allocation, which are well below the current rate of road construction cost increases of approximately 15 per cent. So we can see with those reductions in funding that our roads, rather than being built to a better standard, will be built to an inferior standard. These moneys will be supplemented by moneys from the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program , which is funded by the Bill we are discussing. </PARA>
<PARA> This program will provide $2,500m for roadwork between 1982-83 and 1987-88. It is being financed by a special tax on motor spirit and diesolene of one cent a litre, doubling to two cents a litre from 1 July next year. It is clear from advice from the New South Wales and Victorian Governments that the national highways projects being promised by the Fraser Government cannot be completed under the program unless the special tax is substantially increased or construction standards are reduced. Unfortunately under this legislation that will happen. In New South Wales alone there will be a shortfall of $1 billion. The Australian Automobile Association, representing 3.5 million motorists, has labelled the program a confidence trick. Many local government authorities are saying the same thing to me. The Association argues that it should be funded from existing federal taxation revenues rather than by the imposition of a further $2.5 billion tax on road users. It argues that the program should have been structured to ensure that heavy road vehicles provide a more realistic share of the cost of roadworks. </PARA>
<PARA> Local government has done badly under the ABRD program. If we look at the second reading speech of the Minister we see that funding has dropped from 15 per cent to 12 per cent under this ABRD legislation we are discussing today. The Australian Council of Local Government Associations had stated that local government will, in net terms, get a negligible increase in funds this year and a substantial reduction in real terms in 1984-85. Roadworks are an important source of jobs with about 64 per cent of direct and indirect expenditure going to the employment of labour. Local government employs about 34,000 people on roadworks in Australia. An expansion of federal funds for local roads would create additional jobs, expecially in country and regional areas. Goodness knows , we could well do with those jobs being created in South Australia at this time , particularly with the massive retrenchments that are going on in the south east of my State due to the downturn in the building industry and the importation of cheap timber from New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> A special local roads job development program to carry out local road construction and maintenance projects would reduce the backlog of local roads needs and create employment. That is something to which we will be giving great urgency when we assume the Treasury benches. A special supplementary provision of road funds could be allocated via the States to local government bodies based on the following criteria: Potential for the development of jobs, established road needs and energy and economic savings to be gained. Overall decisions would need to consider special regional needs of the area in which individual projects are located with final approval resting with the Australian Government. Incompatibility of Federal and State road classifications creates difficulty in providing federal funds to local government. Action is needed to achieve great uniformity in road classifications to ensure that federal funds intended for local roads are transmitted in full to local government. That accords with a decision taken at a meeting of the District Council of Murray Bridge last evening. Whilst the Council agrees with this legislation in principle the District Clerk today told me that the Council is of the opinion that more money should be made available to local government authorities so that the Council can get on with its local road programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Co-operative consultations between Federal, State and local governments are required to develop more effective arrangements. Differing fixed State charges on road users in respect of vehicle licensing and registration bear little relationship to actual use made of the vehicle concerned. Such charges could be replaced at the request of the States by a fuel levy designated by the States, collected by the Commonwealth and returned to the States in full. This would overcome the annual financial hurdle of registration and vehicle licensing charges for motorists. Such a pay-as-you-drive plan would benefit low income earners and pensioners who must operate a motor vehicle. A levy designated by the States would have to be equitable having regard to vehicle usage, and consultation with local government, road transport and motorist organisations would be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party recently sat down for many hours and updated its road program which we will be putting to the people at the next election. I want to make brief reference to some of the things which we have embodied in our policy. Labor, in government, will accelerate construction of the national highway system. We will make grants to the States for the construction of other roads, bicycle paths and boat-loading ramps. We will initiate consultations with State and local governments to ensure that federal road grants for local government are passed on in full to their intended recipients. In consultation with local government, road transport and motorist organisations we will initiate discussions with the States to formulate agreement for the development of a national funding scheme to finance road construction and maintenance, replacing State motoring and road transport charges levied for this program. Subject to contemporary budgetary constraints we will establish a local roads job development program. Whilst we see every time we pick up a newspaper that the Fraser Government is pinching many of the Opposition's policies I would have no grouches at all if, having spelt out what we intend to do in government, the present Government immediately pinched some of the planks of that platform and implemented them, particularly the establishment of a local road job development program. </PARA>

The Government could create jobs. The people who want to work instead of being on the dole and being a burden on the Treasury-not because they want to but because of the Government's policies-in turn will become PAYE taxpayers who would have to pay their tax. There is no way a man in the work force in this country can evade tax. The low income earners pay their tax. The very high income earners, as the honourable senator would know have all the loopholes in the world open to them to evade tax. The Government may ask where this money will come from for the job creation program. It will be returned by way of taxation in one instance. It will also be returned by way of extra taxation paid by small businesses which provide the materials to carry out these works. I could go through the whole ambit of job creation. Instead of paying out money to people who do not have jobs the Commonwealth Government could get some money back into revenue by way of taxation from people who would be employed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund Bill 1982 is a most significant piece of legislation which provides for a six-year program at a cost of $2,500m for the upgrading of the Australian road system. It represents not only an upgrading program for roads but also a commitment by the Government to Australia's future economic development. At the outset, it is interesting to draw attention to the main benefits of the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program. The main benefit accruing from this program will be a major transformation of the Australian road network which will result in improved safety on Australia's roads, improved communication between the States through better arterial roads as well as national highways, additional direct employment for more than 8,000 people in the road construction industry and a grand total of 20,000 jobs both directly and indirectly as a result of the program in its duration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will highlight some of the effects that this program has on South Australia. Under the scheme, South Australia will receive 7.2 per cent of the total funds made available. In real terms, this figure of 7.2 per cent will result in $12.9m and $30.7m being made available for road works in South Australia during the 1982-83 and 1983-84 financial years respectively. When debating this legislation in the other place, my colleague the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) used some interesting figures to demonstrate that South Australia will not receive its rightful share of funds under this scheme. Mr Hall pointed out that, although South Australia consumes 9.34 per cent of total Australian fuel consumption, it will receive only 7.2 per cent of the funds to be made available under this program. It needs to be remembered that this program is to be paid by way of a fuel levy. It seems to me that South Australia is missing out. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt) disputed Mr Hall's figures and suggested that the consumption in that State was actually about 7.9 per cent. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Under this program the South Australian share will be 7.2 per cent. If those figures are right, there is not a great disparity between what the consumption of fuel will be and the allocation to South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I differ with the Minister in this respect. South Australia, regardless of the figures that one uses, is not getting its fair share of normal road grants or grants to be made under this scheme. South Australia has had a fall-off in the percentage of road grants that it receives. This has been noticeable over the last 10 years. This fall-off has been to the benefit of States such as Queensland and Western Australia. In 1971-72, South Australia received 11.62 per cent of total grants. That was done, of course, under the previous scheme which had regard to population and area as the parameters under which the grants were made. But from the level of 11.62 per cent in 1971-72 the level of general road grants has now dropped to 8.22 per cent. The South Australian proportion fell in 1974 because of the enactment of the National Roads Act and the Roads Grants Act which were introduced by the Whitlam Government. It should be pointed out that South Australia has 9 per cent of the Australian population, 15.5 per cent of the area, 12.2 per cent of road length, 9.42 per cent of vehicles and 9.21 per cent of vehicle kilometres travelled. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer again to the speech made by the honourable member for Boothby. It should be noted that, as a former Premier of South Australia, he has an insight into the distribution of money among the three tiers of government in Australia. On 20 October, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> South Australia, under this proposal will get 6.5 per cent of the bicentennial funds for national roads whilst it has 16 per cent of the national road lengths within its borders. We will get 7.6 per cent of funds for urban arterial roads whilst we have 9.25 per cent of arterial roads. For rural arterial roads we will get 7.5 per cent of the funds whilst we have 10.25 per cent of the national total within our border. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the Minister and the Government need to address themselves to the question of equity, that is, we must ensure that the fairest possible distribution of these moneys occurs between the States. South Australia's percentage drop has been to the benefit of Queensland and Western Australia which have received a greater share of road grants. It is argued quite often by defenders of this state of affairs that these States are developing States that are carrying the other States because of the development that is taking place and that, therefore, they are rightly entitled to a greater share of the road grant funds. I do not agree with that argument. We are living in a federal system, supposedly a system of co-operation for the good of the Commonwealth. The fact that Queensland and Western Australia are economically healthier than South Australia should, I believe, strengthen the case that South Australia is entitled to a greater share of the funds. </PARA>
<PARA> According to figures supplied by the Minister, the total road grants-that is, normal grants and grants to be made under this program that we are now discussing-will rise by 30 per cent in South Australia, 35.3 per cent in Queensland and 34 per cent in Western Australia during this financial year. That seems fair enough, but when we look at the 1983-84 situation, the increases over the 1981-82 Budget figures will be 80.8 per cent in Queensland, 76.7 per cent in Western Australia and 68.1 per cent in South Australia. That seems to indicate that there is an inequity with respect to the allocation of these funds. These are matters that must be addressed by the Minister. He has the ability to remedy any inequity that arises by adjusting grants made under the Roads Grants Act. I hope that a willingness to do so will be apparent in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the matter of local roads. I have been involved as Secretary of the Canberra committee on local government, in detailed discussions with the Australian Council of Local Government Associations and, less formally, in discussions with the South Australian Local Government Association. Both of those organisations are pleased with the principle of this program. However, concern has been expressed that, in relative terms, local roads have been downgraded under the program. National and arterial road categories have been boosted or at least maintained. The ACLGA believes that, viewed as part of the total program-that is, the bicentennial program, the lifting of the local government diesel fuel exemption and the fact that local government will have to pay a surcharge that will finance this scheme-as Senator McLaren said, local government will be only slightly better off as a result of this initiative. The Local Government Associations admit that overall there will be a marginal gain this year and a two to three per cent increase in real terms next year, but in the third year no growth at all will be recorded. </PARA>
<PARA> This third year situation has recently been the subject of discussion between the Minister and the ACLGA, which has pointed out that there will be a reduction of eight to nine per cent in real terms in that year. As I understand it, the Minister has accepted those figures and has given an undertaking to look at ways in which that situation might be avoided. I understand that local government will benefit, indirectly or directly, as a result of the legislation dealing with a wages pause that is being debated in the House of Representatives. With $ 300m-odd being made available for capital works, I hope that local government will share more equitably in those funds than it has done in the past. I believe that local roads and local government deserve the support of this Government. I believe that local roads must be regarded as just as important to local government as the national and arterial roads systems are to Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate. It is an important one. It touches on a very important area of government initiative at this time. I shall mention just a few of the matters that were raised by individual senators during the debate. Senator Gietzelt moved an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund Bill. The amendment, firstly, seeks to have the Bill make provision for the apportioning of national roads funds between the States and the Northern Territory in order to address the special road needs of the various regions of Australia. It is important to recognise that the very reason the Bill provides flexibility in the allocation of national roads funds is the Government's desire to meet the differing needs of the various States and the Northern Territory in that important area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although the Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt) has advised States of indicative allocations for the first two years of the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program, it is not possible to finalise the distribution of funds for national roads between the States and the Territory to meet our national objectives until firm works programs have been developed. As honourable senators will no doubt be aware, the Commonwealth's major priority in the national roads area is to bring the declared national highways system in all States and the Northern Territory to a dust-free, virtually flood-free standard by the bicentennial year, 1988. It is the Government's intention that no State will be advantaged at the expense of another in the standard to which its segment of the national highway system will be upgraded. Allocations under the ABRD Program will reflect the works required in each State to achieve that overall objective. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, Senator Gietzelt's amendment indicates the Opposition's concern about the adequacy of the level of funds to be made available to local government for local roads. Let me assure the honourable senator that the Government needs no persuasion about the importance of local roads in facilitating travel and assisting the development of economic and social activities within local communities. The Government, therefore, paid particular attention to ensure that local government would not be disadvantaged in the allocation of ABRD funds. In 1982-83, the total allocation for local roads under the ABRD Program and the road grants program is estimated to be about $200m, an increase of some $39m or 24 per cent over 1981-82. This is a substantial increase which will more than offset the additional excise charges on local authorities, which are unlikely to exceed about $10m in 1982-83. Benefits to local government will be sustained in 1983-84 when total allocations to local roads will be an estimated $235m, which is $73m or 46 per cent higher than the 1981-82 level. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLaren stated that there had been a decrease of some $517m in the amount of funds going to the States for road grants over seven years of Fraser governments. Perhaps Senator McLaren needs it to be pointed out again-I know that we have done so on many occasions-that in fact local government has been served very well by the share of personal income tax which has gone to it under Fraser Government policies since 1976. An amount of $1,787.8m has gone to local government over that period. If there has been a fall-off as a result of decreased funds going to the States, it has been more than truly offset by the advantages to local government of its being able to choose its own way of spending the extra funds coming to it from the Federal Government's revenue resource. </PARA>
<PARA> During the debate Senator Haines proposed a further amendment to the second reading motion. This amendment concerns the assessment of environmental consequences of road works and the provision of rest areas with appropriate vegetation along our roads. I should make it quite clear that the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 and section 30 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act apply to road projects which utilise Commonwealth funds. Under the existing road grants program, it is required that State Ministers provide the Minister for Transport and Construction with a State environmental clearance for all road works proposed for Commonwealth funding. Furthermore, projects in environmentally sensitive areas can also be reviewed at the Commonwealth level. Agreed arrangements exist between the Commonwealth and the States whereby the submission of environmental impact statements can be required . These same arrangements will apply under the ABRD Program. Roadside rest areas are eligible for Commonwealth assistance where they form an adjunct to the road network. Such rest areas are usually landscaped where appropriate. I would hope for those reasons that Senator Haines will see fit not to pursue her amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Criticism was made by some honourable senators of the Government's record in the funding of roads. While the Government acknowledges that the level of its funding of roads in recent years has not kept pace fully with increases in road construction costs, funds to be provided over the next two years under the ABRD Program and road grants programs are well in excess of recent movements in road building costs. Total Commonwealth road funding in 1982-83 will now be about $ 914m. This represents an increase of 33 per cent when compared with road funds allocated in 1981-82. For 1983-84, Commonwealth expenditure will total an estimated $1,208m, which represents a 76 per cent increase over 1981-82. These are very substantial increases and reflect the Government's determination to bring about a major improvement in the Australian road network over the next six years. </PARA>
<PARA> I should explain to honourable senators that it is with this objective in mind that the Government has seen fit to require the States to maintain their own level of road funding in real terms. If the benefits of the ABRD Program are to be maximised, it will be necessary to ensure that Commonwealth funds are not used by the States for simply substituting funding which they would otherwise have provided. I can well appreciate the concern that has been expressed about the possible inflationary effect of the surcharge. However, all the evidence suggests that this impact will be minimal. Even the 2c per litre increase in fuel costs over two years will lead to an estimated increase in the consumer price index of less than one-half of a percentage point. For the average motorist travelling 15,000 kilometres a year, this will involve the payment of 67c extra per week. </PARA>
<PARA> During the debate Senator Bjelke-Petersen expressed concern about the requirement that some ABRD Projects must be put out to tender. The Government believes that the tendering requirement for national roads and arterial roads will create a competitive environment for the implementation of the major construction works to be undertaken under the ABRD Program. This will ensure that maximum value is obtained for each dollar invested in these road works. The Government believes that the taxpayers of this country deserve nothing less than maximum efficiency for government expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> I should mention here, too, the most important consequence of the ABRD Program; that is, its favourable impact on employment. Of course, the longer the passage of this legislation is delayed, the less likely it is that we will be able to get jobs created and started quickly because expenditure does rely upon the passage of this legislation. I am pleased to note that this aspect has been recognised, however, by several honourable senators in the course of the debate. The ABRD Program will provide employment for a further 8,000 persons in a road construction industry, with a total of some 20,000 jobs in both indirect and direct employment generated thereby. The additional 8,000 road jobs represent a significant increase of some 10 per cent in road construction employment. Most of these jobs will be located in the private sector as a result of the tendering requirements contained in the Bill. Almost two-thirds of those jobs will be in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of relative State shares of Commonwealth funding is, of course, a most vexing one. It was raised here today by my colleague from South Australia, Senator Jessop. Each State can identify particular economic, social or geographical factors which have an impact on its road needs. In that regard, Senator Crichton-Browne in particular presented a well argued case in respect of national highways in Western Australia. Similar issues were also raised in other States. The overall objective of the ABRD Program is to accelerate the upgrading of roads in all the States and the Northern Territory. In particular, our entire national highway system will be upgraded to a high standard by 1988. As I mentioned earlier, the allocations to be provided under the ABRD Program for national roads reflect that goal. Allocations for other road categories preserve the corresponding funding relativities which apply under the Roads Grants Act. These were established in 1977-78 on the basis of funding recommendations put forward by the former Bureau of Roads. Arguments about the States' shares will no doubt continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to the point raised by Senator Jessop in his remarks today. He quoted the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) as saying that the percentage of consumption of main petroleum products in State marketing areas in recent times was 9.3 per cent in South Australia compared with a figure quoted by the Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt) in the House of Representatives of 7.9 per cent. Mr Steele Hall in the other place did not cite a reference for that figure. I can only assume that the figures which have been provided by the Minister are correct. For that reason, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which sets out the relevant percentages of fuel consumption. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this would be a suitable time to indicate to the Committee that the Government does not agree with the amendment put forward by Senator Evans. I will not delay the Committee at length because Senator Missen has already put down some of the points I wished to put down in reply to Senator Evans. Since those points riled Senator Evans last time there is no point in doing it again. I adopt the arguments put forward by Senator Missen when the Committee last considered this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government regards this amendment as a significant amendment. It believes it would significantly weaken the proposed National Crimes Commission. The Government appreciates the sort of argument put forward by the shadow Attorney- General but its concern is that experience, in particular the experience of the United States of America, tells us that an attempt to state too precisely the limits of jurisdiction of a body such as this could well result in delay- producing disputes as to whether some particular investigation comes within the jurisdiction of the body. </PARA>
<PARA> We think the directions given to the Commission under clause 7 are clear in establishing the general ambit of the Commission's inquiry. We do not believe that it is productive to hand to a litigious person who may be both very wealthy and involved in organised crime, legal weapons which may well enable delaying tactics to be pursued when the Commission is conducting its investigations. We think the proposal, and in particular the deletion of the opening words of sub- clause 2, would mean that any activity by the Commission would be subject to challenge in the courts on the grounds that the matters looked into by the Commission are not offences as defined in clause 7 (2). So we think a ready weapon is being made available here for those who wish to see an ineffective Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The concern expressed by Senator Evans is basically a concern based on civil liberties. We see that concern as being exaggerated and, in any event, point to the short life of five years proposed for the Commission which will give us experience of its actual operation. The requirement of the proposed section is, I think, quite clear. I do not believe that the amendment put forward by the Opposition is necessary. We do not want to be in a position where there is virtually an invitation to conduct challenges in the courts to the carrying out of particular investigations by the Commission on grounds that the offences in question do not satisfy the definition in clause 7 (2). </PARA>
<PARA> If the Senate is minded to alter and narrow this clause then, in the view of the Government, it would be preferable to see it narrowed by the removal of clause 7 (2) (d). I do not advocate that but I think that if there is concern in the Senate as to the width of the types of offences about which the Commission might be concerned it would be less damaging to the operation of the National Crimes Commission if clause 7 (2) were removed and the opening words of clause 7 (2) remained. The Government opposes the amendment proposed to sub-clause (2) and will vote against it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The Australian Democrats will not support the Australian Labor Party's amendment, but we will seek to move an amendment to clause 7 sub-clause (2) (d). We seek to delete paragraph (d) on the basis that it is a far too wide proposition. It talks about other offences of kinds that persons or bodies engaged in law enforcement-including, of course, State police forces-are experiencing special difficulty in investigating, the special difficulty being undefined in the Bill itself.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is why we believe that that paragraph ought to be deleted. The Labor Party amendment is drafted in identical terms regarding paragraphs (a) , (b) and (c), except as regards the changing of the preamble in sub-clause (2) which states that the Commission shall seek to direct its activities in relation to various matters and to substitute the notion of an offence as contained in sub-clause (1) of clause 7. The important point there, as Senator Evans has indicated previously, is to actually define in some definite way what it is that the National Crimes Commission is engaged in. The points which the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, raised, I think, are points with which we would agree, particularly in relation to the notion that the Commission would be restrained in many ways if the ALP amendment were carried in terms of the meaning of an offence. Clause 7 (1) (i) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Any circumstance suggesting that an offence may have been, or may be being, committed against a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory;</PARA>
<PARA>One would then read there the Labor Party's proposal that an offence shall mean an offence, et cetera. We believe if one reads the words in those circumstances in no way-from what Senator Evans has suggested-would the Commission be restricted. He seems to be implying that that would be the case if we substituted his sub-clause (2) for the sub-clause (2) which already appears in the Bill. Therefore we seek to delete sub-clause (2) (d) and leave in the rest- that is, paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) as they are currently drafted. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Page 4, clause 7, sub-clause 2 (d), omit sub-clause 2 (d). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The supposed civil libertarians in this place are long going to have clause 7 of the National Crimes Commission Bill on their conscience if they follow the course which Senator Missen mapped out in supporting the Government on this and which has now at the very last minute been determined to be followed, it appears, by the Australian Democrats. The net result of the contributions we have heard from the Democrats' spokesman, Senator Macklin, and Senator Missen are to give carte blanche to the new National Crimes Commission to do anything it wants in relation to any kind of matter at all that occurs to it. There is simply no jurisdictional limitation whatsoever cast upon the Crimes Commission so far as clause 7 remains significantly unamended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point about sub-clause (2) at the moment is that it is simply, as I said at some length the last time we met, exhortatory in its character. It has no legal effect whatever. Sub-clause (2) states that the Commission shall seek, so far as practicable, to direct its activities in relation to particular defined areas. It does not say that the Commission must confine its activities to those areas. It does not define, as the Australian Labor Party amendment would seek to do, offences in terms of those areas. As such it has some use as a statement of legislative intent as to how the power should be exercised but, for all its practical utility, it is no more than a joke. It is of no legal force or effect whatsoever. If paragraph (d) is left in sub-clause (2) it is a bad joke because the reach of (2) (d) is such as to completely negate, one would have thought, the potentially restrictive effect of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c). To that extent I agree that it would be desirable to remove (d) from it. </PARA>
<PARA> But even if (d) is removed from sub-clause (2), as it is presently cast, that whole sub-clause is still a joke. It only ceases to become a joke if sub-clause (2) is taken away from its present format and is made actually part of the definition of an offence-that is, of course, exactly what the ALP's amendment is seeking to do-so that there will be some formal legal constraint, not just an exhortatory restraint, on what the Commission can do. That has to be appreciated as the first point. The Opposition is not being met half way simply by getting rid of the extraordinarily wide, lunaticly wide, paragraph (d). This does not meet the Opposition's point at all. The whole point and thrust of the Opposition 's amendment is to set some legal jurisdictional constraints on what the Commission can actually do. </PARA>
<PARA> The only answers we have heard as to why that is a bad idea were from Senator Macklin and Senator Chaney. Senator Macklin said that these provisions do not impose any constraints at all on what the Commission could do if they were part of its jurisdictional limitations. Senator Chaney said that they pose excessive restrictions because they will open up the possibility of formal legal challenges being made by all sorts of shady customers who will seek to use these provisions to grind to a halt the proceedings of the Commission. I simply say in that respect-I do not want to repeat at great length what I said last time-that to write the amendment in the way proposed by the Opposition and to formally limit the jurisdiction by reference to the descriptions of offences set out in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) would not be to unduly restrict or limit the scope of the Commission's operations in such a way as to allow the Commission to be hamstrung by a series of jurisdictional challenges of one kind or another. </PARA>
<PARA> As an example I use a kind of geographical analogy. At the moment the jurisdiction of the Commission is totally unfettered in any way, shape of form. There are no practical limitations. Geographically one might say that it is the size of the city of Melbourne. It is almost completely open-ended. If we do as the Opposition would say and actually write in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) as part of the definition of offences so that the Commission has to confine itself to offences which are in the nature of organised criminal activity or involve the use of sophisticated methods or elements of corruption we would, as it were, reduce the scope of the Commission's activities to something like-using the Melbourne analogy-the size of the Melbourne Cricket Ground. There is still a very large area in which to play. It would be possible to define further in a very narrow way the jurisdiction of the Commission with some very tight restrictions such that it would not be the same size as the MCG but about the size of a cricket pitch on the MCG. </PARA>
<PARA> Under those circumstances, if there is only a very narrowly prescribed area within which the Commission can operate, one can imagine a whole series of jurisdictional challenges slowing down, disrupting and hamstringing what the Commission is about. We are saying that the language contained in (a), (b) and ( c) is not so narrowly constraining as to hamstringing the Commission, but it does at least set some parameters, some boundaries, within which the Commission can operate, which boundaries are simply not there the way the clause is cast at the moment. I can do no more than repeat myself endlessly if I go over this track so I will sit down and leave the matter at that. I hope that there will be some reconsideration by the Democrats whose abdication of responsibility on this matter at the last moment does seem to me to be rather alarming. </PARA>

<PARA> Page 7, clause 14, sub-clause (5), leave out the sub-clause. </PARA>
<PARA>This clause is about search warrants. Sub-clause (5) not only enables the person executing a warrant on behalf of the National Crimes Commission to search for and seize objects which are within the scope of that warrant but also enables the person executing the warrant, if he finds-and the nub of the problem is in paragraph (b)-'anything that he beleives on reasonable grounds to be connected with another matter into which the Commission is conducting an investigation', to seize that thing provided there is reasonable grounds to believe that its seizure then and there is necessary to ensure that it is not lost or destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> We would argue that this provision goes much further than is either necessary or desirable to ensure that the Commission does in fact obtain documentary and other evidence that is relevant to the way in which it needs to go about its business. We say that particularly because the language, it will be appreciated, is a reference to not simply evidence being seen which is relevant to the commission of some offence but rather to material being seen which is believed to be connected with 'another matter' into which the Commission is conducting an investigation. That means that since, as we have already established, under the Commission's jurisdiction by virtue of clause 7 it can of its own motion investigate more or less anything it wants to, we have through the vehicle of this clause an open-ended mandate for the Commission, or those acting on its behalf, in effect to seize anything that it seems a good idea at the time to grab. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Missen" NAMEID="YL7">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is more than that. It is where concealment, loss mutilation or destruction might occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a condition subsequent. If they see it and think that it is connected with some other matter, however remote from the subject matter of the judicial warrant that they have obtained-if they think it might be useful for some other matter that has nothing to do with the warrant just issued-they may then grab it provided that, the condition subsequent, they believe that not to do so then and there would be to ensure its loss or destruction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Several things need to be said about that. First, the Government has made the point that provisions of that kind are either not entirely unknown to the common law or-and there is argument about this-if that is not the case at least a provision of this kind is contained in the Government's own Criminal Investigation Bill 1981, which makes provision for someone in the course of executing a warrant that is issued in respect of one offence seizing material or property that he happens to see lying around and has reasonable grounds to believe to be connected with, or evidence of, some other offence. </PARA>
<PARA> True, that provision is contained in the 1981 Criminal Investigation Bill, although I hasten to add not its 1977 predecessor or the 1975 Bill drafted by the Law Reform Commission. The reason the clause in question was not contained in the 1975 Criminal Investigation Bill, or the 1977 version, is that it was preceived to be not only wrong in principle but also unnecessary. This takes me to the real nub of the objection to what is happening here. There is now provision in this Bill for a telephone application for a warrant. In the House of Representatives the particular amendment providing for application for a judicial warrant by the agency of a telephone was moved simultaneously with the amendment that I am moving today which seeks to delete the power to go on an open-ended search once one is inside premises and to seize things not within the ambit of the warrant. There is a logical connection between those two propositions. It may well be the case that one could envisage circumstances in which a person executing a warrant sees evidence of crucial importance in relation to some matter that is centrally relevant to the Commission's investigations and that he has grounds for believing may be destroyed if he does not pick it up there and then. </PARA>
<PARA> The solution that we adopted in regard to the amendments moved in the House of Representatives was to enable the executor of the warrant, under those circumstances, to make immediate application to a judge for a warrant to get the authority to seize those additional goods as well as additional materials which, by definition, were not in contemplation at the time the original warrant was issued. So there is a practical provision by way of the telephone warrant system now provided to cope with that unusual urgent circumstance in which there might conceivably be agreement that it is proper that the materials in question be sought. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened, of course, in the House of Representatives, in the time-honoured sort of double dealing to which one becomes used in this place with this Government, is that the provision for the obtaining of telephone warrants was accepted but the provision to delete the equivalent of sub-clause (5) of clause 14 was rejected. So the Government has had its cake and is eating it too. It has been given an additional procedure, that of the telephone warrant, designed specifically to cope with the removal of the particular power in this sub-clause but has kept the power in the sub-clause as well. In the view of the Opposition, one simply cannot have it both ways in this respect. Either there is a problem or there is not. Either the problem can be met by the use of telephone warrants or it cannot. If it can be, as the Government seems to believe by having accepted our amendment providing for telephone warrants, it is utterly unnecessary to have sub-clause (5) in its present form. </PARA>
<PARA> I finish where I started by saying that there is a difference. Even if honourable senators opposite are unmoved by all of that and say that, as a matter of common law or statutory reform, there ought to be a provision to cover the situation of an extended search beyond the scope of an original warrant in the case of police investigations of criminal offences, I ask them for goodness sake to appreciate that we are not here talking about matters that are as narrowly and precisely defined as are criminal offences. We are simply talking about matters into which the Commission is conducting an investigation-and as the Bill is drawn, the Commission can conduct an investigation into anything it pleases, so no private documents will be sacrosanct. No physical materials in any home or office will any longer be safe from the depredations of those who are in the business of executing Commission warrants. The scope of the jurisdiction of the Commission is so potentially enormous, and the scope of the power that is vested in those who are executing warrants is so wide, that we have contained in this clause, another absolutely outrageous interference with basic liberties, an interference which is utterly unnecessary given the availability of the telephone warrant system. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Missen can rationalise his way out of that, or members of the Australian Democrats can do so individually or collectively, I will be delighted to hear how they do it. They will have a great deal of difficulty in persuading me or anyone else in the community that they deserve serious regard as protectors of civil liberties if they are prepared to contemplate a clause of this kind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a little surprised at some of the language used by Senator Evans in seeking to assert this amendment. He suggested that the Government's action in choosing to accept a Labor amendment and at the same time not accepting a related Labor amendment amounted to double dealing, which seemed a rather strange use of language. To suggest that the fact that we have now agreed to an amendment which gives the opportunity to apply for a warrant by telephone is a matter of having our cake and eating it too is erroneous. To the extent that we can add to the effectiveness of the National Crimes Commission by agreeing to Labor amendments, we will of course do so. But that puts us under no obligation to accept other amendments, whether related or not, and certainly does not involve double dealing in any normal sense of that term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The provision makes quite clear that sub-clause (5) of clause 14 simply provides for the situation in which someone is searching in accordance with a warrant properly issued-not, of course, by the Commission itself but by a judicial officer-and comes across material of another kind that, on reasonable grounds, he believes to be connected with the matter being investigated by the Commission, or anything that he believes, on reasonable grounds, is connected with another matter into which the Commission is conducting an investigation. Provision is made for his seizing that also to prevent its loss, mutilation or destruction. That seems to me to be a very sensible provision. I do not think that many would expect someone investigating or seizing material under a search warrant, who comes across other relevant material which relates to matters properly within the purview of the Commission, to leave that material unattended . </PARA>
<PARA> It may well be that in come cases the provision which has been inserted at the suggestion of the opposition for the obtaining of the telephone warrant would be applicable and would enable the material to be seized and protected from loss or mutilation but, of course, one cannot guarantee either that a telephone would be available or that a judge would be at the other end of the telephone line at any given time. It seems to be but a partial remedy for a circumstance which may in practice arise. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is worth referring to the rules that apply under the general law relating to search warrants. In that regard, I quote Lord Denning who, in Ghani v. Jones, as reported in All England Law Reports at page 1703, pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA> I would start by considering the law where police officers enter a man's house by virtue of a warrant, or arrest a man lawfully, with or without a warrant, for a serious offence. I take it to be settled law, without citing cases, that the officers are entitled to take any goods which they find in his possession or in his house which they reasonably believe to be material evidence in relation to the crime for which he is arrested or for which they enter. If in the course of their search they come upon any other goods which show him to be implicated in some other crime, they may take them provided they act reasonably and detain them no longer than is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>Then a number of cases are cited. It is having regard to that sort of approach and the dictates of common sense that the Government has put both in the Criminal Investigation Bill and in the National Crimes Commission Bill a provision for the possibility that the officer when executing a warrant might find things which are of a different kind to that specified in the warrant but which are relevant to matters before the Commission. I think it is a rather strange idea that because they are not specified in the warrant they should therefore be left when there is a possibility of destruction. There is the possibility within the clause itself that the officer must believe on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to seize the thing to prevent its concealment, loss or destruction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does limit it; that is quite true. So we have this situation in regard to general law and also we have the example of the United States where we know that under its rules, however restrictive they might be, an officer who has lawfully entered to execute a warrant is permitted to take other relevant things. As a matter of common sense, as I said, as well as a matter of comparison with these jurisdictions, we believe that the provision in sub-clause (5) is a sensible and proper one and should not be deleted.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The intent of the amendment moved by the Australian Labor Party can be agreed to. It is a matter about which in some areas one might have some concern, even in the area of State jurisdiction. However, the Australian Democrats will not support the Labor Party amendment. I believe it still leaves open a number of difficult areas that have not been picked up. Senator Evans has pointed out that the provision of being able to get a warrant by telephone would cover most cases. I believe that is correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But I am sure he would agree that in some cases that course would not be available to the officer with the warrant. It is in those circumstances that we have to make some type of provision. I would have preferred it to be done by way of preference; in other words, where possible a warrant has to be sought by means of the telephone. </PARA>
<PARA> However, that might not be possible, for example, in a remote part of Australia which has no access to telephones or where for one reason or another the telephone is out of order. One could raise a whole range of instances. The assumption is that the National Crimes Commission will look into only the matters of the utmost gravity and concern to the country as a whole and I am quite sure that in investigating a matter of the utmost gravity to the nation we would not like destroyed, concealed, lost or in some other way unable to be tendered as evidence, any material which may be useful in solving that crime. Therefore, while one can raise objections in a reasonable fashion to the possible scope and use of this sub-clause, one cannot vote against it, because it could be of the utmost concern and use in tracking down and bringing to a successful conclusion some matter which the National Crimes Commission is looking into. It is on the ground that there are areas that the telephone warrant cannot cover that we believe this additional power is needed. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall make it interesting, by talking about one of the real concerns in relation to the operation of crimes commissions. It is about witnesses and others having their names dragged muddily through the operations of these commissions, about people being the target for scuttlebutt, about people having all sorts of unfounded and scurrilous allegations being made against them. Perhaps it is impossible in the context of any kind of royal commission or crimes commission inquiry to avoid altogether the possibility of people's reputations being put at risk by the kind of material that is put before such inquiries. It is in the nature of the beast that this sort of evidence, which would not satisfy normal court standards of admissibility, is put.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is the nature of an inquisitorial proceeding. That is its justification, in many ways-that it enables a freewheeling, far-ranging investigation to take place. But there are real difficulties, of course, again in terms of civil liberties and the reputations of individuals, if that occurs. The member for Melbourne Ports, Clyde Holding, in the other place, gave a rather moving account of some of the difficulties that he personally had experienced in relation to royal commissions, with his name being dragged through the mud and the subsequent clearance of his name being given far less publicity. The question is : What on earth can we do about that?</PARA>
<PARA> One solution is to ensure that all proceedings of the National Crimes Commission are held in private, with no public access by the media or anyone else who might be minded to report the scuttlebutt, the scurrilous allegations and so on. That solution is not an altogether unwelcome one to the Opposition. We note the way in which the Bill has been amended already in the House of Representatives to widen the scope of the powers of the Commission to hold hearings in camera and in effect, particularly where people's reputations are involved, the power is there for the Commission to order that the evidence not be published and to hold the whole proceeding in camera. That is not a totally satisfactory solution to the problem because where in camera proceedings are held they cannot, by definition, be the subject of scrutiny by outsiders. One of the problems in relation to royal commissions and the contemplated Crimes Commission here is the fear that very many people hold that they will not be democratically or justly operating bodies, that they will operate like star chambers, and to the extent that they operate behind closed doors that will give credence to that kind of concern. </PARA>
<PARA> So the next step to which one is led in contemplating the problem and the possible solutions to it is to say that one ought, then, to impose perhaps some limitations on the extent to which Crimes Commission proceedings can be reported . One kind of restriction would be to allow people there physically but to set absolute limits on what could be reported. That does not seem to be entirely satisfactory, for the reason that if people are to be there at all the real utility of their being there, to ensure that the proceedings are kept fair in the way in which they operate, is that they can tell the world about it if the proceedings are not fair. So an absolute blanket prohibition on reporting by people who are physically present does not seem to be terribly satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> Another solution which I have canvassed from time to time on behalf of the Opposition is to set a limitation on what can be reported by saying, for example , that the only evidence which can be the subject of reporting would be that evidence which can satisfy ordinary standards of admissibility in the courts. The kind of evidence, be it hearsay or otherwise, which would be admissible in the courts but is admissible in royal commission proceedings, would not be able to be reported; but ordinary factual hard evidence, relevant and direct, which would be admissible in the courts, could be the subject of publicity in the ordinary way. That might solve most of the practical problems with scuttlebutt and unfounded hearsay allegations. But there are enormous and obvious practical difficulties about making any such system work. There would have to be some process of certification, either on application or at the end of each day, by the commissioner as to what did and did not satisfy the criteria of admissibility, and it would be undoubtedly make the practical operation of proceedings very complex. </PARA>
<PARA> That, really, is what brings us back to the proposal contained in the amendment . This is a proposal which says: 'Yes, you can go for your life. You can report those proceedings of the Crimes Commission which are open to the public but, in doing so, you take the risk of defamation proceedings if the material that you report is not true. You can report things provided that you are confident that what is being said before the royal commission is the truth. Under this amendment, the press would run the risk if it did report what goes on in the Commission, of being the subject of a defamation action if what in fact it was reporting as having been given in evidence in that Commission turns out subsequently not to be true. In other words, it would lose the protection that is available under present defamation law for a fair and accurate report of the Commission's proceedings. Simply because its report is a fair and accurate account of what transpired in the Commission would not under this amendment be enough to give it protection. It would be protected in an action for defamation from someone who was offended by what it wrote only if the evidence given at the Commission could satisfy these criteria of truth or, perhaps in some jurisdictions, truth plus public benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the concept, and I acknowledge that it may be perceived by the Press and others as an untoward interference or limitation on the capacity of the Press to report proceedings. But I would argue for it as being really the only practical way, short of requiring all Commission proceedings to be in private, of ensuring that in nearly every case reputation destroying hearsay evidence of the kind which is not admissible in ordinary court proceedings is not given wide currency. I have indicated that the only other alternative is the holding of all these proceedings in private. That does not seem either to me or to the Opposition to be satisfactory, for the reasons I have indicated. </PARA>
<PARA> This is in some ways an adventurous amendment breaking new conceptual ground and it might be thought by some to be, as I say, an unwarranted interference on the freedom of the Press. But if the only practical alternative is for the Press not to have power to report at all what is going on in these commissions I think the wisdom of the amendment will be seen as being quite considerable. </PARA>
<PARA> The power will be that of the Press to report the proceedings in the way in which it wants to. If it wants to take the risk of reporting these proceedings if it believes the subject matter is in the public interest and, moreover, that it is prepared to run the risk of relying on the truth of the allegations in question, it can report to its heart's content without any limitation. If it is not satisified as to the truth of the material which is being stated in evidence in the Commission's proceedings, it will no doubt be very cautious about running the story, but that, after all, is as it should be. One of the real problems in the whole operation of royal commissions-it will be a problem in the operation of this Crimes Commission-is the readiness of the Press to report what is manifestly scuttlebutt and what is manifestly deleterious to the reputations of others but is ultimately shown to be without foundation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The comments which Senator Evans has made in support of his amendment really do illustrate the complex balancing of interests that is involved in deciding what rules ought apply to the operations of the royal commission, whether hearings should be public or private and so on. Indeed that is a matter which has already received a fair amount of attention in the Committee stages in the other place. There have been amendments to the legislation which give the person who is appearing before the Commission at least the opportunity to express a view as to whether the hearing ought to be public or private.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The National Crimes Commission Bill 1982 contains a number of protections against the sorts of concerns which have been expressed by Senator Evans about the dangers which can arise from royal commissions repeating allegations or providing a forum in which allegations can be made to the detriment of reputation. I refer the Committee to clause 39 of the Bill and to the restrictions which are contained therein with respect to the reporting of the Commission as far as identifying people who might be suspected of having committed offences or who might be regarded as having committed offences. There are a number of protections in the Bill which I think reflect the sorts of concerns which Senator Evans has put in supporting his amendment. The difficulty with the amendment is that it seems to the Government that it really removes the reality of public hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> I was a little surprised at the views that Senator Evans put forward concerning the position of the Press. I suspect that in a debate upon the law of defamation he might have been arguing for rules which perhaps made it less dangerous for the Press sometimes to pursue matters of public interest. In any event the Government's view is that given that the hearings are attended by few, if any, outsiders the reality is that if there is to be a public hearing it will be public only if there is the normal right of the Press to report proceedings in a fair manner. I do agree that it is a matter of balance, but I think the reality is that the media would be reluctant to report proceedings in circumstances where new clause 17 (A) applied; that is, where there is no possibility of a defence based on a fair and accurate report of the evidence. Given the amendments which have been moved-some of which were moved by Mr Spender in the other place-and the provisions which were already in the Bill and given the balance of interests involved, we oppose the insertion of new clause 17 (A). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The Australian Democrats also oppose this motion. The points Senator Evans raised I think have a lot of merit. I think everybody would be concerned that the National Crimes Commission should not become a forum further to denigrate people's reputations on the basis of, as Senator Evans put it, scuttlebutt. However, we lean in the other direction and suggest that the presence of the Press and the reporting of these items may have the opposite effect. We believe that the Press will provide a great deal of balance to stop such a commission becoming a star chamber, as has been suggested from time to time in the debate. We believe that the only way the Press would be effectively able to do that is to be able, without fear or favour, to report what it sees to be a fair and accurate report of whatever the proceedings are. This necessarily has within it the possibilities that there may be danger to individuals. But as this chamber has privilege which it deems to be necessary for the operation of its activities, as courts have such privileges, we believe that in this case also such a privilege would be useful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When one inquires into any of these items whereby the Press can report something which is said under privilege we believe ultimately one is pressed to the point of saying that provided we need that institution it has to have powers which include privilege, and then the Press has to be able to report it. Ultimately, in any fair debate, that would be the side one would have to come down on and hope that by the Press actually engaging in fair reporting it would be protected. The hope would be that the Press, having been given an opportunity to fulfil that role, would live up to it. </PARA>

<PARA>Legal and financial assistance</PARA>
<PARA> '18A. (1) A witness who is appearing or who is about to appear before the Commission may make an application to the Attorney-General for the provision of assistance under this section in respect of his appearance. </PARA>
<PARA> '(2) Where an application is made by a person under sub-section (1), the Attorney-General may, if he is satisfied that-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) it would involve hardship to the person to refuse the application; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the circumstances of the case are of such a special nature that the application should be granted,</PARA>
<PARA>authorize the provision by the Commonwealth to that person, either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as the Attorney-General determines , of such legal or financial assistance in respect of the appearance of that person before the Commission as the Attorney-General determines.'. </PARA>
<PARA>A number of proposals has been raised with the Government expressing concern about the position of witnesses who may require legal assistance. The Government has given consideration to that aspect, and, therefore, proposes the insertion of this clause in response to the matters which have been raised. The clause is substantially modelled on the provision which appears in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. It is slightly more stringent or restrictive in that it requires circumstances of a special nature before the application should be granted. But, in the view of the Government, a cautious approach should be adopted with respect to legal assistance in these matters. Legal assistance is not normally provided to citizens who are carrying out their civic duty and assisting the police with their inquiries or who are appearing in the role of a witness, even before tribunals which are determining final rights, unless the final rights being determined are those of the witnesses themselves; so, in the case of this forum, where no final rights are being determined, when one is simply inquiring into matters, when there is a duty on citizens to be of assistance to the Commission, the Government believes that the clause which it is putting forward represents an appropriate concession, without going too far down the track, with the reality that some people might otherwise be disadvantaged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(Victoria) (5.42)-I had proposed and given notice that I would move an amendment in a different form from the one which the Government has now moved. In fact, it was in the form in which in the House of Representatives the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) moved an amendment for the provision of legal aid. That amendment was defeated at that time; it was opposed by the Government. I now propose to support the Government's amendment and not to move the amendment of which I have given notice. It is a matter of balance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendment which was proposed in the House of Representatives, which I was proposing to move, was that the Commissioner would determine whether legal aid would be given. I can see that some argument can be raised against that proposition in the sense that the Commissioner could then perhaps be persuaded to give legal aid to a favourable witness or one who produces useful evidence in such a way that-perhaps this is putting too low a standard on the Commissioner's judgment-he may be influenced by the course of events in evidence that is given. I believe that taking it out of his hands and leaving it to the judgment of the Attorney-General is in some ways better. On the other hand, of course, it will be a matter of seeing how it works. This Commission's operation has a limited time, so we can see whether legal aid is granted in a reasonably generous way. Hardship and circumstances of a special nature are required for aid to be granted. I agree that not everybody who assists or who provides evidence should expect legal aid. One can imagine, however, a number of circumstances where people are very helpful to a commission. They are witnesses; they are not people who will be defendants in a case. They are not criminals or rogues. One expects citizens to be helpful and to come forward readily. There is a definite need in cases of hardship for provision of legal aid. </PARA>
<PARA> On balance, although there are some deficiences in this clause, the matter is left very much in the hands of the Attorney-General. I do not think there is any right of appeal against his decision. Unless it goes into the schedules of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act, I do not think there are any appeal provisions at all. This is a new clause which the Government is moving and one which will grant in substance some legal aid. Consequently, despite the defects I have mentioned I certainly will give it support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to move an amendment to this clause related to the question of evidence which people give and the giving of some notice to them when they are summonsed to appear before the Commission. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Page 11, Clause 19, after sub-clause (1), insert the following new sub-clause:</PARA>
<PARA> '(1A) A summons under sub-section (1) requiring a person to appear before the Commission to give evidence shall set out, as far as is reasonably practicable, the general nature of the matters in relation to which the Commission intends to question the person, but nothing in this sub-section prevents the Commission from questioning the person in relation to any other matter that the Commission may, in the proper performance of its functions, investigate.'. </PARA>
<PARA>This matter was raised in the nineteenth report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills because it was felt that, as things stood, the creation of a national crimes commission was different from a royal commission which has its terms of reference. One has no idea, if one is summonsed, as to the nature of questions one is expected to answer, what type of documents it is necessary to bring-unless that appears in the summons-the area of investigation and whether it is a serious matter for which one needs to pay a great deal of money in order to acquire the services of counsel or whether one could attend without such advice. Consequently, this matter was raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee as a deficiency and probably causing some hardship to people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown) responded to the Committee report in the following terms. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it may be pointed out that a hearing by the Commission is not in the nature of a trial. Further, a witness in criminal or civil proceedings is not informed by the terms of his subpoena of the offence in question or the nature of proceedings. Until a witness has been questioned before it, the Crimes Commission will not know the extent or direction of the witness's knowledge. Nor will it in many cases be in a position, before the witness has given evidence, to specify the offence in respect of which his assistance is required. It should be noted that new clause 18 now provides re-imbursement to witnesses of attendance expenses. </PARA>
<PARA>The last sentence is irrelevant. That being said by the Acting Attorney-General, one is still in a situation in which, as far as possible, the person should be given some advice as to the nature of questions that will be brought forward. The amendment makes it clear that that is not to be the end of questioning, that a strait-jacket is not to be imposed on the Commissioner so that he cannot inquire into other matters. But, as far as is reasonably practicable, the witness should have whatever knowledge he can so that he can be more informative in the work he prepares and the evidence he gives before the Commission. I believe that the Government will support this amendment. I will not say any more about it at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA> Page 12, clause 20, line 39, insert 'natural' before 'person'. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment is proposed to an insertion that was made in the House of Representatives during the Committee debate. The Committee of the Whole in the House of Representatives widened the protection which was given under this clause and provided that there could be not merely a refusal to answer questions on the ground of self-incrimination but also a refusal to produce documents. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is clearly understood by the Committee that obtaining access to documents and then analysing the great mass of information which is contained in the documents is one of the significant techniques in trying to combat organised crime which has been developed and demonstrated as a very useful technique by the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. The Government was concerned, on reflection, that the amendment which had been accepted in the House of Representatives was rather broader than was necessary or desirable. The privilege against self- incrimination is, of course, based on the desire to ensure that the individual is not forced to produce information which incriminates himself. It is, of course, firmly rooted in the desire to avoid any temptation which there might be on the part of law enforcement authorities to put undue or improper pressure upon a person and to obtain information from a person which might be damaging. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth referring to a recent High Court of Australia case in which some of the limitations of that privilege against self-incrimination were mentioned by members of the High Court. I think they illustrate clearly that what is desirable is to protect people against incrimination of themselves. We are not concerned to protect non-natural persons or corporations against the right of self-incrimination. Mr Justice Mason, in the case of Rochfort v. Trade Practices Commission, in a judgment which was given on 18 November 1982 and which is not yet reported, pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA> In the United States it has been held that the privilege against self- incrimination is available only to natural persons and not to corporations. Indeed, in White it was decided that it is not available to unincorporated associations or at least those which are organized as business enterprises or labour unions. However, in England it has been affirmatively decided that the privilege is availble to corporations</PARA>
<PARA>He quotes Triplex Safety Glass Co. v. Lancegaye Safety Glass and other cases as authorities for that proposition. Mr Justice Murphy went rather further than Mr Justice Mason. In the same case, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> A person required to produce documents cannot resist production on the ground that this would tend to incriminate another person. The privilege against self- incrimination is a human right, based on the desire to protect personal freedom and human dignity. The history of, and reasons for, the privilege suggest that it should not be extended to artificial persons such as corporations or to large or amorphous voluntary organizations. </PARA>
<PARA>He then quotes a string of United States cases and refers to the English decisions which he says are unconvincing and should not be followed here. On this occasion I would agree with the general view which was expressed by Mr Justice Murphy about the human nature of the privilege against self- incrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States authorities are of some interest. I refer quickly to White's case, which was mentioned by Mr Justice Mason. In that case it was said:</PARA>
<PARA> The constitutional privilege against self-incrimination is essentially a personal one, applying only to natural individuals. It grows out of the high sentiment and regard of our jurisprudence for conducting criminal trials and investigatory proceedings upon a plane of dignity, humanity and impartiality. It is designed to prevent the use of legal process to force from the lips of the accused individual the evidence necessary to convict him or to force him to produce and authenticate any personal documents or effects that might incriminate him. Physical torture and other less violent but equally reprehensible modes of compelling the production of incriminating evidence are thereby avoided. </PARA>
<PARA>There is more in the same vein, but I think the flavour of that is an acceptable expression of principle which the Government would endorse. At the same time we think that it is, from a practical point of view, highly desirable that that principle, which we would support, should not be available to protect corporations against the production of documents which may be essential in the combating of organised crime and, indeed, the discovery of organised crime in Australia. We move that amendment, having given the matter further consideration since it was dealt with in the House of Representatives, and would seek the Committee's support for it. </PARA>

<PARA> Page 14, clause 20, sub-clauses (10), (11) and (12), leave out the sub-clauses.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Missen referred earlier to the report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I only wish he had done so in relation to the first three Opposition amendments because he might then have been moved to cross the floor on them. I refer to what the Scrutiny of Bills Committee had to say in its eighteenth report about these sub-clauses, both in describing how they operate and what their weaknesses are. The passage states:</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 20 (10) empowers the Commission in relation to a person summoned to attend who has, without reasonable excuse, either failed to attend or answer questions or produce documents, to certify these actions to a prescribed Court. Clause 20 (11) empowers the prescribed Court, upon application by the Attorney- General, to order a person to comply with the direction of the Commission. The Committee welcomes the Amendment effected by clause 20 (11) requiring that contempt proceedings may only be pursued upon application by the Attorney- General. However, the Committee is still concerned that this provision leaves open the possibility of an indefinite jail sentence for contempt of court for a person who, in the Court's opinion, fails without reasonable excuse to comply with a direction to appear as a witness. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously there need to be some sanctions if these clauses requiring people to attend and give evidence before the National Crimes Commission are to have any effect at all. But there are sanctions already contained in sub-clause (9) of clause 18, which is in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> A person who contravenes sub-section (1), (2) or (3)</PARA>
<PARA>That is the failure to attend requirement, the provision about the failure to answer or to produce documents and the provision relating to legal practitioners --</PARA>
<PARA>is guilty of an offence punishable, upon conviction, by a fine not exceeding $1, 000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months. </PARA>
<PARA>So if someone does not answer a summons, if someone refuses to produce documents , if someone fails to answer questions properly put to him or her by the Commission, then there is a sanction. The Commission can go to court and get that person charged and convicted, presumably, of the offence described in sub- clause (9) and that person can spend up to six months cooling his or her heels in gaol or pay a fine of $1,000. Why on earth, in addition to those sanctions, does the Government want the additional power to go along to the Federal Court, albeit with the fiat of the Attorney-General, and get an order that the person comply with the direction of the Commission, the net effect of which, of course, is to add an additional layer of sanctions or an alternative route for the application of sanctions, this time without any constraints at all, because if a person is the subject of a Federal Court order to comply with a direction of the Commission or to give evidence which he has hitherto refused to do, that person can then, of course, be adjudged guilty of contempt of court and the implications of being adjudged guilty of contempt of court are an indefinite gaol sentence, until the court in its wisdom regards the contempt as having been purged or until it chooses, for some other reason, to let the person out of gaol . So what the Government wants to do here is to give itself the power to impose indefinite gaol sentences on people who do not co-operate with the Crimes Commission. That is what these clauses are about. They are unconscionable. They are also unnecessary because that other sanction in sub-clause (9) is available. All those people in organisations who have been worried about the potential Star Chamber aspects of the Crimes Commission concept have got a hell of a lot to worry about so long as sub-clauses (10), (11) and (12) remain in their present form. It may be that in the present judicial and community environment it would be unlikely that someone would spend a long period in gaol for contempt of court . It may be that in that environment a Crimes Commission, even though it has got the jurisdiction to do so, would not embark on a McCarthyist kind of excursion in the areas of disloyalty offences of treason and--</PARA>

<PARA>That amendment is self-explanatory. If honourable senators, the Press, the public and members of the House of Representatives examine the Hansard record they will see that in fact this amendment should be supported. I will not keep the Senate long at this particular stage. I believe that if any fair minded person examines the Hansard record of the debate on the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill 1982 they will see that the major issues, both constitutional and legal issues, that have been raised at the various stages of the debate have not been addressed by the proposer of the legislation, nor have they been satisfactorily dealt with by any honourable senator who has voted in support of the proposition. Indeed I attempted in two amendments to have regard to what certain honourable senators, two honourable senators in particular, have said in the debate. Those two honourable senators supported the Bill. It was my wish and desire to accommodate their views in amendments but sadly those amendments were not adopted. Now we are debating whether the report of the Committee should be adopted. We are here to adopt that report. Unfortunately these major constitutional and other issues have not been dealt with satisfactorily by the proposer of the Bill or, for that matter, by any supporter of the measure. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply have this to say: I understand that the Government is not prepared to hold up this legislation in this chamber. That is a matter of concern to me because a function of this chamber, as has been stated on a number of occasions, is to safeguard the rights of the States which are being trampled on by this Bill. The function of this House is to uphold the civil rights and liberties of individual Australians-rights and civil liberties which are being trampled on by this legislation. The Senate is a House of review. It has not discharged that function. However, in light of the fact that the Government, as I understand it, will vote against the measure-due to circumstances in the House of Representatives which I understand will rise tonight-I merely submit this amendment to the chamber in the hope that it is carried and, if it is not carried, in the expectation that those who review this debate will see precisely that the debate shows that the amendment ought to be supported. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on the third reading of the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill to say just a few words. I intend to be extremely brief. It is a fact of life that the Senate has become, by dint of circumstances, the legislative chamber of the Commonwealth of Australia. The House of Representatives is not really the legislative chamber of the Commonwealth of Australia; it is an electoral college to choose the government of the day. The House of Representatives is a forum where the government's view may be put forward and the alternative government's view may be put forward. The House of Representatives may have some veto power over legislation which is initiated in this place or amended in this place. But, in effect, it is no longer the legislative chamber of the Commonwealth of Australia; the Senate is the legislative chamber. But that power which the Senate now commands should be used in the Senate effectively and properly. Power always calls for responsibility. I put it to the Senate that this legislation is an improper use of the power of the Commonwealth. It is improper because it is being used under the external affairs power of the Commonwealth. It is clear from all judgments prior to the Koowata case that that power should be exercised only when there is some external element in the matter with which the legislation deals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this case this legislation is specifically directed to the activities which are occurring or are about to occur precisely within the boundaries of a State of the Commonwealth. It has no external matter connected with it. It is not even yet part of something which has been adopted in another place. I say to the Senate that a federation is a delicate political framework. It is one which must be cared for or it could be lost. I argued on Thursday the reasons-I am sure that those who listened to the debate will agree that I argued effectively-that this legislation is an improper, gross misuse of the external affairs power of the Commonwealth of Australia. I will certainly oppose the third reading. </PARA>

Nonetheless, one can envisage circumstances where these powers could be abused and misused. They are Draconian; they are for all the reasons I indicated before 6 o'clock unnecessary.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government opposes this amendment because it would not regard the clause as proposed to be amended as providing the most expeditious and practical way of dealing with the problem of somebody who seeks not to co-operate with the National Crimes Commission. The question of the compulsion of witnesses and how that ought to be enforced was dealt with by Mr Costigan in the interim report No . 4, volume 1, of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union which has been tabled. I very briefly refer the Committee to page 9 of the report. Admittedly, Mr Costigan here is talking about royal commissions but I think the same principle applies. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Royal Commissions Act has quite inadequate powers and penalties to enforce the attendance of witnesses in the answering of questions. The Victorian Evidence Act in contrast provides efficient and speedy methods. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my strong recommendation that the Royal Commissions Act be amended to provide procedures and remedies similar to those in the Evidence Act. Recourse to the Federal Court would be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Evidence Act contains provisions similar to those in this legislation which require in the case of a possible offence, which in this case would be an offence under earlier sections-the ones which are agreed should remain in this legislation-that the facts may be certified to a law officer and upon the issue of such certificate the law officer may apply to the Supreme Court or a judge for an order calling upon such person to show cause why he should not be dealt with for an offence against this Act. So, one has the pattern established in that legislation and recommended by Mr Costigan. In the view of the Government, that has been demonstrated to be a more effective, expeditious and efficient way of dealing with the situation of the recalcitrant witness. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been, I understand, some concern expressed among some elements of the Opposition-I do not remember Senator Evans referring to that in his own comments ; he may have and I may have missed it-about the possibility of a double penalty being involved. I see that he shakes his head, so I will not pursue that point. Clearly, in the view of the Government, quite separate Acts are involved in any situation where there may be the possibility of somebody being punished for contempt. Therefore, the Government supports the maintenance of these sub- clauses in clause 20. I would merely wish to emphasise to the Committee that the power to punish for contempt is one which is given in a way which makes it quite clear that the witness is not left defenceless. Sub-clause (11) provides:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the court, upon application by the Attorney-General-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that one has, therefore, involved the first law officer of the Crown and I think that in itself is some indication that the power would be used only in appropriate cases although, of course, it is not a complete safeguard in a technical sense. The sub-clause continues:</PARA>
<PARA>may inquire into the case and, if it is satisfied that the person to whom the certificate relates has, without reasonable excuse, failed to attend or refused or failed to comply with a requirement . . . may order the person to attend or to comply with the requirement at a hearing before the Commission to be held on a date, and at a time and place, specified in the order. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, one has the insertion here of a judicial officer of high rank who is required to be satisfied that there has been a failure to comply without reasonable cause and who thereupon orders compliance with the requirement. In the view of the Government, that is a sensible way to proceed and we would seek the Committee's support for the clause as it stands and opposition to the amendment. </PARA>

It provides that a person shall not (a) insult a member or an acting member in the performance of his functions; (b) interrupt a hearing before the Commission; (c) create a disturbance, or take part in creating or continuing a disturbance, in or near a place where the Commission is holding a hearing; or (d) do any other act that would, if the Commission were a court of record, constitute a contempt of that court. For all or any of those offences the penalty is to be $2,000 or imprisonment for 12 months. While we fully appreciate and accept the necessity for some sanction against actions which might be regarded as analogous to those which, in a judicial context, are described as contempts in the face of the court-disruptive or disturbing behavious such as to make impossible the continuation in a dignified manner of the tribunal's proceedings-we certainly do not regard it as appropriate that there should be penalties of this order for such actions as merely insulting a member of the Commission in the exercise of his powers or functions. It is fair enough to have some sanction against abuse or insult bandied around within the context of the place where the Commission is conducting its hearings, but it is not fair enough at all if intensely critical remarks made outside the ambit of the Commission work place become the subject of contempt of court provisions which are as wide-ranging as these. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for that reason that we have proposed to limit rather substantially the scope of this contempt clause so that it would penalise only for behaviour that amounts to (a) obstructing or hindering the Commission or a member in the performance of the functions of the Commission; or (b) disrupting a hearing before the Commission. So it is obstruction or disruption in the more literal senses of those words that we regard as appropriate to deal with in this way, not the more wide-ranging forms of contempt. It may be that we will be told that the clause in question is modelled on that drafted for other tribunals. If so, so much the worse for that drafting, so much the worse for the powers available in relation to those other tribunals. When one is talking about the liberty of the subject being put at risk for overtly critical or demonstrative behaviour one has to be very careful indeed how one drafts such clauses. That was another matter to which attention was drawn by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills-not that that yet seems to have moved its Chairman or its tory members. I hope that on this occasion they will have regard yet again to the work--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the comments made by Senator Missen because I think the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has been proved to be of very great value in providing an agenda of items for consideration and some views which the Senate can take into account. The Government has largely adopted the practice of responding so that there is some evidence on the record of the Government's attitude to the point raised. It is terribly important that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee should not become a stick with which to beat either the Senate or individual senators, including members of the Committee, but rather that it should be a check list and guide of matters which ought to engage the attention of honourable senators. That certainly has been the case with respect to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report on the National Crimes Commission Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government does not propose to support the amendment moved by the Opposition. Indeed, it actually expects to oppose it. The proposal excludes any prevention of insults to members of the Commission, of disturbances near a place where the Commission is sitting and of the flouting of directions by the Commission; for example, directions to a member of the public present at a hearing to be silent. For any of those activities to be objectionable under the clause as it would stand if it were amended in the way proposed by Senator Evans , one would have to show that those things amounted to an obstruction of or hindrance to the Commission or that they had disrupted a hearing before the Commission. In the view of the Government-this view has already been expressed and put on the public record by the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown) in his response to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee-that is too limited a protection to give to the Commission. Bear in mind that this is a commission dealing with the problem of organised crime, a problem which honourable senators from all sides of the chamber have indicated they agree runs deep in the community and is a matter of great concern, and there is no reason to think why there may not be people with an interest in disturbing the proceedings of the Commission. So, in all the circumstances, the Government wishes to maintain clause 22 in the form in which it appears in the draft and seeks the support of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA> Page 15, clause 24, sub-clause (1), line 40, after 're-appointment', insert ' for a period not exceeding 2 years'. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments relate to the terms of office of the commissioners, including the Chairman, his deputies and other members of the National Crimes Commission. The Bill provides at the moment for five-year terms, renewable. The effect of these amendments would be to provide simply for two-year terms, renewable no more than once. The object of the amendment is to ensure some regular turnover at the top of the Crimes Commission and to reduce the chances of the Commission assuming an unaccountable life of its own. </PARA>
<PARA> In dealing with matters of this kind one has to draw a balance between two competing considerations. One is the notion of accountability to the Executive and parliament of the body being created; the other, which becomes relevant when we are dealing with sensitive matters involving criminal law and so on, is to endeavour to ensure a degree of independence from the executive government of the day to create a situation where the body exercising functions in a sensitive area is not simply the stooge of the executive government of the day. This is a problem which notoriously arises in the context of secret organisations like the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. It can also be significant in a number of other areas where sensitive policy decisions are being made by statutory authorities or corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> In the present context, the Opposition would come down in consideration of that balance on the side of ensuring a greater degree of accountability to the executive government of the day, and through that to the parliament, than independence of the Executive. We see it as being important to acknowledge the principle of independence from the Executive, and that is the subject matter of the next amendment the Opposition will be moving, to clause 25. It will take away the remuneration of the National Crimes Commission from the determination of the Attorney-General and make it the subject of determination by the independent Remuneration Tribunal. Nothing can make an Executive organ quite so much a prisoner of the government of the day than having its bread and butter and the bread and butter of the individuals who constitute it dependent on the patronage of the government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> So we in a sense mark our concern for a degree of independence from the Executive in amendment No. 10, which deals with the remuneration question, and focus here in the context of the terms of an appointment on the question of accountability. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate that Senator Chaney is more interested in expedition than in principle in these matters but I will be happy to accommodate him in both respects by expediting it and by being persuasive on the issue of principle . I simply say that it is a difficult balance. I appreciate that some honourable senators-neanderthal troglodytes, small '1' liberal and otherwise-may not be interested in the nature of this argument but we are doing our best to bring it to their attention nonetheless. The particular objection to this that one has to contemplate is, I suppose, that we would be doing something to destroy the continuity of the organisation if we have turnover as rapid as this. As to this, I say two things. Firstly, there will be no question of destroying the continuity of the staff of the Commission. We are only talking about the top, the commissioners themselves. Secondly, as to those commissioners there is provision for up to four- year terms with the first two-year term being renewable once. Obviously it would not be difficult to organise matters in such a way that there was an overlap of tenure at any given time so as to ensure continuity and not a complete severance in the composition of the body.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For those reasons we believe this is a practical and workable amendment as well as one that is sensible in principle because it establishes a closer nexus between this body and the Executive government which has given it life. Given the history of crimes commission's in some other jurisdiction, the way in which they have become at worst targets for corruption and at best, in the scale of misbehaviour, have lost their sense of balance and perspective by having people heading them for too long, we feel it is important to guard against this experience. Thus, this amendment is directed to those objectives.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to Senator Evans to the extent that during his remarks on the clause and the proposed amendment he brought out the balance which is required between competing principles-the problem of having people who are too much at the pleasure of the Executive and hence without the independence which is required of people who may be doing quite delicate, difficult and, at times, contentious work. There is a conflict there, and there is room there for differences of opinion as to where the balance or how the balance ought to be struck.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this case I am sorry, however, that Senator Evans has taken my proper concern for expedition as being a lack of concern for principle. The Government has addressed itself to the issues which he has raised in Committee. It has come down with a viewpoint that the balance is one which ought to be weighed more heavily in favour of the independence and the continuity of people who are appointed to these difficult and important positions. An appointment for a maximum period of two years would effectively make it an appointment at pleasure , the period being so brief when one considers the potentially lengthy inquiries which have to be made. It is the Government's view that in considering the principles raised by Senator Evans the balance needs to be more heavily in favour of the independence, hence we favour the retention of the longer period which is provided for in the clause.</PARA>

<PARA> '(3) A person to whom this section applies shall not be required to produce in any court any document that has come into his custody or control in the course of, or by reason of, the performance of his duties under this Act, or to divulge or communicate to a court a matter or thing that has come to his notice in the performance of his duties under this Act, except where it is necessary to do so-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this Act; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) for the purposes of a prosecution instituted as a result of an investigation carried out by the Commission in the performance of its functions.</PARA>
<PARA> '(4) In this section-</PARA>
<PARA> 'court' includes any tribunal, authority or person having power to require the production of documents or the answering of questions;</PARA>
<PARA> 'produce' includes permit access to, and 'production' has a corresponding meaning.'. </PARA>
<PARA>Proposed new clause 36A seeks to put an obligation on members of the National Crimes Commission in relation to their work. The amendment refers to a member or an acting member of the Commission, a person assisting the Commission, a person employed or engaged by the Chairman under section 35 of the National Crimes Commission Bill 1982 or a person appointed to assist the Commission under section 36 of the Bill. We feel this is extremely important. Sub-clause (2) of the proposed new clause states;</PARA>
<PARA> A person to whom this section applies who . . .</PARA>
<PARA> (a) makes a record of any information; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) divulges or communicates to any person any information,</PARA>
<PARA> being information acquired by him by reason of or in the performance of his duties . . . is guilty of an offence. </PARA>
<PARA>We believe a great deal of pressure may be brought to bear upon individual members of or members assisting, the Commission. It should be made very clear that none of these people who assist the Commission can divulge any information and that it would be an offence to do so. Sub-clause (3) also does not allow such people to produce in any court any document that has come into their custody. The idea of this is that it is not possible to interfere with the operations of the National Crimes Commission by getting at a servant of the Commission where it is not possible to get at the Commission itself. We believe this amendment would make clear those two propositions, and we commend it to the Senate. </PARA>

I would be anxious to know whether the Minister for Social Security ( Senator Chaney) has an answer to the problem of secrecy clauses. I do not want to see a lot more secrecy clauses. I am very anxious to see the Attorney-General 's Department remove a lot of them in accordance with the undertaking of the Freedom of Information Act. The problem we raised has been responded to at page 9 of the nineteenth report of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. We believe that existing Acts cover Commonwealth public servants, police officers or other persons attached to or employed by the National Crimes Commission who would be subject to the secrecy provisions of the Crimes Act. We feel that persons engaged as consultants and so forth are not covered in this amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move by way of amendment to that motion:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the clauses of the Bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Consitutional and Legal Affairs for inquiry and report. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a course of action that was foreshadowed by me during the debate on the second reading stage. In the event that a substantial proportion of the Opposition's amendments at the Committee stage were not accepted, I pointed out that we would seek to have some further and better consideration of the clauses of the National Crimes Commission Bill 1982 by the Senate Standing Committee on Consitutional and Legal Affairs. It has become apparent that for one reason or another, some of them fortuituous, the Opposition's strike rate has been somewhat less than sensational in the Committee stage. Of the 10 amendments we moved, two of relatively lesser importance were accepted by the Government. One of them was passed against the Government's will in a division and seven, for one reason or another, have bitten the dust. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of this motion are simply at attempt to give another opportunity for those more liberally minded honourable senators to reconsider the enormity of the course they have taken in opposing the rational and principled amendments that have been flowing from the Oppostion side of the chamber in the latter part of this afternoon. In particular they should reconsider the implications of the jurisdiction of the Commission remaining as wide as it does under the unamended clause 7, the implications of the search and seizure provision, remaining as it does under clause 14, the implications of the still existing power of the Press to sully reputations which are smeared in a hearsay fashion during such public hearings as are held by the Commission and the provision which remains in the Bill allowing open ended gaol terms for those people who arouse the indignation of the Commission and refuse to co-operate with it. There are important issues of principle in relation not only to those amendments but also to the whole concept of the Bill, which Bill has been the subject of numerous representations to us from professional bodies and others interested in civil liberties and law enforcement around this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that we have had a somewhat less than intensive and rational consideration of this legislation during the Committee stage, certainly somewhat less principled and detailed than I might have hoped would be possible. Under those circumstances I believe it is appropriate that the matter go to this Committee for a proper and detailed consideration. The urgency of the matter is now off, given that at least for the moment there does not seem to be a prospect of an early election, which was undoubtedly the major motivation for bringing the legislation on as quickly as was the case. I may, of course, be proven wrong in that respect. It is not a job that need occupy the Senate Committee for more than a few months. Certainly I imagine it would be possible for the Committee to produce a report before the currently scheduled termination of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union in the middle of next year. For all those reasons I commend this legislation to the Senate. </PARA>

In my opinion, it is important that there ought to be a crimes commission in this country. It ought to be operating as soon as possible.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Government and all liberal-minded, rational and principled senators who spoke earlier in the debate, I indicate opposition to the suggestion that the National Crimes Commission Bill be sent to a committee. If one looks at the examination of this Bill in the House of Representatives and the Senate, in each case one will find criticism of the way the Bill has been dealt with. Yet I do not believe any piece of legislation, except perhaps the tax legislation, in this current session has received more detailed attention from the Parliament. Unlike the tax legislation, this legislation has been substantially amended, with amendments being brought forward by the Opposition, Government senators and members, and the Australian Democrats. It has received moulding by the Parliament in a way which is more complete than any other item of legislation which we have dealt with certainly in this calendar year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have a healthy respect for the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs and for the work which it carried out on such major legislation as the national compensation legislation which was brought in during 1975, the Family Law Act and so on. I express no disrespect at all for the capacity of that Committee to analyse and to improve legislation. I believe that we are in the unusual situation of not merely having the sort of urgency that Senator Missen stressed of getting something into place which deals with what we would all agree is a national problem-some would say that the presence of organised crime in our community is a national disgrace-but also the objection that on this occasion Parliament itself, in both chambers, has subjected the Bill to critical scrutiny in the Committee stage and has substantially amended the Bill to meet many of the objections that have been raised. I think that, on this occasion, the passage of the Bill should be completed rather than having the experience of what would inevitably be a further considerable delay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will not support the Opposition's motion to send the National Crimes Commission Bill to a committee. The reasons have been enunciated both by Senator Missen and by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). Basically the need for urgency in this matter is that we believe a great deal of work must be done once this Bill is passed and that any delay will delay the putting into effect of at least the good parts of this Bill-those parts which the Australian Labor Party has commented on and supported.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other item is one which commends itself, that is, the point raised by the Minister that a great number of amendments have been accepted in the House of Representatives that have been moved by Government back benchers. Indeed, additional amendments that the Labor Party and ourselves have proposed have been accepted here. If one looks at this Bill in comparison with many other Bills that have been debated fairly furiously in the last few months, it has probably had greater acceptance of suggestions by the Government not only by way of amendment but also prior to the Bill being introduced in this place. On this matter it is as well that that occurred, simply because its operation will be viewed with a great deal of suspicion in the community and also with a great deal of hope. In that case, it is best that it goes forward as soon as possible so those matters that were mooted to be put into legislation may be implemented so that at least some concerted attack at a national level can be made on organised crime. At least we may have, for the first time ever, some effective mechanism for dealing with those enormous operations that have dealt so many blows to our community. </PARA>

It may have been introduced, of course, in late October. Whatever the situation may be, I recall very well the night when it was discussed in the House of Representatives because I was listening to it. Although I have not spoken in the debate thus far, I have had a keen interest in the matter and I examined the amendments that came forward from the Opposition. I was concerned that at least one of those amendments was not adopted. I am concerned also that the States have not been fully consulted on this issue. I make the quite categorical accusation against the Government that the States have not been adequately consulted about this particular issue. The National Crimes Commission Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives, let us say, in late October and the debate on the Bill virtually ranged over one day-from 8.52 p.m. until 1.12 a .m. I do not think that is such a brilliant way of handling a measure such as this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Lionel Bowen made the comment that the Government should seriously consider redrafting major sections of the Bill. Therefore, he opposed the Bill at the third reading stage. The Bill is now before this chamber. Today-by arrangement, of course-people here have not entered into the Committee stage of the debate. I would have liked to enter into the debate at the Committee stage but I understand that it is late in the session and one is frowned upon if one gets up and wastes taxpayers' money, as it is said, in attempting to address one's mind to major matters that come before this chamber. One is concerned when that sort of accusation is thrown at one because of one's interest in the matter. But I can assure honourable senators that I was quite clear on the issues involved and the amendments that were to be moved. I listened with interest to the debate in the House of Representatives and I listened with interest to the debate in this chamber. Having analysed the amendments, I was prepared to vote the way that I did when I had that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> A reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs would enable the Committee to have a look at this legislation and it would enable people within the community to have their say. I genuinely believe that people have not had the opportunity to do that. After all, a month's gestation period for a major matter such as this is not a very long time. That is a further reason why I support the proposition put forward by Senator Evans that the matter be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to recap on some of the matters that have just been raised because, as I said, I was not proposing to support the proposal; but I do want to say, as I have alluded to in the past, that I find it regrettable that the Government has not been able seriously to contemplate deferring passage of this legislation until such time as there has been a proper deliberation of this legislation and there have been co-operative negotiations in a sense of good will between the various States, the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory. Before this legislation was introduced there was good will, a spirit of intent to ensure progress, a spirit of intent to ensure that ultimately good, effective legislation would be introduced. It was only with the sudden introduction of this legislation that that good will broke down. I am sure that until that stage there was very much a meeting of the minds of all the participants from the States, the Territory and the Commonwealth. As I said once before, as at 5 November there was to be a report on this matter. All the participants were to work out and ultimately present a final model as to how the National Crimes Commission should operate as agreed upon unanimously by those people. I would have thought that if the Government were serious about this legislation to the point that it wanted to ensure that it would encompass everything and be successful in its application it would have ensured that those negotiations had continued. I do not believe that organised crime is exclusively the prerogative of the conscience or the concern of the Federal Government. In fact, it is very much a matter for the States and the Territory. I am sure that this legislation would be more effective, the endeavours would be more serious and that the attacks upon organised crime would be much more constructive if there had been mutual co- operation and more effective legislation drawn up between the States, the Territory and the Commonwealth, given the fact that the States and the Territory have within their jurisdiction the great majority of criminal legislation. My objection is not to this legislation; it is to the manner, the style and the intent of its introduction.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise simply to indicate that, the Opposition's serious-minded attempts to improve this legislation having substantially failed, as also has its endeavour to refer the matter to a committee for further and better consideration, the Opposition now has no alternative but to oppose the National Crimes Commission Bill at the third reading stage. We did support the Bill at the second reading stage, for reasons which I then outlined, because we thought we had the elements of a potentially successful model to operate in this area of investigating organised crime which was not being effectively coped with by existing law enforcement agencies or the ad hoc system of royal commissions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We did, however, indicate at that stage that we were determined to ensure that a crimes commission not be established unless and until there was an effective set of safeguards to ensure that basic liberties were not put at risk by this new institution and that reputations were not wrongfully destroyed. We do not have confidence that that endeavour has been successful. We believe that basic liberties are still at risk under this unamended legislation. We believe that reputations will have a very strong chance of being destroyed unless the powers and jurisdiction of the National Crimes Commission are exercised with very much more caution than has been traditional with royal commissions in the past. We remain profoundly unhappy with the course of events now in relation to the Bill, having sought at all stages to be constructive and co-operative in the evolution of a successful and workable model that would have full cross party and community support. I register my disappointment with that course of events and indicate on behalf of the Australian Labor Party that it now has no alternative but outright opposition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I do not wish to add to the habit which is growing in this place of having first, second and third reading debates, many of which are largely repetitive but, if I may respond to Senator Evans, I find it strange that he should refer to this legislation as unamended legislation. I think, on a rough count, there were 22 amendments to the legislation carried in the House of Representatives and the Senate and it simply does not warrant that description. The fact of the matter is that a limited number of Opposition amendments were found not to be acceptable to the Senate or to the House of Representatives.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful to Senator Crichton-Browne for that explanation of his position. I would refer back to the second reading responsethat I gave in which I outlined why he has some slight misconception about the point that was reached with the States. There was not a high degree of consensus about the need for a crimes commission, rather the States pursued a quite different model. As I pointed out in the second reading debate, that did not involve having a single line Crimes Commission which would have the powers which were contained in this Bill. Rather there was a proposal for a beefing up or a strengthening of the criminal intelligence arrangements. The Commonwealth has indicated that it is quite happy to proceed with the strengthening of those arrangements. What we did not think was adequate was the proposal that there should be some ad hoc royal commission arrangements with a body which might co-ordinate them. We did not think that that was an effective approach.The Commonwealth put its basic proposition that it thought that a crimes commission was required in the national interest before the interests of the States. That pattern was not something that was being developed by the States. I commend the third reading of the Bill to the Senate. I thank honourable senators for the support that they have given to the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition's position needs to be stated briefly in relation to clause 6 because this has probably been the most controversial part of the entire Bill, even though it is not the subject of any amendment to be moved by the Opposition. This provision, in effect, removes the privilege, if such ever existed, against self-incrimination in relation to witnesses before royal commissions. Clause 6 seeks to insert a new section 6A in the Royal Commissions Act to provide that it not be a reasonable excuse to refuse to produce documents or fail to answer questions on the ground that to do so might incriminate the person. This has been described in some quarters as horrendous. It has been described by the President of the Law Council of Australia, Mr Gerry Murphy, in a rather belated bit of huffing and puffing in a media release yesterday, as outrageous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I think it is important to appreciate that the provision is doing no more than restoring a situation which has been assumed to prevail since 1912. The reasons why that is so and how the situation came about are appropriately described in the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security ( Senator Chaney). I do not want to do anything more than simply advert to that and say that we accept the reasoning there set out. It may be that there is some larger constitutional question that remains to be litigated as to whether it is compatible with the Constitution for the right or the privilege against self- incrimination ever to be taken away, even by royal commissions. We simply leave that to one side to be litigated at the appropriate time. </PARA>
<PARA> On the merits, the argument is simply, as I think was foreshadowed in the second reading speech, that royal commissions are, after all, aimed at getting at the facts of particular matters, including such things as air crashes and matters of that kind, and exposing them publicly. It would be incompatible with that objective were the privilege against self-incrimination to prevail at the expense of persons answering questions directed to them. That is a very different context from the exploratory or investigative context in which it is proposed that a crimes commission is to operate. That, of course, is another good reason in principle for creating a separate Crimes Commission with limited powers in this respect as distinct from the royal commissions. I do not wish to delay the Committee further, but I think it is important that the fact that there is a reasoned basis for accepting this clause be put on record by the Opposition because it is a matter which has generated a lot of controversy. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(9.23)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose this clause, as was indicated in the sheet that was circulated, for all the reasons that were explained in relation to the amendments the Opposition sought to pass to clause 20 of the National Crimes Commission Bill. Clause 8 of the Royal Commissions Amendment Bill seeks to insert a new section 6C which, in fact, creates exactly the same procedure of an application to the Federal Court of Australia for an order requiring compliance against someone who refuses to attend or fails to answer questions before a royal commission, a breach of which order will then result in a contempt of court order and, potentially, then an open-ended gaol term for the non-complying witness. The reasons for opposing this provision are exactly the same as those that were articulated in the National Crimes Commission Bill debate. There is no need for me to repeat them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is, however, something of a change in the availability of senators when it comes to the vote on this matter. So this is one which, on this occasion, we propose to put to a division so that the issues of principle can be properly resolved. I simply indicate that the argument is the same to the extent that there is already in existence a sanction available against those who refuse to co-operate with royal commissions by way of non-attendance or non-answering. That sanction is contained in the existing section 6 of the Royal Commissions Act which has been just amended by an earlier clause of this Bill to make provision for a six-month gaol term or a thousand dollar fine for people who do not co-operate in that way. There is a sanction. The Government does not need the additional one that is proposed here after all these years of the operation of the Royal Commissions Act. As I said concerning the National Crimes Commission Bill in similar circumstances, the provision is both draconian and unnecessary. I urge the Committee to oppose clause 8. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government regrets that this amendment is being put forward and that it is receiving support from the Australian Democrats. As I indicated in the earlier debate, and I do not wish to canvass the points made there in full, this involves a recommendation that was put forward by Mr Costigan which is agreed to by the Government because it appears that the procedure which is set out in the Victorian Evidence Act-there are similar procedures available under the companies legislation-is a more expeditious way of dealing with the difficulty of people who are not prepared to meet the requirements of the Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The idea that it is in some way less desirable to refer people who, for one reason or another, do not wish to co-operate with the Commission to a court for consideration and to make them subject to some court order seems to me passing strange in the name of civil liberties. I would have thought that, with the concerns which have been expressed in this debate about the question of royal commissions and crime commissions and so on, a reference to the established courts which are not subject to any of the sorts of doubts which have been expressed would be seen as a quite positive way of ensuring that these considerable powers are exercised in a forum in which the liberties of the subject are, of course, uppermost in the minds of those who are in control. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to delay the Committee unnecessarily, but I urge the Democrats, consistent with their stated principle of considering these matters right to the end and considering the arguments raised, to consider again the question of whether reference to a court in the way which is permitted by this clause really is something which is inimical to the liberty of the subject. The Government and I do not see it in those terms. I commend the clause in its present form to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful that Senator Harradine has indicated to the Committee the basis of his opposition because that was mentioned but not dealt with in the Committee debate on the National Crimes Commission Bill. I think if Senator Harradine was listening he would recall that when I raised the matter, Senator Evans shook his head and indicated that that was not the ground on which the opposition was putting forward the amendment. Like Senator Harradine, I was certainly concerned at the suggestion of double penalty when it was raised as an objection to this clause, not in the Senate but elsewhere. I think it is important to look at the actual situation and to see that, in fact, this does not involve a double penalty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In both this Bill and the Bill that we have already considered, an offence is committed if somebody does not comply with the legal requirements to give evidence which is not subject to some valid legal objection. In other words, it is quite true that a failure to give evidence can give rise to a situation where one could be taken to court and prosecuted for an offence. I think Senator Evans in his comments on the clause referred to the actual provisions in the Act which permit a prosecution. I do not in any sense deny that the Government's position is not based on that not being the case. We agree that it is, as indeed it is under the National Commission legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The important point to add to a matter which was raised by Senator Harradine is that in a situation where there is a refusal to answer or provide information the matter is then sent of to the court which, after giving due consideration to the certificate which is put before it, has to make the decision on whether it should order the information to be given. It is in a circumstance in which an order is made by the court that the information should be given and that order is subsequently disobeyed that the possible liability for punishment for contempt arises. In other words, it is a separate subsequent refusal to comply which gives rise to a separate possibility of punishment. In exactly the same way, of course, the Commission could call the witness back before it. The witness could again refuse to give evidence and could again be subjected to punishment by the courts for a breach of the law. Where there are repetitive acts of refusal to meet legal obligations there can be a repetitive liability for punishment. </PARA>
<PARA> The same situation applies if somebody strikes another over the left ear. That person is liable for punishment for assault. If that person came round the next day and struck the other on the same ear it would not be double jeopardy to impose a separate punishment for that separate offence. There is no question here of there being liability for a dual penalty for the same unlawful act. There would have to be separate and successive unlawful acts before there would be liability to more than one penalty. If the objection on the part of some honourable senators to the clause as it stands is based on a concern that a single act should not give rise to a double penalty-of course, the basic objection to double jeopardy in the law is that one should not be punished twice for the same offence-I make it absolutely clear to the Committee that that is not the case here. We are looking at the possibility of successive breaches of the law. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The important potential safeguard for the person who is appearing before a royal commission is that he gets a chance-before a quite different forum, before a court-to have the question of whether he is required to answer tested. In other words, it is not just a blind following on from the certificate of the royal commission. I refer the Committee to proposed new section 6C (2) which appears on page 6 of the Bill. The proposed new section provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Where a certificate is given under sub-section (1),--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the certificate from the royal commission--</PARA>
<PARA>the court, upon application by the Attorney-General,-</PARA>
<PARA>So another step is required; the Attorney-General must bring an application before the court-</PARA>

<PARA>In other words, under this application the court is not visiting a punishment upon the person; it is making an order that the person should comply with the requirement. It is only if there is a subsequent failure to meet that requirement of the court that any question of a punishment for contempt can arise. I think I said earlier-perhaps during the Committee stage of the National Crimes Commission Bill-that this is a situation where one is putting before a court rather than a royal commission this fundamental question as to whether an objecting witness should be required to answer. I would see that as being much more consistent with the protection of civil liberties than would otherwise be the situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had hoped to not have had to intervene again in the consideration of this matter but it is necessary because the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), while being perfectly technically accurate in everything he said, has quite misrepresented the practical effect of what these clauses are all about. If I refuse to answer a question as to the source of some information which I have or if I refuse to answer a question, say, as to my whereabouts on a particular night and for refusing to answer one or other of those questions I am convicted under clause 6 of the Royal Commissions Amendment Bill and spend six months in gaol, it is not much consolation for me when I get out of gaol to find that I am the subject of a proceeding under the Federal Court of Australia. Should I again refuse to comply with that request and find myself in gaol again for an indefinite period this time for contempt of the Federal Court, it is not much consolation for me to learn, when I am cooling my heels in gaol for the second time for refusing to answer exactly the same question, that, technically, different questions were put on different occasions or that a technically different sequence of legal events got me into gaol.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reality of the matter is that, as Senator Harradine said by way of interjection, in each case the thing is rooted in the same course of events or in the same question that one has refused to answer. One can be punished not just once, not just twice, but on multiple occasions under the clauses as they now stand for refusing to answer one particular question-the same question repeated on subsequent occasions. In that sense-not in the technical sense-there is a degree of double jeopardy. The Government already has a punishment provision; it does not need the open-ended punishment provision that is now contained in this clause. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make one further comment. I am sorry that Senator Evans saw my explanation as being only technically correct. I point out that with respect to the provisions as they would stand if his amendment succeeded it would also be open to a royal commission to bring a witness back on successive occasions and to ask the same question. In those circumstances there would be an ongoing liability to successive punishments in the event that the witness was improperly-that it, improperly under the various sections of the Royal Commissions Act-refusing to answer the questions. The only difference in substance, I would suggest, is that there is not a limit on the court with respect to the duration of punishment which may be imposed. But in terms of the possibility that a person who continuously refuses to comply with the requirements of the royal commission to answer a question which is properly asked and for which there is no legal justification for refusal there is exactly the same liability for successive acts of punishment. My concern and the Government's concern is that the operation of these sections under the Evidence Act and the Companies Act has indicated a more practical working mechanism for the procedures. My personal preference-I express it because it is not a matter on which I have some Government direction-is that bringing an allegedly defaulting person before the courts and requiring the courts to be satisified that the various tests contained in the sections as to when a person has to answer and when a person does not have to answer are met is more likely to protect the liberty of the subject than would otherwise be the case.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Page 8, after clause 14, insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA> '14A. The principal Act is amended by adding after section 6N the following section:</PARA>
<PARA> ''6NA. (1) Where a person suffers loss, damage or injury as a result of that person having appeared as a witness before a Royal Commission, or having provided information or evidence to a Royal Commission, the Commonwealth is liable to pay compensation to that person. </PARA>
<PARA> ''(2) The amount of the compensation to be paid to a person by the Commonwealth under sub-section (1) shall be such amount as is agreed between them or, in default of agreement, as is determined by a court of competent jurisdicton to be just. </PARA>
<PARA> ''(3) The costs of and incidental to proceedings in a court under this section shall be paid by the Commonwealth, unless the court is satisfied the institution of proceedings was vexatious or frivolous.''.'. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment is concerned with the compensation of victims of royal commissions. I will not make a long speech because I understand that the amendment will not receive overwhelming support from this chamber. I will speak very briefly. The Costigan Royal Commission of Inquiry on the Activities of the Ship Painters and Dockers Union referred to the case of Mrs Cooper who was the licensee of the Station Hotel at Port Melbourne. I will not canvass the case or the deserts of Mrs Cooper at length. However, the fact is that, because she allegedly gave evidence before the Costigan Royal Commission, her hotel was boycotted by the waterside fraternity and particularly by members of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. These criminals damaged her hotel. We are advised that there is nothing in the present legislation that would cover the loss of goodwill and profits of a business. Senator Evans has been kind enough to enlighten me that existing legislation does cover people who are hurt as a result of giving evidence before royal commissions. However, I am yet to be persuaded by him that such a provision also covers loss of goodwill or profits as happened in this case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say a word or two on this matter. I do not believe that this amendment is acceptable to the Government. However, it seems to me that this matter is certainly something that should be looked into very much more closely. Unquestionably, people who come forward and give evidence in a co-operative manner can find themselves, as this woman clearly was, victimised in terms of loss of business and so forth. It is true that the Government could make ex gratia payments and so on but I do not think that this would be a satisfactory situation. I think that there is a strong case for some arrangement being made whereby people are properly compensated for losses which they suffer because they have gone forward as public spirited citizens, given evidence and thereby have suffered. It is true that people who are injured probably would be entitled to some compensation under victims of crime legislation. However, they would certainly not be compensated for loss of business. Although this matter may not affect this legislation, the Government ought to look more closely at the possibility of making future amendments to ensure that people do not suffer because they co-operate with royal commissions. I suppose the same could be said in relation to the National Crimes Commission although the situation in that respect might be more difficult. However, I believe there is great merit in something being done in this respect.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not propose to support the amendment moved by Senator Chipp. This matter has been largely canvassed. It is true that there is provision in most States for compensation for injuries which arise out of criminal action. That is a lesser point than is sought to be covered by Senator Chipp in his amendment. Protection is, of course, given to witnesses under section 6M of the Royal Commissions Act. I do not wish to comment on the particular case raised because there are in train criminal proceedings which go to the case that has been raised by way of example but was not canvassed by Senator Chipp in moving his amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposal that a witness before a tribunal of this sort should receive compensation for damages suffered by reason of such appearance is a new proposition. It may be true that, as Senator Missen has said, it needs careful consideration by the Government. I certainly undertake to refer it to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) for further consideration. But we need to be cautious in this area and ought to withstand amendment at this stage because in our society we expect citizens, as part of their civic duty, to participate in a number of things which may in one way or another cause them some detriment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not proposed by this amendment, nor do I suggest that it would be practical, that those who, pursuant to their civic duties, come forward and assist the police in their inquiries ought to get protection for loss or damage that they may suffer. A very large question is raised by the amendment. It certainly is not one that I can, on behalf of the Government, take on the run. It is one that needs longer and more careful consideration than it is possible for the Committee to give it tonight. I certainly undertake to refer it to the Attorney for that purpose. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Oppostion, I indicate that although the Opposition has considerable sympathy with the objectives sought to be assured by Senator Chipp's amendment, and has in fact wrestled with the matter for some time, on balance it is persuaded by the kind of arguments that were hinted at by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) in his reply . Run-of-the-mill situations where people are threatened or intimidated as a result of giving evidence are undoubtedly covered by existing law, as are situations in which people are physically injured as a result of some violent retaliation vented upon them following their giving evidence. Certainly there are gaps so far as the protection of property and so on are concerned, the case to which Senator Chipp referred being an obvious one in point, but in the most extreme and outrageous of those cases it has been the practice in the past to contemplate making ex gratia payments, as I understand is to be the case with the Cooper-Station Hotel affair, in the context of the Painters and Dockers Union inquiry. For the moment, that is enough to give us sufficient confidence that justice will be done in individual cases. But it is a matter that needs thought in the future in the context not only of royal commissions but also similar matters, including the whole criminal investigation process carried out by the police. I will certainly take it on board on behalf of the Opposition, but for the moment I believe that it is inopportune to pursue it to the point of amendment tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Evans and Senator Chaney for undertaking to look further into the matter , also Senator Missen for his support. Just for the record, let me say in response to Senator Chaney that section 6M of the Royal Commission Act 1902 does say that it is an indictable offence to inflict violence, damage, loss or disadvantage to any witness before any royal commission. The penalty for such an offence is a fine of $1,000 or imprisonment for one year. I wonder whether that is much joy to the victim; that is my point. I agree with Senator Chaney that section 6M does make it an indictable offence, but my concern is for the victim. Recently we have had a couple of royal commissions that have cost millions of dollars and in regard to which people have put themselves in jeopardy. I know that once or twice, with some trepidation and misgiving, I have given evidence before royal commissions on drug taking, yet those royal commissions have unearthed virtually nothing. As I have said perviously, the Williams Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs and the Woodward Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking provided an answer that was almost a lemon. Yet, in the course of those royal commissions a great many citizens felt it their duty to give evidence, thus putting themselves in some physical danger. I have in mind a situation in which someone may well be forced to disclose information, against his will, to a royal commission and suffer the consequences. With great respect, I do not think it is good enough for a person who suffers as a result of performing his civic duty in that way-to pluck a phrase from Senator Chaney's well chosen words-to have to rely on the good will of the government then in power for compensation.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will provide legislative authority for the entry into force of comprehensive double taxation agreements with the Republic of Korea and the Kingdom of Norway. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreements, which were signed on 12 July 1982 and 6 May 1982 respectively, deal with all forms of income flowing between Australia and each of the other two countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Neither can enter into force until all necessary constitutional processes are completed both by Australia and the other country. </PARA>
<PARA> Double taxation agreements have two primary objects-the elimination of international double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of these objects is achieved by the contracting countries agreeing to the allocation of taxing rights between them. </PARA>
<PARA> There are various ways by which this is done, depending upon the nature of the income involved. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, some types of income will be taxed only in the country of residence while other income may be taxed only in the country in which it has its source. </PARA>
<PARA> A third category is comprised of income which may be taxed in both countries, with the country of source generally agreeing to limit its tax, and the country of residence of the taxpayer agreeing to allow a credit against its tax on such income for the tax paid in the other country. </PARA>
<PARA> Both of the new treaties accord in all essential respects with the position that Australian governments have taken over the years in relation to double taxation agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> Each provides for the country of source to limit its tax on dividends, interest and royalties. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Korean agreement, the country of source is to limit its tax to 15 per cent of the gross amount of any dividend, interest or royalty income flowing to the other country. </PARA>
<PARA> For its part, Australia will reduce the rate of withholding tax on dividends flowing to Korea from the normal 30 per cent rate to the 15 per cent rate specificed in the agreement but, as the rate of withholding tax on interest under Australia's domestic law is 10 per cent, this will not be affected by these arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia royalties paid to non-residents are taxed on the ordinary assessment basis and, accordingly, the limit specified by the agreement will not affect the amount of Australian tax on royalties unless the tax which would otherwise be assessed is greater than 15 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties paid to Korean residents. </PARA>
<PARA> For its part, Korea will reduce its rate of tax on dividends, interest and royalties from the existing 25 per cent to the 15 per cent rate specified in the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> In some cases, however, Korea may, in accordance with its industry incentive legislation, wholly or partially exempt from Korean tax certain interest and royalty payments made to Australian residents. </PARA>
<PARA> If nothing were done to avoid the situation, the tax so foregone by Korea would simply result in a corresponding reduction in the credit to be allowed by Australia against its tax on the relevant interest and royalty payments. In other words, the Australian revenue would pick up the tax foregone by Korea, thus nullifying the incentive. </PARA>
<PARA> To avoid that result, provision is made in the agreement for Australia, as a ' tax sparing' measure, to allow a credit against its tax for tax foregone by Korea under agreed Korean incentive legislation as if notional tax equal to 10 per cent of the interest or royalty income had been paid to the Republic of Korea. </PARA>
<PARA> These tax sparing arrangements are broadly similar to those which have been included in agreements with other developing countries in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Norwegian agreement the tax of the country of source is to be limited to 15 per cent in the case of dividends and to 10 per cent for both interest and royalties. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, this limit will not affect Australia's rate of withholding tax on interest nor, since Norway does not at present tax interest or royalties paid to non-residents, will it affect the position regarding interest or royalties flowing from Norway to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> However, if Norway were to impose a tax on interest or royalties in the future, the limit of 10 per cent would apply. </PARA>
<PARA> As with the Korean agreement, the limit on the tax on royalties will only affect Australian tax on royalties paid to Norway where tax on the ordinary assessment basis would otherwise have exceeded the limit expressed in the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Both agreements contain measures for the formal relief of double taxation of income that may be taxed in both countries, with the country of residence of the taxpayer affording the necessary relief by the allowance of a credit against its tax for tax paid to the country of source. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as Australian residents are concerned, income in respect of which a limit is imposed by the agreements on the tax of the country of source-dividends , interest and royalties-will generally be taxed here with credit being allowed for the tax of the country of source. </PARA>
<PARA> However, foreign source dividends received by Australian companies will continue to be effectively tax-free in Australia under existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Other income that is taxed in full in the country of source will continue to be exempt from Australian tax. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as the object of preventing fiscal evasion is concerned, provisions are made in each agreement for the exchange of information and for consultation between the tax administrations of the contracting countries. </PARA>
<PARA> A memorandum containing more detailed explanations of technical aspects of the Bill and of the agreements will be made available to honourable senators. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the Area to be Avoided in Bass Strait, in the vicinity of the offshore petroleum production facilities, to which entry is prohibited to unauthorised Australian vessels over 200 tons gross tonnage. The Area to be Avoided replaces the existing restricted area first established in 1976 and enlarged in 1980. The existing restricted area is advisory only. However, with the increasing number of platforms in the area, and their economic importance to Australia, the Government considers it appropriate that additional steps should be taken to increase the effectiveness of the restrictions, enhancing the protection of the offshore platforms and the safe movement of shipping in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the present provisions of the Act, and in accordance with the 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf, safety zones of 500 metres have been declared around each platform, prohibiting entry by any unauthorised vessel. The Area to be Avoided established under this Bill will extend approximately 50 nautical miles from the coast to envelop the offshore platforms and submarine pipelines. Its outer boundary will lie about 5 nautical miles beyond the platforms while its inner boundary will follow the outer limit of the 3 mile territorial sea. Complementary legislation will be introduced by Victoria extending the Area to be Avoided from the outer limit of the territorial sea to the coast of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> The Areas to be Avoided established by the Commonwealth and the State legislation will have the same boundaries as the present advisory restricted area. </PARA>
<PARA> The restrictions established under the Bill will be binding on Australian vessels over 200 tons gross tonnage. For foreign vessels, the restrictions have been promulgated as an Area to be Avoided in accordance with arrangements approved by the International Maritime Organisation. The restrictions will become mandatory for foreign vessels as their governments pass appropriate legislation. The International Maritime Organisation has also approved a traffic separation scheme to the south of the Area to be Avoided to assist ship navigation. </PARA>
<PARA> Arrangements are in place involving sea, air and radar surveillance of Bass Strait to ensure that restrictions are complied with by shipping. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the details of the Bill, clause 3 inserts a new Division 6A into the 1967 Act and clause 4 adds a new schedule 6 to the Act defining the boundaries of the Area to be Avoided. The new section 140C provides for a penalty of a fine of up to $50,000 or imprisonment up to 5 years for unauthorised entry into the Area to be Avoided or both. The penalty may be imposed on the owner, the master and any officer in charge of the vessel. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to ensure that the new provisions can be carried out effectively, authorised persons are given powers of enforcement set out in the new section 140D. These include the power to board a vessel, to order the removal of a vessel from the Area to be Avoided and to order a disabled vessel to accept assistance. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the unavoidably absent Senator Walsh, who would normally handle the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill, I indicate that the Opposition does not oppose it. It is a belated implementation of part of the package announced in relation to industry on 19 July which involved a variety of measures. It is perhaps indicative of the enthusiasm with which the Government approaches the task of providing export incentives that it has taken until December to get this fairly small and innocuous but helpful piece of legislation off the ground and into effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation arises against the backdrop of a most unhappy balance of trade situation-a $9,000m deficit in the last financial year and with the country looking down the barrel of an even larger deficit this year. Against that background it becomes very important, particularly for the manufacturing industry of this country, to have incentive mechanisms of the kind contained in this legislation set in place and updated so far as their financial contents are concerned. The primary effect of the Bill, apart from some other aspects contained in it, is to update the value of the support which was contained in the original 1974 legislation introduced by the Labor Government. Thus it is, for example, that the maximum annual grant is increased by virtue of this legislation from $100,000 to $200,000. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I make the point that any pride the Government may have in these increases should be tempered both by the years of parsimony which have eroded the real value of export incentives and also by the other measures which the Government is taking on this occasion; in particular, the simultaneous abandonment of the Export Expansion Grants Scheme. Using the figures supplies by Mr Hurford, the Opposition spokesman in the other place, in 1979-80 the total allocation under that grants scheme to all industries was $162.7m. Of that total , manufacturing industry received $153.7m. However, the estimates for the current financial year, with the abandonment of that grants scheme and the continuation of only the Export Market Development Grants Scheme show that the total equivalent assistance will be only $36m. So what we are in fact confronted with when we look at export support as a whole and not just in the context of this particular program is a cost cutting exercise. There may have been some policy justification for that approach being taken to the grants scheme but we would not wish anyone to be under any illusion about the ineffectiveness and insufficiency of the Government's support in this crucial area. </PARA>
<PARA> When these points were made by Mr Hurford in a speech the contents of which ranged over the series of relevant policy issues, which there is no need for me to repeat here, the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) did not deign to give him anything in the nature of a reply. I believe that that amounted to a silent acknowledgement of the accuracy of Mr Hurford's comments and of the Government's slowly disintegrating-perhaps increasingly rapidly disintegrating- interest in real incentives to export. I think the Government has made it plain by these and other measures that its real interests are with, if anyone, the miners and the farmers of this country and not with that sector that can most immediately stimulate employment and provide a sound base for future maintenance and increases in the standard of living of Australians; namely, the manufacturing and service industries, although I notice that tourism is given some support by this measure. Following those brief remarks, I repeat that the Opposition supports this Bill and wishes it an appropriately speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my intention to justify the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill and answer some of the concerns expressed by Senator Evans. As he mentioned, the Bill must be considered in the light of the Industries Assistance Commission report on export incentives, put down in February of this year, and the Government's total package of industry assistance which includes its response to the IAC report, announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) last July. This Bill implements that part of the total package which relates to export incentives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But for the constraints of time I would have placed this Bill in the historical context of export incentives in Australia. Suffice it to say that they were first introduced in 1961 in the form of two schemes, one rewarding export improvement and the other subsidising market development. Dual schemes of the same nature exist today although that rewarding export improvement has once been abandoned, then reinstated and, further to the Prime Minister's announcement and now by this Bill, it is to be abandoned again. That relating to subsidising promotional activities is to be expanded and further refined. The question therefore is whether governments have been twice right or twice wrong in relation to the practice of recent years in export development. Fundamental questions arise relating to the need for export orientated industry and, if such need exists, the benefit and cost of direct export incentives. </PARA>
<PARA> As stated by Senator Evans on behalf of the Opposition, Australia's trading account position is far from satisfactory. In 1980-81 Australia had a trade deficit of $372m. By 1981-82 it had increased almost tenfold, to $3,321m, giving a current account deficit of over $9,000m. The export of goods increased by only 2 per cent that year whereas the value of imports increased by 17 per cent. The vulnerability of having to rely upon massive capital inflow to balance the books has already been recognised by government. On 14 December 1981 the Minister for Trade and Resources, Mr Anthony, said:</PARA>
<PARA> We cannot assume that this level of capital inflow will continue to compensate for any trading shortcomings. No country can rely on capital inflow to this degree. Already this year, capital inflow has slowed. At the same time the current account deficit has continued to grow. </PARA>
<PARA>Our trading position is of great concern. What, in that light, has happened to exports over the last decade? In general terms there has been an average annual growth of 2.1 per cent. The classifications have, however, changed. Primary sector exports other than mining have declined from 51 per cent to 45 per cent. Manufactured exports have declined from 24 per cent to 20 per cent and mining sector exports have increased from 22 per cent to about 31 per cent. Markets have also changed. The European Economic Community used to take 18 per cent of our exports but that has been reduced to about 11 per cent. The level of exports to the United States of America fell from 11 per cent to 7.8 per cent. Japan has stayed steady, with a fall from 26 per cent to 24 per cent, while the Association of South East Asian Nations and other Asian markets have substantially increased from 12.3 per cent to 19.3 per cent. The other growth area-the Middle East-has seen an increase from 1.9 per cent to 3.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the IAC has reservations about drawing conclusions from a comparison of the gross domestic product and export levels of various countries, it nevertheless stated in its report on export incentives that in 1978 Australian exports represented about 12 per cent of gross national product which proportion was lower than that in most other developed countries. Furthermore, in 1963 exports represented 15 per cent of GNP. Finally, whilst the ratio of exports to GNP declined for Australia during that period, the ratio increased for most other developed countries for which data is available. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, our export performance has been one of small, steady but nevertheless comparatively disappointing growth, with significant change in markets and significant change in the composition of export products. It shows an increasing dependence on the fluctuating fortunes of the mining sector, the consequences of which we are now suffering, and still a subtantial though slightly lower dependence on the rural sector, for which we shall suffer as a result of this drought. Notwithstanding the drought, the Bureau of Industry Economics does not foresee any substantial increased access to world agricultural commodity markets for Australia and, if the United States this year is any guide, a good crop year in Australia may not have resulted in significant reward because of the inability of importing countries to pay for the product. Our performance has not, therefore, been as good as we might imagine. It has adapted to change only slowly, and it is narrowly based and, therefore, vulnerable. The contribution of export incentives must be considered in the light of that record. </PARA>
<PARA> Who, therefore, has benefited from the schemes? The IAC estimated that in 1979- 80 manufacturing industries received 81 per cent and 95 per cent of the total grants under each of the Export Market Development Grants Scheme and the Export Expansion Grants Scheme respectively. Rural and mining industries, accounting for the substantial proportion of Australian exports, each received only 3 per cent of total export grants. Thus it would appear that the incentives have been directed to, or at least particularly taken advantage of by, the manufacturing sector. Is that a criticism? On a resource allocation argument, that might be said to be inefficient. However, if an export orientated manufacturing industry is important, this particular system might be justified. Furthermore, Australia' s apparent vulnerability, which has now been shown with drought conditions and low mineral prices, appears to support the principle of export diversification. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, the importance of an export orientated manufacturing industry has the support of such bodies as the Committee to Advise on Policies for Manufacturing Industry-the Jackson Committee-and the Crawford Study Group and remains government policy. Sir Phillip Lynch, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, when reporting on the Crawford report, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will continue to pursue policies to encourage the development of competative manufacturing industries that are more export orientated, involve specialisation in particular skills and products, use advanced technology, draw on wider markets to take advantage of scale economies, have innovative management, pursue increased productivity and rely less on government support. </PARA>
<PARA>But in looking at the role of export incentives in relation to such objectives, one is struck by the apparent inconsistency in relying less on government support. The IAC also considers that:</PARA>
<PARA> A healthy export sector is one which can be internationally competative with minimum levels of government support. </PARA>
<PARA>But if export incentives do encourage specialisation, updating of technology and improved management skills or encourage market expansion and development beyond the financial capacity of the manufacturer, there may well be a countervailing argument. In the debate on the motor vehicle industry last November I argued for the concept of export facilitation as an incentive for those able to produce an internationally competitive product. Again, economies of scale benefit from specialisation and attendant advanced technology, and I think that the adoption of that principle by government has shown reward. The export of engines by General Motors-Holden's Pty Ltd is an example of the utilisation of Australia's natural resource advantages and a realistic incentive to guide industry in a desirable national direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Somewhat similarly, in May of this year when speaking to the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1982, I argued for accelerated depreciation on plant and depreciation on buildings on the basis that our manufacturing industry cannot be expected reasonably to compete with overseas industry which is receiving such benefits. I am pleased to see that this fact has been recognised by the Government and included in the total package of benefits of Australian industry. Thus I would support in certain circumstances what might be called a distortion by the purists, dependent upon an analysis of the ultimate objective. Therefore, it is relevant to see how the IAC assessed the contribution of the schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Although accepting the difficulty in obtaining quantifying evidence, the IAC could find little expansion in exports attributable to the EEG Scheme. Furthermore, it found little evidence from witnesses that they had used grant money to invest in higher technology plant and equipment or to undertake research concerned with the development of export orientated products. In other words, it found little evidence that the scheme had produced direct long term advantage. It found that the EMDG payments had been more successful, mainly because they have increased awareness of export opportunities and enabled some exporters to establish a foothold in export markets and achieve export sales which would be sustainable in the absence of assistance. Overall, however, it recommended that both schemes be terminated. Its rationale was largely that the export sector cannot be considered in isolation from other sectors of the economy, as to a large extent a healthy export sector is contingent on the development of an efficient and competitive industry structure as part of the economy as a whole. That structure will be better achieved by the implementation of a policy of general reduction in protection which would encourage the development of export and other relatively low cost activities, by reducing the cost penalties resulting from the provision of relatively high levels of assistance to many import competing industries. </PARA>
<PARA> To quote the Prime Minister, the Government's decision accepts the concept of:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a winding down of direct assistance to exports. At the same time the package is designed to encourage industrial investments and increase efficiency, by particularly providing accelerated depreciation on plant, depreciation on income producing buildings and maintaining the industrial research and development incentives scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has reaffirmed its desire to foster a healthy export industry sector and to facilitate the structural adjustment of industry towards greater export orientation but has rejected that this can be best achieved by providing financial incentives to increase exports. On the other hand, the Government did not reject the principle of direct assistance to encourage exports. It might be said that there is an inconsistency or, alternatively, that all eggs are being placed in the one more efficient basket. There is probably some truth in both propositions. But the EMDG Scheme can be justified by its ultimate objective in much the same way as export facilitation. It enables an industry to develop export markets which it may not otherwise be financially able to develop. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other complication I wish to mention. That is the substantial growth of protectionism in world trade in recent years. Australia has argued in recent times that the multilateral winding back of subsidies to international trade is desirable. Furthermore, in September of last year Australia signed the Code on Subsidies and Countervailing Duties. Arguably, the EEG Scheme is in fact prohibited by the code. Thus by its action the Government is not only endorsing the code but, by not redirecting the whole of the incentive into a legitimate scheme, it is taking a small step to endorse by practice the principles of its recent trade initiative. It will be remembered that at the time of the call by the Prime Minister for such an initiative there was the criticism that Australia was not prepared to show a lead. </PARA>
<PARA> I do, however, sound a warning. The most impressive economic performance over the last decade has been that of Singapore, which has gained its achievements through increased trade sponsored by such government assistance-I shall not list all the examples-as follows: Exports are not subject to value added tax, turnover tax, development tax, or capital gains tax; there was a 50 per cent reduction in company tax for export income profits; approved companies are given a concessional tax rate on profits-a 90 per cent reduction-for five years; and there are double deductions for export promotional expenses. The majority of the IAC said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission considers that the principle of matching export incentives with those provided by other countries is not a sound principle on which to base longer term economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA>That may be so as economic theory, but Australia cannot expect its industries to compete against an unfair advantage artificially created by a competing government. That was the point that I made in an earlier speech on the subject of depreciation allowances. </PARA>
<PARA> If, therefore, other governments are not prepared to comply with not only the letter but also the spirit of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Australia must not be prepared to sacrifice its export potential in the manufacturing sector for an ideal. We must, therefore, develop a system with sufficient flexibility to determine when it is in the nation's long term best interests to help industry in the short term to meet unfair competition. Therefore, apart from that challenge, which we have not yet met, I recommend the Government decision, first as a further step domestically away from artificial distortion of economic development; secondly, in the recognition that the Government must nevertheless not abandon a responsibility to guide economic growth towards ultimate national goals: and thirdly, as a positive commitment to what is in the international best interest-a gradual reduction rather than an increase in protectionism and subsidies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise very briefly to speak in support of the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1982 on behalf of the Australian Democrats. In our view it is a very important Bill. We have just heard from Senator Hill a very enlightened and well thought out speech supporting the Bill and pointing out how the Government's attempts to assist manufacturing industry to export have been subject to repeated changes over the years. I think it is indicative of the interest this chamber has in manufacturing that Senate Hill has been speaking virtually to himself and those few honourable senators who have been in the chamber have not disguised a look of boredom on their faces. I can say only that it a great tragedy that the Government has concentrated its attention on the agricultural and mining sectors to gather foreign exchange and to encourage the exports of those industries and has let a one-time very healthy export market for our manufacturing products decline quite seriously. The worst thing that can happen to industry is not to know what the Government's intentions are, and the many changes to the export incentives to our manufacturing industries have been quite devastating. Companies have spent large amounts of money developing export markets in certain countries only to find that the Government has changed its policy and they have had to retrench representation in overseas offices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although this Bill has the support of the Democrats it is of great concern to us in that, as Senator Evans pointed out, it represents a reduction in the total amount of assistance to manufacturing industry for exporting. To that degree it is a great pity. I think it clearly demonstrates to us the Government's downgrading of the importance of the manufacturing industry. I hope the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) will address himself to this when replying. If the Government had a more enlightened approach we could now have a manufacturing export industry which would act as a buffer to the decline that both our mining and agricultural export industries are facing. The facts are that a balanced economy with due regard to all three sectors-mining, farming and manufacturing-is what this country needs and is what it has not had in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> The manufacturing export industry can act as a stabilising factor in times of downturn in commodity prices and in times of drought. We hope that the Government sees the error of its ways and turns again to the manufacturing industry, particularly to the exporting side of manufacturing industry, as an important initiative in trying to solve our very crucial deficit on the current account, which as we know, last year was $9.1 billion and this year gives all promise of being considerably in excess of that. If the sorts of incentives which, as Senator Hill pointed out, the Singaporean Government gives its manufacturing industries, had been offered to Australian manufactures, we would have had a very flourishing, soundly based and rapidly developing exporting manufacturing industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I rise to thank honourable senators for their support of the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1982. I believe one or two points raised by Senator Siddons and Senator Evans require comment. This Bill amounts to a very substantial increase, in fact a doubling, of the ceiling in significant items that are included in this legislation. I also draw attention to the fact that Senator Siddons has obviously ignored that it was this Government which in 1978 introduced the Export Expansion Grants Scheme, which amounted to substantial assistance to industry in selling its goods overseas. This Government has a firm commitment to the development of export industry. It is not the absence of any further assistance which Senator Siddons leads us to believe is the problem in export markets today; rather it is the underlying problems relating to the costs of manufacturing in this country. I thought he, as a manufacturer, would have recognised that as being a difficult problem and consequently would have given more credit to the Government for its long term commitments to this area of assistance. I thank honourable senators for their general support of the legislation and wish the Bill a speedy passage.</PARA></TALK.START>

As a result they have necessitated a good deal of scurrying around to satisfy ourselves that there is nothing in them to worry about. They mainly seem to be directed towards geting rid of the possibility of some rorts in this area, at least so far as clause 4 is concerned, and cleaning things up a bit so far as the tourist promotion provisions are concerned; an admirable objective but one which could equally well have been served some months ago, in our submission, and it would have been helpful to have had earlier notice.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Social Security Amendment Bill 1982 proposes to amend the Social Security Act 1947 in two areas. It has been introduced in response to anomalies in the operation of the Act that have come to the Government's attention recently. The budgetary implications of the proposed amendments are relatively minor. The Bill proposes to pay family allowance to the parents of unemployed school leavers during the six week period they are not qualified for unemployment benefit. It will also extend eligibility for sickness benefits to a number of people to whom it should be paid but two are presently excluded because of the wording of the legislation. It will also enable, for the first time, all sickness beneficiaries who are otherwise eligible to receive supplementary (rental) allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>Assistance for parents of unemployed school leavers</PARA>
<PARA> Under current provisions when a student child over the age of 16 years ceases to be a full-time student, family allowance ceases to be payable from the following family allowance period. Where a school-leaver does not immediately or quickly obtain employment, there is a six week waiting period before unemployment benefit becomes payable to the former student. Thus there has been a relatively short period during which no specific support has been available to families for the maintenance of an unemployed school-leaver. This has created difficulties for some families where the parents are on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government now proposes to treat such a child as a student over the six week period or the relevant part of that period. In this way payment of family allowance, including handicapped child's allowance and double orphan's pension, can continue during the period the child remains unemployed and otherwise qualified. Similarly, the amendment provides that where the school-leaver is the child of a pensioner or beneficiary, additional pension or benefit for the child shall continue to be paid for the relevant part of the deferral period. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will operate from the family allowance pay period which commenced on 15 October 1982 and in relation to pension and benefit instalments falling due on or after 1 November 1982. The cost of this initiative is estimated as some $5m in a full year at the current rates. </PARA>
<PARA> I also take this occasion to mention another initiative affecting student children but one for which legislative amendment is not required. As from the beginning of 1983 the amount of income which a student may have while attracting family allowance or additional pension or benefit is to be increased. The Government has decided to increase the amount of income which a student may have while continuing to be regarded as a 'dependant' from $1,800 to $2,500 for those living at home. For students living away from home, the limit has been raised from $2,600 to $3,600. </PARA>
<PARA>Sickness Benefits</PARA>
<PARA> Under the current provisions of the Social Security Act, a person may qualify for a sickness benefit if he is temporarily incapacitated for work because of sickness or accident and has thereby suffered a loss of salary, wages or other income. the loss of income must arise from an incapacity for work. Legal advice provided to the Department of Social Security has indicated that this loss of income requirement is only met where a claimant was actually receiving income immediately before the incapacity occurred or where he would have definitely received an income if the incapacity had not occurred. accordingly, it has become necessary to assist people adversely affected by this requirement by providing special benefit. To overcome this anomaly, the Bill extends eligibility for sickness benefit to two categories of people who may currently be disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> First, eligibility will be extended to people who are able to show that, but for their incapacity, they would have been qualified to receive unemployment benefit. The rate of sickness benefit paid to these people will be limited to the appropriate amount of unemployment benefit. This limitation ensures precisely comparable treatment with unemployment beneficiaries who become incapacitated for work and are transferred to sickness benefit. Elegibility will also be specifically extended to former invalid pensioners and recipients of sheltered employment allowance, and to former recipients of rehabilitation allowance, who had previously been paid sickness benefit, invalid pension or sheltered employment allowance. Such persons may not be eligible under the more general new provision since they may not be eligible for unemployment benefit. The rate of sickness benefit paid in such cases will reflect the previous pension or allowance payment. </PARA>
<PARA> The initiatives governing payment of supplementary (rent) allowance to sickness beneficiaries are significant. At present a person who is transferred from unemployment benefit to sickness benefit is not qualified to receive supplementary allowance. Similarly, an incapacitated person who has not suffered an actual loss of income but who is granted sickness benefit under the new provision would not be eligible for supplementary allowance. The Bill extends eligibility, under the normal conditions, to both of those groups. Thus for the first time all sickness beneficiaries otherwise eligible will be able to claim supplementary allowance. Consistent with the relevant provision governing the payment of supplementary allowance to sickness beneficiaries, eligibility for the allowance will commence after a six week period. </PARA>
<PARA> A further minor but important advance in this area contained in the Bill is a provision which enables all pensioners who were previously receiving supplementary assistance or incentive allowance to receive supplementary allowance immediately on transfer to sickness benefit, rather than wait for the six weeks qualifying period. The cost of the amendments to the sickness benefit and supplementary allowance provisions is estimated at $2.5 million in a full year at current rates. The amendments to the sickness benefit and supplementary allowance provisions will take effect as soon as the Bill receives the Royal Assent. This Bill corrects important anomalies in the Social Security Act which have been drawn to our attention as a cause of hardship to certain groups in the community. It is a Bill that I believe deserves the support of all honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on the adjournment to make some observations about a well-produced book called The Ironworkers which was written by Robert Murray and Kate White. It deals with a very important segment of the trade union movement. We all know about Robert Murray from some of his earlier publications, including The Split which dealt with a turbulent era of the Australian Labor Party in the 1950s and another excellent book which dealt with Australia between the two wars. Likewise, this book deals in full with the leadership of the Federated Ironworkers Association. It not only deals with the current leaders but also goes back to the formation of the union which was before World War I.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I rise primarily because an error appears on pages 286 and 287 of this excellent publication. As a former official of the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Labor Party, I want to correct this mistake. The book discusses the torrid period during the struggle for control of the union. It states that in 1965 the National Secretary of the Ironworkers Union, Laurie Short, in an act of compassion suggested that a man named Ken McKeon should be given Australian Labor Party membership. I used the word 'compassion'. In that context, I want to develop the saga of the McKeon family to indicate why Ken McKeon was not given membership. I will be as quick as I can. </PARA>
<PARA> I take the Senate back to my first dealings with the McKeon family who lived in Concord. My story has a small beginning. It began on a Sunday morning. I had a fox terrier dog named Jeff. I know that people such as Senator Douglas McClelland who is a dog lover will appreciate this aspect. I went along to my place of worship. The three McKeon boys were in the churchyard. They were always vicious. They took umbrage because my dog followed me into the church. Whatever denomination people are, I do not believe it was the end of the world because that inoffensive dog wanted to follow me into the church. </PARA>
<PARA> Ken McKeon, who was the greatest degenerate of any member of the trade union movement in New South Wales, laid my dog out with a brick. I picked up a piece of three by two in order to even things up because there were three McKeons and only myself. It was unfortunate that, with the dog lying in a pool of blood, the father of the McKeon boys, who was a policeman, threatened to arrest me. Of course, there was only one victor and it was not me. I carried the dog the half mile to my home. I said to my mother: 'One day I will even that up'. </PARA>
<PARA> I will take the saga of the McKeon family a bit further. During the early 1950s , Ken McKeon was one of Ernie Thornton's henchmen in the Federated Ironworkers' Association. I state quite fairly that I do not have phobias if someone is a Marxist. A man whom I often see today-we are on good terms although our politics are miles apart-is Jack McPhillips who was a prominent official of the ironworkers union during that era. The difference is that Jack McPhillips has remained loyal to his Marxist principles. But the McKeons used Catholicism, Marxism and toadying to the boss for their own ends. </PARA>
<PARA> I started by saying that Ken McKeon was the greatest degenerate who was ever in the trade union movement in Australia. I will illustrate this point. A friend of mine, Wally Carlton, a prominent Sydney businessman, was an FIA member at the Westinghouse Brake Company. The modus operandi that Ken McKeon would use consisted of knocking on the doors of delegates that he did not like when he knew they were out, abuse their wives and then sometimes expose himself. That was the sort of man he was. It did not end there. When he was an official of the ironworkers union, he used his conscripted typists as his bedmates. It was of all the more concern when it was well known that he used to attend the VD clinic in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> I will put this matter in clear terms. I know that the facts are sordid but this must be said. I will give honourable senators the whole story of Ken McKeon . When he left the Communist Party, of course, he looked for somewhere else where he could feather his nest. He ultimately finished up as part of the boss class, as an industrial officer for the Chicago Bridge Company. He then went to Bernard Smith and subsequently to another firm. That is the saga of Ken McKeon. I know that Senator Douglas McClelland will agree with my comments. In 1965 Laurie Short had a moment of weakness and suggested that Ken McKeon should be forgiven. I believe in dealing with this matter on a sectarian line. When Louis Budenz, who was the leader of the Communist Party in the United States, wanted a good job, he embraced Catholicism and got a job at the Jesuit University at Fordham. McKeon operated in the same way. The McKeon family, when they were not using Catholicism, were using Marxism. Therefore, in 1965, when Short suggested that he was a reformed character, I said: 'He will only get in over my dead body '. He never got in! I was supported by the General Secretary of the Labor Party, Bill Colbourne, by the then member for Kingsford-Smith, Dan Curtin, and the present Chairman of Committees in the Legislative Council of New South Wales, Clive Healy. I make that point deliberately because when people read this book I do not want them to believe what is written in error, namely, that a super degenerate, which is what McKeon was, ever came into the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal with his two brothers because they were also the assailants on my dog and me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He did and he lived for another seven years in spite of that vicious attack. With regard to the other two McKeons, one joined the Democratic Labor Party and the other had membership for a long while in the Australian Labor Party. Let met give the Senate my reasons for indicting them. They were more cunning. They were church wardens in the various parishes in the Catholic Archdiocese in Sydney. The remarkable thing about them was that one Sunday they would go around with the plate. But the next Sunday, if somebody else went around, it would be noticed that there was more money on the plate. Honourable senators can draw the conclusion that the McKeon family was the dregs of society . I make that point because I believe in settling scores. So the situation is that Ken McKeon was denied membership of the Labor Party personally by me due to that vicious attack on my dog. But, apart from that, there was no way, when we heard the other aspects about his sexual peculiarities and other things, that he would be accepted into the Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I commend this book The Ironworkers. It is an excellent book. It is 99.9 per cent accurate. But the .01 per cent remaining portrayed the low grade people that the McKeons were.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 3 December, the Australian newspaper carried an article headed 'Lone Crusader Prompts Fresh Diplomatic Check'. Later in the article we read the following:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senior Labor Party sources said yesterday Senator Primmer was 'a lone crusader' in his battle against the three senior public servants. </PARA>
<PARA> He did not have his Party's support in the matter, particularly since Mr Henderson and Mr Bowden had already been cleared by two separate reports. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know who the senior Australian Labor Party sources quoted are. Quite frankly, I care not because, if I am a lone crusader, I believe I am in damned good company with several of my colleagues such as Senators Georges, McIntosh and Sibraa, all of whom have voiced concern about the matter which has seen the misconduct of senior officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Those officers have repeatedly robbed the taxpayers and, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street), have misled the Parliament, abused parliamentary privilege and told lies to the Senate. My calls for the suspension from duty of those officers and the implementation of a thorough and impartial investigation into the misconduct which has gone on for years have been resisted, avoided and latterly ignored by Mr Street and other Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> I informed the Senate on 2 December that Mr Street had telephoned me that day to seek my co-operation in having the police investigate evidence which had come to light through a concern expressed by a number of honourable senators and questions I had placed on notice. These concerned the former Ambassador in Tehran, Mr Bowden, and the former Ambassador in West Germany, Mr Loveday, plus the head of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Mr Henderson, who, I believe, has been knowingly and willingly involved in covering up these matters right from the start. I informed Mr Street that I would happily co-operate with him and the police. But I also told him that I was most unhappy about false information being put to the Senate by officers high up in his Department. Later that day, Mr Street issued a Press release which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Allegations by Senator Primmer</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Tony Street MP, today announced that he had written to the Minister for Administrative Services, the Hon. Kevin Newman MP, to ask him to have investigated by the Australian Federal Police the allegations made by Senator Primmer in the Senate on 25 November against officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Mr Street said that he and the officers concerned regarded the allegations as most serious ones and were anxious that they should be investigated immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said that almost seven months had passed since he had publicly called for anyone with information about embezzlement or other financial impropriety, to make it available for investigation. Mr Street said he had asked Senator Primmer for his co-operation so that the question of whether there had been any wrongful actions could be disposed of without delay. </PARA>
<PARA>I would ask the Senate to note the reference to 'allegations made by Senator Primmer on 25 November against officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs.' In my speech on 25 November, I referred to, firstly, Mr Bowden's various embezzlements in Tehran and elsewhere; secondly, Mr Henderson's cover-up operations and his disgraceful performance before Senate Estimates Committee D on 10 September; thirdly, an allegation by a local businessman of fraud by Mr Bowden; and, fourthly, the possibility that Mr Loveday, like Mr Bowden, had embezzled government funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, based on Mr Street's telephone call and his subsequent Press release, I expected that Mr Street had realised that the Tehran affair had to be re-opened, as I have urged for some time. However, my hopes fell when I read Mr Street's letter to Mr Newman which, in effect, limited the new investigations to the allegations of the local businessman of fraud by Mr Bowden and matters concerning Mr Loveday. In other words, the unspoken point was that the Tehran affair was over and done with and that both Mr Bowden and Mr Henderson had been cleared by the Department of Finance and the police. That I deny, and I accuse Mr Street of having misled the Parliament, the media and the taxpayer in his Press release. Nevertheless, I felt that I should co-operate with the police to the maximum extent possible in their investigations of the two new matters-the alleged silverware fraud and the alleged holiday trip, at the taxpayers' expense , to Austria by Mr Loveday and his wife, using an official car and a driver. This I have done by telling the police all that I could about the Bowden matter, including the name of the local businessman who made the allegation of fraud, along with all I know about the Loveday matter. I also told the investigating police of the inquiry currently being undertaken by the Ombudsman into allegations of dishonesty by their compatriots who made inquiries earlier into the Tehran affair. I went on to inform the police officers-this gives the lie to Mr Street's bleats about my smearing public servants and failing to substantiate my allegations-that information had recently come to me about a further covered up Bowden episode concerning the shipment of a piano from Tehran to Australia. Further, I informed them that there was information from a very senior source concerning a false invalidity retirement orchestrated by Mr Henderson for a close friend and colleague, Sir Nicholas Parkinson. I have sought full information on these matters by placing questions on notice to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make it clear that the latter matter seems to involve many thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money. I ask: Does this demonstrate that Mr Henderson was prepared to use taxpayers' money to obtain his present position as Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs? Whilst I do not want to impinge on Sir Nicholas's privacy by discussing his health, in my view the matter raises questions and there is an urgent need for an investigation by some authority, not influenced by Mr Henderson or his Department, into this matter. Likewise, with all the matters that I have raised since February of this year, let Mr Street and the Government undertake a full inquiry by a completely impartial body into all the allegations which have been made. I refer to allegations by staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs that both Mr Henderson and Mr R. J. Smith have breached section after section of the Crimes Act; allegations of the misuse of government funds by a handful of senior public servants and the subsequent cover-up of same by permanent departmental heads and Ministers of this Government; allegations of the misuse of security personnel within the Department and the purveying of lies to the Parliament; legal action and threats of same against the media and a parliamentary representative; continual maltreatment of actual and potential witnesses; a despicable rumour campaign against some officers of the Department; and, in the case of Mr Henderson, barefaced lying to a Senate committee. It remains my belief that these men can be contained by vigorous parliamentary action supplemented by the media, the Ombudsman, Public Service unions and those many public servants who are absolutely fed up with dishonest management of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat my call for the suspension of both Mr Henderson and Mr Bowden who, I believe, have been exposed, due largely to parliamentary privilege and honest officers within the Department. It must be realised that Mr Henderson has had a major say in the management of the Department for almost eight years. I guess what he does not know about that Department is not worth knowing. He has, in my view, repeatedly covered up all sorts of misconduct by his senior cronies and it does not seem possible to me that even Mr Street can have faith in him any longer. Mr Henderson has been caught holding the proverbial smoking pistol time and again. To cap it off, I am informed that he provided Mr Bowden with documents to enable him to fool the Commissioner of Taxation that he, Mr Bowden, had overspent his entertainment allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned previously that people have been coming out of the woodwork on this issue. Perchance it is because of the fact that citizens now realise that these matters can be aired in this chamber without fear of writs and that parliamentary privilege is a worthwhile weapon that should be guarded jealously. A few days ago I received information which leads me to fear that yet another of Mr Henderson's friends has been following in Mr Bowden's footsteps. As I understand it, the man concerned has demonstrated a capitalistic acquisitiveness which would surely be frowned upon in the country in which he supposedly represents Australia. To avoid the possibility of this man being hastily cleared by his mates, I do not intend to inform the appropriate investigating authorities unless and until the evidence is effectively marshalled. I hardly need to assure all concerned that the Senate will be following this particular matter closely and doing all that it can to protect witnesses and put the searchlight on anyone inclined to try a cover-up. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to an article in the Melbourne Sun of 22 November relating to the trial of a Mr Cowling who allegedly took the Australian Embassy in Washington for over $670 000. That article states, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> Cowling told a U.S. district court he had committed the elaborate swindle on the embassy after warning his superior in a finance department that the system was so loose 'someone will steal a million dollars from you'. </PARA>
<PARA>It would be interesting to know whether Mr Cowling did tell his superior that and whether he believed it to be a fact. He tried and failed, but I ask: How many have succeeded?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Mulvihill has, I think, cleared the record on a number of matters of deep concern to him. Certainly we enjoyed very much his recounting of stories. Senator Primmer has once again made some very firm and serious assertions about the involvement of officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs in certain activities. He did this on a previous occasion in relation to, I think, the charge-d'affaires in Tehran. That was some two or three months ago. He pointed out in his remarks that there had been a departmental investigation of the matter and nothing had eventuated. He made the point tonight that he was rather upset by or regretted very much the form of that inquiry. It seems to me that the recourse which he has in these circumstances is to bring forth positive evidence which amounts to something more than assertion and which would justify the Government's involvement in any further activity or investigation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the further assertions that Senator Primmer made in the Parliament tonight in relation to certain officers, again I invite him to produce evidence of any kind that will serve to back them up. He rightly drew our attention to the powers of the Parliament in relation to privilege. He is fully entitled to put forward his views in the way that he did tonight. However, I believe that he owes it to all of us who are members of this place to bring forward evidence which can be rightly the subject of a proper inquiry and which can be determined on the value of the evidence itself. We should all regard assertions as being less than positive evidence. All of us should keep our assertions close to ourselves until we are absolutely certain of the way in which we should put them forward in this place. We should have regard to the fact that this place is terribly powerful in the way that its proceedings are reported. We know of the privilege that exists in respect of individual honourable senators. We know that whatever we say in this place can be reported without punishment for those who might report it. In that respect, I believe we have to be very careful in the way that we handle ourselves. Nevertheless, the allegations that have been made are very serious. I would very much like Senator Primmer to bring forward further evidence so that the Government might consider it in the light of his allegations. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>
<PARA>Senate adjourned at 10.52 p.m. </PARA>
