<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 23 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Uphold the principle that the seeds and cuttings of plants are a public resource and a common heritage to all and that accordingly seeds should be freely available to all, freely multipliable, able to be sold, exchanged, exported and imported by anyone who wishes. This is seen as a matter of national food security.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Recognise that plant breeding is a highly co-operative venture often involving private enterprise at the very last stages after basic seed collection , storage, and research has been publicly funded.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. In view of the aforementioned paragraphs, recognise that any system giving ' property' or ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises is inappropriate and unjust.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Recognise that legislation establishing plant patenting schemes overseas has had serious adverse effects namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) a slowing-down of scientific information exchange and exchanges in basic plant breeding materials, that is, germ plasm,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) subordination and/or curtailment of public breeding programmes,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) farmer unrest at seed prices,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) monopoly control of seed production and sales has passed into the hands of giant petrochemical and drug corporations also marketing crop chemicals,</PARA>
<PARA> (v) increased uniformity of crop varieties leading to a vulnerability to pest and disease attack.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Reject any proposal to legislate for any system such as the drafted Plant Variety Rights Act, which gives exclusive ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth, do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Note that legislation establishing plant breeders' rights in other countries has had serious adverse effects, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> a. Virtual monopoly control of seed production has passed into the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> b. The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilisers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> c. The genetic diversity of crops has been eroded, rendering them vulnerable to disease and other environmental threats.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Recognise that maintenance of the genetic diversity of plant varieties is crucial to the continued well-being of the Australian nation, and take all necessary steps to preserve and promote such genetic diversity as a public resource and to prevent exclusive control over plant genetic materials from falling into private hands.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Defend the vital interests of Australian farmers and gardeners, independent Australian seed companies and their employees, and consumers of Australian farm and garden produce, by rejecting any proposal to legislate for the establishment of plant breeders' rights in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 54 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. there is a lack of public information about the content and intention of the proposed legislation on Plant Variety Rights;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. there is concern that the ethical and moral issues of granting private proprietorial rights over genetic resources have not been properly and publicly considered;</PARA>
<PARA> 3. there is evidence to suggest that such legislation may lead to a reduction in the plant diversity;</PARA>
<PARA> 4. there is reason to fear that farmers may be restricted in their activities due to the controls placed on the use and propagation of seed stacks;</PARA>
<PARA> 5. evidence suggests that Plant Varietal Rights legislation will lead to higher costs for the farmer, the consumer, the plant-breeder and the tax payer, and</PARA>
<PARA> 6. evidence suggests that Plant Varietal Rights legislation will lead to a further increase in foreign control of Australian resources.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Parliament ensure:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) that information be made freely available to allow full and informed public discussion of the issues involved.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that the Government undertake to carry out an analysis of the costs and benefits involved to the various sectors of agriculture and the nation as a whole.</PARA>

<PARA> That all members of the Women's services 1939-45 War qualify as 'Australian Soldier' under the Defence Service Homes Act for loans because on voluntarily joining the Australian Forces they took the oath to resist His Majesty's enemies making themselves available for combat duty in War Zones, and according to Acts and Regulations of the period the Military women had enlisted for service anywhere, some Naval women to sail in any waters, with all servicewomen available for service in Papua New Guinea.</PARA>

<TITLE>Family Law Act</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: We the undersigned citizens of Australia, concerned about the high and increasing rate of divorce and family breakdown, convinced that the Family Law Act has weakened marriage by making divorce a trivial matter, the present Act paying scant regard to its own definition of marriage as a life-long union; and believing that the legal bond of marriage should be strengthened, humbly petition for the Family Law Act and the Marriage Act to be amended in order to:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Reject any moves towards divorce by post</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Restore the former prohibition of marriages between close relatives by blood or by marriage</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: Is it true that the position of Australian Ambassador to the United States of America is now vacant and that shortly the position of Australian Ambassador to Japan will become vacant? Does the Government regard it as important that these posts, involving two of our most important political and trading partners, are not un- occupied for any length of time? Will the Minister give an assurance that those appointed will be appointed in accordance with the Prime Minister's election promise that there will be no jobs for the boys and that they will not be Ministers of the present Government? In other words, will the Minister give an assurance that these posts will be treated differently from those of High Commissioner to London, Ambassador to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, Consul-General in New York, Consul-General in Los Angeles and High Commissioner to New Zealand, all of which were filled on a jobs for the boys basis?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand the difficulties that Senator Button has with a reminder of the past. It is true that Sir Nicholas Parkinson has retired from the post of Australian Ambassador to the United States of America. My understanding is that a very distinguished diplomat-David Anderson, who was with the United Nations-is acting in that position at the moment. It is true also that Sir James Plimsoll is to leave Japan in the near future, I think to take up a vice-regal appointment. Both posts are important. I understand that the Government has not made the appointments as yet. The Government will appoint people fully equipped to carry out Australia's representation in both countries in the knowledge that they are important posts. It is extraordinary that when the Whitlam Government was in power it was the strongest proponent of the fact that it was a good thing to appoint Ministers, such as Mr Barnard or, in our case, Sir Victor Garland and, of course, the very distinguished appointment of Sir Robert Cotton to New York. In government the Australian Labor Party saw this very clearly; in Opposition it seeks to sneer. Let me simply say that the record of previous Liberal Ministers serving abroad in diplomatic posts has been of the highest order and, indeed, our appointments to diplomatic posts will remain so.</PARA></TALK.START>

I acknowledge that. It is a problem which the Department has sought to deal with by recruiting additional qualified staff. Notwithstanding that there is a difficulty with respect to unemployment in this country, it has proved not easy to get staff who are qualified for this work. In particular I have been advised by my officers that they have had difficulty in recruiting lawyers, who are an essential part of the process of putting the requisite material into shape to go before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Considerable effort has gone into trying to rectify the difficulties. I will obtain up to date figures for the honourable senator and will also advise him of the up to date staffing position.

I ask whether he is aware of allegations that were made on the Canberra regional news of the Australian Broadcasting Commission last night that, on completion of the new and permanent Parliament House, the Parliament House that we now occupy is to be pulled down so that it will not 'spoil the view', presumably of the new edifice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not hear the report last night but I think I heard such an allegation this morning. Such an allegation is not based on fact. Those honourable senators and honourable members of another place who have served on the Joint Standing Committee on the New and Permanent House will know that an essential feature of the acceptance of the design of the new Parliament House was that it would be integrated into the Parliamentary Triangle and would sit in a vista looking across from the Australian War Memorial to the new Parliament House with this building remaining where it is. As quite a number of honourable senators and honourable members will know, that was fundamental to the acceptance of the design. Everybody stressed that this building, being of an historic nature and of extremely attractive design, should remain. Various suggestions have been made as to its future use, including a convention centre; but no final decision has been made, except that it was implicit in the decision on the site of the new Parliament House that this building should remain where it is.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have become aware lately of new and emerging international evidence. I believe that an article in the Australian newspaper a couple of weeks ago drew attention to some of the latest information. The writer of that article probably drew upon the United Nations report to which Senator Walters has referred. I think all honourable senators would believe that those people interested in the effects of cannabis and other drugs should have access to all available information. I do not know whether it is possible for the Government to ensure the wide distribution of the information from the United Nations international control agency to which Senator Walters referred.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Will the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs explain why the Aboriginal Development Commission has been left with a shortfall of $1.1m? Does he acknowledge that a rapid increase in the administrative responsibilities of the ADC has created unavoidable higher administrative costs?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aboriginal Development Commission has not been under- funded by the Department. The Department has not promised the Aboriginal Development Commission an additional $1.1m. Press reports which have asserted that have been misleading. Expenditure by the Aboriginal Development Commission until the end of February this year shows that the ADC will have overspent its administrative budget, as distinct from its program budget, by the end of the financial year. The Department supported an increase in the Additional Estimates for the ADC's costs of administration. The Aboriginal Development Commission, like all other parts of government, was required to offset as much of this increased cost as it could against its other programs. In fact, it was required to offset this increased cost against increased revenue which it expected to receive during the financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A reassessment of the ADC's financial position since the Additional Estimates were finalised has suggested that a case for some extra funds can be supported. Appropriate steps are now being taken to follow up and to examine the ways in which that increased entitlement might be pursued. I might add that it has taken considerable time and effort to obtain the information on which that assessment might be made.</PARA>

I would have thought, and I have said so in a number of statements that have been issued by me and in a number of answers I have made in the Senate in answer to this question, that it has proved to be an extraordinarily difficult process. For quite a period it looked as though nothing was going to be achieved. Last June when the Prime Minister met President Reagan he raised the matter at that level because it seemed as though it needed raising at that level. There has been a revival of discussions with the United States Justice Department, and I think I have already indicated that I raised the matter with my counterpart, Mr William French Smith. The latest position is that there are to be discussions between officials in Washington in the middle of May next and renewed efforts are to be made to see whether an agreement can be reached. If those discussions are successful or seem to indicate that success is reasonably likely, I would propose to have further discussions with Mr French Smith later in the year, probably June or July.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have repeatedly outlined the significance of the pipeline which is to run from Moomba to Stony Point near Whyalla. As honourable senators would know, the pipeline will have an initial capacity, without pressure, of some 35,000 barrels of liquid a day and, under pressure, of 80,000 barrels a day. Eighty thousand barrels a day is one-fifth of the output of Bass Strait. That is significant in itself. As the fields in the Cooper Basin find oil and move from exploration to development, the pipeline will become more and more significant not only to the development of South Australia and its industries-that is significant enough-but also as an insurance policy for Australia should there be any interruption at all to our oil supplies from abroad or from Bass Strait.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am not precisely aware of the accuracy of the figures quoted. I will draw the attention of my colleague the Minister for Industrial Relations to the substance of Senator Hill's question.

Bearing in mind that the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against women was signed on behalf of the Australian Government in July 1980 but has not yet been ratified and hence is not yet legally binding in Australia, can the Minister say when the Government intends to proceed with ratification of that Convention? If some impediments lie in the way of the ratification, what are they and how solvable are they? Finally, what steps is the Government taking to ensure in the meantime that the spirit of the Convention is operating to the advancement and advantage of women in this country?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by assuring Senator Haines that Australia regards the Convention as a most important international instrument relating to women's rights. We are working towards ratification just as we are working towards a policy of equality of opportunity, freedom from discrimination and equal status for women. Honourable senators may be aware that there was a meeting of Ministers dealing with human rights held in Alice Springs in November 1980. It was agreed that Commonwealth and State governments would work actively towards ratification. The Commonwealth and State officials have been examining the various laws and practices within their jurisdictions in order to ensure consistency between the Commonwealth and the States with the principles and objectives set out in the Convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been subsequent meetings. I understand that the Commonwealth and State Ministers have met since then in April, August and November 1981 and again in February 1982. They had before them papers prepared by officials who were trying to progress this matter. Good progress has been made towards final consideration of ratification. The Minister whom I represent is hopeful that ratification may still be possible in the not very distant future.</PARA>

They have been suitably put in their place by virtually every section of the media and by virtually every authoritative economist in this country. What has emerged is that, whilst there has been some slowing down of growth in Australia primarily due to the fact that there is a continuing recession overseas, the rate of investment in Australia is still very high indeed and the prospects of growth for Australia are still real. It is regrettable that due to recession we cannot, for example, go ahead with certain of our undertakings at this moment. One hopes that they are basically delayed and not finally abandoned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It scarcely seems necessary to respond to the rather gratuitous last part of the question, but I will try to respond to the main question asked by Senator Coleman concerning Aboriginal reserves around towns in Western Australia. I do not have any material on it, but I understand that there has been some continuing study of the appropriate way to provide housing for Aboriginals in Western Australia, particularly around some of the rural towns. It has been a policy to try to provide more housing and to upgrade the standard of housing available to Aboriginals. To this effect there has been a co- operative effort between the Department, the Aboriginal housing associations, the State through its State Housing Commission and housing for Aboriginals and, lately, the Aboriginal Development Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As some of these housing developments have gone on, the need for camping reserves around some of the towns has altered and a number of reviews have been undertaken by the Western Australian Government. We have been kept aware of some of these reviews. I understand that the aim of the Western Australian Government is to try to make action on these reserves consequential upon the provision of housing through other avenues. Its objective is to get housing for Aboriginals which is appropriate to the town and to the population of Aboriginals which is available. I think it is a quite difficult area because I have spoken to a number of Aboriginal people in, for example, the eastern goldfields area who have indicated quite clearly that they do not want to move into conventional housing. Some of them have said that they have tried conventional housing and it does not suit them. For those people there is a need for some special arrangement which might be provided, for example, by an arrangement such as the one being undertaken in Kalgoorlie with the Parkeston development, which is now about to go ahead. So, provided we retain a flexibility of approach and a willingness to respond to a situation as we find it, I see nothing wrong with the Western Australian Department continuing to examine the need for housing and whether in some communities where adequate housing has been provided through alternative means it might give some consideration to closing down a reserve. But I must emphasise that the two sets of processes are interdependent and really consequential.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition again raises the question of the global arms race and the problems associated with nuclear weapons. Again we press the Government to take more steps to improve international affairs and to renounce the tensions that are obviously behind the arms build-up. For the first time in history mankind has the means of its own destruction. When I last spoke on this matter of the nuclear arms race I felt somewhat pessimistic about the opportunities that existed in this area and the chance for ordinary human beings to reverse the trends that existed then. My feelings were shared, I am sure, by my Australian Labor Party colleagues and my Australian Democrat colleagues in this place for at that time, in November, a new round of arms limitation talks was to begin in Geneva. The talks were to take the place of the abandoned and still not ratified SALT II negotiations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yet neither the United States of America nor the Soviet Union seemed prepared at the time to take real arms limitation and reduction seriously. The Soviets had deployed, and were continuing to deploy, triple warhead SS20 missiles aimed at targets in Western Europe and at the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation forces. The United States, buoyed mainly by this, was preparing to enter a new stage of the arms race by installing the Trident, the Cruise and the Pershing II missiles aimed at strategic targets in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. This was on top of the massive army of nuclear weapons each of the forces had stowed away ready for action in the depths of the Ural Mountains, on the salt flats of Utah, spread throughout Europe or beneath the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. To top if off we had the new Reagan Administration in America making aggressive noises and speculating about the possibilities of the so-called limited nuclear war. President Reagan himself made the now famous or, should I say, infamous remark reported by the New York Times:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . that he could see where you have the exchange of tactical (nuclear) weapons against troops in the field without it bringing either one of the major powers to pushing the button. </PARA>
<PARA>However, since that time I believe things have changed a great deal and in a qualitative way. We still have major international tensions, exacerbated currently, for example, in the Falkland Islands area. Of course, the massive nuclear armory has not gone away. But we now have the signs of a mass world-wide reaction, a popular movement, against the arms race. For example, in Western Europe, in the United States and even in parts of Eastern Europe hundreds of thousands of people have come out in the streets to protest against nuclear madness. They were joined on the streets between 4 and 7 April by over 100,000 Australian citizens in our major cities. No matter where people congregated, they expressed their views about the nuclear problems. In Sydney, where I marched, the spirit of the marchers was high and determined, despite the rain and despite the mammoth task of defeating the spread of nuclear weapons. I was proud to be marching with Anglican and Catholic bishops and with other important civic dignitaries. </PARA>
<PARA> These rallies now being held the world over aim to impact the United Nations Second Special Session on Disarmament. The rallies have brought together a huge number of disparate groups-a wide range of people including churchgoers, trade unionists, conservationists, members of ethnic groups and ordinary folk who, after all, make up the backbone of our society. Many of them had never thought before of becoming political or of taking part in a rally. But they feel, as indeed I know the Parliament should feel, the need to make the voice heard and to protest at the insanity and the sheer illogicality of a system that can destroy the world an infinite number of times over. On the occasion of that rally in Hyde Park, Sydney, author Patrick White summed up the feeling of a great number of the marchers when he quoted Mahatma Gandhi. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> If I seem to take part in politics, it is only because politics encircles us today like the coil of a snake from which we cannot get out, no matter how much one tries. I wish therefore to wrestle with the snake . . . </PARA>
<PARA>These comments should be sobering to us as professional politicians. The decisions that those such as we are making about nuclear arms will affect the daily lives and perhaps even threaten the survival of millions and millions who are not really involved in politics as they understand it. When these people become involved, as they are now becoming involved, we professional politicians had better take notice. I believe that that is the purpose of the Australian Labor Party in raising this matter in the Senate today. Julie Flynn, writing in the National Times last week, remarked:</PARA>
<PARA> The anti-nuclear weapons movement has emerged so suddenly on the Australian political landscape that party tacticians on both sides have not yet had the chance to fully assess the consequences. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe she is right. Certainly, I have been a supporter of the peace and disarmament movement in recent years, but still the force of the concern of these recent protests surprised even me. It is now incumbent upon the Parliament and the Government to make its position clear and to act upon it. For the Labor Party's part, its position is clear and unequivocal. We believe that although Australia has no nuclear weapons, no one and no country is unaffected by the resurgent danger of nuclear war. Australia, because of its respected position as a middle power, its close ties with the United States and its vast resources of uranium, the base fuel of nuclear weaponry, is in a position whereby it can intervene in an international sense on the side of peace, disarmament and stability. But the position of the Liberal Party is less clear. We have in the past, for example, had some fine rhetoric from our Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, on this issue. For example, in his speech to the United Nations General Session on Disarmament in 1978 he said that there needed to be progress with the strategic arms limitations talks, that there was an urgent need for creation of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, that measures were needed to prevent horizontal proliferation, that there was an urgent need for setting up regional zones of peace such as the Indian Ocean and that there was a pressing need to study the relationships between disarmament and the needs of the developing countries. They are fine sentiments, and the Labor Party supports such sentiments, but little has been done by the Prime Minister and the Government to support them since 1978. Mr Fraser's most notable contribution to the disarmament debate since then has been to unequivocally support the new United States arms build-up, as he did on his United States trip last year. Mr Fraser, speaking in December 1981, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Let me say at the outset that Australia is pleased indeed that President Reagan has embarked on the process of rebuilding United States defence forces. I take no pleasure or comfort from the criticisms which are sometimes levelled at the United States' policy in this area,--</PARA>
<PARA>Said Mr Fraser-</PARA>
<PARA> For peace can best be pursued from a position of strength. Indeed, it can sometimes only be pursued from a position of strength. </PARA>
<PARA>That quote came from the Canberra Times of 2 December last. In addition, this Government has eagerly sold our uranium without any real safeguards or guarantees as to what will happen to the reprocessed and enriched fuel. What does France do with it? What does the Soviet Union do with it? This is not the way, we submit, to actively promote the cause of peace and disarmament. It is little wonder then that no government members or senators have contributed to the public debate in the last few months on this question of nuclear war. </PARA>
<PARA> There are various ways to analyse the nuclear build-up. Most observers have used one or the other to suit their purposes. The most common analysis is that which seeks a balance of forces and, therefore, encourages mutual deterrence. The problem with this balance of forces analysis is that it can be misused, as I believe it is being misused by the Reagan Administration and by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. They have argued the Trident, Pershing and Cruise programs are necessary to draw even with the Soviet Union-that is the view that they express time and again-given its deployment of the SS20 missiles. They say that not to engage these new weapons would give the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics a tally of 300 missiles to nil in the nuclear scoreboard, as if they were talking about an ordinary little backyard war game. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Street, used exactly this logic in speaking in the House of Representatives last week when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Lionel Bowen, raised matters similar to those which I am raising today. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two important matters which I wish to submit to the Senate concerning this sort of logic or, should I say, illogic. Firstly, most observers question the actual balance with which NATO comes up. For example, General Gert Bastian, the NATO general who resigned from his post in protest at the Western European contribution to the arms race and who visited Australia recently, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Nobody denies that the deployment of SS20 missiles (which according to NATO standards is an overdue measure rather than one implying modernisation of special significance) will add to the disturbing Soviet capacity to pose a nuclear threat. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to stress that NATO forces already have the appropriate systems available to counter the SS20 missiles. He said the new NATO moves 'would create a new and embarrassing situation for the Soviets, to the unilateral advantage of the US'. He is a gentleman who has been employed by his country, West Germany, and is a significant figure in NATO in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I wish to make about this logic is that the USSR uses it too. We recognise this. I am sure honourable senators will recall receiving recently the glossy Soviet publication entitled 'Whence the Threat to Peace', which is full of pictures and diagrams showing the alleged superiority of the American weapons system. These graphs and diagrams are beside the point as we see it. They introduce the basic question of fear that exists between the two super- powers. The very logic of the arms race and the nuclear balance system ignores the fact that at a fraction of the armaments level of these countries we can still destroy civilisation. In cognisance of this fact, the respected Manchester Guardian editorialised along these lines:</PARA>
<PARA> Battle joined-the niceties would cease. With the atmosphere alive with radiation and communications put out of action, with supreme commanders taking split second decisions before they themselves were incinerated, no-one would ask whether the approaching missile was long-range or short-range. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the logic of the arms race which has led President Reagan to ask Congress for an extra $43.7 billion for military spending and which leads him to predict a United States military budget of $333 billion by 1985. It is this logic which leads the Soviet Union to burden its economy with an arms bill that will reach 15 per cent of its gross domestic product by 1985. It is this military logic which delivers profits in the order of $20 billion per year to the arms manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Australia-indeed, the people of the world-are justifiably scared by the prospect looming and they expect something from their political leaders- hence the raising of this matter of public importance today. There are signs in the United States that some political figures are responding to the chorus of popular opinion. Democrat and Republican senators and congressmen-140 of them all told in the United States legislatures-have sponsored resolutions for a United States-Soviet arms freeze. State legislatures in New York, Wisconsin, Kansas, Connecticut, Massachusetts and elsewhere have supported this call. Eminent figures, such as senior military men of the United States, the Soviet Union and England, have thrown their weight behind the campaign of international physicians for the prevention of war. I quote these examples:</PARA>
<PARA> Admiral Gayler, former Commander-in-Chief of US forces in the Pacific, won applause when he said-</PARA>
<PARA>At a conference recently-</PARA>
<PARA>it was nuclear weapons, not the Soviet Union or the United States, that were the enemy. 'We have got to join together and get rid of them,' . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Lord Carver, former Chief of the British Defence Staff, said he opposed the total abolition of nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> But he said: 'It would be criminally irresponsible for anyone to initiate nuclear war in the belief that it would remain limited.'</PARA>
<PARA> General Milstein, faculty head of the Soviet Academy of General Staff, said . . . 'Those who start a nuclear war in the hope of winning would start a holocaust and would perish in it,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA>The former United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union, George Kennan, former Secretary of State Vance and a former Secretary of Defence McNamara have all recently warned publicly of the dangers of nuclear arms proliferation. Our Government will have an opportunity in June next-six weeks away-to take a similar stand for peace. Let us hope that, when Mr Fraser and Mr Street speak to the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament, they do not take a pathetic and weak stance in support of Mr Reagan's militarism and the fear that that brings in the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fraser has already disgraced himself and degraded Australia in this way with his statements in New York last year. It is our hope that Mr Fraser will respond this time to the views that exist in his country, to the sentiments that he expressed when he addressed the last United Nations conference on disarmament and take a stand for peace. Let us use our close and friendly relationships with the United States in a creative way, a way that will influence that Government towards finding a common thread that does exist in all humanity, and a way that will bring together the super-powers to take the turn towards world peace and away from nuclear war. We must recognise that we cannot allow a continuation of the build-up of the global arms race and of the obvious tensions and distrust that exist between nations, particularly the nations that are known as the super -powers. Let us hope that Mr Fraser will speak on behalf of all Australians when he goes to the United Nations this year and that he will use his influence and the influence of the Australian Parliament to bring about a change of direction in the United States and, in the process of taking that step, encourage the forces in the eastern part of the world, which have every reason to fear the possibilities of a nuclear holocaust. This is not asking too much of the Australian Government; this is not asking too much of our Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; This afternoon we are debating a matter of public importance that alleges:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The inadequate leadership provided by the Government for nuclear disarmament.</PARA>
<PARA>I have listened with interest to Senator Gietzelt's contribution and I am basically in agreement with most of the things that he has said. Nobody in Australia would not accept that the intrusion of great nuclear power and capacity in the military world is a great threat to all people everywhere. The enormous problem is to find a proper and responsible basis on which it can be controlled and ultimately eradicated. In other words, how do we get both sides in this sort of circumstance to co-operate? That is the essential prelude to the ultimate solution of the problem. There is no question at all about the problem. There are all sorts of questions as to how we get the co-operation we need to solve it. </PARA>
<PARA> There must be recognition that there will be a reduction on a balanced scale until such time as perhaps, I hope, there will be no nuclear capacity. When I say 'on a balanced scale', I mean there is no ultimate solution of the problem by a unilateral reduction in one field or another, be it the Soviet Union or the United States of America. Indeed there is no evidence in the history of mankind that weakness has been a real contributor-indeed, a contributor at all-to avoiding armed conflict. Therefore, we shall have too look much further than that. We have only to go back to the 1939 circumstance when there was an extreme measure of weakness in the Western world in a military sense and in other senses . Its only contribution to the circumstances of those days was to be the prelude to perhaps the greatest holocaust to this point that man has known. We have to recognise the reality of the need for some form of balance of power in our search for ultimate peace in this field. Senator Gietzelt, in one of his quotations, said-I hope I quote him correctly, I only have a brief note-that nuclear weapons, not the United States or the Soviet Union, were the enemy. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MQ7">Senator SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator quoted somebody and I omitted to note who he was. Of course there is absolutely no question that nuclear weapons, from a literal point of view, are the enemy. However, in reality it is the United States and the Soviet Union that control, develop and research them. Consequently the ultimate responsibility lies with those two powers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The world today, for all sorts of reasons and not the least of which is the contribution of nuclear power, has shrunk to such a measure that we no longer look at borders and frontiers as being within vision. We are talking literally of hemispheres. We are hemispheres apart and yet significantly within range of each other. That only emphasises the need to come to a useful and proper solution to the problems that confront us. I suggest, briefly, that the Government has done a significant amount in ensuring a real consciousness, not only at home but also in our region and around the world, of the dangers and tragedies that are relevant to the development of nuclear weaponry. However, it appears extremely difficult to get into close contact with the Soviet Union. After all, on the best information that is available to me, the Soviet Union would appear to be the greatest nuclear power in the world today. If there are people in this country or outside it who have a closer understanding and even support for the socio-economic circumstances that are promoted by the Soviet Union within its boundaries and beyond, they have a massive responsibility to talk to the Soviet Union and to try to involve its citizens in the abhorrence of nuclear weaponry that we in the Western world must naturally have. </PARA>
<PARA> Reference was made at Question Time to the USS Truxtun which is a nuclear powered American warship, its proposed visit to Brisbane and the objections in some quarters to that sort of ship coming to an Australian port. Surely there has to be, as I said earlier, a measure of balance in the nuclear capacities of the major entities in the world if there is to be any hope of a reasonable and responsible solution. There has never been-I fear there never will be-a successful response from a side developing a significant weakness. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has a well-established policy on nuclear disarmament. In fact, it has a well-established and a well-promoted policy on nuclear control in every field. It is significant and proper that Australia should have such policies as Australia is one of the world's greatest potential producers of uranium and, consequently, one of the greatest potential contributors to nuclear power in general. There is little doubt that in the longer term-it may well be a significant number of years-nuclear power in the commercial and economic field will have a very significant contribution to make to the development of many countries around the world and, in particular, to the developing countries. Consequently, it is important that we have a strong attitude to the control of nuclear power in all its areas and in all its characteristics. It is ridiculous and absurd to suggest that this country of all countries which, though not a nuclear power itself but which is so clearly involved with the basic materials that enable the generation of nuclear power, has no responsibility and no policies that are referable to the control of a source of energy and power which , in the wrong hands and with the wrong objectives, can be so incredibly damaging to most people around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The ultimate goal of this Government-indeed, of the Australian people-is general and complete disarmament. That has been the goal of peoples around the world for many years. It is a goal that, regrettably, seems to be still some distance away. I believe-the Australian Government believes-the first step is to establish a real measure of control and then, finally, the demolition of military nuclear power. With that in view, the Government has sought, in every field possible, to establish balance and surveillance. It has sought balance in that whilst we approach the need to disarm from a point of view of nuclear armament, we will have, in that circumstance, a balance of power which will enable a certain recognition of reality and which will enable us to move through a proper measure of surveillance to a situation where, first, there will be a halting in the development of the nuclear military capacity and then, a downgrading of that capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt mentioned, and I emphasise the fact, that in June and July this year, senior Government people such as the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) and, in all probability, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) will actively participate, as Australia always has done in matters of nuclear power control, in the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament. It is to be called together for the first time in four years since it last met in 1978. This session will be a total and comprehensive review of the problems that relate to nuclear armament around the world. There is no shadow of doubt that the Australian Government's presence there will be recognised by the strength with which it pushes the circumstances it will be promoting and the circumstances it has promoted over the years that are directed towards the control and ultimate demolition of nuclear military capacity. The Government has involved many non- government organisations. It has taken cognisance, naturally, of expressions of opinions in the Press, in the streets and all through the community in finally reaching a proposition to be put to this important discussion at a top level. This Government has tabled, amongst other things, every nuclear safeguard agreement that has come within its ken. Not only have they been tabled but also they have been debated. They are of extreme importance. The Government certainly would want it no other way than that they should be discussed in detail. That has been the consistent policy of the Government over the years that it has spent in office. </PARA>
<PARA> This type of matter has been discussed, as indeed, it should be, on frequent occasions. This could be the third or fourth time in six or seven months that it has been discussed in the Parliament. The Senate discussed, at some considerable length, only a month or six weeks ago, the question of the nuclear enrichment industry in this country. In the course of that discussion a whole range of controls were discussed and emphasised. Those controls, in the commercial field, are promoted with even greater emphasis in the field of military nuclear capacities. The curbing of nuclear weapons is a prime plank of Australia's disarmament policy. I imagine that in the view of all Australians it is a significant plank. As I said when I first rose to speak, there is no disagreement on the need to control and, finally, to dismantle nuclear military capacity. But there is a need to establish the best means of co-operation between the major nuclear powers. Of course, Australia is not a nuclear power, but certainly, it has a very clear recognition of the problems, the dangers and the disasters that relate to uncontrolled nuclear military power and, indeed, ultimately to any form of nuclear military power. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia supports, very strongly indeed, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, as a first step. It has been a supporter and a member of that organisation since its foundation. Membership of that Treaty, with all the requirements, guidelines and observations that are involved, is an absolutely essential pre-requisite to any form of Australian trade, let alone any concern with military nuclear circumstances. The nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty includes a full scope of the safeguards administered by the most effective body in the world today for this sort of thing, the International Atomic Energy Agency, over all nuclear installations in non-nuclear weapon states. I recall Australia's involvement with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as being one more piece of evidence of Australia's concern to control the enormous threat of nuclear power around the world. Australia, through its Government and I believe through the thoughts and deliberations of its people, seeks the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty as a very significant contribution to the final restraint on nuclear disarmament. The comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty would help the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty very significantly. As a part of Government policy, we have opposed consistently the nuclear testing that has taken place from time to time by the French in parts of the South Pacific. This Government has consistently protested and opposed that sort of thing and seeks to destroy all possible chance of nuclear testing both in the atmosphere and without the atmosphere. Unfortunately, the French Government seeks to ignore, at this stage anyhow, the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. Consequently, we can make our protests known and we can make them forcefully, but to this point they seem to carry very little weight beyond that position. When we talk of Australian Government initiatives, it should be remembered that we co-sponsored the United Nations General Assembly motion in 1980 to establish a team to examine in-depth the problems relating to chemical warfare, those problems are almost as great and abhorrent-indeed, they are as great and abhorrent-as the threat of nuclear power to the countries of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally those countries which have nuclear arsenals should reduce them. They must end nuclear testing in all environments and the Non-Proliferation Treaty must be strengthened and must grow. These are the basic projections of the Australian Government in this most important field. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is most timely that the Senate should be debating this issue because in the middle of this year, which is in only a few weeks time, we will see the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament take place in New York. My colleague Mr Lionel Bowen said last week in the House of Representatives, when discussing this very same issue:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is always left to the Opposition to raise in this Parliament any matter relating to disarmanent. </PARA>
<PARA>The disarmament movement has been sweeping rapidly throughout the world in the last few months. In Australia huge marches and demonstrations have taken place. Western Europe has witnessed gatherings the size of which has never been seen in that continent before. In Eastern Europe there is growing concern over the arms explosion with churches and other organisations strongly supporting the disarmament movement. In fact, it has caused some embarrassment to the leaders of East Germany. The church, not the government, has been at the forefront of these recent moves. </PARA>
<PARA> In Washington a freeze proposal sponsored by Senators Kennedy and Mark Hatfield won the support of 24 senators and 166 House of Representatives members. Senators Henry Jackson and John Warner have a proposal to build up United States nuclear forces as a prelude to negotiating balance reductions. It is important to look at the remarks made recently by Senator Jackson who is always considered to be a hawk on this issue. He said that President Reagan and the current Republican Administration in the United States of America have totally misjudged the mood of the American people in regard to nuclear disarmament. In March this year, 139 members of the United States Congress introduced a resolution in both Houses calling for a freeze in the level of stockpiles kept by the super-powers and urging them to pursue a complete halt to the nuclear weapons race. The question has to be asked: Why are so many people desperate to see the end of the arms race? For example, why would 40,000 people stand in the rain in Sydney a few Sundays ago to demonstrate for nuclear disarmament? I think the reason is that the present situation is frightening and the more the facts are publicised the more urgent the campaign will become. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote some statistics which I consider are quite frightening when one looks at the situation of nuclear disarmament today. The total explosive power in the nuclear arsenals of the two super-powers is equivalent to about 16,000 million tonnes of TNT or about 1,250,000 Hiroshima bombs. The world's combined weapons of mass destruction are enough to kill every man, woman and child ten times over. On average, each of the major cities in the northern hemisphere is targetted by the equivalent of 2,000 Hiroshima bombs. Any honourable senator who has been to Hiroshima and seen the damage or anybody who has seen films or photos of what was done with one bomb would be staggered by those statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> The Trident submarines now being built by the United States are designed to carry a total of 192 warheads each with an explosive power equivalent to eight Hiroshima bombs; that is, each submarine will carry 192 bombs which, when multiplied by eight, gives a total of 1,536 Hiroshima bombs for each submarine. The Soviet Union is building similar machines of destruction, such as the Typhoon class submarines. These statistics surely must prove that nuclear war is unwinnable. Total world military expenditure is $US450,000m, whereas the annual spending on official development aid is $US20,000m and the cost of the World Health Organisation program to eradicate malaria is only $US450m. </PARA>
<PARA> When the President of the United States of America, Ronald Reagan, last year stated that the United States had accepted the concept of a limited, winnable nuclear war in Europe, the West Germans immediately demanded a full explanation and a rebuttal of that statement. I believe it was that statement that sent shock waves through Europe and precipitated the massive nuclear disarmament protest that we are seeing in Western Europe today. Unfortunately I believe that people are being slowly conditioned into believing that a limited and winnable nuclear war is a possibility. Once that concept is accepted, I foresee this as being just another step towards making nuclear war probable. On 21 October 1981, Senator Frank Church, who is the former chairman of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated in Canberra:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no such thing as limited nuclear war. Any nuclear exchange would quickly escalate out of control. Any talk of limited nuclear war is unreal. </PARA>
<PARA>I completely agree with him. In a report published about the middle of last year our Office of National Assessments said that currently the world faces a 50 per cent chance of a nuclear conflict occurring. Some people will say that Australia is a long way from Europe and a long way from the scene of any possible nuclear war. I believe that since there can be no limited nuclear war, and there can be no winnable nuclear war as Senator Church said, Australia is as much involved as the Europeans. It takes only one miscalculation to bring about an all out nuclear war. It is also very important that we remember that 80 per cent of the world military expenditure at the moment is used in the conventional arms race. Conventional weapons have been used in all of the more than 100 armed conflicts since World War II, often with shocking effects on the civilian population. Arms technology has produced conventional weapons systems of unprecedented destructive power. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year I visited the Lebanon. What we have there, by sheer weight and number of conventional arms, has turned that country into a nightmare. We have the Palestinians and the Syrian and Iraqi factions all controlling their own check-points and sections of the city of Beirut. At present they are all engaged in conflict amongst themselves. The Amal-Shia group, the Sunni Moslem Brotherhood and the Druze community in the Lebanon are all fighting the Palestine Liberation Organisation and sections of the Syrian Army, and occasionally all fighting amongst themselves. There is the Lebanese Resistance Movement, which is a Christian resistance movement. It has really turned its section of the country into a separate state. It now controls 15 per cent of the area of Lebanon and has about 50 per cent of the population in that area. Major Haadad has separate forces on the border of Israel. He has a so-called Christian militia. In fact, the enlisted men in his force are 70 per cent Shia Moslems. In the middle of this there is a Lebanese army that is completely powerless because in the country at the moment there are over 200 armed groups, all of them with sophisticated weapons, with missiles, with mines and with rocket launchers. The impression that I had when I was there was that every man over the age of 15 seemed to be carrying a Kalashnikov rifle or a machine-gun. This is a world gone mad. Also, in the Middle East, there is the current conflict between Iran and Iraq. The war continues with an horrific loss of life because the Soviet Union, the United States, Israel, the Arab world, the Europeans and even private arms dealers are continuing to supply weapons to both sides. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned these two instances because if there is a war in the Gulf like the conflict between Iran and Iraq or if there is a war in the Middle East triggered off by fighting in Lebanon this is of great strategic importance to the rest of the world. Such a war can involve the super-powers. It can escalate into a nuclear conflict purely because of the weight and the numbers of conventional arms that are in the region. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Here in Australia we have to agree to give the prevention of nuclear war and universal nuclear disarmament the highest priorities on the agendas of foreign and security policies. Let us recognise:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Disarmament is a matter for political leadership, for political will and determination and common commitment and dedication. </PARA>
<PARA>These words, with which I agree completely, were spoken by the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) at the special session of the UN General Assembly on Disarmament in 1978. It was a most promising speech but there has been no follow up by this Government. It is now quite clear that, despite those fine words four years ago, the Government has no clear or coherent policy on disarmament and arms control. We are a middle power but nonetheless we are influential enough and intelligent enough to have such a policy and to advocate it vigorously. At the 1978 UN special session on disarmament this Government listed key issues for the international disarmament agenda which included: Firstly, the need for greater progress in the American strategic arms limitations talks negotiations; secondly, creation of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty; thirdly, methods to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to nations which do not have them; fourthly, the need to study the relationship between disarmament and the development needs of the poorer countries; and fifthly, creation of regional arms control arrangements, such as an Indian Ocean zone of peace. </PARA>
<PARA> We can compare these aims with what has been achieved since 1978. Firstly, Washington has failed to ratify SALT II and has virtually abandoned the progress that was made under the Carter Administration. Secondly, there has been no progress towards a comprehensive test ban treaty. Thirdly, far from preventing the spread of nuclear weapons among nations which do not already have them, current policies are encouraging such proliferation. Such developments as the introduction of B52 strategic bombers to Australian territory and, in the near future, to the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia are simply the latest examples of this policy. Fourthly, the need to study the relationship between disarmament and the development of the poorer countries is being neglected. Fifthly-I refer to the creation of regional arms control arrangements such as the Indian Ocean zone of peace; here at least there is some encouragement-there has been a recent American offer to make a formal proposal soon for a nuclear free zone in the Middle East. The Australian Labor Party has publicly welcomed that initiative as it is firmly committed to the establishment of nuclear free zones as one way towards preventing nuclear war and achieving nuclear disarmament. Yet, to the best of my knowledge, this important United States proposal drew no public support from the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I propose that Australia seek official or unofficial membership of the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues which is headed by Olaf Palme, the former Prime Minister of Sweden. Its membership includes many distinguished persons from the East and the West and the Third World. We ought to be a member of that commission. It is working to support and publicise the UN Special Session on Disarmament. I believe that the Australian Government has no clear or comprehensive policy on disarmament. Moreover, this Government does not take every opportunity to advocate disarmament or actively encourage public participation in the disarmament movement. It was a great shame that last year's Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne failed to take advantage of the impressive gathering of world leaders to make a strong statement on disarmament. I hope that as a result of this matter of public importance proposed by the Opposition today the Government will show the leadership that is needed on this vital issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate this afternoon is debating a matter of public importance from Senator Gietzelt which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The inadequate leadership provided by the Government for nuclear disarmament. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposition is absolutely untrue. If the proposal read that the Opposition complimented the Government on the leadership it has provided towards nuclear disarmament it would be another matter with which we could agree with the Opposition. But there is no case at all to make that the Government has not given the most effective leadership it can on this most difficult of questions. As Senator Scott said there is universal acceptance of the goal that we have to reduce nuclear disarmaments as much as possible. That implies having some degree of control over the nuclear armament business and moving on from there at a later stage to general disarmament. The Government supports those goals unequivocally. </PARA>
<PARA> The point of difference between the Government and the Opposition is in the fact that the Government understands the very great complexities of the issues that are involved in this move; the Opposition simply does not appreciate what is involved here. It has a simplistic view on this matter. I say this with no disrespect. It is a view that members of the Opposition have on most of the complex issues that face Australia today. As an example of the complexities involved in this matter I quote a few words from a speech by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to a special session of the United Nations General Assembly in June 1978 which illustrates very well the complexities of what is involved. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> One fact is certain-the forces militating against arms control are powerful. We cannot hope to begin to dismantle the world's military apparatus unless we address our minds to the causes which nourish and sustain it: the motion that increased military spending inevitably provides greater national security regardless of the objective facts, the narrow self-interest and ambition which nations can pursue-reckless of the tension and conflict which this may generate; the quest for national status which still motivates the actions of many states; attempts to exploit the weaknesses of smaller states; the attempt to expand a nation's influence over other states, under the cloak of ideology-regardless of damaging competition with other powers which results. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister listed just a few of the many factors involved in the nuclear armament business, a few of the reasons why nations seek nuclear arms for their own protection. The difficulties here are quite enormous. They are fully appreciated by this Government as nations have tried for years and years to make progress down this path to goals which we all support. The Government has supported every international forum and, more importantly, the Government is an active member of every international forum, notably, of course, the Committee on Disarmament which is a negotiating body, not a talking body, with 40 members on it. Any discussions on disarmament, nuclear disarmament in particular, has to recognise that it is an international matter; it is not a provincial matter. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the bodies of which the Government has been a supporter and a member is the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament. On 5 June 1978 the Prime Minister addressed the General Assembly. I quoted from his speech earlier. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Street, will lead the Australian delegation in June and July of this year to the second United Nations conference where again, as forcefully as it can, the Australian delegation will put forward the Governments position that nuclear disarmament should proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is a signatory to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the basic treaty concerning and controlling the spread of nuclear materials in this world. I say in passing that our credentials in that Treaty are second to none. Other signatories to that Treaty have sold nuclear materials-uranium-to countries such as Argentina. Australia scrupulously observes both the spirit and the intent of that Treaty and will continue to do so. Finally, I mention the comprehensive test ban, which has our unambiguous support, as witnessed by the Opposition we have expressed to the French testing in the Pacific. Those are facts. They are not suppositions. They are not hypothetical cases. The support for the Committee on Disarmament, the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament in 1978, the coming United Nations Special Session on Disarmament, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the comprehensive test ban all bear witness to our sincerity and our determination to prosecute this aim. </PARA>
<PARA> I listened with interest to Senator Gietzelt and Senator Sibraa. Senator Gietzelt, as usual, was more sympathetic to the Russian point of view than he was to the American point of view. I was rather interested to hear him claim that the introduction of SS20 missiles by the Russians was really to catch up with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation position. I think that is a military appreciation which will find no support whatsoever in any Western military circles. Senator Sibraa gave us a most interesting talk about Lebanon and Kalashnikov rifles, but for about 12 minutes of his talk he failed to address the title to which he was speaking. The general drift of the Opposition's argument is that the Government has done nothing. The treaties I have listed and the committees of which we are an active member give the lie to that allegation. I noticed that in the other place the Australian Labor Party is keen to say that we only sell uranium for cash where we can get it. Again, that is not true because we sell only to countries that are signatories to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> In dealing with this most complex problem we have to realise Australia's position. We are not the prime and leading actors on the world stage. Australia is a very small country militarily. We do not have much international clout in the military field. If we were either the United States of America or the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics our position would be quite different, but we are not. We are only one voice among many in the community of nations. Secondly, we are not a nuclear power. Furthermore, as a signatory to the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty, we cannot be. The only resources Australia has in the international forum are the resources of the power of reason. To be effective in reasoning we must take into account the realities of the world situation as it is today. We have to start with the world as it is. We cannot start with a hypothetical ideal world. </PARA>
<PARA> We support the concept of disarmament-not just nuclear disarmament. But we can only support that concept provided it is universal because we know that if it is not universal we cannot have the support which we need of the other nations to bring it about. We are faced with this dreadful dilemma when we come to the subject of disarmament because disarmament simply cannot work without trust between nations. Yet, tragically, if that trust had existed in the first place there would have been no need at all for nations to arm themselves against their neighbours. So we start with a position where there is no trust-or very limited trust-in this world. We have to build that trust as the first step down our path towards any effective nuclear disarmament program. </PARA>
<PARA> While on the subject of mistrust, one must look at the actions taken by the USSR and the momentum which it has attained in the last 10 years and with which it is still proceeding in arms acquisitions. For the last decade the USSR has grossly overspent on its defence requirements. Defence spending is estimated to be at least 13 per cent of its gross domestic product. Russia has a huge arsenal of SS17, SS18 and SS19 intercontinental ballistic missiles. It has the Backfire bomber and the Typhoon submarines, as Senator Sibraa mentioned, are coming on- stream. Above all, Russia has the SS20 missiles, which have a range of 4,000 kilometres and can hazard and bring under attack the whole of Western Europe-the whole of the NATO mass. </PARA>
<PARA> What has Russia done? It has proceeded to arm itself to the teeth. At present it enjoys conventional arms superiority in the NATO theatre, yet it has gone on accelerating its theatre advantage with respect to both nuclear and conventional weapons. it has made no effective recognition of the protest movement towards disarmament in Western Europe. All it has said it will do is pull out its SS20 missiles west of the Urals. That is no concession at all because the range of those weapons is such that from east of the Urals they can bring the whole of the NATO countries under attack. So any unilateral move by Western nuclear powers would be absolutely untenable. Acceptance of any of the propositions that a freeze be introduced at present would merely perpetuate the ascendancy in nuclear weapons that the USSR has gained over the last 10 years. If we introduced a freeze at the point where the USSR has this ascendancy we would only build instability into the relationships between the super-powers. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point, after developing trust, is to get parity between the nuclear powers as a pre-requisite for some agreed disarmament. That is an enormously difficult proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The major problem is that since the Second World War peace has been achieved by the existence of nuclear deterrent. Because we have a nuclear deterrent the super-powers have always built and accelerated their capacity in this direction. It has had a positive side because we have had peace in Europe for 37 years, despite periods of intense political tensions. That does not mean, of course, that peace can be achieved only by nuclear deterrents. But the reality is that the nuclear deterrent doctrine is the instrument of peace at present and it will take some time, some care, and a great deal of patience to move away from that doctrine and have it accepted by other nations that there are other ways of determining peace. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to move to another area that is very important to Australia and it is an area where Australia's lesser powers can have some influence. I refer to the spread or the horizontal proliferation of nuclear arms to the second line or Third World countries. The Non-Proliferation Treaty has been fully supported by Australia and the dangers posed by the spread of nuclear weapons-a horizontal proliferation-are, in many ways greater threats to the world than those coming from a conflict between the two super-powers. Just as a matter of conjecture we could say that Israel, India, Pakistan, Libya, South Africa and possibly, the Argentine, could all have nuclear weapons at present. This is a very dangerous situation because these types of countries lack sophistication in their intelligence gathering capacities, they lack control, both politically and militarily, of the forces in the country and, very frequently, their contiguous countries have been rivals or enemies for centuries. Added to this local rivalry we often have the fact that they are centres of great power struggles, such as in the Middle East. It is possible that a conflict between two neighbouring states could involve the major powers with catastrophic influences for all of us . Australia, with its clear support of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its influence in international forums has played a very effective part in trying to control this lateral spread of nuclear arms. Australia's position is one of the support for the ultimate goal of general and complete disarmament and a negotiation of balanced and verifiable means of arms control. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The 196th Report on the Curatorial and Conservation Functions of the Australian War Memorial breaks new ground for the Committee. Rarely has such a topic been considered by this or any other committee of the Parliament. Curatorial and conservation functions relate to the capacity of the Australian War Memorial to exhibit, maintain, catalogue and restore its collection. In his report to Parliament of 30 March 1981, the Auditor-General highlighted the parlous state of the collection of the Memorial and the administrative difficulties that were contributing to it. The Committee's inquiry has fully substantiated his report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In historical terms, the worth of the collection to this nation is immeasurable . In monetary terms, it has been valued at over $100m. Because of past neglect, parts of the collection are at risk. Already many assets have been lost, including 17 vintage aeroplanes now worth over $100,000 each. The Memorial estimates that it will take at least 400 working years of conservation to restore the existing collection fully. The problem however does not end at the War Memorial. The Committee found that other institutions within the National Collection, such as the National Library of Australia and the Australian Archives, also face heavy conservation backlogs. A similar situation will arise in the case of the Museum of Australia unless early action is taken to re-house and store its existing collection in an appropriate manner. These backlogs have arisen for a number of reasons. Firstly, there has been a lack of awareness by those who have been responsible for the conservation and maintenance of the collection in the past. This 'unwitting neglect', as it has been described, has been an outcome of complacency engendered by the fact that the Memorial attracts a high proportion of those who visit Canberra. This high attendance has apparently been interpreted as an indication that further upgrading of the display or condition of the collection was unnecessary. Secondly, the need to conserve all collections has only recently been realised by most museums and government institutions. Consequently, there is an insufficient number of suitably trained personnel on whom to draw and inadequate funds to employ those experts who are available. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Committee believes that there has been an inequitable sharing of resources amongst institutions responsible for the National Collection; for example. The Australian National Gallery, in contrast to the War Memorial, is well endowed. Since the completion of the inquiry, the Public Service Board has advised the Committee that some action in line with our recommendations regarding staff ceilings and salaries at the War Memorial has already been implemented. We hope that this trend will continue. The Committee's recommendations are numerous. In essence they involve the following proposals: A greater role for the Department of Home Affairs and Environment in co-ordinating resources within the institutions responsible for the National Collection; personnel career planning for curators and conservators within government employment which would involve revision of the salary structure and classifications; staff ceilings for the Australian War Memorial to be at least on a par with the Australian National Gallery; and introduction or extension of corporate planning techniques, disaster planning procedures, internal auditing, conservation data bases and automatic data processes inventory control systems within all institutions housing the National Collection, especially the Australian War Memorial. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee wishes to make the public and the Government aware that conservation is not the problem only of the institutions. Preventive conservation methods such as the use of long-life inks, typewriter ribbons, paper, et cetera-must be encouraged if further compounding of the conservation crisis is to be prevented. With the exception of the segment housed in the National Gallery, a conservation crisis does exist within the national collection. This is exemplified by the poor and threatened condition of the Australian War Memorial collection. We acknowledge that only a certain amount of the resources of the national purse can be allocated to solving the problem. It is a problem that must be tackled now and we call for a review of the allocation of these resources and improved management approaches within the institutions in an attempt to overhaul these serious conservation backlogs. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the user pays principle the question of admission charges was canvassed. However, while the Committee makes no firm recommendation on this issue we are concerned that if the Memorial does not fully utilise its revenue raising potential its current position as the poor relation within the National Collection may be exacerbated. The need for a high standard of conservation for the National Collection is essential. The threat to these unique repositories of Australian history and traditions demands the attention of Parliament. We appear to be witnessing the unmaking of Australian history. That, my Committee believes , will concern all members of the Parliament as well as the citizens whom we represent. I commend the report to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA>CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION AMENDMENT BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, in his ministerial statement on 'Wage Determination and Industrial Relations' on 16 February the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) informed Parliament that he intended to introduce a number of legislative initiatives. I now present a Bill to the Senate about matters then foreshadowed. The Bill contains a number of elements but its philosophy can be distilled to three main themes:</PARA>
<PARA> protection of the rights of the individual;</PARA>
<PARA> to provide a better balance in the powers, rights and duties of employers and empoyees; and</PARA>
<PARA> to open the door to movement from within the work-force so that present union rigidities and monopolies are loosened and structures created which are more suited to a modern economy and representative negotiations between employers and employees. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me develop these themes and outline to the Senate how the Bill will give effect to the Goverment's aims. </PARA>
<PARA> Fundamental to the Government's approach is its belief that the expression and pursuit of democratic freedoms, including the rights of association and the withholding of labour, and the operation of free institutions, such as trade unions, cannot survive in the absence of law. Our industrial relations system assists in setting a base from which behaviour patterns can develop which are acceptable to the majority and which in turn foster a strong, progressive nation . </PARA>
<PARA> The notion that for some reason unions are so different that they and the conduct of their members should stand beyond the law is untenable and at the root of much of the industrial trouble Australia has experienced in recent years . </PARA>
<PARA> There are constitutional limits on the Commonwealth's industrial relations powers although there may be more room to make new laws than we have given the Constitution credit for in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> In the life of this Government we have already acted within our legislative power to protect the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> We have legislated to ensure that rank and file union members have a greater say in union affairs and, to this end, are provided with full information on their union's financial affairs. We have strengthened the provisions for secret ballots. We have provided a method of seeking rapid deregistration where a union threatens the safety, health or welfare of the public. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also strengthened our own hand in dealing with unreasonable industrial action by employees of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is, by this Bill, proposing legislation in support of the principle of voluntary unionism and the restructuring of unions away from a craft and occupational basis. We are also legislating to give employers the automatic right to stand down employees who cannot be usefully employed as a result of industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA> These proposals reflect so far as is reasonable the points raised by the ACTU and employer representatives at two meetings of the National Labour Consultative Council. </PARA>
<PARA>Voluntary Unionism</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Legislation for voluntary unionism is a firm policy of the Government parties. In our liberal democratic society, individuals should have the right to decide whether or not they want to join a union. If they do not they should be protected by the law. This Bill will give them that protection. If they do so, they are encouraged to play a responsible and active part in their union's affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, nobody should be under any pressure to join a trade union. There should be a completely free choice of whether to join or not to join a union. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a central feature of the Bill now before the Senate. It introduces to the principal Act this right of choice. It removes from the jurisdiction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission the power to grant preference to unionists and it provides avenues of redress against both employers and unions in the event of victimisation of individuals who do not want to join a union. </PARA>
<PARA> The objects of the Act will be amended to positively declare the principle of voluntary unionism. </PARA>
<PARA> By the Bill, an employer or a union will be prohibited from disadvantaging, to use a general description, an employee or prospective employee not wishing to belong to a union. </PARA>
<PARA> A person will be able to defend their freedom of choice by a right to seek compensation in the Federal Court for loss or damage suffered as a result of action taken to force them to join a union. </PARA>
<PARA> We are providing that, where an employer is the subject of compensation proceedings and considers that a union's conduct has induced the employer to take the action for which he is being proceeded against, the union may be joined as a party to those proceedings. It would then be open to the Court to give judgment against the union instead of the employer or partly against the union and partly against the employer. It may be of interest to honourable senators to note that this is consistent with provisions passed recently in the United Kingdom Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Stand-downs</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the provisions in the Bill relating to stand-downs. </PARA>
<PARA> Increasingly, strikes and bans from plant to plant or industrial action by small key groups of workers have been used to put intense economic pressure on a single employer, a whole industry or the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA> In circumstances of this character, an employer simply has no work for his employees. The employer's capacity to resist a strike or other industrial action is reduced to nothing, because the wages bill goes on running. Protection is needed in that situation and the Government intends to provide it. </PARA>
<PARA> If unions are to have, as a basic principle, the 'right to strike' then it is surely not unreasonable for employers to have at their individual disposal, the right to protect their commercial interests in circumstances where they are put at risk by union action. </PARA>
<PARA> Strikes, and other forms of industrial action, do not simply affect the businesses of those directly subject to that action. They effect also other businesses and other employees dependent upon the goods and services of the business being disrupted. As the community has come to appreciate to its cost and often to its despair, the industrial action in one place ripples widely throughout society. </PARA>
<PARA> The law has long recognised, by awards of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, that workers who are not on strike but who cannot be usefully employed because of action elsewhere, may be stood-down without pay. </PARA>
<PARA> But the processes to be followed are, in many instances, cumbersome and involve delays and the terms of the stand-down award may not in the end be commensurate with the industrial pressure being exerted leaving the employer lamenting that the law and the circumstances leave him defenceless. </PARA>
<PARA> Using a blend of constitutional powers, the Bill extends to employers the direct right-and I emphasise that-to stand-down employees who cannot be usefully employed because of industrial action. The decision to stand-down will be the decision of the employer according to the circumstances with which he is faced. </PARA>
<PARA> There may be circumstances in which employers would wish to use the processes available presently through the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Bill gives employers the choice between doing that or using the new provisions. However, the Commission will not be able to limit the rights of employers under these new provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>Industry Unions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the proposals relating to industry unions. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a widely held community view that the craft system of union organisation is increasingly creating difficulties for the sensible operation of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> Craft and conglomerate unionism has resulted in a situation where most industries and many enterprises face a multiplicity of unions. Union amalgamation of itself is not sufficient to improve this situation substantially . </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the past discussion about amalgamation of unions failed to distinguish between the objective of allowing the creation of industry unions and amalgamations which create bigger conglomerate craft unions, the membership of which straddles a number of industries. Encouragement of the development of unions along these lines will not, in the Government's view, assist in reducing the level of industrial disputes to any significant degree. The record of the AMWSU is testimony to that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's long-standing objective, expressed in our Industrial Relations Platform, is the encouragement of industry based unions. It is also the objective of the Labor Party and the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation faces up to the need for change by providing a legislative framework which will facilitate the restructuring of unions into fewer industry- based organizations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is well aware that the development of industry based unions will not be an easy process or one that will take place overnight. However, a start has to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the trade union movement itself, and amongst employers there is evidence of interest in some industries that unions should be industry based. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill defines an industry for the purpose of registration of an industry union as the business, trade, manufacture, undertaking or calling of employers. It is proposed to leave to regulations the prescription of the classes of industry for which a union can be formed to enable discussions to be held with the ACTU and employers as the process of change is initiated. In this way the development of industry unions can occur in consultation with unions and employers directly involved and the peak employer and union bodies.</PARA>
<PARA> To obtain registration an association of employees will need to satisfy the Registrar that the members are employed in a single industry and that they constitute a substantial majority of the total number of persons employed in that industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for regulations to be made to allow for a secret ballot to be held of employees in an industry to test whether a substantial majority wish to form or join an association seeking registration as an industry union. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is also making provision for an existing union to become an industry union by the process of changing its rules to enable the absorption of employees who would not otherwise be eligible to become members. However, an existing organization, seeking to establish itself on an industry basis, will have to satisfy the Industrial Registrar that the rule changes are authentic and have been democratically endorsed within the organization. </PARA>
<PARA> Where an amalgamation of unions would result in the formation of an industry union, special conditions will apply to facilitate that amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA> The present requirement that in a ballot to approve an amalgamation at least one half of the persons on the roll of voters must vote and, of those voting formally, more than one half must vote in favour of the amalgamation, will be relaxed. Where an amalgamation would result in the formation of an industry union (and only that in that case), not less than one quarter of the persons on the roll of voters will need to vote, and of those voting formally more than one half must vote in favour of the amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA> This particular provision is drawn from earlier recommendations made to me by the National Labour Consultative Council about the amalgamation processes of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> These provisions of the Bill are seen by the Government as a first step in the process of encouraging the formation of industry unions. We will naturally be watching their application and development closely and be ready to adapt or change them in the light of experience. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Government has not included in this Bill any provision for the formation of enterprise unions. The Government's proposals in this area are being further developed in consultation with employer and union groups. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Provisions of the Bill</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> There will continue to be, unless the situation is remedied, problems in relation to the de-registration of organizations under both the State and Commonwealth systems. This Bill is intended to cover the situation where a union tries to play off one industrial relations system against another in circumstances where a State union is deregistered in its own jurisdiction. A State union will not be able to move into the Federal jurisdiction to avoid the consequences of its industrial misbehaviour in a State jurisdiction and the discipline of that jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> These proposals have been introduced at the request of the Western Australian Government. To operate, this part of the Bill requires reciprocal State legislation. The Minister will be raising this with his colleagues, the State Ministers for Labour. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments are made by this Bill to provide for greater certainty in the administration of unions where casual vacancies arise. There are situations in which it may be desirable for a vacancy to be filled by appointment, rather than by election. The amendment will permit a casual vacancy to be filled by appointment, provided that the unexpired portion of the term of office is less than 12 months. Special provision is made in the case of appointment to a casual vacancy in an electoral college. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, the rules of an organisation do not permit a person to be elected to hold an office for a period exceeding 4 years, without being re-elected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted representations from the ACTU, through the National Labour Consultative Council, that this requirement is unduly harsh when officers are approaching retiring age. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill, therefore, proposes that the rules of an organisation may permit the holder of a full time office, who is due to retire within a period of 12 months after the expiration of the period for which he was elected, to remain in office until he retires. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with what I have said earlier about encouraging democratic control of organisations registered under the Act, the Government has decided to enlarge the scope for financial assistance to parties to proceedings in the Federal Court in cases involving that principle. The opportunity has been taken of consolidating the financial assistance provisions of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also introduces new procedural arrangements to simplify the application in the Territories of variations to common rules made in the Commission. These arise from discussion of this matter in the National Labour Consultative Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, these principal legislative initiatives which I bring before the Senate, voluntary unionism, an employer's statutory right of stand-down and the formation of industry unions-are the start of a program of reform of the Australian industrial relations system. There is much to be done. As the Minister for Industrial Relations said in his Ministerial Statement on 16 February last, ultimately reform of industrial relations in Australia needs to go further than simplifying and restructuring what we now have. </PARA>
<PARA> It is as challenging a cause as any which faces Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill tackles three principal areas of current interest. It is based on the philosophy, policies and objectives of the Government parties. The Bill confronts no-one. It looks to strengthening the rights of individuals, bringing into balance the rights of unions and employers and opens the doors to the restructuring of union organization in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES (VOLUNTARY MEMBERSHIP OF UNIONS) BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> This is a short Bill, Mr President, and a simple one. It follows from what is provided in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, to give effect to the Government's intentions about the voluntary nature of union membership and preference to unionism. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill declares void any award determination or agreement which makes provision relating to the employment of persons by reference to membership of an association. </PARA>
<PARA> It withdraws powers to make provision for preference by reference to membership of an association. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore designed to put into effect in the area of Commonwealth Government employment the principles proposed in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> (1) That, notwithstanding anything contained in the Standing Orders, and unless otherwise ordered, where in any week there are Orders of the Day for the resumption of debate on motions for the consideration or adoption of reports of committees:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) On Thursday of that week the business before the Senate shall be interrupted one hour before the time at which General Business would have precedence pursuant to Sessional Order, and if the Senate is in Committee at that time, the Chairman shall forthwith leave the Chair and report to the Senate ;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Orders of the Day relating to reports of committees presented to the Senate during that week shall then be severally called on, in the order in which the respective reports were presented;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) if there were no committee reports presented during that week, or if debate on motions relating to such reports concludes before the expiration of one hour, Orders of the Day relating to committee reports presented prior to that week shall then be severally called on in an order which is the reverse of the order in which the respective reports were presented;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) in any debate on such motions so called on, each Senator may speak for not more than 10 minutes; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) any debate pursuant to this Sessional Order shall be interrupted after the expiration of one hour.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Provided that, where debate on any motion debated under the provisions of this Sessional Order is adjourned or is interrupted under the provisions of this Sessional Order, Senators who have spoken to such motion under the provisions of this Sessional Order may again speak to the motion for the time allowed under Standing Order 407A when the debate on the motion is again called on in the normal course of business.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will be aware that this item relates to the consideration of committee reports. It is an attempt by the Standing Orders Committee to suggest to the Senate that it may wish to provide a mechanism whereby committee reports can be considered on a regular basis. It does not alter, of course, the capacity for the Senate to do during debate on General Business items what it has done for years. But it will provide an extra amount of time on a regular basis each week for committee reports to be debated.</PARA>
<PARA> The Standing Order provides that an hour be set aside on the Thursday of each week and that there be limited time for each speaker so that up to six speakers might take part in the debate. An attempt has been made by the Standing Orders Committee-I reiterate that I am speaking in this debate as a member of the Standing Orders Committee and as a senator, not on behalf of the Government, in what is a senators' debate-to ensure that should there be no committee reports, there is a capacity for some flexibility for using that hour to consider committee reports that were previously brought up. It is a genuine attempt by the Standing Orders Committee to provide for the Senate an extra mechanism. I think it was tried once in the past and it was not unsuccessful. It is considered to be an appropriate moment to reconsider the proposal.</PARA>

I must say that I do not entirely agree with him when he says that the Standing Order, as it now stands, allows an hour to debate reports. That is not the way it used always to be. He also said, as is set out in the report of the Standing Orders Committee, that if time allowed on any Thursday we would deal with the reports that had not been dealt with. Since this new Standing Order has been in operation and since I have been in the Senate we have never got through all the reports on which honourable senators wanted to speak on Thursdays, when we have had a 90-minute time limit. Many of them are held over and will continue to be held over each Thursday when new reports come in. We may never be able to debate them unless we seek to do so during the adjournment debate or, if an honourable senator believes it is important, during the first reading stage of a Bill. This will further impede the progress of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That Standing Order 407A be amended to read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> No Senator shall speak for more than thirty minutes in any debate in the Senate . Any Senator may move that the time limit of thirty minutes be extended for fifteen minutes; such motion shall forthwith be put without debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Provided that where a right of reply is allowed in any debate a Senator speaking in reply shall speak for not more than thirty minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> Provided further that, in debate on the first reading of a Bill which the Senate may not amend, no Senator shall speak for more than fifteen minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> In Committee no Senator shall speak for more than a quarter of an hour at any one time on any one Question:</PARA>
<PARA> Provided that where the speech of a Senator is interrupted by this provision, and no other Senator rises to speak, the Senator so interrupted may continue his speech for a further quarter of an hour but no longer continuously on any one Question. </PARA>
<PARA>The Standing Orders Committee, as honourable senators know, consists of senators representing each group within the Senate. It has for some time been looking at ways in which the proceedings of the Senate might be made more effective to meet the requirements of honourable senators. The recommendations which have come forward are recommendations from the Standing Orders Committee. Again, they are not Government recommendations. They have been put forward by senators representing the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal and National Country Parties and the Australian Democrats. The recommendations include proposals that the time limit on speeches on non-broadcast days be 30 minutes, as the time limit is now on broadcast days. I offer a personal opinion that some of the most effective speeches we hear are on broadcast days. I can see no limitation of honourable senators' rights. There is nothing to stop any honourable senator seeking the leave of the Senate in a particular situation, should it arise and should a particular matter of importance come up. The Senate has a record of being receptive to accommodating people in special circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also seeking to look at a special limit of 15 minutes on the speaking time in debates on the first readings of Bills which the Senate may not amend. This does not carry with it any limitation on the capacity to debate matters during the first readings of these Bills, nor does it put a time limit on the debate itself. It merely suggests that in order to allow more honourable senators to participate in the debates and to give honourable senators a chance to play a fuller role in the Senate, the 15 minute limit may not be inappropriate. I commend the proposed amendment to the Standing Order to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose this proposed new sessional order. When I first became a member of this chamber many honourable senators, when they spoke, took the maximum time allowed them. It was an hour on Tuesdays and Thursdays and half an hour on Wednesdays; and when they spoke they took the whole of that time. That, I believe, is not what happens here now. In recent experience honourable senators have rarely spoken for over half an hour in any speech in this place. I believe one of the reasons the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) and those honourable senators who are members of the Standing Orders Committee who advocated this change did not bring forward the actual average duration of speeches in this place today is that the production of those figures would demonstrate that in the vast majority of cases speeches in fact last for less than half an hour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is said that this sessional order will improve the proceedings of the Senate . I do not believe we have had any evidence that that is in fact so. It is certainly true that on the odd occasion an honourable senator in this place has spoken for more than half an hour or even for more than an hour. At times I have been as annoyed as anyone else about the individual cases. I repeat: In the vast majority of cases speeches in fact are less than half an hour. But there is the odd occasion when it is necessary to go longer than half an hour. There is in this place an increasing tendency for the Government to introduce omnibus Bills which cover many aspects of large pieces of legislation such as the Social Services Act or the repatriation legislation. Often they are omnibus Bills which cover many pieces of legislation, several sections of which are very controversial. In those circumstances it is very difficult at times for honourable senators to cover the subject matter in half an hour and they frequently need more than half an hour. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Peter Baume said, there is nothing to prevent honourable senators asking for an extension of time and certainly in the past the Senate has been partial to granting that extra time. But there is no guarantee that that extra time will be granted. If we had a situation of hostilities in this place there is every guarantee that a government, or any party with a majority, may deprive honourable senators of that extra. I do not see how a limitation of speeches to half an hour will change things much. I do not see how it will improve proceedings of the Senate. Until I have some figures to demonstrate that such a restriction would improve the proceedings of the Senate, I will persist in opposing this change. </PARA>
<PARA> In passing I will say, as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs did, that I am certainly partial to limiting the time for speeches at the first reading stage to 15 minutes. The first reading stage of a Bill in this place has become a sort of procedure for a grievance debate in many cases, a procedure with which I agree. As far as I am concerned, on every occasion 15 minutes is long enough. In recent years that I have been a member of this place a limit of half an hour for speeches in general debate has not been abused. If it has been abused, it has been only on very rare occasions. There are times when one needs to speak for longer than half an hour and, therefore, I cannot see any good coming out of this change. Until it is demonstrated that it will do some good, I will persist in my opposition to this change. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too will outline my opposition to the changes proposed in the report of the Standing Orders Committee. I can remember only two occasions since I have been a member of the Senate when honourable senators have spoken for one hour. Obviously there have been more than those two occasions, but the fact that I can remember only two seems to indicate that it did not worry me as a member of the Senate that some honourable senators had exercised their rights to speak for a whole hour. On one of the occasions that I can particularly remember a Government senator who is sitting opposite at the moment spoke for an hour. I do not remember the occasion particularly because the speech took so long, except that former Senator McAuliffe was wanting to follow in the debate and was getting a little itchy waiting for the whole hour to go so that he could have his turn. I remember that the particular senator, who may now remember the occasion I refer to, mentioned that he was in London and had had a good meal of bangers and mash. The other occasion I remember was more recent when a very complex matter was debated. I do not say that the previous speech was not about a complex matter, but the one I remember in later years was on a very complex matter. After an hour the honourable senator who was speaking on this side asked for and was granted an extension of time. When those occasions occur and honourable senators speak for that length of time it seems to me that they obviously have a need to do so; and to limit their time would be to limit our rights as senators. I have never spoken for an hour in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was before Senator Evans arrived in this place. If he likes, I shall refer him to the page in Hansard so that he can see what an excellent speech it was. However, if we reduce the time limit, as indicated in this report, I am not sure where we will finish up. Prior to the amendment made in 1975, the relevant Standing Order stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No Senator shall speak for more than one hour in any debate in the Senate, except that in the debate on the Address-in-Reply, or on the first reading of a Bill which the Senate may not amend, or in moving the second reading of a Bill, he shall be at liberty to speak for one hour and a half. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Standing Order stated prior to the amendment in 1975. Then it went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Any Senator may move that the limit of one hour or of one hour and a half may be extended for thirty minutes; such motion shall forthwith be put without debate:</PARA>
<PARA>Prior to the amendment in 1975 the situation was that, under certain circumstances and provided an extension of time had been given, a senator was able to speak for two hours. I think that two hours is probably far too long. We had that change in 1975, shortly before I became a member of this place. The limit was brought back to an hour with an extension of half an hour, if the leave of the Senate was granted, or half an hour on broadcast day. I am not quite sure where we are going if we are to cut back that hour to half an hour. It would mean that the limit had been brought back from an hour and a half, to an hour, to half an hour. Where do we go from there?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator can speak for our side. I am not quite sure that he can speak for his own. The point I want to make is that we are here to represent States or Territories and we have a right to air the grievances of those States and Territories. If we keep cutting back the time, in certain circumstances we will not be able to air those grievances properly. I will certainly vote against the reduction of the hour to the half hour on Tuesdays and Thursdays and against the reduction of the speaking time to 15 minutes for a first reading debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the real advantages that we in the Senate have over those in the other place is that we can use a first reading debate to raise grievances for the State we represent. I do not think it is a right that we abuse; it is a right we use very carefully and we can use it very effectively. Certain people in the community, when they are listening to first reading debates, do not quite understand what is going on because we might be considering the first reading of a wheat Bill and some honourable senators might be speaking on the Murray River waters. It is very important, I believe, when we are on air, and speaking on such matters, that we outline why we might be speaking on a subject other than that mentioned in the Bill. If we limit the time to 15 minutes we will limit the rights that we have and the advantage that we have over the other place of being able to air these grievances during a first reading debate. I should imagine that, if we took out figures we would probably find that most of the first reading speeches do not reach 15 minutes or are about 15 minutes. But an honourable senator has the right to speak for longer than 15 minutes at the moment and probably exercises that right very effectively and conscientiously. If we are to limit the time we have available for speeches we will limit our rights, and I will vote against both of the proposals on those grounds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Senator Grimes and Senator Colston I will vote against these proposals. I have been one of those who, on occasions, have taken the full time allowed-that is an hour-and I make no apologies for it. I believe it was my right as a senator and I do not want to see that right whittled away. I well remember that my very good friend Senator Cavanagh would never agree to the Senate taking away any rights of honourable senators. He taught me a good lesson. While I am a member of this place and able to speak on those matters I too will oppose any proposals put forward to take away the rights of honourable senators. In the first instance I will confine my remarks to page 2, paragraph 4 (a) of the Senate Standing Orders Committee Third Report for the Sixtieth Session under the heading 'Improving the Proceedings of the Senate'. In the recommendations we see that the Standing Orders Committee says that if we limit the time limit to half an hour on Tuesdays and Thursdays it will not affect special time limits on particular debates, but no mention is made in the report from the Standing Orders Committee as to what in fact those particular debates are. I would like to have the answer from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume), who is in charge of the debate, as to what is a particular debate which will allow a speech to exceed 30 minutes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter that concerns me is that Ministers in this place often deliver long second reading speeches. If leave is not granted to incorporate a second reading speech-it only needs one dissenting voice-what will happen to the second reading speech? Will the speaker be cut off in mid-stream? Having had leave refused to incorporate the speech, will we then have to debate a Bill in the Senate having heard only one-half or two-thirds of the second reading speech? Honourable senators will not know what the Bill is about. That is one matter which I raise now because each honourable senator has the right to refuse leave to incorporate a speech. Of course, if the Government has the numbers it will do as it always does, it will just suspend Standing Orders to complete the debate. The Standing Orders set the time limits and they will carry the day. The party which happens to be in the minority in this chamber again loses its right. The Standing Orders will not protect it in this instance if this recommendation is carried. That is my objection to this proposal, and I intend to vote against it. I also look forward to the Minister advising me as to the special time limits on certain debates and what those debates will be. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to paragraph (b) of the report which seeks to take away more of honourable senators' time on first readings debates. I am indebted to my colleague Senator Colston for pointing out that in 1975 we were allowed to speak for 90 minutes on first reading debates. Now it is proposed by the Standing Orders Committee that honourale senators be given only 15 minutes. Often in this place we have cognate debates, particularly Tariff Bills-there may be seven or eight of them-and we take the first reading of only one of them. If this proposal is carried I will be one senator who will seek the adjournment on the first reading of each of those Bills. If I am to be limited-I might not want to use them all, but some other senator might-I will be one senator who will seek to adjourn the debate on the first reading of every Bill that comes in here. If it takes me 30 minutes or 45 minutes to speak on a matter I will do it in three stages and speak for 15 minutes on each Bill. I will not be the only senator to do that. I am sure that my colleague Senator Colston, who often raises matters of importance to his constituents in Queensland, will do the same. This will again throw the Senate into a further bind. </PARA>
<PARA> As my colleague Senator Grimes said, we have not been given any statistics as to the time taken on first readings of Bills. I want to see those statistics. As I was saying before I digressed to Senator Grimes's remarks, I do not think that any honourable senator has abused the first reading of Bills unless he had good reason to do so. I make it plain to the Senate that that is what will happen if we are further restricted. If this proposal is carried-there was a period of seven years when honourable senators had 90 minutes to speak on the first reading of a money Bill-we will be restricted to 15 minutes. I think that that takes away from honourable senators rights which ought to be guarded so jealously in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Talking about the first readings of Bills, my colleague Senator Colston mentioned the fact that it is good policy to explain, particularly if we are on air, our reasons for discussing a certain matter. It is not too often since this Government has been in office that we get the opportunity to speak on the first reading of a Bill on a Wednesday when we are on air because it always takes fine care to ensure that first reading debates are on a Tuesday or Thursday when the listening public cannot hear that matter of importance which an honourable senator might want to raise. It is a good policy to tell people what we are speaking about because there is a Bill that comes in here, I think every year, known as the Pig Slaughter Levy Bill. It is commonly referred to as the pig's laughter Bill. I well remember the speech of my friend about whom I spoke a little while ago, Senator Cavanagh. When debating the Pig Slaughter Bill he spoke on three occasions over three days because he was not allowed to continue his remarks on the first day when he was putting the Bogle case before the Senate. He made a very good speech. I recommend to any honourable senator who was not here at that time to get out the Hansard and read what Senator Cavanagh had to say about the Bogle case, and he will be very much enlightened. Without delaying the Senate any longer, I will vote against the proposals contained in paragraphs (a) and (b). I await a reply from the Minister as to those special circumstances when a speech may proceed beyond 30 minutes. </PARA>

I think it would be hurtful indeed if, after all our deliberations on this point, the matter were to be rejected on the basis of arguments which perhaps did not fully take account of the issues which concerned the Standing Orders Committee. Some of my colleagues spoke at great length about the rights of honourable senators. Of course we all have very substantial rights by virtue of the fact that we are senators-rights which most members of the public do not have and which I think the public is very much aware of in relation to politicians. With respect, the question is not really one of rights. If one claims that it is an inalienable right of an honourable senator to speak as long as he or she wishes, why does one choose an hour rather than two hours?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What one has to do-the Standing Orders Committee was concerned about this aspect-is to moderate rights in order that the participation of all honourable senators can be assured as far as possible. It is not a question of individual rights; it is a question of the rights of honourable senators as a collective group. Each honourable senator should have an opportunity to speak in a debate. Only a finite amount of time is available. If the rights of a particular honourable senator are considered to be so important that he or she should speak for an hour, that is a delimitation of the rights of other honourable senators. That is the point that the Standing Orders Committee was concerned to bring out. The rights that we have here should be shared rights and not rights which are occupied by one honourable senator to the exclusion of the rights of other honourable senators to participate in a debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I may be wrong about this, but I would have thought that the talent in this Senate was such that anybody here would be capable of saying everything that needed to be said on a particular topic, if words were chosen with precision and spoken concisely, in half an hour. It has never been my view that it is necessary for honourable senators as talented as the ones we have here to take an hour to deal with a particular topic very thoroughly. I put to the Senate the strong view that half an hour in relation to a second reading debate is quite sufficient for most honourable senators to put their views explicitly on a particular topic, bearing in mind that in the context of a party house, as this place is, they will have colleagues who will be wanting to put similar or complementary points of view to the ones that they are putting. </PARA>

I am dealing with the half-hour limitation in relation to a second reading debate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The recommendation is not for a time limit of a quarter of an hour; it is for half an hour. I am not departing from the recommendation. If any honourable senator wants to recommend one of a quarter of an hour we will debate that matter again. I put it to the Senate that that is the appropriate consideration to take into account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator McLaren raised an important legalistic point, if I may put it in those terms, when he said that sometimes a Minister, in introducing a Bill, speaks for more than half an hour. If we cannot accommodate that sort of situation in this place and let a Minister finish-perhaps by way of exchange we could give Senator McLaren 10 minutes extra or something like that when he speaks to the matter-I think we are really in dreadful trouble. We want the place to work as efficiently as it is humanly possible for people to work in the sort of iron lung in which we find ourselves. I think that point could be overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of the limitation of time in the first reading stage of a Bill, I do not feel as strongly about that issue as I do about the first issue. Again, I think the Standing Orders Committee is trying to encourage in the first reading stage of a money Bill a situation in which a number of honourable senators could contribute concisely and so on about particular points. Again, it is not a question of asserting individual rights; it is a question of sharing the time, as far as possible, so that we can get as many contributors and as much participation as possible in relation to the first reading stage. I should have thought that the nature of speeches made in the first reading stage of a money Bill would particularly lend itself to short, concise, compelling, incisive, direct, forthright speeches--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We put an arbitrary limit on it because some honourable senators might think that their speeches were so precise, incisive, short, penetrating or whatever that they would want to repeat themselves when as a matter of fact they can probably do it very well in 15 minutes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So what the Standing Orders Committee's report is about is encouraging the use of talent in the Senate; encouraging the development of the skill of saying things precisely, to the point, directly and so on, improving the cut and thrust -to adopt an expression of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)-of debate in this chamber, and making sure that the capacity of all honourable senators to participate in that debate is assured rather than having some honourable senators being excluded by the indulgence of others. I commend the Standing Orders Committee's report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak also as a member of the Senate Standing Orders Committee. I wish to reinforce the point made by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister for Health, Senator Peter Baume, that the recommendations which have been put forward are not government initiatives. They arise out of the work of an all-party committee. I think it would be unfortunate if any honourable senator who entered into the debate did so with the idea that perhaps the present Government will gain some advantage from it. I assure all honourable senators that the members of the Committee, as an all-party group, were looking to protect the interests of the Parliament rather than those of a government at any particular time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The recommendations that were made grew out of the responses to a questionnaire sent to honourable senators. In other words, although we have had some speakers against the propositions that have come forward, the questionnaire has indicated quite clearly-two to one-that honourable senators are in favour of the propositions. We went through this exercise particularly because we wanted to make sure that we were accommodating not just those honourable senators who speak with the loudest voices or put forward the strongest arguments but the majority of honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> The suggestion has been made that a 30-minute time limit might encourage better speeches to be made. Let us hope that, as Senator Button suggested, honourable senators will learn to restrain themselves to a 15-minute speech and those who are speaking in the ordinary debates will restrain themselves to a 30-minute speech. </PARA>
<PARA> One honourable senator made a suggestion and, as we are speaking not as members of a party but as members of the Senate, I can comment on that suggestion. Senator Grimes suggested that we should have some sort of demonstration to show that 30 minutes is a better time limit. I put it to Senator Grimes that that is exactly what we are trying to do. This is a sessional order to see whether a 30- minute limit is a better proposition. We want to see whether this will be a better idea. Matters that come within the Standing Orders or matters that come within sessional orders are always open to change at a later stage. Certainly we will never know whether 30 minutes is a better time limit unless we give it a try. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to reassure another of my colleagues who said: 'In 1919 we had an hour and a half and we still had the same in 1975 but we changed it. What a terrible thing! What will we do next? Will we have five minutes or 10 minutes?' I do not wish to be facetious about this matter. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OP7">Senator ROBERTSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make the point that in 1919 there were 36 honourable senators in this place. We now have 64 people who have to be accommodated. So it is not a very dramatic change. I turn now to the suggestion concerning a 15- minute time limit for first reading debates. Again this was suggested in response to the questionnaire and is the request of the bulk of the people here. I believe, going back to the argument that we have just raised, that we must give ourselves more chance to speak. If we give honourable senators half an hour each to speak on a first reading, that means that half the number of honourable senators will be able to speak than if we allow each honourable senator 15 minutes. We have lists on our board of 15 and 16 honourable senators who are waiting to speak on a first reading. By the time each honourable senator has had half an hour on the first reading stage, the matters many wish to discuss will no longer be relevant as they will be debating them three weeks later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we have a matter which needs to be brought forward in a concise way, as Senator Button has said, surely we ought to try to allow as many honourable senators as we can to speak in the time available. The recommendation is that we try a limit of 15 minutes. I reinforce again the point that Senator Button made. It is not the rights of individual honourable senators that I am concerned about now but the rights of the total group. Certainly there is no doubt in my mind that I would rather have ten honourable senators getting 15 minutes each than five getting half an hour each. That is protecting the rights of the individual by allowing them to bring their matters forward. On the subject of a Minister's second reading speech, a suggestion made by one speaker was that perhaps Ministers could be accommodated by the Opposition. If the rest of us have to speak for 30 minutes, surely Ministers can contain themselves to 30 minutes. If gold rusts, what then shall iron do? After all, Ministers have people who write their speeches for them. Let us face it: If it is a shorter speech it will probably be an improvement. Another suggestion was made that we should have first readings on a Wednesday. I make no comment at all about this matter. It is not part of what we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me, with those few brief comments, add to what has been said by others. I remind honourable senators that this is not a government initiative; it is a matter that all parties have looked at. We are looking at, firstly, trying to improve the quality of speeches, secondly, trying to give honourable senators more opportunity to speak on broadcast and non-broadcast days, on first readings and other debates and, thirdly, looking towards making the whole situation flow more evenly. I think that this proposal will improve the flow of work in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As one of the more notoriously brisk, incisive and short-winded speakers in this place, I do not feel personally that I will be in any way prejudiced by any of these new rules and for that-among other reasons -I will not vote against them. I rise to make only one small point, and that is that I think it ought to be acknowledged openly by speakers on both sides of the chamber that there are exceptions and that extensions of time ought not to be churlishly withheld, certainly not for partisan reasons, in those exceptional cases. I think there are two obvious classes of exceptional cases that I can think of and certainly of which I have been guilty-if that is the word-of employing to speak rather longer than half an hour. Those two classes are these: First of all, when there is a very large and compendious Bill encompassing a broad range of subject areas which simply cannot be dealt with other than superficially in a very short time, it is my experience that often the Committee stage in these matters can be quite considerably shortened without setting a number of hares running that other people will pick up, if an honourable senator can build into a second reading speech of a slightly longer duration than would otherwise be the case, the various specific points that that honourable senator wants to make and which could technically await the Committee stage but perhaps could be more conveniently dealt with at that stage. That is one exception.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the other obvious exception that we have all been aware of from time to time is the case where some actual or potential abuse is being alleged of some individual, where allegations are being made of misconduct of some kind or another or potential misconduct, where people's reputations are on the line and where, accordingly, I think it is important for those alleging the matters in issue to do more than simply make some rhetorical and often superficial statements perhaps accompanying them by a mass of tabled information but which, of course, will not be easily reported at the time because it cannot be easily absorbed by those who are listening to it. I think that, for example, is very much the kind of situation that was in issue on that perhaps notorious occasion when I spoke for about 75 minutes, an occasion referred to, I suspect, by Senator Colston earlier on the alleged financial dealings of Sir Garfield Barwick a couple of years ago. It was a matter of obviously great concern, a matter that had to be presented, if it was to be presented at all, with a great deal of care and responsibility and a great deal of attention to detail. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not suggest for a moment that occasions of this kind are always appealing to the other side of the chamber. However, I do suggest that it ought to be acknowledged that they are the sorts of occasions where, if the matter is to be raised at all in the Parliament, it is important that it be done properly and carefully and that, accordingly, it be that kind of occasion when an extension of time is granted. If the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) or someone else on the other side would acknowledge openly on the record now in the course of this debate that that ought to be the case in the sorts of instances that I have mentioned and perhaps some others as well, I for one will be perfectly happy to make the new norm that which is proposed by the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am coming in at an opportune or perhaps inopportune time, depending on which side of this debate one happens to be on. The heading on page 2 of the Senate Standing Orders Committee report is ' Improving the Proceedings of the Senate'. If there is a misnomer, that is one; because, if what follows is supposed to improve the proceedings of the Senate, I would need to be convinced. Over the period that I have been here, we have gradually diminished, and in some ways improved, the proceedings in the Senate. But we reach a stage when one must say: 'We have been so far and we go no further'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What has happened since I have been a senator in this place is that we, by general arrangement, have shortened the length of speeches. In some very important debates in order to allow major participation by honourable senators the Whips have arranged that the length of speeches be limited. On special occasions, the length of speeches has been limited by special arrangement. However, there are some times when it is impossible to say, in an abbreviated time, what one needs to say. One needs to have adequate time. The old practice was that if one rose to one's feet and one had half an hour to speak one spoke for half an hour. Over a period, honourable senators have come to appreciate that they say what they have to say and then sit down. That is the position at the moment. Honourable senators have accepted that they do not have to go on endlessly. </PARA>
<PARA> If they have half an hour to speak on broadcast days they should speak for a full half hour: That was the ruling at the time when I came into this place. On broadcast day I used to say all that I needed to say in 15 minutes and pad the next 15 minutes because the understanding was that if one did not fill the half hour-especially on broadcast day-one gave the balance of one's time to one's opposition. We have grown up a little. By arrangement, we have voluntarily shortened our speaking time. However, we ought not to formalise that arrangement by putting it into the Standing Orders as is indicated by this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Senate we also have a ministry and shadow ministry both of which have staff available to them. Also, they have the facility of having their speeches prepared for them and of reading them. They can speak with great formality and suit their purpose well but backbenchers are inclined to find themselves in a limited position. That does not seem to be relevant to what I am saying, but let me get back to the fact that the--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V4">Senator GEORGES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am prepared to admit that but often, when the honourable senator is on her feet, she never admits that she is not relevant to the debate before the chamber. She can go on for ages. I am prepared to admit, as I listen to myself develop what I am saying, that I am not quite relevant to the subject matter. However, let me get back to the proposal. The recommendation is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the general time limit on speeches be half an hour on Tuesdays and Thursdays, as it is at present on Wednesdays, and that the Standing Orders be amended accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA>When have we had a speech on a Tuesday or a Thursday that has gone for one hour? That occurs very seldom unless some honourable senator has a particular case to put. There is very little stonewalling in this place. As a matter of fact, it is the opposite. We seem to be keen to do as little as possible in as little time as possible and to get out of the place as soon as possible. It seems to be the convenience of the front bench to say their brief piece and then get out of the place. </PARA>
<PARA> To get back to the debate, seldom does a senator go for the full hour to which he is entitled on Tuesdays and Thursdays. For the life of me, I cannot understand why--</PARA>

Besides, he is entitled to the hour because many of us are prepared to give him that full time and to cut back our own time. If honourable senators are worried about lengthy speeches, and it is my view that we have to put up with them, then they have to look at the lawyers in this place-Senator Rae, Senator Lewis and, in particular, Senator Gareth Evans.

Although we may be able to protect ourselves from, say, the legal profession in this place who seem to have to stretch out what they have to say to as many words as possible, I do not think that is a reason for cutting back the time for speeches. Who knows, there may be an occasion when Gareth Evans has something to say which is interesting and which will take an hour. What is more, the same can be said for Senator McLaren. In any case, if they speak for too long, the Whip can impose the discipline.

I think there is no need to formalise the proposition which allows for the limiting of time from an hour to half an hour. Senators very seldom take an hour. I come to the proposition allowing for a 15-minute speech on the first reading of a Bill. The first reading debate on a money Bill makes this place very much different from the other place. It allows a senator to make a statement which may be of great concern, and to make that statement clearly and effectively during a general debate. What we are endeavouring to do here is to make of the first reading debate a short grievance debate as it is in the other place. I do not know whether that is entirely necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>

There seems to be no need to further truncate the speaking time of senators. We have accepted already the device of the incorporation of second reading speeches. This device has saved the Senate many hours. I do not think it is necessary to go any further. I think it ought to be left to the good will of the senator concerned and also to the discipline that the Whips impose and the arrangements which the various parties come to.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to support the half-hour limit on speeches. I do so because I was amazed by a statement made earlier by Senator Colston that he could remember only two occasions since he has been a senator when any senator spoke for an hour. I became a senator at the same time as Senator Colston. I can remember on many occasions senators speaking for the full hour. I well remember then Senator Reg Wright from Tasmania speaking on constitutional issues on a number of occasions. He spoke also on the Hursey case . On one occasion, he spoke for an hour on the Remuneration Tribunal and I think he was only half way through his speech. I also remember great efforts from Senator Harradine and Senator O'Byrne when they carried out some 15-round bouts over the history of the Australian Labor Party in Tasmania and the history of the Labor Council in Tasmania. I suppose I really do not blame Senator Colston for forgetting those speeches because most of them were very forgettable. But I can remember them and I can remember the details. For those reasons alone, I certainly will be voting for the 30-minute limit.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For different reasons, of course, than those outlined by Senator Sibraa, I will be supporting this proposition. I will do so on the understanding that no doubt honourable senators who will be supporting this proposition will have regard to the fact that sometimes it is impossible, within the half hour, to deal with all of the matters which one would like to deal with when addressing oneself, say, to the debate on the second reading of a Bill which is before this chamber. I am attracted to the proposition because it puts Wednesdays which are broadcast days on the same basis as Tuesdays and Thursdays. In other words, on Wednesdays the extensions provisions could apply, as I understand this proposition. That is attractive because if, for example, industrial legislation came before this chamber on broadcast day, the Government presumably putting it on on that day because it expected, forlornly I might say, to get some political propaganda out of it, if one were expected to deal with it in an intelligent manner then it might be difficult to deal with it within the half hour. Under the present Standing Orders, a senator would have half an hour and that would be that. Under this proposition a senator would be enabled to indicate to the Senate that he would not have time to complete his remarks and therefore would be enabled to move presumably as he would still be on his feet, for an extension of time of 15 minutes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond to a couple of points that have been made during this debate. When I speak I am not speaking for the Government; the Government does not have a view on the Standing Orders. An honourable senator said that this is a Senate debate; I am speaking as a senator. Since I have come to this place there has been a change in the way honourable senators approach their work. We have a younger Senate; we have, by objective measurement, a better educated and fairly active Senate. A lot of honourable senators want to take part in debates. As Senator Button said, the problem is to try to make available, to the greatest number of honourable senators, a chance to participate in debates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind those who have taken part in this Committee debate that the last motion that was passed put aside more of the time that might have been used for Government business for a Senate purpose; that is, for the consideration of committee reports. Senator Button said in his speech that what is required is to seek a mechanism to give a greater number of honourable senators a chance to participate in debates on Tuesdays and Thursdays and to participate in debates at the first reading stage. If more speeches can be made, we will represent our electorates better. What is being proposed in the new Standing Order is a means of achieving that. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a situation now where if one can anticipate special circumstances, and generally one can, arrangements are often made between Whips, or in the case of Senator Harradine between him and the various groups in the chamber or between the Australian Democrats and the major party Whips. Efforts are made to try to accommodate special circumstances and special needs. That has always been the case. The provision here is explicitly spelt out so that honourable senators have a capacity to move for an extension of the time beyond the limit. The whole thrust of what we are out to do is to try to put alongside the further extension of the consideration of committee business a provision which will allow more honourable senators to take part in general debates during the week. This can only be for the good of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Having been guilty, certainly in the past, of making some long and boring speeches, my own observation of my own performance would be that when one had to prepare a speech to deliver within a time limit it was generally a better speech and was, as Senator Button said, a tighter, better organised speech. That is simply my personal recollection and observation. That is often the case for many honourable senators. I acknowledge that there may be special circumstances and special situations for which special arrangements are required. I think that is a matter for the Senate to decide. I do not believe that either in the proposal to bring the speaking arrangements for Tuesday and Thursday in line with Wednesday or in the proposal to make new arrangements for first reading debates honourable senators will lose anything. All that is required is that we prepare our material with rather more care. I think that the debates will be more interesting and that we will lose nothing in the presentation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few remarks on what Senator Button has said. He mentioned that honourable senators can make good speeches if their words are chosen with precision; that by doing that, and by ensuring the adoption of the new time limits on speeches we encourage talent. Unfortunately not all honourable senators have facilities similar to those of Senator Button and Ministers. Senator Button, as can Ministers, can speak in the Senate from notes or from a speech in draft. The points in those notes are gone over with a fine tooth comb by staff and when the speech is delivered it can be read. It is received very well and it reads well in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope in the future the honourable senator does not do that, because he has done so in the past, as have Ministers. This is quite against Standing Order 406. If a back bencher, particularly on the Opposition side, endeavours to read a speech he is smartly brought to book. This has been referred to occasionally on the Government side, not so much on the Opposition side. The point is that if we are going to introduce recommendations to change Standing Orders to improve the performance in this place we also ought to give the President full authority to enforce Standing Order 406 so that Ministers and the leaders on this side of the chamber have to go through the same trauma as back benchers. They will then make speeches, which in a lot of cases, may not read as well as speeches by back benchers, although it will take them a little longer to deliver them. All honourable senators who vote for these propositions today should not even ask for or expect to get extensions of time. They have signified in their speeches today and will signify by their vote that they do not want them. They are going to condense their speeches and show the talent which Senator Button spoke about.

They come in here week after week and say nothing. They will be the ones who will support the recommendation. These honourable senators who want to say something probably would not have supported the proposal. The matter that disturbs me greatly regards Senator Walters. If she is going to vote for this motion to restrict her speaking time to half an hour three days a week and 15 minutes for first reading debates, how will she develop a speech when she stands up there as she does on most occasions and lambasts the trade union movement? She will not be able to do it in 15 minutes. So she will be in trouble, as this is the main theme of her speeches.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Robertson said that there is a long list of honourable senators wanting to speak in first reading debates. By the time they get the call the material that they want to use is stale or out of date. That was never the case before. An honourable senator could rise immediately and speak to the first reading motion of a Bill. For some reason unknown to back benchers that has all been changed. We can only speak in first reading debates on Thursdays. If some business takes place and first reading speeches are not made on Thursdays there is then a week's adjournment or three weeks' adjournment like we have just had and in the Whip's room there is a list a mile long of honourable senators who want to speak. It might be a month before honourable senators get the opportunity to speak in that debate. By that time the matter is stale because first reading speeches are allowed only on Thursdays. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is my understanding of the matter. I am pleased the honourable senator has informed me that the position is different. If I have a current matter I want to raise the next time a first reading debate is brought on I will feel quite free to get up and speak to it. For the reasons that I have outlined I think the Senate is running into great dangers if it adopts these proposals. Some honourable senators are not afraid to point this out. If honourable senators seek an extension of time we will remind them that they did not want the time initially. The members of the Standing Orders Committee must have given very serious thought to these recommendations. My leader Senator Button is a member of the Standing Orders Committee. I am sure that when he agreed for this proposition to come forward he gave serious thought to the time limit he imposed upon himself as well as the time limit he imposed upon the back benchers. As I said, he has more of an advantage because he can say a lot more in 30 minutes with a prepared speech compared with honourable senators on the back bench. We have to do our own research as well as attend to all the other duties we have in the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When a Bill is brought on for debate we often have to speak off the cuff. I venture to say that a lot of the speeches that are made off the cuff in this place get right to the nub of the problem. They are far better than some of the prepared speeches by Ministers, front benchers from our own side and others. There are many occasions when our speeches find the kernel of the problem much better than some of these prepared speeches. When one has a prepared speech one does not know what will crop up. If one answers a few interjections one is thrown right off line. Certainly, if this measure passes-apparently it will- honourable senators will not get an extension of time. Matters will just be left in limbo. People listening to an honourable senator on the radio on Wednesday or reading the speech the next day or the next week in the proof copy of Hansard will not know what the honourable senator is on about. They will know what the people who were speaking off the cuff were on about. They were not allowed to read their speeches. For those reasons I will oppose both the propositions. </PARA>

But having listened to the debate which has taken place I begin to wonder whether my concern is misplaced. Having heard some of the contributions that have been made and the length that they have taken I just begin to wonder whether we should at least not give a trial to some method of imposing some limitation. I therefore propose to the Senate-as a compromise between those who wish to see permanently enshrined in the Standing Orders the limitation which has been proposed by the Senate Standing Committee on Standing Orders and those who are opposed to any change at all-the idea that for a trial period by sessional order there be the change to see how, in fact, it operates. I would feel considerably happier if that were done. After, say, two sessions of trial we could see whether people still hold the same view as passionately as they do now that there will be some real loss to the Senate of its opportunities to operate as a Senate.

I assure Senator McLaren that when I was thinking about a limitation of time I had him in mind as much as myself, if not more so. My action was not done on any partial basis at all; it was done on the basis of equity, at least between Senator McLaren and me .

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier in the debate I outlined my opposition to both proposals-the proposal to limit general speeches to 30 minutes and the proposal to limit speeches in the first reading debates to 15 minutes. I am not so intent on trying to see that opposition succeed that I would not like, perhaps, to see it work in the Senate for a little while. I therefore commend the proposal that Senator Peter Rae has put forward. It may be that, after we have seen this plan in operation for some time, those of us who oppose it at the present time might not any longer see any need for opposition. On the other hand, the situation might arise that those who have proposed these matters at this time see after that trial period that it is not working properly or it is not working effectively in the Senate and, therefore, it would be much easier for us to revert to what we have at the present time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we enshrine these propositions in the Standing Orders at the present moment I can foresee that it would be very difficult for us to revert to what we have at the present time. We would have to go through the whole debate again. We would have to have a report before us. That would be a most cumbersome prospect for us to go through. I therefore commend Senator Rae's proposition to honourable senators. However, if the motion is passed in its proposed form I ask : What do we mean by a sessional order? How far does it go? I would be interested to know whether it would be just for a session, whether it is for this session and the autumn session or for the whole sitting of this Parliament.</PARA>

We are here representing people from various States and the two Territories. Those people sent us here expecting us to do our duty by them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I participated in the debate earlier I indicated that most honourable senators take no more than half an hour-sometimes less-to speak in debates. One or two honourable senators might take a full hour on a matter which they considered to be important. If this proposal were to be implemented for a trial period one would not object to that period of half an hour in which to speak. We could see how many people get to the end of half an hour and find that they need more time. I do not think we will find that happening very often except in some of the more complicated debates that may take place. Even then, I suppose, an honourable senator could take up many of the matters in the Committee stage of Bills. I do not feel inclined to go to the barricades over the half hour limitation on Tuesdays and Thursdays as well as Wednesdays.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I have strong feelings on the next proposal found in recommendation (b ). I do not think the first reading debate ought to be truncated in this way. I am assured by Senator Robertson that first reading debates on Bills do not come forward only on Thursdays. I think this occurs by government arrangement. If the Government has any astuteness at all it will not bring on the first reading of a Bill on a broadcast day. It certainly will not do so when it has important business. The first reading debates are generally set down for a Thursday anyhow . The Government by arrangement of the business program makes certain that first reading Bills do not interrupt the flow of debate. My view is that if a first reading debate takes place it should be treated the same as all other debates; that is, if we agree to recommendation (a) in paragraph 4, recommendation (b) ought to read half an hour. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason, I intend to propose formally-if you, Mr Chairman, put the question separately-that, recommendation (a) having been agreed to, recommendation (b) be amended to read half an hour. That would prevent a speech in a first reading debate on a Thursday or a Tuesday going for the full hour, as it does at present. It would merely go for half an hour. My view is that 15 minutes is far too short a time in which to make an important contribution to a debate on the motion for the first reading of a Bill. In moving that amendment, I will suggest that we take the matters separately and when recommendation (b) is put to the Senate I will move that there be a limit of 30 minutes on the speaking times in debates on the first reading of a Bill which the Senate may not amend and that the Standing Orders be amended accordingly. I am not saying ' special'. I am merely taking out the word 'special'. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V4">Senator GEORGES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That would have exactly the same result. Therefore, I will move formally for the deletion of the last paragraph. That would bring the time limitation for first reading debates into conformity with that for the rest of our debates; that is, half an hour. If we accept Senator Rae's proposition we will also give ourselves a period to reconsider. At the end of three months or six months we can take a look at it and see just what limitations the half an hour limit has placed upon the Senate. In view of the fact that, as I said before, very few honourable senators have taken their full hour, I cannot see any reason for opposing recommendation (a). I strongly support the deletion of recommendation (b).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I want to make one further point. From an Opposition's point of view-I might be being critical of those Opposition members on the Standing Orders Committee-these moves facilitate a Government more than they facilitate an Opposition. I know that there will be a change of positions in this place and I expect that there will be a change at the next election. But historically the Labor Party has been in opposition more often than it has been in government. What we are doing is facilitating the ease with which a Government runs its program. That really is not the responsibility of an Opposition. The responsibility of an Opposition is to have as many devices as are available to it to frustrate the Government if what the Government is opposing is not acceptable or is, perhaps, reprehensible. There ought to be devices available to an Opposition. Sometimes the device may be lengthy speeches made at the appropriate time in order to postpone proceedings. It might be a postponement for only two or three days. It might be necessary to postpone legislation and not to allow legislation to be passed. What we are doing, of course, is making it easier for the Government to get its business through. I make that comment from an instinctive position which I have taken in the past. I have responded immediately to some of these propositions of the Government-especially those proposed by the Government Whip-with a 'No' because the Government was seeking to advantage itself. It looks as though I am going to drag Senator Grimes into the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak briefly. I believe Senator Rae's amendment is sensible partly because it is clear that the new limitation on times will in fact go through. I suppose that is partly due to some of the arguments that have been put by people in opposition to it. I must say that I take the reverse view to that taken by Senator Georges. I believe that the ability to speak on what an honourable senator wishes in a speech in this place on the motion for the first reading of a Bill is in fact a quirk of this place. It is in fact a time for grievances. If an honourable senator cannot get his grievance over in a quarter of an hour, I think he should propose it as a matter of public importance or raise it in the adjournment debate or at some time like that when an honourable senator can take longer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My argument and the argument I used in the first place is simply that I think we are going about this matter in the wrong way. We have had two people-Senator Evans and Senator Harradine-who have said: 'We will vote in favour of the limitation of time to half an hour'. But they have both said: 'But when we want extra time we will seek an extension and we expect to get it'. With due respect to the two honourable senators, they are people who are always after extra time and who will always need it in the future because they are two people who happen frequently to make speeches for more than half an hour. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am being fair. The simple fact of the matter is that the vast majority of the speeches made in this place go for less than half an hour. On a few special occasions some people speak for more than half an hour. As Senator Peter Baume and I have demonstrated since we first arrived in this place, we are able, by self-discipline, in most cases to limit ourselves to less than half an hour. I see no harm in the present time limit of an hour on those Tuesdays and Thursdays. If someone finds himself in the circumstances in which Senator Harradine and Senator Evans sometimes find themselves and he wants to go for a bit over half an hour he in fact can do that without any difficulty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have heard a lot about senators' rights and I am not one who uses that sort of argument at all. I think we get obessed with what we think are our rights in this place and I think we mistake what the word means. But if we reach the circumstances whereby we are having some sort of war of attrition in this place, it is the easiest thing in the world for the majority group in this chamber to stop people from getting the extension of time they need. Then people such as Senator Harradine and Senator Evans may find themselves in trouble when they should not be in trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, it is clear that the half hour limit proposition will go through. I fail to see-no honourable senator arguing in favour of it has demonstrated this to us-how it will improve the workings of the Senate. Everyone here knows that people very rarely speak for longer than half an hour. No one has taken out any figures to try to demonstrate how the new limit will make more time available for debate. One would not be able to demonstrate that by limiting the speeches to half an hour we would improve the situation. I accept where the numbers are. As I said earlier, I accept some of the reasons for the numbers being where they are. I will therefore support Senator Peter Rae's amendment, which I think is eminently sensible. I do not support Senator Georges's amendment for the reasons that I gave earlier. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; From what Senator Grimes has said, it is clear that my previous support for the proposal was based on a false premise. I had been under the impression that existing Standing Order 407A precludes the moving of a motion on broadcast day for the extension of an honourable senator's time. Clearly that is not so. There is an ability under existing Standing Order 407A on broadcast day for an honourable senator to move for an extension of time . In those circumstances, for the reasons that I gave previously, it is clear now that we will not gain anything from the proposition before us. Therefore, I must admit that, having made up my mind to support the proposition on a false reading on my part of existing Standing Order 407A, I am now persuaded to vote against the proposition and I will do so accordingly. The fall back position, of course, is that proposed by Senator Peter Rae. I will support that proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just mention that I was under a misapprehension when I was speaking earlier about the sessional order. I understood that, if we passed Senator Peter Rae's motion, we would probably look at this proposition again next session- that is, in my mind, the Budget session. I think Senator Georges was probably under this misapprehension too. He mentioned that we would perhaps look at the proposition again in three months' time. I am informed that a session, in parliamentary terms, is the length of the Parliament. That means that we could conceivably go until the end of 1983 before we looked at this matter again.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that the honourable senator did not mislead me. I was misled by my own definition of a session. We often speak of the autumn session or the Budget session and I was using that terminology. Of course, I am told that if for some reason the Parliament is prorogued in the meantime that is the end of the session. It could be prorogued for some special reason, for instance, if we wanted to have the Parliament opened by the Queen when she is in Australia later in the year. We would look again at the Standing Order at the beginning of the next session, which could conceivably be at the end of this year. But the most likely event, it seems to me, is that the session will go until the end of 1983. In that case the sessional order would apply until then and we would have to look at the Standing Order again in the early part of 1984. Whether the fact that the year would be 1984 has a relevance, I am not sure.</PARA></TALK.START>

If Senator Peter Rae's motion is carried, it would seem to me to be better that we look at it at, say, the end of this year or the beginning of next year to determine whether we are still in favour of it and whether it should continue. If we wait until the end of next year, the proposition may become part of the folk lore of the place and, even though there may be some disadvantages, we may be disinclined to change it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened to this debate for most of the afternoon-some time in my office and a little time in this chamber. I have yet to hear a fundamentally sound reason why there should be change. We have been told-it has been emphasised-that at present honourable senators rarely use all of the time available to them in debate. That is fair enough. My memory of the situation, from the short time in which I have been here, is that that is true. Why should we formalise that discipline which honourable senators are already imposing on themselves?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite obviously, when honourable senators have had enough to say, when they have made their case, they sit down. Very rarely in here do honourable senators talk out their time. There are occasions-Senator Georges alluded to them-when the tactic is used, quite properly so, by the Opposition. I do not have the same dreadful expectations about the future that Senator Georges has. I do not anticipate that in the future honourable senators presently on the Government benches will be on the Opposition side and senators presently on the Opposition benches will be on the Government side. I do not want to hear any suggestion of any party political advantage in the debate. It seems to me that we have been given no good reason at all. It seems to me that a change has been proposed almost for change's sake. </PARA>
<PARA> I could see the advantage, even though I voted against it, of trying new sitting hours in the Senate, but, regardless of whatever good reasons were put forward for changing those hours, there does not appear to be any sound reason for the proposition now before us except to formalise the self-discipline that honourable senators have exercised in the place. That is not a good enough reason for me to want any change at all in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that, as has been well pointed out by others, there will be occasions- very rare occasions-when somebody needs more time. Indeed, I suppose I have to personalise that remark by saying that the only occasion since I have been a member of the Parliament when I feel that I will need more time than is allowed- about half an hour-will be during consideration of the family law matter which is to come before us soon. The subject has been before us previously. I feel that I will need a lot more time in which to speak on that matter because I have a particular interest in it. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that honourable senators have other interests and they will want to take up their allotted time. Senator McLaren, who is trying to interject, has his interests, too. He wants to take up his time and he uses it well. I suppose that , in common with everybody else around here, I do not like to be here after midnight listening to him use that time well, but he is entitled to do so; and I have been here keeping him company while he has been doing that. Fundamentally, I think, Senator McLaren and I are at one. Senator McLaren's proposition is that the Standing Orders be left as they are. That is my proposition too. I say so simply on the grounds that no really good reason has been put forward for formalising the discipline that honourable senators already impose on themselves . So, with great pleasure, I will vote against all the new propositions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the existing sessional order relating to the procedure for the presentation of petitions be replaced by the following proposed sessional order:</PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding anything contained in the Standing Orders, the procedure for the presentation of petitions is varied, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) A Senator wishing to present a petition shall lodge it with the Clerk. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Clerk shall make an announcement in respect of petitions lodged with him, indicating in respect of each petition the Senator who presents it, the number of signatures, the identity of the petitioners and the subject matter of the petition. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Every petition so presented shall be deemed to have been received by the Senate unless a motion, moved forthwith, that a particular petition be not received, be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) The terms of the petitions presented shall be printed in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA>After the uneventful and non-controversial debate which has just passed, I am sure honourable senators will find the next proposal to be a matter of little controversy. It concerns the practice in the Senate of reading petitions. As honourable senators will see in the report of the Standing Orders Committee, it is suggesting to honourable senators that it may wish to consider an amendment of that practice, namely, that the reading of the text of petitions be abandoned , that all petitions presented by honourable senators be lodged with the Clerk and that the Clerk read a summary of the content of petitions. The Standing Order has been drafted to give effect to that. Honourable senators might ask: What is the purpose of a petition being presented in the Parliament? It is, of course, an ancient right for citizens which has to be taken seriously by honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> The only question before the Committee is the form which that should take. How should a petition be put into the Parliament? It is irrelevant what happens in any other place, but one may ask again: How can we use the time of the Senate best? How can we do it in such a way that still allows petitions concerning matters of importance to come before the Senate so that the Senate is made aware of those petitions, yet perhaps modify the present practice which is considered by some honourable senators to be not the best use of the Senate time and to be one during which not a lot of attention is paid to the detail of the petitions themselves?</PARA>
<PARA> If the new sessional order is adopted, the Standing Orders Committee would recommend-this is included in the report-that Mr President would as a matter of practice have a list of all the petitions circulated to honourable senators so that those senators who want to have the content of a petition taken up by a particular Senate committee may be aware of the substance of the petition and may in fact then seek a reference from the Senate so to do. The Standing Orders Committee has been trying to seek a means by which petitions can be received and by which the subject matter can be made known to the Senate but which will avoid the quite lengthy and often unproductive way in which the presentation of petitions has been done until the present. I commend the recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose this proposed change. I think it is a great shame that this should have come before the Committee. I believe that even in considering it we are forgetting a very important fact-that we represent people in this place. The people of this country who, when they feel strongly enough about something to get off their butts and to collect tens or hundreds of thousands of signatures, do so with a purpose. They have a very ancient right at least to petition this place and to have the feeling that their petition is heard in some kind of way. I have listened to the way in which petitions are presented in the House of Representatives. It is an absolute farce; it is a disgrace. There is no reason why petitions should even continue to be presented in that place, judging from the way they are handled now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the last session of this Parliament I moved a motion, which I will be shortly moving again in this session, which would enable a large enough petition containing half a million signatures to demand action to put matters to referendum. That, I think, is something which lies in the future for this country. Meanwhile, I think it essential that we allow a voice from the people to come into this place. It is the only one they have, with respect to those of us who are delegates, the representatives of those people, members or whatever we call ourselves. They rarely enough have their views put forward by people in this place. I think it is an ancient right. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of broadcasting has given these petitions a certain amount of clout. I do not deplore the fact that we get many petitions on a broadcast day. I do not regard it as a waste of time. The feedback I get from people in the electorate is that they do not regard it as a waste of time. When those many thousands of people who sign those petitions hear that at least the fact that they have done so is getting through to the rest of the community through the broadcasting of the Senate, they feel that something of importance has happened. I will cite one small example. Petitions concerning lead in petrol were presented in this place last year by a number of honourable senators. Every broadcast day, and virtually every other day as well, those petitions were presented. I cannot believe they did not have a considerable effect on community feeling and possibly on the view of government. It was designed to be that way. Those people, many of whom were members of parents and citizens organisations, got those petitions together because they felt that there was some value in doing it. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that when petitions hit this place no further action is taken about them. But this is, after all, a parliament. It is a place of debate. It is a place where things are discussed and talked about. To refuse the right for the want of a little of our time, to say that perhaps another 10 or 15 minutes speaking time for one of us is more important than that the voice of those people should be heard here, is a great disgrace. I oppose the motion and certainly I shall vote against it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All I am suggesting is that the honourable senator's responsibility on the Standing Orders Committee, especially as he is an Opposition member of the Standing Orders Committee, is far greater than I thought it was previously; and I thought it was a fairly heavy responsibility. Let me now look at petitions. We are now going again to shorten the program, for our convenience, because we are not prepared to listen to petitions being read. There are two ways in which petitions are presented in this place. An honourable senator makes a decision as to whether a petition will be read. He or she makes a decision as to whether it will be given to the Clerk. At that point he or she makes his or her own determination. That facility is there. But no matter how we feel about time and no matter how boring some people may think it is, why should we withdraw from a group of people the right on a broadcast day to have a petition read-not a summary, but the petition. Petitioners are entitled to that right. It is an ancient right, as an honourable senator said. But whether or not it is ancient, it is a worthwhile right.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is another matter we would need to take a look at because, depending on the nature of a petition, it is possible for an honourable senator in this place to refer that petition to a standing committee-it has been done-or to take some other action, depending upon the importance of the petition. A number of people-it may be 20, 30,300 or 500-decide that a petition shall be presented by their senator. The honourable senator says that the best time to present that petition is on broadcast day, a Wednesday. As it happens, that is the day on which an honourable senator generally asks for a petition to be read. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said that on broadcast day in this place at about 2 o'clock or 3 o' clock in the afternoon-the exact time escapes me at the moment-there may be 5, 000 or 6,000 people throughout Australia, which is not many people, listening to the broadcast either by accident or by intent. Many people are politically attuned and do listen to the broadcast. Out of a total of 14 million people, 5, 000 or 6,000 is not very many. Nevertheless, 5,000 or 6,000 people do listen; I think the ratings show that. That is 5,000 or 6,000 people to whom that petition is read. Very few of us can at any time gather together an audience of that size to which to put a point of view, and our petitioners at present have that right. What do we want to do? For our convenience now we are going to have a summary read. We already have, in part, a summary. If an honourable senator determines that he or she has already presented a petition on a number of occasions, he or she says: 'I do not want the petition read. I want the Clerk to deal with the matter'. That is a decision that can be made, and surely that is sufficient. It worries me that the Standing Orders Commitee, for expedient reasons--</PARA>

One cannot stand in a public place in Queensland and gather a petition. It is against the law to do so and one can be arrested for so doing. People have been arrested for trying to gather petitions. That is a serious limitation of the right to petition the Parliment and the Crown. Furthermore, a group of people are not able to present a petition to the Parliament in Queensland. They face arrest if they do because they are in breach of the traffic regulations. The traffic regulations in Queensland are now superior to and take precedence over the rights of people to petition.

Again, it is a matter of choice by the honourabe senator as to what happens to the petition-whether it is read or is part of a summary.

In essence, it provides that there be a summary of the contents of a petition read by the Clerk; but it further provides, as Senator Georges acknowledged in his answer to Senator Grimes, who put a telling argument by way of interjection, that the President adopt the practice of sending petitions to the relevant standing committees, for example. Where Senator Georges's and Senator Mason's arguments fall down is that it is not sufficient to assert that it is an ancient right to make it necessary for that practice to be continued. Senator Georges said it is the right of every citizen to hear his petition read.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with Senator Bonner's views after I have dealt with those of Senator Georges, if he does not mind. That is a point which Senator Georges seems to regard as very important. He is concerned not about the hundreds of thousands of people who sign petitions but about the 2,000-odd people who listen to the proceedings of this chamber on broadcast day. Perchance some of them may have signed a petition and had the opportunity of hearing it read, which would produce a state of great elation, no doubt, in the petitioners . That, if I might say so, is a great exaggeration of the factual situation and an extraordinary proposition because they as petitioners have rights which ought to be accorded to them on Tuesdays as well as Wednesdays. In essence, the proposal of the Standing Orders Committee seeks to make this Parliament more relevant. The package of matters we have dealt with today are directed towards that point: Involving honourable senators such as Senator Georges in debates much more frequently than they have been in the last few years and giving every honourable senator a right to contribute as much as possible to a debate by limiting the time for which some of us speak in order that others may contribute . Limiting the time to speak at the first reading stage of money Bills will enable as many honourable senators as possible to make precise, to-the-point contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I might venture a view, all that the reading of petitions involves by way of community participation is the actual honourable senator doing his thespian stunt of reading the petition on the day in question. That is all the process adds to the relevance and dignity of this Parliament-a bit of reading by honourable senators-and we are not all former Australian Broadcasting Commission employees, such as Senator Mason, who reads them well. What is important, of course, about the collecting of petitions in this community, if we are frank and honest, is the involvement of members of the public in being concerned about an issue confronting this Parliament and discussing it with their neighbours, workmates and colleagues and getting them involved to the point at which they read a petition and say: 'I am concerned about that, too. I will sign it'. That is the important community process. Those people ought to know that when the petition comes to this chamber something relevant is done with it, not just having it read out and put in the dustbin of history, because that is what Senator Georges is arguing for. </PARA>

The Standing Orders Committee has suggested a much more relevant way of dealing with petitions: Firstly, seeing that they are not read in great detail over the air because, whether we like it or not, that stuff does not make good ratings for the Parliament, and, secondly, seeing that contents of the petition are drawn to the public by a summary read by the Clerk and then referred to the relevant standing committee for consideration.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I speak briefly on a matter of interest to the local Manly-Warringah community in Sydney. I bring to the attention of the Senate the fact that a local newspaper, the Manly Daily that circulates throughout the Manly-Warringah district-the district incidentally in which I live-has been judged for the second consecutive year the best suburban newspaper in New South Wales. The Manly Daily is delivered daily to more than 73 ,000 homes in the Manly-Warringah area except on Sundays and Mondays. It is estimated that it is read by more than 150,000 people each day when it is delivered. I believe it is certainly read more widely in the Manly-Warringah district than are the metropolitan dailies. The paper is delivered free of charge with advertising rates being its major source of revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is very important because an increasing number of pensioners in the district cannot afford to buy the daily papers and get their news from the free throwaway paper. The Manly Daily is dedicated to publishing purely local news keeping Manly-Warringah residents up to date with local government issues, activities of local politicians and local events. I believe that the paper is a strong unifying force in the community. It takes part in community affairs and charity events on a regular basis. As far as the sporting news is concerned, it is first class and regularly has more up to date information than the metropolitan dailies especially in regard to those local teams that represent the district and the composition of those teams. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not always agreed with the editorial policy of the paper. In fact, during the last Federal election I violently disagreed with its editorial policy . But I must point out that at any time I have written letters to the editor about any complaints that I have had they have always been published. I think the coverage of political events in the district is fair and accurate. I am sure that my State colleagues, Tom Webster, the honourable member for Wakehurst, and Alan Stewart, the honourable member for Manly, would agree with me. I also strongly agreed with the campaign that the newspaper ran against the tax on information-the sales tax that this Government proposed to put on newspapers that this Senate rejected. The legislation would have adversely affected the newspaper. I am certainly glad that we were able to defeat the Government's proposal. I just wish to place on the record tonight my congratulations to the paper for winning the best suburban newspaper award for the second consecutive year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a matter which not only concerns the quite appalling treatment of an individual but also raises an important issue of principle about the administration of government employment. This is the background to the matter: In February 1981, Press reports appeared to the effect that the Australian Federal Police were investigating criminal records and making other so-called character checks on officers of the Attorney-General's Department. On 24 February last year, I asked the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) in the Senate whether and by what authority such checks were being carried out and what the fate would be of any member of his Department who refused to consent to such a check being made. On 26 March 1981, the Attorney supplemented his original rather brief oral answer with a written answer. I seek leave to have that detailed answer incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator Durack</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 February 1981 (Hansard, page 12) Senator Evans asked me the following questions without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Is it the case that character assessments are presently taking place in the Attorney-General's Department whereby all employees, including those who have no access to classified government documents, are being checked for such apparently irrelevant or ill-defined characteristics as 'undeclared homosexuality' or a ' loose tongue'? By what authority, legislative or administrative, are these checks being carried out? Are they being carried out or will they be carried out by any other department? If such action is not directly connected with the protection of highly sensitive classified material, what is the policy underlying such checks?</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Having agreed to further investigations, will the Attorney do two things: Firstly, undertake to table in Parliament forms that persons are being required to fill in and also any supporting documentation governing the procedures now applicable and, secondly, will he tell us what the fate of any member of his Department who refused to give consent to this procedure would be in practice?</PARA>
<PARA> The answers to the honourable senator's questions are:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) For the purpose of this answer officers in my Department and throughout the rest of the Public Service may be put into two categories. </PARA>
<PARA> The first category consists of officers who have or may have access to classified material. In respect of these officers, my Department obtains a security assessment from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. This clearance is obtained in accordance with the new security procedures adopted following the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act 1979. In addition, after receiving the consent of the officer, my Department obtains from the Australian Federal Police details of any criminal charges involving the officer pending before a Court together with details of any conviction of finding of guilt which has been recorded against him. Alternatively, the officer is permitted to obtain a certificate as to those matters from the Police Force of each State or Territory in which he resided in the past five years. These procedures are, I understand, followed by all Departments. </PARA>
<PARA> The second category consists of officers who do not generally have access to classified information. The Department does not obtain a category assessment in respect of these officers. However, before a person is appointed to the Public Service, my Department, with the consent of the person concerned, obtains details of any criminal charges pending before a Court together with details of any conviction or finding of guilt recorded against him. Alternatively, the person may obtain a certificate in relation to those matters from the appropriate Police Force. I understand this is the practice followed in all Departments for officers in this category. </PARA>
<PARA> For a short period recently, my Department commenced to apply the procedure used on appointment of the second category of officers to all serving officers. The purpose of this was to provide maximum flexibility in the future deployment of staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The Permanent Head has now concluded that this procedure will not be generally applied to serving officers who are in the second category but may be applied in the case of promotion or transfer of officers to positions of special trust within the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Copies of the forms that persons have been asked to fill in are attached.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of an officer in the first category, a person declining to fill in the necessary forms may be regarded as ineligible for promotion or appointment to the position. If the person is already occupying the position, consideration would need to be given to whether he should be transferred to a position not involving such access. </PARA>
<PARA> In the second category, a person refusing to consent to the AFP providing the statement or to provide the certificate from the relevant Police Force mentioned above might be regarded as ineligible for appointment. As explained above, in relation to serving officers, the question will arise in the future only in relation to positions of special trust. A refusal to follow the procedure mentioned may result in ineligibility for promotion or transfer to such a position. </PARA>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I will briefly summarise that answer since it is highly pertinent to the case I am going to describe. The Attorney-General said that for these purposes public servants could be divided into two catergories. Category one consists of those officers who have access, or may have access, to classified material. An Australian Security Intelligence Organisation security assessment is made of these officers and, with their consent, details of their criminal records obtained. Category two consists of those officers who do not generally have access to classified information. In this category a security assessment is not obtained. But, before appointment and with the consent of the person concerned, details of criminal records are obtained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Attorney-General went on to give the following answer in relation to a refusal to give consent to the obtaining of a criminal record:</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of an officer in the first category, a person declining to fill in the necessary forms may be regarded as ineligible for promotion or appointment to the position. If the person is already occupying the position, consideration would need to be given to whether he should be transferred to a position not involving such access. </PARA>
<PARA>In respect of persons in the second category-that is, where there is no access to classified information-the Attorney continued:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . a person refusing to consent to the AFP providing the statement or to provide the certificate from the relevant Police Force mentioned above might be regarded as ineligible for appointment . . . in relation to serving officers, the question will arise in the future only in relation to positions of special trust. A refusal to follow the procedure mentioned may result in ineligibility for promotion or transfer to such a position. </PARA>
<PARA>In a moment I shall have some remarks to make about the inappropriateness of any question of access to criminal records of persons applying for positions which have no security sensitivity. Right now I just want to proceed to outline a particular case which appears to have been conducted in direct contravention of these guidelines set out by the Attorney-general. </PARA>
<PARA> The officer in question, whom I will not name for reasons which will become obvious although I know her name, is employed in the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Sydney. She commenced employment there in July 1979 as a legal officer . She was employed as a temporary employee under the Public Service Act and still retains that status. She is a temporary employee nearly three years later. Her work in the DCS Office throughout has been in common law litigation. At first her work concerned bankruptcy and, since August 1981, she has been in a section dealing with negligence actions against the Commonwealth, mostly involving personal injury claims. None of this work is remotely security sensitive by any criterion, and certainly it does not involve the officer in question in access to classified information. Without doubt she is an officer in the second of the two categories identified by the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA> Late last year, the officer in question applied for permanent employment in the usual way. Following a series of interviews, she was recommended for permanency. I should point out that, while her employment status was to change, she was to continue to do precisely the same work as before. She was duly sent an application for permanent employment together with a request that she sign a consent form authorising the Federal Police to provide to the Attorney-General's Department details of any criminal charge pending against her and of any conviction recorded against her. At this stage, I seek leave to incorporate again in Hansard the form in which this request was made. I have drawn it to the attention of the Attorney-General and he has indicated no opposition. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I should point out that before admission as a solicitor of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, which event occurred more or less contemporaneously with her appointment to the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in the Public Service of the Commonwealth, this person had been required to swear an affidavit in relation to any convictions she might have had. Her affidavit attested to the fact that she had none. It is my belief-as I will make clear; I do not perceive this to be relevant to the force of the case-that there is no question of any convictions ever having been recorded against her or any such action having been pending. But, as I say, that is my belief and that is only marginal to the point that I want to make. Understandably enough, she refused, as I understand virtually all the serving officers in the Department had themselves refused, as a matter of principle, in February 1981, to sign this consent form. She regarded it as an unjustifiable invasion of her privacy and one that bore no possible relationship to the nature of her employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Furthermore she was, although a temporary officer, an officer of some years standing within the Department. She took the view that that fact ought to be taken into account. An element of humiliation was involved in seeking consent to the search in question. According to the Attorney-General's guidelines, which I described at the outset, refusal to give consent should only affect a serving officer in a case of promotion or transfer to a position of special trust, which this case clearly was not. Yet, following her refusal to give consent, the Attorney-General's Department notified her on 14 April-just a couple of weeks ago-that unless she signed the consent form she would not be accepted for permanent employment and furthermore that her temporary employment would cease on 30 April 1982, this coming Friday. That is, not only is she being, I believe, unfairly prevented from upgrading her employment status following a favourable recommendation by the relevant selection committee but also she is about to be sacked for her refusal to consent to what I regard as an obnoxious procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to register the strongest protest at this conduct which I can only perceive to be vindictive conduct by the Department. I believe it is an affront to anyone who is concerned about civil liberties, to anyone committed to enlightened employment practices and to anyone who believes in elementary standards of fairness. This threat of dismissal is nothing short of bullying by a department which is determined to get its own way against someone who does not even have the appeal rights of a permanent public servant. The Department's action is justified neither-I put this very strongly-on the merits of the case as I perceive them and which, I believe, speak clearly for themselves nor by reference to the Government's guidelines in relation to serving officers in which category she clearly falls, albeit as a temporary officer. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer again to the guidelines described by the Attorney-General in his written answer to me of 26 March 1981. I call on the Attorney-General, who I wish were here in the chamber since I gave him notice that I would be raising this matter, to take immediate action to revoke the dismissal notice and to ensure that the recommendation for permanent employment is speedily confirmed without any further absurd requirement to consent to scrutiny of the kind that is proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I will simply comment more generally for just a moment on the fact that there is no apparent reason why the Commonwealth, as an employer, should be in any different position from a private employer in matters of this kind when it comes to obtaining information about the criminal records, if such exist, of applicants for employment. I had occasion recently to investigate this question in the context of the Victorian Police Force and I was impressed, I must confess , to discover just how stringently the Victorian Police Force appears to control employer access to criminal records. The only employers who can get access to such records are those who are engaged in genuinely security-sensitive business such as drug manufacture, security and surveillance services and who apply to the Police Commissioner for authorisation and obtain the written consent of the applicant in question. </PARA>
<PARA> Other employers in Victoria have no access whatsoever to criminal records however much they might like to have such access and they are prohibited from making it a condition of employment that an applicant give the consent in question. I assert that the same principles should apply to the Commonwealth and that outside that sector of Commonwealth employment which is genuinely security sensitive-using the Attorney-General's category 1 description-it seems to me quite insidious that there be any requirement to consent to access to records. I believe that this practice should be immediately abolished, as a general matter, quite apart from the particular case of what appears to be clear injustice being resolved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to a situation in which a reputedly distinguished Australian became very much less of a renowned figure when he misjudged the appropriateness of the occasion and the response from the audience as to the form and content of his address. The setting for this loss or reduction in reputation was at the graduation ceremony of the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education last Saturday night when Robert John Hawke abused the privilege which was granted to him in presenting a sound, reasoned, researched and academic address on a matter of substance. If Bob Hawke could do no more than present a closely read speech, a monotonous monologue of partisan attack on unemployment which could be heard on almost any day of the week in Parliament, I think this great Rhodes scholar has indeed suffered great deterioration of mind since his heyday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Lest this be regarded as an uncharitable approach let me assert that surely those who have been building up this image around him have found that he is incapable of sustaining that image during the 1980s. A possible explanation of this unusual behaviour must surely be the cavalier attitude of Mr Hawke to the feelings of others, particularly the graduates and their families. The approach was discourteous, not only to the chairman but also to the principal, the graduates, their families and the many guests. It was an unfortunate occasion but I think Mr Hawke used the occasion knowing full well that there will be a State election in Tasmania where the issue of spending limits has been critical to both parties and candidates. Therefore, candidates and parties use every possible device that they are capable of putting forward in order to reach a very wide audience. I believe if this was the tactic it was despicable to use this occasion to this end. Mr Hawke spoke for approximately 40 minutes to an increasingly--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He spoke for forty minutes to an increasingly restive audience. In fact, a number of people left. The figure has been put at about 50. At last a speech and drama student got up and said: 'We have spent four years leading up to this night. I think it is our night and not yours'. The applause that that young student got was thunderous and most appropriate to the occasion. Never have I seen a speaker so cut short in his remarks; he was certainly cut to the quick. Almost to a man I think that audience acknowledged the sensitivity and correctness of that girl's remarks. I think it was unfortunate that Mr Hawke used this occasion to deliver what one must say was a most inappropriate address . He took unfair advantage of what would have been a captive audience. After four years of grinding study there were people present who felt that this was not the occasion to deliver what I call a monotonous monologue on matters relating to unemployment, inflation and industrial relations. The address was far removed from what the occasion required. I think this is the essential point to bear in mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was a sad day for the College which is trying to establish itself as an identity in the community. The setting was grand. For the first time the magnificant Albert Hall was used. Over 1,100 people were there. I think it was regrettable that after four years some of the students went away from that hall and wept because they were so disappointed. Other citizens came to that hall expecting to hear an oration from a person who is supposedly one of Australia's greatest debaters. Unfortunately, their great expectations were not realised. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly would like to see Mr Hawke make an apology to the College and to the citizens of Launceston for the inappropriateness of his remarks on the occasion and for the manner in which he delivered the address. It was also unfortunate that he took so little interest in the students receiving their awards that night. It was not only his remarks that were unfortunate but also his lack of interest in those students who passed by him to receive their awards . Because of that I would ask that he restore some dignity to the occasion by making a public apology. Lest any honourable senators believe that my remarks are inappropriate or inaccurate I ask leave to have incorporated in Hansard the Mercury newspaper report of 26 April 1982 headed: 'Hawke jeered at ceremony'. </PARA>

<PARA>Hawke jeered at ceremony</PARA>
<PARA> Federal ALP front-bencher, Mr Hawke, was interrupted and jeered by students as he addressed the 1982 graduation ceremony of the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education at Launceston on Saturday. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hawke, the guest speaker at the ceremony, had spoken for about 25 minutes on unemployment and alternative Government policy when he was interrupted. </PARA>
<PARA> A student stood and said to Mr Hawke, 'We have spent four years leading up to this evening. I think it is our night not yours'. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the 200 graduating students supported this with applause and jeering.</PARA>
<PARA> In reply Mr Hawke, the Labor spokesman on youth affairs, employment and industrial relations, put away his prepared speech and said he had tried to make a contribution that he thought would deal with the future that the graduating class faced. </PARA>
<PARA> He said he realised some of the students may have thought he was using the time to put across one point of view but said the issue of unemployment 'transcends Labor and Liberal party policy'. </PARA>
<PARA> He said it was something that happened in society that could not be blamed solely on Government. </PARA>
<PARA> After Mr Hawke's speech, the chairman of the council, Mr E. A. Rouse, said Mr Hawke 'spoke to us with a great deal of sincerity and depth of feeling on a subject that affects us all'. </PARA>
<PARA> In Mr Hawke's speech he had urged the Government to concentrate on unemployment first and inflation second. He said 'the commitment to a goal of full employment had disappeared from the political arena during the 1970's. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Government policy in Australia and other countries has become obsessed with controlling inflation'. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hawke's alternatives included creating a 'more expansive fiscal policy', a ' modest increase in the public sector', taxation changes and a development of works programs in local communities. </PARA>
<PARA> He said fighting inflation before unemployment had failed and it was time to tackle unemployment first as had been done successfully in Sweden, Austria and Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> At the ceremony, attended by more than 1,100 people, more than 200 graduates received their masters and bachelor degrees and diplomas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I feel obliged to respond to the remarks of Senator Watson and to make one or two points that may be relevant. Until I heard Senator Watson speak I was not aware of the incident that occurred. It seems to me that someone was remiss in not having in some way set the program for that evening. Although there was a keynote speaker it is usual on these occasions that the keynote speaker is told that he has 20 minutes to speak. Whenever I chair any conference, function or seminar that is fairly clearly indicated well beforehand to the person concerned. It seems to me that someone failed to indicate that on such an occasion this would be the requirement. Nevertheless, I would need to read what Bob Hawke did say. What he has expressed to groups of students on previous occasions was his concern that having gone through long periods of study and having achieved their qualifications the employment environment is such that their expectations are considerably limited.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would suggest that the honourable senator should take a look at who was the chairperson on that occasion and find out just exactly why it was not made clear that such an amount of time was available. Perhaps Bob Hawke did misjudge. I think that if he did misjudge sufficient criticism emerged on the night and in the Press to satisfy even Senator Watson, but he brought this matter into the Senate. In other words, he wishes to rub it in. If Bob Hawke was in error he wishes to push Bob Hawke further down. I can say only that on the occasions when Bob Hawke has prepared material he has prepared it with preciseness. He has prepared it with care. In fact, looking from my point of view, he has been far too academic. But he has been academic because he believed the propositions he was putting were important. Perhaps he mistook the situation and made this a forum to present that point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to take a look at that speech he made. I think it would have been relevant to the position in which most of those students would have found themselves, having achieved their qualifications. My view of it is that throughout Australia there is now an extreme difficulty on the part of graduates to find employment. Many youngsters find themselves unemployed for long periods. Many government schemes-the National Employment and Training System and other employer-supported schemes-try to assist at the level of pre-tertiary education. But once the youngsters have gone through tertiary education and got their qualifications they are, in fact, in a very serious position in relation to employment. </PARA>

I have a son who did a master's degree in zoology. He took a year off in order to find employment. The only two jobs he found in that 12 months were, firstly, loading Coca-Cola crates on a truck and, secondly, working at a drive- in bottle shop in a hotel. He was forced to go back to university and do a doctor of philosophy degree. We all know exactly the trauma, the poverty and the actual despair that most doctor of philosophy students go through in four or five years. He is now waiting for his assessment which he is told will take a minimum of six months. It might even take 12 months. He has no employment prospects whatsoever and he is not the only one. Many others in his stream are so placed. If Bob Hawke spent time on putting forward this case he put it forward with a considerable amount of justice. Politicians have a problem. I have spoken for five minutes now. I suppose, possibly, if I get wound up I will go for longer. If I had a captive audience I would be tempted to go for longer.

Sometimes I feel that he has lost me but I am easily lost in these matters and I need to come back and ask for much more simple explanations of the problems. But honourable senators cannot deny that Bob Hawke was invited because he was a person of standing. Being a person of standing he should have been allowed a certain amount of time to present a case. If he over-presented that case I would say that somebody did not properly advise him and I would take a look at the people who organised that ceremony. I doubt whether they will fall into the same trap next time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us put the credit side as far as Bob Hawke is concerned. He has been responsible for a substantial number of achievements in both an academic way and an industrial way. He is now in the political area and, possibly, that is to his disadvantage because once a member has been in this place too long he becomes loquacious and submerged in trivia. He possibly does not understand that he must get out of the rarified atmospheres in which he has worked for so long and get back to giving a few odd platitudes at an opening or presentation. But I do not think he is that sort of person. I do not think he should make a few odd remarks , smile, sit down and say, 'Have a good year and congratulations on getting your diplomas' et cetera. He is much too serious a person for that. If that is what the College of Advanced Education wanted it should have invited me, but if it wanted something more substantial it did the right thing by inviting Bob Hawke. If he overextended his welcome that is perhaps unfortunate. But I think he is now aware of it and he certainly will not make the same mistake twice. </PARA>

I think every one of us is fully aware of the fact that on such occasions there are ways in which we can discuss a subject without making it quite so obvious that we are grinding a party political axe.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This was a graduation ceremony, not a seminar as Senator Georges suggested. It may have been far more appropriate if it had been a seminar. But it was a ceremony at an excellent and relatively young college attended by a group of young students all of whom were trying very hard to develop a standard of excellence. I have been to a great number of graduation ceremonies around Australia and this was one of the best that I have ever been to. As Senator Watson said, the hall was excellent. When I heard that Bob Hawke had been invited as the guest speaker I had no thoughts that his address would be other than an excellent and appropriate one. Senator Archer agrees that it was a most unfortunate occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish very briefly to describe a part to which Senator Watson referred and to join him in the request that he made. What happened was that after some 40 minutes or more Mr Hawke, seeing that people had been leaving the large hall for quite some time and that there was restlessness, made some reference along these lines: 'If you will bear with me a little longer . . .'. From what one could judge, quite a few pages of the notes from which he was reading remained. It was at that stage that a young, and I think fairly brave, graduate stood up and made the remark to which Senator Watson has referred. She said that the students had worked for four years for that night and that it was their night and not Mr Hawke's. The situation was further compounded when Mr Hawke endeavoured to continue to read parts of the speech and for a second time said: 'If you will give me another two or three minutes . . .'. Nobody objected to that although there was a little murmuring in the hall. The next time he said: 'If I can just have another two or three minutes . . .' the response from the hall was quite strong, to the effect: 'No, sit down and shut up. You have already had too long' . </PARA>
<PARA> It was a most unfortunate event. I feel particularly sorry about the embarrassment to the college, to the principal, to the council and particularly to the graduates. I believe that it was a very public occasion. Mr Hawke had obviously intended it to be a political occasion, because he had distributed copies of his speech, or a summary of it, to the media in advance for the purpose of publication in the Sunday Press in Melbourne and Sydney- all over Australia. Such reports would not emanate from some reporter who was at the ceremony that night. Rather, it was used as a political occasion which would lead to headlines such as 'One million unemployed in Australia, Hawke says'. This was obviously an intentional act of using the invitation given to Mr Hawke by this college for a party political exercise, for distributing around Australia a speech which was intended to be, and was, an attack on a party political basis putting forward alternative policy points of view. Some of us may agree that unemployment is greater than it appears from the statistics and that other points in what Mr Hawke had to say may have been valid. But it was the way in which his views were expressed, as a party political axe grinding exercise, which offended so many of the people, including many Labor supporters, who were in the hall that night. It was the most incredible display of insensitivity and rudeness. I believe that all those concerned deserve an apology from Mr Hawke. I join Senator Watson in asking whether Mr Hawke will make such an apology. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Over recent years the meat processing industry had been undergoing structural change as a result of over-capacity, fragmentation and intense competition. Many abattoirs are operating at less than 50 per cent of capacity and a large number have been closed.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) During this period of change over the past five years, the Government has considered thirteen proposals for foreign investment in the meat processing industry (excluding poultry, fish and smallgoods). If all the proposals considered had been implemented, the resulting increase in foreign ownership in the industry would have involved total assets of about $55m.</PARA>
<PARA> A number of proposals entailed acquisitions of only a small percentage of the shareholding of the target company and in several cases the effective increase in foreign ownership was only marginal. Furthermore, not all of the proposals eventuated.</PARA>
<PARA> Three of the proposals have been of significance to the industry. The first was the acquisition by Amatil Ltd of the whole of the issued capital in T. A. Field Holdings Ltd in 1977 for a consideration of $12.8m. Field was reported as being the fourth largest New South Wales meat processor at the time of the acquisition , the second largest retailer of meat in New South Wales and a significant exporter. Amatil has since become a naturalised company in terms of the Government's foreign investment policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The second proposal of importance was the acquisition in 1978 by Waitaki NZ Refrigerating Ltd of New Zealand of just over twenty per cent of the enlarged issued capital in F. J. Walker Ltd. Walker holds a substantial position in the Australian meat industry. The proposal was expected to lead to benefits primarily through the combined exporting strength of the two companies.</PARA>
<PARA> The most recent proposal which was approved in March 1982, involves a merger of the pig and processed meat activities of F. J. Walker Ltd with Canada Packers ( Australia) Pty Ltd. This proposal will not involve any net loss of Australian ownership and the merged business will be jointly Australian/ Canadian controlled. There will be national economic benefits through industry rationalisation and increased efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA> The radical changes occurring in the industry over a number of years makes estimation of the level of foreign ownership and control difficult since closures of some abattoirs will seriously affect the figures. Further, the $55m increase in foreign ownership referred to above needs to be seen in perspective having regard to the fact that in 1979-80 turnover in establishments in the industry exceeded $3.3 billion while value added during the period was around $ 776m. In short, there has not been a substantial increase in foreign investment in the industry in recent years and the investment that has been permitted has been designed to help the industry in the difficult situation confronting it.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) A substantial number of meatworks in Australia compete with each other in the purchase of livestock for processing. Also, there are over 100,000 livestock holdings freely selling their stock for slaughter in a competitive marketing system. The relatively small number of cases in recent years in which foreign investment has increased in meatworks or rural properties would not have provided a capacity for the foreign owners to control the market in their own interest.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) I refer the honourable senator to my reply to parts (3) and (4) of his earlier Question No. 725: 'Variations in staff numbers in the Taxation Office can be expected to have some effect on the amount of taxation revenue that can be collected but it is impossible to say how great this effect is likely to be without setting up an arbitrary reference point for some ''optimum' ' number of staff.</PARA>
<PARA> No Government has ever adopted a policy of expanding the number of staff in the Taxation Office (or any other revenue collecting agency) to the point where every dollar of revenue capable of being collected each year is collected. At the same time it does not make good sense to cut staff to the point where substantial revenue is forgone.</PARA>
<PARA> I can mention in this context that, in order to avoid this situation, I have authorised the Commissioner to discuss, in the context of the Government's general policy of staff restraints, the adequacy and implications of his provisional staff ceiling for 1981-82 with the Public Service Board in the first instance.'</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner's discussions with the Board led to a request for a review of the provisional staff ceiling for 1981-82 being referred to the Ministerial Committee having responsibility for such reviews.

<PARA> Why was it necessary to purchase a house for $140,000 to accommodate a senior defence officer of the Army?</PARA>
<PARA> Are there any adjacent military establishments which would require the purchase of a house in this prime location?</PARA>
<PARA> What is the normal cost of building a house to defence standards on government land for senior officers?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The house was acquired by the Department of Defence for use by a senior Navy officer appointed to any one of the several naval establishments in the vicinity of Sydney Harbour. There is an acute shortage of housing which is reasonably close to such establishments, and which meets the standards appropriate for senior Service officers.</PARA>
<PARA> The house was transferred to the Department of Defence from a Commonwealth authority which previously owned it (the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation). The transfer followed procedures which normally apply in such situations: after notification that the Corporation no longer required the house, the Department of Administrative Services asked other Commonwealth departments if they had a need for it, before considering its disposal. Thus, although the house was transferred to the Department of Defence at its taxation valuation ($140,000), the acquisition involved no additional outlay by the Commonwealth, in real terms.</PARA>
<PARA> The current cost of building a house to standards appropriate for senior officers is around $54,000. To this would be added the cost of land, which would vary with the location.</PARA>

<PARA> Did the annual report of the Commissioner of Taxation released on 29 October show that at the end of the last finanial year $973m, accumulated in tax avoidance schemes and challenged by the Department, remained uncollected? Is this $200m more than the avoidance figure reported a year earlier and $550m higher than the avoidance figure of two years ago? Does the $973m accumulated in 1980-81 remain uncollected because of a shortage of personnel due to staff ceilings, or is there some other reason relating to government legislation why that figure is so rapidly accumulating?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In reply to your question of 12 November 1981 regarding tax avoidance I indicated that I would ascertain the latest position in respect of the staffing levels of the Australian Taxation Office and whether the uncollected tax attributable to tax avoidance is accumulating because of staff shortages or for some other reason.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation has reported to the Parliament on more than one occasion that his operations have been affected by the limited numbers of appropriately qualified and experienced officers available within earlier staff ceiling limitations. However, I am now able to advise that the staff ceiling of the Australian Taxation Office has recently been increased by 324. This should materially assist the Commissioner's efforts to maximise the level of compliance with the taxation laws by all sections of the community.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the amount of $973m reported as uncollected at 30 June 1981, I would point out that a substantial part of this total relates to large numbers of schemes cases awaiting decisions on similar cases which have been referred to the courts and boards of review for hearing.</PARA>

<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The report prepared by the Commercial Bank of Australia (CBA), which was published in the CBA's 'Economic Review, September 1980', did not endorse the estimate of the size of the underground economy (10 per cent of Gross Domestic Product) which was prepared by the Monash Centre of Policy Studies; it preceded it and did not mention any other Australian work in this field.</PARA>
<PARA> The CBA report included an estimate of the size of the underground economy which was obtained by applying an approach used by Professor Gutmann for the United States. However, such estimates are inherently unreliable; moreover, Gutmann's approach is based on a number of very dubious assumptions. The authors of the CBA report clearly indicated that they were conscious of the limitations of their estimates of the size of the underground economy. Indeed, they said '. . . we do not wish to argue whether this is a correct assessment or not'.</PARA>
<PARA> The statistician has not attempted to estimate the 'underground economy'. Any attempt to do so would suffer from lack of reliable data on which to base such an estimate. It should also be noted that because some components of estimates of national income are based on data that would not be affected by under- statement in income tax returns, at least some of the 'underground economy' is included within estimates of gross domestic product.</PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding these uncertainties, the Government tries to minimise, as far as possible, the effects of the 'underground economy' on the collection of income tax and other revenue of the Commonwealth.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 February 1982 (Hansard, page 391) Senator Townley asked the Minister representing the Treasurer, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Has the Government, in the interests of assisting incentive and an attempt to stop some tax avoidance, considered limiting the tax on overtime earnings to a rate equal to that applicable to the top of the employee's base salary.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In these times of high interest will the Government once again consider asking the Australian Taxation Office to investigate the practicability of paying interest on money retained by that office and subsequently refunded to a taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Government has considered and rejected limiting income tax on overtime earnings. The major difficulty with such an arrangement would be that the limitation could not, in practice, be confined to overtime payments. For example, wage earners who obtain promotion or who take on additional employment to increase their income, and businessmen who work additional hours for the same reason, would be regarded as equally deserving of the limited rate of tax on their increased income.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to causing a loss of revenue, a general limitation of the rates of tax on all additional income would involve complex legislative and administrative arrangements. It would result in different tax being paid by people with the same earnings and hours worked but who had different basic salaries or normal hours of duty. It could also promote tax avoidance where the taxpayer was able to arrange to have a greater proportion of his earnings paid in a form that would qualify for the lower rate.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The question of the payment of interest on end of year excess tax instalment deductions due for refund to taxpayers has been considered and rejected by the Government on a number of previous occasions. In considering the question, regard has been had, among other things, to the views expressed by the Taxation Review Committee under Mr Justice Asprey in 1975 that it did not favour the idea of interest payments as the practice 'would be extremely expensive and might result in delays in making refunds to employee taxpayers'.</PARA>
<PARA> If the Government were to decide to pay interest in respect of refunds of tax overpaid, it would be difficult to confine the application of such a policy to that particular area. The proposal would need to be considered in the light that, if interest became payable on refunds issuing after a delay in the processing of an assessment, there would be pressure for the introduction of similar measures to provide for payment of interest in other circumstances, for example, where refunds result from a review of an assessment or from decisions in favour of taxpayers within the appeal system of the tax law. The extra costs , including administrative costs, which such an extension of the proposal would involve could well ultimately require an increase in taxes and this would tend to offset any benefit of interest payments made to individual taxpayers.</PARA>

<PARA> Can he say whether the Government has yet found a buyer for the Australian Government Publishing Service bookshops as recommended by the razor gang? Is it a fact that the books currently printed by the AGPS do not have a price printed on them as has previously been the case? Is the price now put on manually by the AGPS staff? Can the Minister say whether the new method of pricing the AGPS books allows commercial enterprises to sell the publications at a far higher price than would have been charged by the Australian Government bookshops?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> A number of expressions of interest have been made by individuals and commercial organisations for the leasing of the Australian Government Publishing Service Bookshops.</PARA>
<PARA> Tender documents are in the final stages of preparation and are expected to be issued in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA> It is correct that prices will not be printed on future AGPS books. However this decision is entirely unconnected with commercial leasing of the bookshops. It has been done to allow AGPS to operate in a more commercial fashion following recommendations by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Publications. Recommended retail prices applicable at particular times will continue to be published in AGPS catalogues.</PARA>
<PARA> The printing of prices on books has not prevented resellers from increasing them in the past, the new arrangements will therefore not change the situation.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of Time magazine's recent article on the health problems associated with excessive consumption of sodium, particularly as salt. This is one of many articles which have appeared in the print media on the relationship between excessive consumption of salt and prevalence of hypertension in Western countries, including Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) established a Working Party on Sodium in the Australian Diet which first met in March 1980 to consider the matter of salt intake and its relationship to the development of hypertension.</PARA>
<PARA> The Working Party has now finalised its report which, it is anticipated, will be considered by the Council at its June 1982 meeting. If approved by the Council, the report will be given wide circulation.</PARA>
<PARA> I should emphasise, however, that my Department has already taken action to alert the community to the dangers of excessive salt intake. My Department has drawn up a set of eight dietary Guidelines for Australia to improve the nutritional health of the community: One of these Guidelines is to reduce the consumption of salt.</PARA>
<PARA> A publication 'Dietary Guidelines for Australians'-which includes advice to the community to use less salt and gives practical suggestions as to how this can be done-should be available for wide distribution within the next few weeks .</PARA>
<PARA> The matter of the declaration of the specific percentage of salt and/or sodium on the labels of packaged foods, as suggested by the honourable senator, is presently under consideration by expert Committees of the NHMRC and, indeed, was considered by the Working Party on Sodium in the Australian Diet.</PARA>
<PARA> The NHMRC has already recommended that ingredients of packaged foods should be declared, in descending order of proportion, on the label. This recommendation includes the declaration of added salt and has been referred to the States and Territories for adoption. Recommendations emanating from the NHMRC are, primarily, matters for consideration by the individual States and Territories as regards their possible incorporation into legislation, and several States have already adopted the recommended provisions in their food regulations.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied me with the following additional information:</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator's question refers to the sale by the Australian Wheat Board of 1 million tonnes of wheat to the USSR for shipment in the period February to May 1982. The sale was announced by the Wheat Board in a press release of 4 February 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> The sale continues the regular Australian wheat trade with USSR which has been in existence for many years. It follows an earlier wheat sale of 1 million tonnes from the 1981-82 wheat crop and brings to 2 million tonnes the Board's total contract wheat sales for delivery to the USSR in 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> In line with normal practice the latest sale by the Wheat Board was made on full commercial terms. The period of credit was strictly short-term and the interest rate charges reflected market rates. The precise terms and conditions of Wheat Board sales are generally not made public as a matter of commercial prudence and often at the request of the buyer.</PARA>
<PARA> While the Soviet Union is normally a cash buyer of Australian wheat the decision to provide commercial short-term credit for the latest sale was taken on the basis of pure commercial consideration prevailing at the time and in no way represented an effort by Australia to assist the Soviet Union.</PARA>
