<PARA>To the Honourable The President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Great Barrier Reef is unique and is included on the World Heritage List.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Although the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act was to create a marine park to provide for the proper protection and management of The Reef, only 14% of the total area defined in this Act as the Great Barrier Reef Region has been declared marine park.</PARA>

<PARA> 4. This can only be effected by declaring the whole area of the Region a marine park under the above legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should request the Government to take action to hold a referendum together with the next Federal Elections on the question that: 'The entire area of the Great Barrier Reef and its surrounding waters, defined as the Great Barrier Reef Region in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975, as amended 1978, be immediately declared a marine park under the provisions of that Act.'</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations to a question from me on 16 February this year in which I asked him to outline the three main elements of the Government's wages policy- a question to which I have not yet received an answer. I ask: Can the Minister now explain how the proposed wages freeze fits in with the Government's wages policy as enunciated by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations? In particular, I ask: As it is the Government's proposal to impose a wages freeze and as the Government is responsible for wages policy, what does the Government propose to do about wages policy at the expiration of the period of the freeze?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had a request in similar terms yesterday. As I indicated, the very considerable difficulties that we face in the labour market in Australia today-the loss of employment and the growth in the number of people registering for employment-call for special measures. The Government has responded to the reality of what faces Australia. It is seeking co-operation from the State governments and, indeed, from the whole community in getting a wages pause which will do something to reduce the pressure on those businesses which are having to reduce their employment and which will do something to restore Australia's competitive position. I do not think many people in Australia need the sense of that proposition explained to them, even if the Leader of the Opposition does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was also questioned yesterday with respect to what will occur at the end of the freeze and questions were also addressed to Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. The point has been made by a number of Government spokesmen that it would not regard a catch-up in wages as being the correct thing to occur at the end of the freeze and the Government will pursue policies of wage moderation after the freeze for whatever period it is entered into.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether my colleague Senator Bonner was here yesterday when Senator Chipp asked a question which contained the elements of the question asked by him today. I understand it is a matter of concern to a number of honourable senators, but I believe the answer I gave to Senator Chipp yesterday covered the matters raised by Senator Bonner. In short, the application that was forwarded by Australia, which was considered earlier by the Bureau of the Heritage Committee, contained a large amount of information. We think there is sufficient information to allow the consideration of the listing to proceed. Extra information that has been sought is being finalised. Dr McMichael, the head of the Department of Home Affairs and Environment, has left for overseas to present the case for the listing and it is our belief that the extra information will be there in time to be considered when the listing is considered by the Heritage Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TITLE>FLINDERS BY-ELECTION</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA> Sentor CHIPP-I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services much the same question as has been asked by Senator Missen. I have just had delivered to me a photostat copy of an advertisement appearing in today's local newspaper in the Flinders electorate. This contains a copy of the alleged telegram sent by Peter Reith to the Acting Prime Minister. Underneath that telegram, after three big blots, appears:</PARA>
<PARA> Democrats. support 'No Dams'</PARA>
<PARA> Peter Reith. supports 'No Dams'</PARA>
<PARA> Democrats. support 'Peter Reith'</PARA>
<PARA>If one looks carefully at the advertisement it can be seen that there is a small fullstop after the word 'Democrats', the words 'Peter Reith' and the word ' Democrats' again. As this is typical of the sort of dirty, filthy, misleading tricks that are played at election time, will the Minister make urgent representations to the Minister for Administrative Services to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act so that misleading or untruthful advertising can be barred at election times and be made illegal for political parties to engage in, just as soap manufacturers or toilet paper manufacturers are precluded from issuing misleading or untruthful advertising?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not at all. I just have not seen the advertisement myself. I feel it should be referred as it is to the Minister for his attention directly. I think that, on the information provided by Senator Chipp, we need to observe one or two things. First of all, the advertisement refers to the support of the Australian Democrats for Peter Reith. All of us know that there is in this country the system of voting known as preferential voting. Therefore, there is concern that people who indicate preferences for individual candidates should do so in proper order of preference. For that reason, clearly the word 'support'-I am not giving any kerbside opinion-has a fairly wide interpretation within that system. Nevertheless, having said that, if Senator Chipp is prepared to supply a copy of the advertisement, I will refer it to the Minister for Administrative Services for review and to see whether anything further ought to be done.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Will we ever reach a point in Question Time when a Minister can give a straight answer to a simple question? I simply asked whether the Minister agreed that this was a misleading advertisement and whether he would agree to take the matter to the Minister for Administrative Services with a recommendation that the Commonwealth Electoral Act be amended to make it illegal for political parties or political candidates to enter into misleading or untruthful advertising. The fact is that the Australian Democrats 'how to vote' card has been distributed to letter boxes since last weekend. The card clearly shows that we have followed the past practice of not supporting either candidate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the Minister for Social Security to suggestions by the Opposition over a period that the Commonwealth Government is more interested in prosecuting persons who are in breach of the Social Services Act than offenders under the Income Tax Assessment Act. I ask the Minister merely to comment on that allegation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There were some allegations of the sort mentioned by the honourable senator. I must say that I found the allegations disturbing and had them checked. The fact of the matter is, of course, the exact reverse to the suggestions which were made. In fact, if one looks at the record of the Government with respect to prosecutions under the Income Tax Assessment Act as against the Social Services Act one will find that there is a very wide discrepancy in favour of prosecutions under the Income Tax Assessment Act. In one year 57,842 prosecutions were made under the Income Tax Assessment Act and in the same year 2,042 prosecutions were made under the social security legislation. Clearly, there is a massive imbalance in favour of the prosecuting of tax defaulters rather than social security defaulters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to the number of people involved on a per hundred basis, the figures are again illustrative of where the emphasis lies. We pay social security benefits and pensions to over 2.3 million Australians. If one looks at the number of prosecutions to clients one will find that there is one prosecution for every 1,126 clients receiving pensions and benefits. As far as taxpayers are concerned, there is one prosecution for every 103 taxpayers, so that it appears that there is about a one per cent chance of a taxpayer being prosecuted as things stand. There is no basis for the sort of statement which was made by Opposition representatives. I can only say that in both areas it is the concern of the Government that the law should be obeyed and that it should take suitable steps to make sure that that is the case.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The succinct answer to the honourable senators question is that the unemployment figures incorporated in the Budget were supplied by the authority of the Treasury; they were Treasury figures. Cabinet asked the Treasury to confirm those figures. So the basis of the Budget is Treasury figures. In no way at all can that be gainsaid. Since the rest of the question was directed to the Treasurer, I will refer it to him.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have recently been advised of the position by my Department and by the Snowy Mountains people and the position is of considerable interest to all Australians. The inflow to the Snowy-Murray development and Upper Tumut works for the period 1 May to 31 October was 594 gigalitres. This was the lowest inflow ever recorded. I repeat that this was the lowest inflow ever recorded. The previous lowest inflow was 620 gigalitres. As at 30 October of this year the storages of the Snowy scheme were at 33 per cent of total capacity. If the drought conditions continue and inflows remain at a low level Snowy storage could be below 15 per cent of capacity by 30 April next year. Release of notified entitlements of water has been requested and is essential for irrigation. The flexibility of the Snowy scheme in providing both water and electricity is likely to be limited over the coming months. If inflows less than the minimum recorded continue the situation will obviously become quite serious towards the end of next year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The Australian Government does not believe it would be appropriate to link the Australian Development Assistance Program to the human rights question in the Philippines.</PARA>
<PARA>Is the Minister aware that the Philippines Government takes quite the opposite view and sees a very real link between Australian aid projects and the suppression by the military of the just claims and dissent by the peasants and workers of North Samar? Is she aware of a speech given early in August by the Philippines Defence Minister, Mr Enrile, at a dinner in honour of the Australian Defence Minister, Mr Sinclair? The speech was reported on 3 August in a Hong Kong newspaper under the headline 'Australian Aid Helps Manila Subdue Rebels' and quotes Mr Enrile as saying that Australian development aid is helping the Government stamp out insurgency in rural areas of the Philippines. Will the Minister make available to the Senate a copy of the speeches made by both Defence Ministers at that dinner? Moreover, will this view of the Philippines Government's Defence Minister lead the Government, until clarification is obtained, to reconsider my plea that, certainly, direct military aid to the Philippines be suspended and ordinary civil aid be reconsidered?</PARA>

With what appears to be the development of an open trade war between the European Economic Community and the United States of America, together with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks finishing in a chaotic situation, what then is Australia's future, particularly in regard to markets for its primary products? In this free-for-all for markets, how does the Government see Australia's future trade, particularly with its neighbours in this region of the world? Is it a fact that the friction between nations is being fuelled by the world recession? Is this likely to bring about further collapse in trade arrangements between nations?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2965" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon Sir J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Acting Prime Minister, upon his return from the Geneva meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, expressed the dismay of the Government, and I think of all Australians, at the breakdown of discussions, the breakdown of consensus within the free world and the move towards putting further barriers around individual countries, particularly member countries of the European Economic Community. Therefore, as to Senator Kilgariff's question, there is no doubt that as a result trade prospects for Australian products are more uncertain than they have been for a long time. If a trade war does develop across a range of agricultural products, countries such as Australia and New Zealand could suffer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are also concerned about the real prospect of bilateralism-that is, country to country agreements-and we view with apprehension the results of private talks between the United States of America and the European Community which are scheduled to take place next week. This is the very antithesis of the freeing of world trade. It is important to keep in mind that jobs can be created only if we can have the ability to trade. We will undertake all possible actions to prevent moves towards bilateral agreements. Clearly, some countries are reluctant to adhere to GATT and are unwilling to resist their protectionist pressures. It is, therefore, difficult, even pointless, to continue discussions in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's basic trade objective is an open multilateral system for trade and payments. This is the only way to maintain prospects for economic growth. An inward looking economic situation would entail far too great a cost for Australia's standard of living. Australia has, over its history, depended on trade for its well being. It has depended upon its ability to move outwards into world markets to earn money to create the living standards of the Australian people. We have, therefore, pursued a policy with the rest of the world to overcome the kinds of disabilities that we have seen in the past, which have destroyed employment in various countries and which have brought in fact a worse recession to the world. So we regret very much the breakdown of trade. However, because Australia lives within the Pacific, and particularly within the western Pacific, it is inevitable that more of Australia's trade will turn to that region. To the extent that much of our trade moves that way now we are not so likely to be affected by the EEC decision.</PARA>

For example, at Macquarie University, of four lecturer positions recently created by the disestablishment of seven tutorial positions in the School of Behavioural Sciences, two of the four positions went to overseas applicants whereas the seven tutoring positions had been held by Australians. Is it a fact that there is no reciprocity for Australian graduates in the United Kingdom or the United States? Is it a fact that Australian doctor of philosophy graduates would find it impossible to find jobs at British or American institutions because of unstated barriers raised by the slightly different graduate school systems? Is it a fact that Canada insists that such jobs go to Canadians? Does Australia's immigration policy require Australian universities to satisfy the criterion that jobs in Australia should go to Australians who are qualified for them before they are offered to non-Australians? Is the Minister satisfied that this criterion is as stringently enforced in the case of academic jobs as it is for other categories of employment? Will the Minister agree to make representations to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to ensure that Australian universities are required to abide by our immigration laws as strictly as are other employers?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of what happened recently at Macquarie University but I do have some information about this matter. I believe it has been the subject of some consideration by the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts in its report on the tenure of employment of academics. I understand that the Committee did refer to this question. Essentially, universities are self-governing institutions and the appointment of staff is a matter for the university authorities themselves. For reasons which concern proper institutional autonomy it might be difficult to interfere too much in the way in which the universities approach the employment of their academic staff. I understand though that the Senate Standing Committee in its consideration of this matter did ascertain that a significant proportion of academics in Australian institutions is traditionally recruited from overseas. I understand that, for the year up to April 1977, 50 per cent of all the new academic appointments were from overseas. I suppose that, if one looked at transfers within universities in Australia and took those numbers out, the percentage of new recruitments would be higher than 50 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that universities advertise internationally. Senator Martin's question referred to the constraints which apply to universities employing overseas applicants while there may be suitable Australians. I am advised by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs that permanent migrants have to meet normal migrant criteria. That means they have to have an employment nomination, among other things. I understand that the Department does insist that the university has to try to employ local persons first. So the rules are clear. Senator Martin asked what the rules were. She also asked whether they were being properly enforced. I understand that the Department of Immigration and Ethnic affairs does carry out checks to see that the regulations are being applied properly.</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee had some comments to offer on the way in which we should approach this matter. It reported that the Australian academic community would not wish to see artificial barriers imposed on international competition. I think it was looking to the very best standards of participation in our universities and our colleges. It also recommended that the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission examine whether unreasonable restrictions are placed upon Australian academics overseas and make that known to the Government in case it needs to take it up in a policy sense or by way of bilateral negotiations. The Government is still considering its response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee. It will be making a statement to the Senate in due course. The matters which I have raised and which were the subject of Senator Martin's question will be among the considerations which the Government will have before it at that time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. The Minister will recall that in 1967 the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission abolished the basic wage and margins concept and introduced the total wage. This was done at the behest of the government of the day and of the employers, against opposition from me and others. Is it not a fact that in recent years increases on economic grounds for movements in the consumer price index have been generally applied as a percentage of total wages? For example, with a 5 per cent increase a person earning $200 a week gets $10 a week and a person earning $500 a week gets $25 a week to cover the same increase in prices. Would not a restoration of the two- tiered system provide a structure wherein the blow-out of wages can more readily be contained, lower wage earners can be protected more adequately and margins for skills and responsibility can be more visibly delineated?

Has the Minister noted comments made recently by the Chairman of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Dr Wild, in which he pointed to Australian manufacturing industry's lack of entrepreneurship to capitalise on research, development and new scientific ideas in order to generate economic benefits? Is the Government concerned at this apparent unwillingness by private industry to engage in private industrial research and development? Does the Government believe that industry's reluctance to apply for less than half of the 1981-82 allocation under the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act reflects a true lack of enterprising spirit, or is it related to difficulties that firms are encountering when applying for government grants?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly it is an undeniable fact that Australian industry proportionately subscribes to a much lower level of industrial research and development than occurs in many countries, particularly those with which Australia could be compared. The Government would like to see this situation improved. Any encouragement that can be given to industry to interest itself in industrial research and development should have our support. As I understand it, there was a fairly wide discussion on this matter in Senate Estimates Committee F. I am told that in September of this year an explanation was given to the Senate Estimates Committee, with regard to the Department of Science and Technology and the introduction of the Act in June 1981, of the provisions which require companies to provide security against advances of payment for approved project expenditure that were proving more restricting than had been expected. This was certainly brought to attention and was under consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Jessop also mentioned the matter of taxation concessions. This has been raised on a number of occasions, most recently in the Industries Assistance Commission inquiry and report into certain budgetary assistance to industry. The recognition of the need for stability in industry policy has led the Government to retain the current IR and D incentives scheme at least until 1986. As I am advised, taxation incentives are of little assistance to new companies or companies, particularly the numbers of them at present, which have a very low level of profitability or no tax liabilities. They receive no assistance by way of tax deductibility for any expenditure they may incur in the way of industrial research and development. However, the question of Senator Jessop raises a couple of matters of policy that I will refer to the Minister concerned and see whether he has a response to make to them.</PARA>

It is a matter of great regret to us that the sort of organised criminal activity that we have heard of in other countries should be found to be alive and well in this country. There is a variety of methods of attack on organised crime. One of the chores of the Attorney-General was to examine the different approaches which are adopted around the world. He visited the United States some time ago. He saw the work of the crimes commissions which operate in a number of States and, of course, the work of grand juries, which present a quite different approach to the lead-up to prosecution of criminal matters in the United States. I think what is said by Mr Costigan is unfortunately probably true: No matter how effective the mechanisms that we put in place, it is likely that there will continue to be some elements of organised crime in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. On 10 November the Leader promised to supply Senator Button with information about the activities of Mr Arnis Verbickis, the Government Information Unit officer stationed in Melbourne. In particular, he asked for an assurance that Mr Verbickis has not been and will not be involved on behalf of the Liberal Party of Australia in the Flinders by-election. He also asked the Leader to tender a statement of the duties performed on a daily basis by Mr Verbickis since the announcement of Sir Phillip Lynch's retirement. As the Leader has not replied and as the electronic media black-out in Flinders begins this evening, will he undertake to give Senator Button today the details and the undertakings that he requested?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that the French Socialist Government of Mitterrand, on coming to office some 18 months ago, introduced a strongly inflationary program similar to that which has recently been advocated by the Australian Labor Party and its leader? Is it a fact that the French program resulted in two devaluations of the franc, galloping inflation and massive increases in unemployment? Has this program now been replaced by a deflationary policy involving an austerity program much more severe than that of the United Kingdom and that of Ronald Reagan and much more severe than would have been needed if the French had not previously adopted an inflationary policy? Is it a fact that the current austerity program adopted by the French has in effect marked the beginning of the erosion of real wages in France? Is it designed to encourage private enterprise to become competitive with the rest of Europe? Has the Australian Government learnt any lessons from the French experiment? If so, what lessons has it learnt?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the world knows that the Mitterrand Government came to power on the strength of policies which were enormously expansionary and calculated to inflate enormously the money supply and the deficit. The world- wide comment was that that would inevitably lead to severe inflation and consequent severe unemployment. Indeed, those predictions came abundantly true. As Senator Lewis said, France suffered very severe inflation, devaluation and unemployment. The result has been that France, in common with other countries of Europe and elsewhere, has faced the reality that the only way in which to come to grips with inflation is to tackle costs. The main ingredient of costs is the cost of labour. France is now tackling the cost of labour and has brought about a lowering of the upsurge of wages and a steadying of inflation. It is true that the policies it has pursued in order to rectify its economy's former defects are now more severe than should have been necessary in the first place. There is a very real lesson to be learnt here. Clearly, any government which pursues expansionary policies by deliberately inflating the money supply will not create jobs but will produce inflation and unemployment. The road back is to do what the rest of the free world is now doing-endeavouring to bear down on costs by getting wage stability. That is precisely the policy now being advocated by this Government for the Premiers Conference next week.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O97">Senator ELSTOB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. This Government's answer to fighting inflation has been to create unemployment and impose high direct and indirect taxes. Its rein on inflation has been a miserable failure. As the Minister is so fond of the trite remark, ' One man's wage rise is another man's job', I ask him whether it is not also true that a demand for goods and services-that is, increased spending power-creates jobs. Is this Government happy to see a state of stagnation in the economy and despair in the community? Has it not practised anti-growth policies, including wage restraint, for the past seven years and achieved only one result-that the economy has come to a complete stop? I further ask the Minister whether the Liberal Party has an engine driver in its ranks to give the Government better economic advice than it is getting now. The Minister may recall that the best Treasurer Australia ever had-at a time of great national stress-was an engine driver and Prime Minister named Ben Chifley.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That question certainly reveals that Senator Elstob does not regard Mr Hayden or Mr Crean as quality Treasurers from the Australian Labor Party. He denigrated Mr Crean in his question, in that it was Mr Crean who invented the phrase, which is abundantly true, that one man's wage rise is another man's job. It is no wonder that Senator Elstob seeks engine drivers. He would naturally leave out Mr Hayden because there is division in the Labor Party now and because Mr Hayden as Treasurer was spot on when he stated in his last Budget that increasing the money supply by simply inflating the deficit created unemployment. Let me get that straight. I reject the rhetoric of the opening part of Senator Elstob's question. The Government's policies have not created unemployment. Unemployment in this country has been created by a world recession . That is acknowledged by all authoritative commentators. The fact is that the whole world has been in grave recession, a creeping recession, for the last nine to 10 years. The world recession has resulted in--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, if Senator Button wants to interject he has my invitation to get up and make a statement. An Australian Labor Party, led by people such as Senator Button, that is devoid of any policy, divided in its leadership struggles between Hayden and Hawke and torn with dissension, can do only one thing and that is to have its members interject continuously during the answer to a question in this place, to try to stop the message getting through. Senator Button will not succeed in that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I repeat, because we have had a classic example of what the Labor Party is trying to do, that the fact of the matter is that both Mr Crean and Mr Hayden as Treasurers worked on the assumption that one man's pay rise was another man's job. Senator Elstob has ignored them because it does not suit his purpose today. The fact of the matter is that this recession is acknowledged as having been brought on by overseas recession which has meant that trade is shrinking in Australia. This situation is exacerbated in Australia by the fact that wages last year soared by 17 per cent or 18 per cent and therefore costs rose in contrast with those in the rest of the world. The way out is the way that all other countries in the free world have been seeking to follow. I repeat that the Labor Party finds itself more and more out on a limb as the only group now that is rejecting the idea of wage restraint as the primary function in getting costs down and fighting inflation. So the basis of Senator Elstob's question is entirely false.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question should perhaps be directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs but perhaps more rightly to the Minister representing the Acting Attorney-General. The townspeople of Tennant Creek, Northern Territory, are very concerned that supposedly public areas on the perimeter of that town are included in the latest Warramungu Aboriginal land claim. Having in mind the Aboriginal Land Commissioner's recognition of the effect that this claim will have on some people and his having allowed those people to participate in the hearings, despite objections, I ask: Will the Acting Attorney-General give full consideration to their recent legal aid application to ensure that equal opportunity is given to those who are affected as well as to the claimants? Will the Minister please note that it is suggested that a means test should not be considered applicable in instances such as this where this remote town is endeavouring to be heard?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 November Senator Ryan asked me as Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs a question without notice concerning the funding of a position for an Aboriginal alcohol counsellor with the Central Gippsland Aboriginal Advancement Co-operative at Morwell, Victoria. She asked another question in relation to the Rumbalara Aboriginal Co-operative . I have been able to get some more information for the honourable senator. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs advises me that funds have been approved for the provision in 1982-83 of a full time alcohol counsellor position with the Central Gippsland Aboriginal Co-operative at Morwell. The funds will be provided as a health project grant rather than temporary special works project funding as in the past. The East Gippsland Aboriginal Co-operative is provided with funds to employ two alcohol counsellors. This is an on-going commitment. It was not possible to provide funds for employment of an additional alcohol counsellor at Shepparton, in view of the higher priority needs elsewhere. A full Aboriginal medical service-the Rumbalara Aboriginal Co-operative-is funded to provide medical services in the Shepparton area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also add to the reply given to Senator Ryan on 25 November by saying that the Aboriginal health program arrangements in Victoria are a model for what is provided elsewhere in that they are based on agreement between the Commonwealth and State governments and between Aboriginal organisations. Both the governments involved have made commitments to increase resources going to Aboriginal health programs and have implemented this commitment over the last financial year and the current year. Although more remains to be done there has been a basis for real confidence that all parties are committed to the effort necessary to bring Aboriginal health status to the level of that of the general Australian population.</PARA>

<PARA>ANTARCTICA</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Last week Senator Lajovic asked me a question based on an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 24 November about Antarctica. The report mentions a statement in the United National General Assembly by the Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr Mahathir, in September that a new international agreement was required to replace the Antarctic Treaty, and that sovereignty in Antarctica must be given up.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. I am advised that no Third World countries have approached Australia about that statement. However, the Government has followed developments closely and has made and will continue to make its views known to Third World and other countries.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Australia is geographically comparatively close to Antarctica and has a long history of substantial exploration and scientific research in the region going back over 70 years. Australia exercises sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The Government is confident that Antarctica is being, and will continue to be, managed responsibly and in the interests of the international community under the Antarctic Treaty. The Treaty is open to accession by any State, and a number of developing countries have in fact acceded to it.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The article in the Sydney Morning Herald refers to the mineral resources of Antarctica. There is little detailed knowledge at present of the extent and nature of these resources and their development does not seem likely for at least some years. While Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties have begun discussion on the elaboration of a minerals regime, they are highly conscious of the need for stringent environmental safeguards, and agreed some years ago that no minerals activity will be allowed to occur while their discussions proceed.</PARA>

The case raised by Senator Colston in his question is not typical, although I said last week, and I repeat, that in the area of appeals and primary decision making we have regarded ourselves as having problems which have received a great deal of attention.

These statistics show the processing time between registration of an appeal and the date a recommendation is made by the Tribunal, but not the processing time between registration and a hearing before the Tribunal.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek to open the discussion this afternoon on what I really believe is, as the matter of public importance states :</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The serious position for Australia and the world resulting from the failure of last week's GATT Ministers' meeting in Geneva. </PARA>
<PARA>There can be no doubt that the failure of that meeting to come to perhaps more positive determinations-not entirely because of the attitude of the European Economic Community but at least significantly because of that attitude-does hold great problems for all major trading countries, in particular for Australia, and in even more particular circumstances for the developing countries. It might be appropriate to recall that this ministerial meeting of the GATT was the first such meeting since 1973. It might also be worth recalling something of the structure of the GATT and its objectives. I shall be very brief in dealing with that field. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically the GATT is a system of trading rules that developed out of the economic chaos of the 1930s. It was with that behind us that the world saw fit in January 1948 to form the GATT. At that stage the nations that comprised the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade numbered only 23 and of the 23 original members Australia was one. Membership has grown since 1948 to consist now of 86 contracting members. A further 32 members are really de facto members and abide by and apply the rules of the GATT. A further feature is that this organisation' s membership is responsible for significantly in excess of 80 per cent of total world trade. GATT is an important body. It has a very clear objective and a clear contribution to make to establishing trading circumstances that may well see better use of the world's natural resources, both material and manpower. I do not believe that the fact that the Economic Community could not come to a final solution that was satisfactory to the bulk of its membership is an insuperable obstacle. The Economic Community may well change its stance, albeit gradually. In doing so it would, one would hope, seek to stop the possibility of a drift of world trade into the establishment of varying inward looking trading blocs. The European Community is significantly an inward looking bloc. The result of that sort of attitude would inevitably be, I fear, a term of trade warfare. </PARA>
<PARA> Trade warfare is a form of warfare like most others from which there are very few, if any, victors. The trade warfare in which massive subsidisation occurs and an unnatural distribution of the world's products likewise occurs is destructive to even the powerful operator who is capable of subsidising to the extent necessary. But in the case of Australia and many other such trading countries around the world, certainly in the case of nations of the developing world, it would be a disaster. It is my hope, indeed my belief, that the European Community will recognise the sort of devastation that could occur from a policy that would develop a number of trading blocks around the world. That would be the aftermath of trade warfare. </PARA>
<PARA> It is somewhat extraordinary that we should find these constant limiting circumstances to world trade at a time when the capacity of the world to trade is theoretically and practically greater than it has ever been. Man's capacity to communicate by land, sea and air is so fast, so all-consuming, that the basic requirements for international trade are much more effective and efficient today than ever in man's history. The world's history holds many examples of the dire consequences of the failure to follow a realistic international trading policy. It has been said more than once that if butter does not cross the frontiers guns will. Regrettably, history holds a great number of incidents from which that has been the result. </PARA>
<PARA> I find the European Economic Community's attitude quite understandable within its own context. Insofar as it has set up the Common Agricultural Policy to enable it to ensure the supply of foodstuffs and essential materials, that is a reasonable and proper attitude, particularly with a view to the history of Europe. Over the decades-indeed, even over the centuries-Europe has constantly been concerned about a situation which may well see its being cut off from its basic and essential supplies. As a reaction to that part of history it developed the Common Agricultural Policy, albeit at enormous cost to its own citizens. It established a better situation for its primary industry producers in particular. I believe that is relevant to the problem and the great argument. As I said, I can perfectly understand the establishment of the Common Agricultural Policy. I hope and believe that ultimately, as a result of various sets of circumstances, the European Economic Community will see fit to admit the goods of the more economic producers around the world. Of course, they include Australia in a significant field of international trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that I understand fully that situation, I must point out further that the ultimate result of the Common Agricultural Policy as it has existed to this time has been to produce, because of the attractiveness of the subsidisation, quite massive subsidised surpluses. These surpluses have been unleashed on the free markets around the world at prices with which the genuine, bona fide producers in international trading are unable to compete. This has developed what I believe is a distortion of and damage of great proportion to many of the world's economies. At this stage I take only one instance of the involvement of subsidised masses in the normal areas of international trade: The sugar industry is in dire straits in many parts of the world today. The facts are that for the five years ending in 1977 the European Economic Community pumped into the markets of international trade about 800,000 to 850,000 tonnes of sugar annually. Yet last year the European Economic Community pumped into those free markets around the world no less than 5.3 million tonnes of sugar-an increase of something like 500 per cent-whilst the member states of the International Sugar Agreement received an increase of 3 per cent in their contribution. That is the sort of tragic situation-particularly in sugar production, which is so important to Australia and immensely important to the developing world-which totally distorts the international trading position and which certainly ensures the uneconomic use of the world's resources. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want it to be thought for a moment that I have not a full and proper regard for the value of, and contribution made by, a protection policy to this economy and to many other economies around the world. In infant industries, and for many years beyond infancy, protection has played an important part. It has, in the Australian circumstance, enabled us to develop a much more versatile and complex economy than we would ever have had otherwise. The problem really is as to how far that measure of protection must go. Indeed, when it reaches the point at which it involves the establishment and maintenance of totally uneconomic entities in the industrial and commercial world it becomes a load on the country that supports it. But I reiterate that protection, in a reasonable and responsible measure, has made a great contribution to the development of a complex Australian economy and a great contribution to the development of job opportunities for Australians over a very wide range of industrial and commercial activity. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia must be concerned with the degree of freedom of international trade because, as much as or probably more than any other country on earth, it needs overseas markets. It needs them to such an extent that some 65 per cent of its grain must be exported. Some 50 to 60 per cent of its meat, even at today's production levels, must find a market overseas. For wool, 95 per cent of its market must lie overseas. Since Australia has a population of only 15 million, as against a population of 300 million in the European Economic Community, 300 million or so in North America, and enormous populations in Japan, China and so on, it cannot be inward looking. It must be able to move out into areas of legitimate international trade. Consequently, we must try-as was tried at the GATT meeting and hopefully will yet succeed, although maybe not in the next week or month-to initiate on a reciprocal basis a pause, a standstill, in protection. Indeed, when from time to time, as employment and the state of the economy warrant, see fit to reduce the protection barriers around our economy, we must ensure that such reduction is matched by reciprocal action on the part of our great trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA> Our mining and processing industries, our advances in sophisticated technology as a result of scientific research and discovery in engineering, medicine and so forth, have an enormous and exciting potential. They could form the bases of new and exciting industries, but such industries will not be viable unless the trading circumstance is much freer than has been the tendency in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> Our tourist industry also possesses enormous and exciting potential, yet finds it extraordinarily hard to compete with its subsidised competitors. We have to be aware of these factors and, unquestionably, ensure that such subsidies do not reach such proportions as to deny the capacity of industry to develop in its own economic area. I have mentioned that tariffs, protection and trade barriers have had a part to play in the development of a complex and total economy. However, I must make the point that in excess these factors ultimately will contribute to unemployment. I say that because increased costs and prices, inflation and concurrent balance of payments and deficit problems must produce an uncertainty and a lack of confidence in the economy which ultimately can only contribute to a lessening of profitability and the employment potential of this great country. Therefore, in the long term we must continue to search for reciprocal reductions in trade barriers around the world. We must develop an education system that will produce the type of person necessary for a technologically based Australian economy. The Government is aware of this as has been shown by the emphasis on school to work transition, technical and further education-the real development of which has increased every year of this Government's occupancy of office-and apprenticeships. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to comment once again on the severity of the current drought which is ravaging Australia. The problems created are very similar to those that would evolve from a failure to gain and maintain access to existing and growing markets for efficiently produced Australian goods. The drought is widespread, covering four States in eastern Australia. It is the most severe drought we have ever known. Unfortunately, it has come at the conclusion of a five-year period of which three to four years have been drought years. Consequently, fodder is at an absolute minimum. The drought has thrown into stark light the total interdependence of industry and commerce in Australia, particularly in rural Australia, today. No longer can we talk of 120,000, 130,000 or 140,000 farmers being affected. Indeed, more than three million Australians in virtually every walk of life are being drastically affected by a drought of this proportion. Primary industry produces practically 50 per cent of Australia's export income. </PARA>
<PARA> The severity of the drought, causing as it has across a very wide range of industry and commerce a tragic loss of jobs to which there is no simple solution , can be equalled by the severity of a trade war or trading bloc concept as a result of which Australia may well lose some of its very necessary markets at any time in the future. The drought, because of its relevance to the total Australian economy, is part and parcel of the trading situation, just as it is part and parcel of the weather situation. I conclude my remarks by mentioning that the holding and gradual lowering of tariff barriers will enable industry, through management, work force skill, technological change and restructuring, to become competitive in appropriate areas and will make for a larger and more confident employer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After listening to Senator Scott for 20 minutes or so, I wondered what reason the National Party had for introducing a matter of public importance. I cannot remember the National Party ever having done so before. It seems to me, having listened to Senator Scott, that there were two reasons for doing it. The first was to make sure that the Australian Labor Party did not raise a matter of public importance, exposing the sterility of the Government wages policy and the confusion and nebulous nature of its so- called pay freeze or pause, whatever it is. The second reason was to give Senator Scott the opportunity to present, on behalf of the National Party, an apologia for the National Party's failure to respond to pressure from its supporters to reduce protection-an attempt, in other words, to get the National Farmers Federation off Mr Anthony's back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a pity that a matter which is extremely serious has been treated in such a cavalier fashion. The apparent global slide into rabid protectionism is a very serious question which carries, among other things, the grave danger that the world will be dragged further and further down into a depression as it was in the 1930s, as exporting industries in all countries contract because markets elsewhere have been closed to them. It is, of course, correct that Australia as a middle-sized trading power was not the crucial nation at last week's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade meeting and is not the crucial nation in any global discussions on trade. We are, however, of some importance. It is a pity that such influence as we have had on the actions of other countries has been negative. They have been negative perhaps most importantly of all because of this Government's practice of and support for macro-economic policies, the effect of which is to stifle growth. </PARA>
<PARA> In only one of the seven years that this Government has been in office has it achieved real gross domestic product growth of 4 per cent which is about the minimum level required to maintain the existing level of unemployment. Not only has it practised growth stifling policies at home but also it has supported the insane economic policies of the Reagan Administration, the eccentric policies of the Reagan Administration, and the even more anti-growth policies of Mrs Thatcher in the United Kingdom. The effect of the growth stifling policies which this Government has both practised and supported is, of course, to develop an environment in which mutually destructive trade policies can flourish; and they do appear to be flourishing. The influence of this Government has been negative because, although it has behaved with piety abroad, at home its behaviour is marked by political chicanery and pork-barrelling protectionism. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear sanctimonious denunciations of the European Economic Community and the common agricultural policy for the dumping of agricultural products. Dumping, by definition, is the sale of a commodity on overseas markets at lower prices than the same commodity is sold at on domestic markets. Using that definition, Australia is dumping and habitually dumps eggs, canned fruit, dairy products, tobacco and wheat. There are no more enthusiastic advocates of those dumping policies than the members of the National Party who behave with such piety in the Senate and with such piety abroad. In all of those cases there are restrictive domestic marketing arrangements under which the domestic prices of those commodities are substantially higher than are the prices at which they are exported. </PARA>
<PARA> The influence of this Government has been negative because the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) has debased the quality of economic debate, as no previous Prime Minister has done, to the point where rational consideration of economic questions is almost impossible. He debased in particular the debate about protectionism with such pieces of newspeak as he employed during the Bass by- election in 1975 when he said that the unemployed textile workers of Bass knew about the dangers of big government. Of course, he was referring to the reduction in tariffs in 1974 which, compared with a couple of other factors that were operating at the time, had a quite minimal effect on the textile mills in Launceston or anywhere else. More importantly, of course, he equated a withdrawal, a toning down, a phasing down, of government intervention with big government, whereas the truth was the reverse. Because of that sort of continual debasement of economic debate it is very difficult to get sensible consideration of these issues. Nobody has made a greater contribution to the debasement of that debate than the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Our influence has been negative because Australia breaches the GATT. I refer to the notorious Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd case in which Australia continued to sell skim milk powder in breach of its GATT obligations. Mr Sinclair, the responsible Minister at the time, said that he did not know about the matter. A Senate committee unanimously declared that it preferred to accept the evidence of Mr Webster that Mr Sinclair did know about it. We have breached the GATT in both of the last two Budgets in one quite small way. Nevertheless it was a clear cut breach. A provision in the GATT forbids the use of sales taxes in a way that discriminates against imports. There has long been a sales tax on imported wine, but in the last two Budgets that sales tax has been increased. This is another breach of the GATT. Australia's influence has been negative because the Prime Minister keeps telling different stories about this matter to different groups in Australia. Some of the time the stories he tells are not true. I will give one example. The latest issue of the National Farmer quotes the Prime Minister's response to this question: What is the Government going to do for the agricultural community and what response is the Government going to make to pressures from at least some sectors of the agricultural community to reduce protection for manufacturing industry?</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> The car plan that has been announced involves much greater imports coming in over each year of the plan and that will be a significantly increased share of the market. </PARA>
<PARA>That just is not true. In 1980 the import quota was set at 95,000; in 1981 at 88 ,000; in 1982 at 92,000; and the interim quota for 1983 announced last week is 81,000, the lowest of the four years. Apparently, the Prime Minister continues to believe and practise: 'Tell the mugs anything that will keep them quiet. Get them off our backs for the moment and never mind whether it is true or not'. The influence of this Government in this area has been negative because it does not have a trade policy. It has a sequence of stunts designed to divert attention from the wreckage of the Australian economy. The most spectacular of those stunts appeared in the Prime Minister's statement of 18 May of this year-the Fraser three-point plan for world recovery, the magic formula of messiah Mal to lift the world out of recession. There was to be a standstill in protection-the first point-and no introduction of new tariff or non-tariff measures. There was to be no increase in export incentives. There was to be a commitment to reduce significantly and progressively all forms of protection in accordance with a set formula to be determined through the mechanisms of GATT. That was what the Prime Minister said on 18 May. On 2 June the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) jumped on the band-wagon, boasted of the vital meeting of the Ministerial Council of GATT which was to be held in November and said that he would be taking the Prime Minister's major economic initiatives to that meeting in order to rescue the global economy. In a Press statement on 2 June he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I will be urging that the November meeting come to grips with the need to reduce protection of all kinds and to scale down the massive subsidy programs that are placing such a strain on taxpayers around the world and contributing to economic and social dislocation. </PARA>
<PARA>So we had the Prime Minister's original, much vaunted proposals to rescue the world economy and the Deputy Prime Minister saying that he would take them to the GATT Ministerial Council meeting in November, beating up the importance of the Ministerial Council meeting. But within six weeks the prime ministerial plan was torpedoed by the Government-indeed by the Prime Minister who, in a statement dated 19 July, said:</PARA>
<PARA> In concluding that no further general reductions in protection are practicable at this time, the Government was also conscious that the capacity of the community to accommodate the economic and social consequences . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was the industry assistance package which repudiated the so-called plan-in fact the stunt-which the Prime Minister had pulled out of the hat less than two months before. He repudiated that and said that there would be no reductions in protection. Some people agree with that; other people disagree with it. That is not the point. The point is that this Prime Minister keeps saying different things because he does not have a policy; he does not have an overview, nor does his Government. All he can do and all his Government can do is to produce a series of politically motivated stunts. In the domestic economy the latest of those is the pay pause, freeze or whatever it is to be called. However, notwithstanding the torpedo of the prime ministerial policy by the Prime Minister on 19 July, Mr Anthony continued to big note himself as though the GATT Ministerial Council meeting had some real chance of success and as though there was a real possibility of the prime ministerial plan-already torpedoed by the Prime Minister-being adopted by other countries. The Department of Trade and Resources was more honest. In its annual report, tabled a couple of weeks ago, among other things with respect to this GATT ministerial conference it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not expected that the Session will result in a major new round of trade negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, a major new round of trade negotiations would have been mandatory had the Australian proposal been taken seriously. Notwithstanding that honest assessment of the situation from Minister Anthony's Department, he continued to act out the farce. At last week's meeting he intended to continue big noting himself but his plan was undermined because, rather than making pontifical and pompous statements to the Australian media, he was in fact harassed by phone calls from Australian journalists who wanted to know the details of the family home that he has in Canberra when he says that he in fact lives in Murwillumbah. He tells the Department of Administrative Services that he lives in Murwillumbah . He tells the Canberra Times that he lives in Canberra, in his family home. Of course, journalists are interested in the $85,000 profit he will make on the family home which he purchased with the aid of a 4 3/4 per cent government loan which he gave himself. They are interested equally in the 300 days travelling allowance which he picked up last year. So the plan rather misfired. Instead of being the elder statesman or a significant statesman in the world trade negotiations, Mr Anthony was harassed by Australian journalists who wanted to know the sordid details of the snout that he has been poking in various public troughs in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> While Mr Anthony was busy abroad ostensibly canvassing for reductions in protection, Mr Peacock was busy at home doing the opposite. In that week he announced new motor vehicle import quotas, to which I have referred-the lowest of the four years in which the present plan has been in operation-changes in anti-dumping laws, the effect of which will be to increase protection, and an Industries Assistance Commission inquiry into fatty acids and glycerine, because , as he put it, the industry is now facing strong competition from imports. Again, some people agree with those decisions; some people disagree with them. That is inevitable. But the Government has no consistent policy. Mr Anthony purports to be putting a powerful case for reduced protection and in the very week that he is doing that overseas, Mr Peacock is busy at home doing the opposite. That has been the unfortunate story of the Fraser Government through most of its life in most policy areas. What it actually does contradicts what it says. </PARA>
<PARA> The Acting Minister for Trade and Resources, Sir James Killen, put out a Press release-or at least, a Press release has appeared in the name of Sir James Killen. Frankly, it is so incoherent that I wonder whether Sir James has been paid back for some of the practical jokes that he is known to have played around Parliament House for many years. In other words, I wonder whether it is a hoax Press release that someone else wrote and on which he put the name of Sir James. I shall read a few extracts from it:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a pressing need to curb the rush to protectionism among major trading nations. Australia cannot ignore the consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government frankly admits difficult economic problems face the world and this country. That is and remains one of the major considerations in the Government's calling of a Premiers' Conference for December 7. </PARA>
<PARA> Political interests are intelligible. National interests are paramount. </PARA>
<PARA> Every political party is under an obligation to acknowledge the existence of national interests. Beyond this, no country 'is an island entire unto itself'.</PARA>
<PARA>I am astounded. Some people might think that Sir James never had much contribution to make in policy areas, but he was fairly well recognised as a man with quite a good command of the English language. I wonder whether he put out that statement or whether he has been paid back for some of his own previous practical jokes. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has no moral authority at home. It has no moral authority abroad. It deserves none in either place. The global descent into beggar-thy- neighbour protectionism has very substantial dangers not only in the economic sense but even ultimately, perhaps, in the physical sense. Australia has some real justification, however, for being somewhat more protectionist than a number of other countries because of the enormous deficit on current account which we piled up last year and which we look like repeating this year. We are running a deficit on current account of between $9 billion and $10 billion. We are in the same category as Mexico and Poland. Our current account has more in common with that of a banana republic than that of a fairly rich industrialised nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Senate should be grateful to Senator Scott for giving us an opportunity to debate this quite serious subject. The seriousness of it has been reflected in prominent editorials in recent days. Yesterday the Melbourne Age suggested in its editorial:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The stubborn refusal of the EEC to agree to any proposals for trade liberalisation at the GATT conference in Geneva over the past week is an extraordinarily selfish and irresponsible stance. It risks igniting a bushfire in which new barriers to trade will roar through the world, as politicians from each country take action to protect their industries from import competition. And people in every country stand to lose from it. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for some action in Geneva to hold the line against protection was clear. The recession is affecting everyone. From all quarters, pressure is being applied to Governments to try to export unemployment to other countries by running up protective walls against imports, or by subsidising exports to dump surplus goods on world markets. We saw in the 1930s the ultimate end of these policies-low-cost producers are denied outlets for their production while high- cost producers are propped up by their consumers (or taxpayers). Everyone has to pay more to buy less, and economic recovery is delayed still further. </PARA>
<PARA> The virtue of the Fraser policy for a moratorium on new protectionist measures followed by gradual reduction of existing ones was that it recognised the reality that no country could afford to act alone in liberalising trade. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that Mr Anthony was quite right in expressing his disappointment in the attitude displayed at Geneva. He is already concerned that Australia should be looking to other ways to offset the difficulties that will be presented as a result of conflict between the United States of America and the European Economic Community with respect to dumping heavily subsidised goods on the market. An article in the Adelaide Advertiser stated yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA> The collapse of the international trade conference in Geneva is a tragedy. The implications for the world economy are immense. Without firm international agreements on trade the greatest danger now is with the world economic growth already in neutral, if not reverse, an increasing decline in exports will plunge the world into a quickening downward spiral. This will increase pressures for individual countries to raise their trade barriers and this spiral could soon plunge the world into a protracted and chaotic depression. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result of the failure of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade meeting to address responsibly the issue of world protectionism, I think a number of options are open to Australia. The Australian Labor Party's answer, of course, is to advocate, as it has done for many years, increased protection in Australia . </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2G7">Senator JESSOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a bit confusing. I will continue to suggest one of those advocacies anyway. The ALP believes that this will shore up inefficiency in industry and subsidise employment. I think this type of interventionist approach was recently adopted by the ALP spokesman on industry, Chris Hurford, who said that a Labor government would assist the ailing steel industry by taking over 50 per cent of Broken Hill Proprietory Co. Ltd. This sort of approach fails to recognise that the solution to problems facing industries such as the steel industry has nothing to do with government intervention but ultimately relates, as it always has related, to the supply and demand equation. This typical socialistic approach to the problem is not the real answer. That is abundantly clear and has already been recognised. I thought an article in the Adelaide Advertiser expressed the following views quite well:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>But calls for greater protection against imports-to save jobs-are already being voiced loudly, by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden, and the NSW Premier, . . . by manufacturers and by unions, but more protection for some industries will inevitably hit others, including the devastated agricultural sector. Greater protection will push up inflation, hitting the consumer even further. The Federal Government, which has so fervently preached free trade abroad, must resist the temptation to back-track at home. We must make ourselves more efficient, search out every market and pursue it vigorously. Only this way will Australia be able to progress on a solid foundation of efficiency once the recession is over. </PARA>
<PARA>That is why I drew attention at Question Time today to the need to stir up industry to take advantage of the finance that is available to research and development facilities. I thought it was quite incredible that less than 50 per cent of the money made available by the Government for industrial research in the private sector was taken advantage of in 1981-82. It seems to me that industry has to have regard for its own future welfare. It has to develop new technologies. We are quite capable of doing it. Attention was drawn to this matter in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment on industrial research and development. Why is not more made of the public interest projects within the industrial research and development grants situation? The Committee pointed to some very significant areas into which industry should be moving rapidly to develop our technology. We mentioned in the report the production of liquid fuels from coal and other vegetable materials. We highlighted the example of Interscan and how it must be developed as an international market commodity. We pointed to export developments arising from military research. At present, Australia is doing a lot of very significant research in the Defence Research Centre in Adelaide on over the horizon radar, the Jindalee and the Barra sonar buoy. Research is proceeding with respect to laser technology for oceanography. Those sorts of things ought to be exploited to a far greater extent by Australian industry. I believe that we are failing in that regard. If we are to offset the failure of the GATT talks we have to do other things to secure Australia's position in the world. I noticed that the Age also stated:</PARA>
<PARA> For political reasons it will have to make some concessions. One only hopes that they will be concessions which add least to the costs of other Australian producers-especially farmers and downstream manufacturers-and can be most easily reversed once the crisis is past. If we seek relief from the recession in import quotas, we can forget about the recovery. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, any protectionism must be afforded in an extremely selective way and it also must be a very short term expedient. Pressures for indiscriminate protectionism must be resisted and more permanent solutions must be sought. The Australian Labor Party has no real answer to the economic problems that led up to the GATT meeting and the problems that have flowed from it. The ALP's socialist philosophy-or social democracy as it prefers to call it in an attempt to become a little more respectable in the eyes of the Australian community-has proved to be a failure overseas. I noted with interest Senator Lewis's question about the Mitterrand Government. Senator Peter Rae, by way of interjection a while ago, also asked about France. The philosophy of the French Government has led that country into great trouble. Since coming to office the French Government has taken certain actions that have exacerbated its own unique economic problems and those international problems, such as unemployment, that affect all countries. Over the last 12 months the unemployment rate in France has risen from 7.3 per cent to 9.1 per cent-nearly 25 per cent in a year. Over 400,000 people have been added to the unemployment pool in that country since the socialists came to power. Total unemployment now stands at 2 million people and recent estimates suggest that this figure will rise to 2.2 million this month. This is contrary to the promise made by that socialist administration a little over 18 months ago that it would keep unemployment below 2 million people . So much for the socialist approach to unemployment and inflation. Unemployment in France has risen despite massive government intervention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know about Austria. I have not been there. I am not particularly concerned about Austria. In Australia the socialists' counterparts, the members of the ALP, are arguing against a wage freeze such as the one tried in France and given away a while back because that country was finding that the value of wages was being eroded. It had a prices and wages freeze and it gave up that proposition. I think our philosophy of having a wage freeze will certainly have an influence ultimately on the prices of consumer goods.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the answer for Australia will have to be to look to our immediate region. Although there are inherent problems associated with the development of another trade bloc, I think we are forced in this situation to look at our region in regard to the establishment of some sort of economic alliance. I recognise the dangers that Senator Scott described. We do not want to have a trade war. I believe that the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) suggested when he returned to Australia recently that we will have to look very seriously to our immediate region. Our region is not insignificant when measured in any terms. We should therefore ensure that our strength in this area is used effectively. If an economic alliance were established among such nations as the member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations, Japan, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Australia it would represent over 440 million people living in countries whose gross domestic products totalled over $ 1,430 billion in 1981.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe the Senate is indeed indebted to Senator Scott for raising this matter of public importance. The collapse of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is a matter of crucial concern to Australia. We must look to our laurels. We must immediately develop new trade policies. The aim of the Australian Democrats is to be even-handed to town and country. We are concerned to help our wealth producing industries, both primary and secondary. We believe it is possible to develop trade policies for Australia that will help our farmers and manufacturers. Their interests are not necessarily in conflict. The National Farmers Federation yesterday stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Federal Government must move positively to develop bilateral trade relations with countries in the Asian Pacific basin and the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA>We agree with that proposition. GATT, being a multi-lateral trade agreement, has been very difficult for Australia. When it is all boiled down it probably has not helped Australia all that much. We must have a new multi-party strategy for world trade. We should mobilise industry-both primary and secondary-labour, government and the academic community to build a dynamic, unified and multi- party international trade strategy. International trade today is between countries and not between companies. We have tended to ignore the evidence in front of our noses which indicates that competition from overseas is very largely distorted in various ways by devices of government. Australia has very largely been playing by one set of rules for conducting world trade while all other countries have been playing by other sets of rules which they obviously find beneficial to their circumstances. Predatory trade practices designed to permit one country to gain an advantage at the expense of another constitute economic warfare. That has been going on for many years. Now, with the collapse of GATT, it has come out into the open. The real question is: How does the Australian Government get involved in a constructive fashion to evolve a new system that deals effectively with the competitive challenges that Australian primary and secondary industries face both at home and overseas?</PARA>
<PARA> To find workable solutions we need government involvement. We need the Government, academia and industry to work together to find an entirely new approach-new at least in our generation-to trade policies. While we are developing this multi-party consensus on a trade strategy there are undoubtedly certain emergency measures which we must take. I believe these emergency measures must be taken before Christmas. As I think Senator Lewis pointed out, our trade deficit on current account last year was $9,000m. It undoubtedly will be greater this year. Australia cannot continue along this path. We will become broke; we will become internationally insolvent very soon. One emergency measure which we must face immediately is the devaluation of the Australian dollar. We are living beyond our means. Devaluation of the Australian dollar would assist both manufacturers and farmers in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the second emergency measure that we must face is to make it clear to the Australian public that we cannot have everything. Japan, during the oil crisis of the 1970s, was suddenly faced with an enormous increase in its bill for imported fuel. Because Japan knows what it can and cannot afford, it very quickly realised that it had to make some sacrifices and so it prohibited, amongst other things, the importation of beef until it got its economy back into balance. Australia cannot go on indefinitely importing whatever it feels like. We will go broke. There are many things that we must import. We must import farm machinery, telecommunications equipment and factory machinery. But it seems to me to be a matter of very simple common sense that at a time of emergency such as this we should not continue to import products that can be manufactured by our own industries. We have a critical unemployment problem and a critical balance of payments problem. Why should we import products which can be made in this country and which are already being made efficiently in this country?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8R7">Senator SIDDONS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a sheer luxury that we can no longer afford, at least in the short term. We have to face import restrictions in the form of quotas on those products that can be manufactured in Australia. We do not suggest that a reduction in tariffs should take place. The Industries Assistance Commission has looked at our relative tariffs continuously. We are not suggesting that they be interfered with. But as an emergency matter quotas are unavoidable and we believe they must be applied immediately-that means before Christmas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third emergency action that I think is required is this: We have to start buying back the farm before we are unable to do so. We should seriously look at controls on the amount of money foreign corporations are allowed to borrow inside Australia. Such controls worked reasonably well from 1966 to 1972 and continue to work well in New Zealand. I believe we should change the guidelines on foreign contol which govern the operation of the Foreign Investment Review Board to require share control in Australian enterprises. We should allow, and indeed encourage, foreign portfolio investment, foreign loans and the transfer of foreign technology, but on our terms. To optimise the pool of investment capital inside Australia we should immediately terminate the arrangement whereby Australians can invest in foreign companies at will. We should also make attempts to stem the outflow of intra-company funds by a variety of transfer pricing policies. We should make the guidelines on foreign takeovers more strict . At present they are rightly treated as a joke by foreign companies. These emergency measures require the attention of the Government. Not all of them are long term solutions but they have to be put in place while we develop our new all-party, very largely bilateral trade strategy in co-operation with the Government and not in isolation from it. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly I draw attention to what I think is a very ill-conceived propensity by the Australian Government to try to big time itself around the world. Australia is very small fry in international trading terms. The European Economic Community, the Americans and the Japanese really could not give a hoot about Australia. We might think they do but in actual fact Australia's total trade with the United States for instance represents 0.2 per cent or about one-fifth of one per cent of America's gross domestic product. Our trade with the EEC is about the same. Any comment along the lines that if Australia introduced quotas as an emergency measure that action would precipitate a trade war, particularly with countries such as those of the EEC together with the United States of America and Japan, is just so much tommy rot. Nevertheless, we do have to be concerned about our trading relationships particularly with those small countries of the South Pacific that require Australia's assistance. This particularly applies to New Zealand with whom we are developing closer economic relations. Of course, Australia is one of the few countries in the world that enjoy a favourable balance of trade with the Japanese. We would certainly not want to do anything that would put that happy situation at risk. I conclude by quoting from Keynes who said in 1930 that:</PARA>
<PARA> The voices which . . . tell us that the path of escape is to be found in strict economy and in refraining, whenever possible, from utilising the world's potential production, are the voices of fools and madmen. </PARA>
<PARA>What Keynes was saying then was that it is very important in a time of recession or depression not to have a contractionary monetary policy. The facts of the matter are that Australia, for the last three years, has had an amazingly tight monetary policy-a very contractionary policy. That is relevant to Australia's trade. It is relevant as far as our trading relationships with other countries are concerned. We have to utilise our own productive resources fully at home at the same time as we develop our trading relationships with other countries. In a word, Australia's tight monetary policy has to stop. It must stop quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, I am saying: Let us develop a new trading strategy in co-operation with government, academia, with our industries-both primary and secondary-and with labour. In the meantime let us adopt emergency measures which include a devaluation of the Australian dollar and quotas on most products which can be manufactured in Australia. Let us look to our bilateral relationships, country by country. By all means let us talk with the GATT countries but in the meantime let us develop bilateral relationships particularly with those countries of the South Pacific. Finally, our approach to economic management has, in the opinion of the Australian Democrats, been absolutely the wrong approach over the last three years. It is very obvious that we have had an increasingly contractionary approach to the amount of money in circulation in the economy. A reversal of this policy is required so that we can fully utilise our productive resources at home. Of course, the productive resource that really matters is our human resource. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the matter of public importance proposed for discussion by Senator Scott in these terms: The serious position for Australia and the world resulting from the failure of last week's GATT Ministers' meeting in Geneva. In some of the debate, this has been referred to as the collapse of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. I start my contribution on this subject by pointing out that GATT has far from collapsed. In fact, there were some positive results from the GATT meeting. I believe that one can be far more hopeful of results being produced than many of the newspapers and other commentators have been.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently when I was in Europe at both the Council of Europe and the European Parliament, I was told that the Economic Committee of the European Parliament expected it would not be possible to achieve results at the brief meeting but what it would seek to have were mechanisms established at the GATT meeting for the determination of a lot of these problems. It was said that if mechanisms were set up GATT would be most worth while. In fact those committees were set up at the recent GATT meeting. Whilst Australia did not achieve the sorts of dramatic breakthroughs and dramatic agreements which a lot of people would have liked to have seen-I do not think it is a matter where there is other than a relatively bipartisan policy in Australia and in many countries of the world-it would have been desirable to endeavour to get agreement on the spot at that time , to move towards the reduction of tariff barriers, particularly of non-tariff barriers to trade. It would have been highly desirable in Australia's interests if we could have moved towards a breakdown in the two matters in relation to agricultural trade which worry us so much. </PARA>
<PARA> One is the fact that we have been excluded from what was our biggest market in Europe in regard to virtually all our primary products. The second is that Europe as a result of policies which it calls the common agricultural policy for subsidising the production of primary products in Europe has moved from being a net importer to being one of the major exporters of a large number of primary products which we also export. The problem is, of course, that Europe sells these products on the world market at prices which are heavily subsidised. This is done to the degree where, to use an example, in 1980, beef which cost $4,000 a tonne or more in Europe to produce was being sold to Egypt for prices between $1,500 and $1,700 a tonne against Australia's competitive, efficient production price of about $2,200 a tonne. That is not fair trade. That is not a basis upon which it is possible to conduct trade in any world sense. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator PETER RAE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is clearly dumping. Europe has been engaging in a variety of dumping practices which I believe are starting to be recognised as such in Europe. There is very considerable hope that Europe will move away from that practice. We were given an assurance, for instance, that the new policy in relation to sugar will mean that in the next year there will be a 20 per cent drop in the production of sugar in Europe. That will make a marked difference in the amount of sugar dumped on world markets. Not so long ago Europe had what I think might be regarded as the total impertinence to dump a lot of sugar in Papua New Guinea, right on Queensland's doorstep where most of our sugar is produced. The sugar was dumped at ridiculous prices. I believe that decisions in the GATT agreement such as this are encouraging and that we should not over- react to such decisions by saying that they were not further towards what we would have liked. I quote from the GATT communique which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The CONTRACTING PARTIES have accordingly decided:</PARA>
<PARA>I quote one of the parts which states:</PARA>
<PARA>to ensure that GATT provides a continuing forum for negotiation and consultation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>A little later the communique states that in drawing up the work programmes for the committees established and the priorities for the 1980s the 'contracting parties undertake, individually and jointly' amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA>to bring agriculture more fully into the multilateral trading system by improving the effectiveness of GATT rules, provisions and disciplines and through their common interpretation; to seek to improve terms of access to markets; and to bring export competition under greater discipline. To this end a major two-year work programme shall be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA>That may have been putting off the evil day. I think it would be unreal to suggest at this stage that Europe has not recognised that it cannot go on producing subsidised surpluses and dumping them on the world market. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator PETER RAE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. This is another point about which I found there was particular concern in a number of countries. One of the countries which very strongly voiced concern was Germany where people were saying: 'Why should the European taxpayer pay huge subsidies to produce surpluses which are then sold to countries such as Russia to help it because its economy is unable to produce enough to feed its people?' The concern has been heightened by the realisation that they are now approaching the full utilisation of the one per cent value added tax which is the tax revenue base for providing the subsidies. I believe it is quite clear that the Economic Community will not agree to increase that one per cent VAT. Therefore the position has been reached where the amount of subsidy being provided in Europe has gone as high as it is going to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In discussion with the European Commissioners-Senator Mulvihill was another member of the delegation and could confirm this-we received positive assurance that by April next year a new scheme of policies in relation to agricultural production will be in force and that the position will diminish the effect of subsidised products being dumped on world markets. I believe that we should not rush into a situation in which we have people screaming for protection to be added immediately and others screaming 'No, do not add protection', all as if GATT had been a total failure. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly there are serious implications if GATT does not go on from that ministerial conference to use the committees which have been established, to use the negotiation and consultation processes to develop new policies. There will be a serious situation if a country such as Australia or any other country rushes out immediately to put up tariff barriers to protect itself. The war would then be on. That would be the disaster which, I believe, we need to avoid. It is not that GATT itself produced the disaster. What could produce a disaster is an over-reaction to the fact that GATT, in a few days of ministerial meeting, did not achieve as much as many of us would like to have seen. It is interesting to note what Paul Johnson, the noted English writer, historian and economist, said in an interview on the Australian Broadcasting Commission on 26 November. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . if Australia adopts the right attitude to this and faces up to this and says 'We've got to be efficient or die', I think you can become efficient too, and you can compete successfully with your Asian neighbours. But I think to fall back on tariffs again would be a disastrous solution. </PARA>
<PARA>I was therefore a little concerned with the apparent emphasis which was put by the Australian Democrats on the reintroduction of further tariff barriers. I am not suggesting that we should remove all barriers and try to cure unilaterally the problems of the world. Obviously we would create massive problems and massive further unemployment in Australia by doing that. What we must do is positively not raise further barriers, positively encourage and assist in every way we can towards the negotiations which are going to follow. I was encouraged today to hear that the United States negotiator Bloch stated that whilst his reaction was one of disappointment he was going back to Europe next month for further negotiations and he does not believe that all is lost. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is a trading nation. We will continue to provide employment in this country only if we can trade freely and find markets for our products. If we adopt policies which put barriers on free trade then we are not going to be able to engage in the trade which provides employment in Australia. Therefore I think it is a matter of some concern to find--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator PETER RAE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have to be able to afford what we buy and how we can afford it is by increasing our productivity, our efficiency and our exports. That is the point that Paul Johnson was making. We have to improve our efficiency; we have to be able to compete and we have to be able to afford then to be able to buy what we do not produce ourselves. I certainly agree that we need to have protection against dumping. The type of dumping, particularly of agricultural products, which has been going on so far as Europe is concerned is, I think, a public disgrace. We need to ensure that the protection stops that sort of dumping but we need to fall short of raising new barriers which impede the restoration of world trade which, I think everyone agrees, is going to come about in the relatively near future. I was interested to hear the Secretary- General of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Mr Emile van Lennep, say on 5 October:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We must face up to the fact that, especially over the last two years, there has been a serious deterioration in international trade relations. This has shown up less in the imposition of traditional trade restrictions-although these have been on the increase-than in the increasing use of less transparent techniques such as voluntary export restraints and the so-called 'monitoring' of imports, and, in particular, in the growth of domestic subsidies and other support measures to uncompetitive industries and companies. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that he was pointing to a number of the reasons why Australia has got into trouble; why there are problems in the Australian economy. We have these problems because we have failed to do what, according to Paul Johnson, is now starting to happen in England. In answer to the question: 'Is the reason for that change the fact that there are 3.5 million people unemployed or is it a change that would be happening anyway?' Johnson said:</PARA>
<PARA> That is one reason, the heavy unemployment. I think the penny has dropped in the minds of many working people that high and unrealistic wage claims ultimately threatens their jobs. They have in fact seen jobs lost of their friends, possibly themselves because of excessive wage settlements. So what you might say is that in Britain the working people have been taken through, over the past 3 years, a kind of elementary crash course in economics and it is having its effect and is penetrating upwards through the unions, so that the whole business of wage negotiating is becoming more rational. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that that is what we need to do in Australia. The wages pause, which is the Government's policy, is one of the important steps towards placing Australian industry in a position in which it can compete whereas raising further barriers can only have the reverse effect. Fifteen million people is such a small market-I think this is one of the points that Senator Siddons perhaps did not refer to adequately-that we need to be able to move towards having our industries producing things which can be exported overseas at competitive prices and be able to get into other countries in order for us to be able to restore full employment in this country. Increasing efficiency, the adoption of new technology, using the world economic recession as a pause opportunity to restructure some of the industries from the inside, to introduce and apply the latest technology to make Australian producers the most efficient producers are all the sorts of things which I believe can move us towards achieving that result, whilst at the same time continuing to do everything that we can to emphasise that GATT and its committees which have now been set up should develop new and better arrangements for reducing trade barriers in the world steadily and on a multilateral basis. I completely agree that Australia would be mad to try to approach the matter on some sort of unilateral basis. It cannot be done that way. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I refer to the fact that the Council of Europe and the European Parliament have expressed concern about matters to do with trade protection which went a very long way in being similar to the concerns which we expressed but which were not reflected by what I regard as not a totally supported view by the European Commission when it argued at the GATT meeting against a lot of the steps which their own Parliament said ought to be taken. I think that too ought to be borne in mind when people are thinking about what the future holds in relation to the further steps that can be taken under GATT. As my time has expired I regret that I am not able to cover a couple of the other points that I wanted to make. I simply say that whilst the result of the GATT meeting could be serious it should not be described as a collapse and it should not be described as something where there was total failure. I think there is hope but it is going to be slower than many of us would have liked. I move:</PARA>

We often hear him talking outside this chamber about civil liberties but it seems that there is no civil liberty in this chamber. If one is opposed to Senator Missen one is not entitled to be heard.

That is to say, anyone who conforms to the law at the time is safe from the fluctuating wishes of those in power and even of the community as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sometimes the law is technical, imperfect and deficient. But ultimately it is much more important to adhere to the rule of law than it is to start on the slippery slope of penalising retrospectively those now condemned by changing moral standards or even by hypocritical representations of what most people's expectations are in relation to tax. No one expounded the importance of being able to rely upon the law better than Sir Thomas More, although in his case also in the end the law was bent to conform to the strong political pressures of the times. Those honourable senators who are familiar with that magnificent play by Robert Bolt will know what the ultimate end of Sir Thomas More was. He was topped. There are a few other matters I want to mention. During the debate I heard some people say that this tax we are speaking about is not a new tax. I want to put right that matter. Section 55 of the Constitution states:</PARA>
<PARA> Laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect. </PARA>
<PARA>In this case the second sentence is most important. It states:</PARA>

<PARA> Finally-I suspect some honourable senators will be glad to hear me say that-if this legislation is enacted in its present form it will work a great injustice on many of those to whom it will apply. It will make it easy in the future for retrospective legislation to be directed against unpopular groups or causes. To some extent it will deprive all Australians of that fundamental security that comes from knowing that the law depends upon general rules laid down in advance and applied by the courts. I hope that some of the lawyers in this chamber, who are so distinguished in chanting about civil liberty causes in other dimensions, are listening to my statement concerning what is wrong with this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill treats those who are concerned with tax avoidance, whether they have done anything illegal or not, far more stringently, financially, than those who have been convicted of crimes of the gravest kind, such as drug trafficking. It also provides that the assets of promoters engaged in certain transactions, which at the time were legal, as well as those of their relatives will, irrespective of fault, be expropriated in 1982. Who can, any longer, feel secure in investing in, or carrying on an activity in, Australia that may be thought to be controversial? In such a situation there is no fundamental security for anybody. The fact is that others, members of the Australian Labor Party in particular, regard the Bill as setting a most important precedent in the field of retrospective law. Once the principle has been conceded in the face of indignation, moral fervour, change in judgment or new perceptions, it becomes much easier to concede it again and again. It is always possible to say that circumstances are very special. I suppose there is something unique about every situation that faces government. But what assurance will non-residents have if, for instance, overseas ownership of property in Australia becomes a highly charged and emotive issue? Legislation that would effectively strip them of their rights may be passed. What assurances against that have these people?</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, this Bill is an outrage against fundamental civil liberties. I would have expected that more people in this chamber than in the other chamber-I have listened for years to speeches by certain honourable senators on civil liberties-would have been on the side of the opponents to this Bill, which is an outrage against the traditional freedoms that we have enjoyed for generations and which will serve as a precedent for worse things to come. I commend all who feel as strongly as I do, and any others who may be converted by what we have had to say at the Committee stage, to join us in opposing this Bill. </PARA>

I am prepared to admit that there is rage outside firstly because most people think that, taxes are too high . Politicians on both sides of the Parliament have been telling them that for 10 years-in spite of the fact that governments continue to spend money like water. Neither side of politics will get taxes down while both sides spend other people 's money on those who do not really need it. For as long as politicians are not prepared to create a proper needs-based welfare system we will continue to have high taxes. We ought to admit that and not go around making all these silly promises. Secondly, there is some rage on the part of the pay-as-you-earn taxpayer, who cannot split his income, when he sees that his neighbour can.

He is a great civil libertarian but he continues to make wild allegations. I repeat, there is a sense of rage on the part of the PAYE taxpayer, who cannot split his income, against the person, often his neighbour, who can do so and who pays far less tax on the same income as a result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As against that, there is a rage amongst many of the self-employed against those PAYE taxpayers who work between 35 hours and 38 hours a week and get four weeks annual leave, 10 paid public holidays every year, a 17 1/2 per cent loading, maternity leave and long service leave. In contrast, the self-employed person risks all his assets and must work 60 hours a week to try to keep his business together. He feels a little cross about the amount of tax that he must pay.

If one were to add vendor-shareholders, politicians would probably rank below them also. If there is a sense of outrage in the community at the moment it is about public sector superannuation. It has been based on publicity about senior public servants and retired politicians who have walked away, quite lawfully-as did the vendor-shareholders-with $300,000, $400,000 or $500,000, 95 per cent of which is tax free. Yet what examples do Senator Missen and other people give? They speak of the businessman who sold his company for $100,000 and walked away with $47, 000 and say what a terrible man he is. Supposedly, this Bill is designed to remedy the rage in the community, which is said to be all about vendor- shareholders who, according to Senator Missen, have pinched $47,000.

We cannot continue to have in this country a system whereby some people can split their incomes and lower the incidence of taxation and others cannot. Everybody must be able to split income, or no one. We cannot have one sector of the community averaging incomes and using income equalisation deposits if that opportunity is not available to everybody. We cannot have special allowances for anybody in this community. If there are to be special benefits for anybody in this community they should be paid out through the Appropriation Bills. As long as we keep using the income tax system for appropriating money and shifting benefits and burdens between different members of the taxpaying community we will have an unfair tax system. This nit-picking away and picking up some vendor-shareholders will do nothing to bring about a fair, just and equitable tax system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having listened to all of this debate with some unconcealed interest, I would like to take a minute or two of the Senate's time by filling in one or two points. This is one of the most important Bills ever to go through this Parliament. It is based on entirely new and erroneous premises for a Liberal government. The consequences of this legislation simply cannot be foreseen. However, they are potentially very damaging for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Three points have stood out through the debate. The first is a frank admission by the Government that the legislation is retrospective, in a punitive sense not in a beneficial sense. No argument has been advanced as to why the circumstances are so exceptional and so extenuating that we should support retrospectivity on this occasion. The second point is that no explanation has been made of why the Government or the Public Service did nothing. Both of them are to blame. It is not fair for the Ministry to blame the Public Service or for the Public Service to turn around and blame the Ministry. They are both culpable because under the existing legislation prosecutions could have been placed and the crooks- undeniably there are crooks in this scheme-could have been apprehended many years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> We seem to have developed a doctrine of the endless buck-not the financial buck but the one Harry S. Truman talked about that stopped at his desk. Unfortunately we do not seem to have anyone in this country, in either the Public Service or the Ministry, who has a desk that is big enough to carry a buck. People get paid high salaries here but no one seems to be prepared to take responsibility for his actions. In the four and a half years I have been in the Senate I have found it impossible to sheet home responsibility for any action for anything that anyone does in Australia. That is what is wrong with the country today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Mr Deputy President. Because no one is prepared to accept responsibility there is no leadership. We have this great amorphous mass of government and the Public Service, characterised by incompetence and inaction , is just sitting like a huge mushroom over the whole of Australian business and paralysing it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third thing that stands out in this debate is the rejection by the Government of any suggestion that innocent people will be trapped by this legislation. We believe that people are innocent until they are proved guilty. If there is any doubt we give the benefit of the doubt to the accused person. The belief that one innocent person might lose his life was one of the most potent arguments in the abolition of capital punishment. If that principle is good enough in the case of capital punishment-it is a principle that is embodied in the rest of our legislation-it should be observed in this case. We should not be legislating against a whole class just because the majority perhaps were guilty. Yet the Australian Labor Party and those Liberal Party of Australia and National Party of Australia supporters on this side who support that legislation are condemning a whole group of people. It must be emphasised that those people, who are innocent, broke no law as the law stood at the time. The consequences and penalties that they are going to pay are very severe. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. If the honourable senator knew something about the commercial world he would know very well that a lot of them did not make a buck. The crooks did. The crooks have got out with a few hundred thousand dollars or a few million dollars and gone to the Channel Islands, the Mediterranean or Hong Kong, but a lot of people used the system legitimately to stay in business and to employ people. Some of those people probably voted for the honourable senator . This leads me to the appalling ignorance in the Labor Party and some, regrettably, on this side of the chamber. There is a total lack of comprehension of practical commercial life in Australia. It is no wonder we have a recession and that that recession is getting worse when such ignorance is displayed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The effect of this legislation will fall on three groups: It will fall on individuals and the business world generally and it will have a major influence on our overseas investment. I will deal first of all with individuals. Many individuals have been involved in family companies. If honourable senators know anything about family companies they will realise that in many cases all the members of family companies do not take an active role in running the company; one member of the family does and the rest of them have neither knowledge of nor control over what happens. Yet, everyone who is a shareholder in a family company is now going to suffer. The last six years have probably been the most difficult for generations in Australian business. The aim has not been, as Senator Tate might think, to make gross profits by availing themselves of whatever opportunities are provided under the Income Tax Assessment Act, but simply to stay alive and to stay in business tomorrow. A fight for survival, a fight to the death, has been going on for the last six years. </PARA>
<PARA> The effects of inflation alone pose enormous problems for business because, although there is an apparent increase in profitability, no real increase occurs . There is an increased tax liability which comes from increased gross sales. This position is not understood by the Government in any way at all, least of all by the Commissioner of Taxation or by the Department of the Treasury in giving advice to the Government. The true position of businesses has been deteriorating, as is borne out by the company profitability figures of the last few years. If profitability diminishes the opportunities for employment and the expansion of industry diminish and this poses severe problems for the whole of the Australian nation. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been imperative for many companies to use whatever means were open to them legally to stay afloat. I will give the Senate just one example of this. One man came up to me in Brisbane. This self-made businessman, who started from nothing about 20 years ago, freely admits that, after gaining the best of professional advice, he took advantage of a scheme that is now called the bottom -of-the-harbour scheme. He was not to know at the time that that scheme was involved. He said to me that he can now pay the tax if the Government proceeds with this legislation. He has the financial reserves to do it. However, currently he is owed $2m by other companies. He knows that the people who owe him that money have all been involved in these schemes. He knows that none of them can survive and that therefore he will go broke because he simply cannot afford $2m. Senator Button, with his simplistic little socialist mind, can laugh . However, this is a serious problem. Several hundred jobs are involved in this one case. This situation will be magnified a hundredfold in the Australian community. This is all unnecessary. Senator Button probably believes that all of these people have the money in brand new bank notes in 44-gallon drums. I am making the point that, apart from the crooks who got off to the Channel Islands- Senator Button, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) or anyone else will never catch the criminals because they have fled the country-the money was used by the rest of them to stay alive in a most difficult financial world. </PARA>
<PARA> The third thing I deal with is the effect on overseas trade and overseas investment in Australia. In Australia we have sheltered behind very high tariff walls for generations. That has allowed poor management in business and agreement to rapacious union demands with respect to wages. We have kept solvent by selling the farm and by having a high degree of capital inflow. One way or another we have sold off the farm and had an influx of money. What is happening today? Where have all those funds been going since this legislation has been talked about? They are not going into property development, they are not going into buying real estate, they are not going into the stock market, they are not going into starting companies which either have the potential to be profitable or are profitable today; that money is going into government bonds and fixed interest securities. It is going there because the overseas investor who formerly trusted Australia as a sure haven is now frightened off and he will only put money into government securities. In this respect we can look forward to a deteriorating level of foreign investment in Australia and that again has severe consequences for the Australian economy. The consequences for the future are tragic. In the simplest terms, we will lose jobs, we will have a higher level of unemployment. No one in this Parliament wants that. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Australian Labor Party has been so vocal, I would like to muse for a moment on the consequences of this legislation and the way it will embolden the Labor Party to move retrospectively in other ways. There is no end and there is no limit to what the Australian Labor Party will now feel that it can do. Items that have been legitimate tax deductions for generations can be retrospectively ruled out of order and people can be made to pay. We can look forward to a capital gains tax being introduced. Most importantly, as members of the Labor Party are saying publicly, they can buy back the farm by introducing a retrospective resource rental tax. The way is now clear for the Labor Party to legislate retrospectively against the mining companies by imposing a resource rental tax which will send them bankrupt. A Labor government could socialise the mining companies at no cost to the Australian taxpayer except to the employment of our people. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Withers said, what is fair and reasonable and what is contrived and false is purely a matter of numbers in the House at the time. As Senator Martyr said, business must have certainty. As I said in my speech at the second reading stage, the financing of major company developments is now far too complex to be treated capriciously by the Parliament of this country. The problem that we are dealing with here is not the matter of bottom-of-the-harbour legislation; it is the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1936 and its 1,092 pages. It has now gone beyond the level of reasonable comprehension. It is so complex that it inevitably must have many holes in it and there will always be dishonest people who will exploit it. Until we re-write that tax Act with the emphasis on simplicity we will always be faced with this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to conclude by telling a story. I have spent a lot of time working with aircraft and I have known many aircraft engineers. It is the sort of work that requires some patience, thought and precision. There is a saying that an experienced aircraft engineer uses in speaking to a novitiate who is impatient. That expression is: Don't use force; get a bigger hammer. That is what the Government has done in this case. Instead of thinking its way through what it was trying to do, it has just gone and got a bigger hammer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a contribution to the debate on the motion for the third reading of these Bills. I realise, of course, that the fate of these Bills is a fait accompli, that they will pass through this chamber. But they will not pass through this chamber with my support. I cannot support retrospective legislation. I cannot support the retrospective application of laws. I do not know to whom members of the Government have been talking, but in my travels I have not found anyone who is in favour of this kind of legislation. The Government will get these Bills through the Senate with the support of the Opposition. That is understandable because we have already been told by Senator Evans and Senator Walsh what the Australian Labor Party will do if-it is a big 'if'-it ever gets back into government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By introducing this retrospective legislation the Government has opened the door for the Labor Party; it has opened Pandora's box. No one knows the direction the Labor Party will take if it ever gets back into government. That causes me grave concern. This retrospective legislation goes back to action taken in 1972. No one has been able to tell me yet that people who did not pay their taxes, who avoided their taxes or who used bottom-of-the-harbour schemes at that time did not break a law which was already in existence, that they did not offend against the tax laws then. If they offended against the tax laws then , why were not procedures put into effect to catch them at the time?</PARA>
<PARA> It is no good saying that this Government is responsible for what happened or that it acted irresponsibly. The Labor Government was irresponsible in this area because it was in government from 1972 to 1975. These schemes apparently were being used then because this retrospective legislation goes back to 1972. That indicates that both the Labor Government and this Government have been at fault because they did not catch up with the people who supposedly had broken the law. If those people had broken the law then that law must still exist unless, somewhere along the line and unbeknown to the Australian people, that law was repealed. If the law has not been repealed, if it is still there, why are we not using that law? Why do we need to pass these Bills now? The law is still there. The Government should use that law to force those people to pay the taxes that they have avoided paying. If that is not the case, if there was not a law at that time and if there is still not a law, the Government is now introducing a law to punish people retrospectively for doing something that was not illegal at the time they did it. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept the proposition that such acts were immoral, but if everybody were retrospectively charged with something immoral that he did in his youth or something he did 10 or 15 years ago we would be in a sorry mess. So far as I am concerned, this is retrospective law. It will punish people for doing something which at the time they believed, in all conscience, was not illegal. They did not believe it was illegal. That is the main point I bring up. </PARA>
<PARA> Some honourable senators on this side of the chamber, including me, tried to introduce into the Bill an amendment to protect people who engaged in these schemes in all innocence. The supporters of this legislation would not accept even that. What they are saying is that they do not care whether these people are guilty or innocent. They will bring them all in and catch the lot. That is what they are saying. They do not care whether people are innocent. I do care. I do not want to see people punished for something they did in all innocence. But no, they threw out that amendment; they rejected it. Only a handful of honourable senators on this side of the chamber had sufficient thought, compassion and understanding for the people who were involved in this matter in all innocence. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is a time of shame for this chamber when honourable senators will not allow innocent people to be protected. What has happened to our so-called British justice? What has happened to the so-called laws of which we are supposed to be so proud? Firstly, the Government has introduced a law that will be retrospective. Secondly, it is not even prepared to allow some small measure of protection for those who were innocent, those who did not realise that they were breaking the law at the time they did something. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I now wish to make concerns the policy of the Liberal Party of Australia. We now have a Liberal-National Party Government. I have always felt proud of the fact that it was part of the Liberal Party's platform that it would not entertain the introduction of any kind of retrospective punitive law. That is what I understood to be the Liberal Party's platform. Yet I am now witnessing the passage of retrospective legislation. Again I point out that we are opening Pandora's box. I can imagine what would happen if the Labor Party were to get into government and Senator Walsh were to be sitting on this side of the chamber . I can imagine the type of retrospective legislation that he would seek to introduce. Senator Walsh and Senator Evans are already on record as saying that they will really show us what retrospective law is all about when the Labor Party gets back into government. All I can say to the people of Australia is that the Labor Party should never been given that kind of responsibility because it would use its power to bring in all sorts of retrospective law which certainly would not be in the interests of the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the most depressing features of this legislation, besides its implications, ramifications and implementation, has been the level of debate not only in the House of Representatives and the Senate but also in the public at large. We have heard many people, not just the Government, say often that this legislation is not about innocence or guilt. How many honourable senators have we heard interjecting today to say that people are crooks, cheats, robbers, thieves and possessors of stolen money? The rage and the indignation which have been kindled and fanned in the community, in my view, are not spontaneous and occurred not as a result of the revulsion over what people identify in a very clear, precise and articulate way as the stripping of companies, which they completely understand, but as a result of what we have seen in the media, in this Parliament and on two Australian Broadcasting Commission television programs. That has divided the community as it has never been divided before. There is no distinction between tax avoidance and tax evasion. There is no distinction between innocence and guilt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A perception has been cast by some quite purposefully and knowingly that all the people we are talking about are crooks, cheats and possessors of enormous amounts of money that they have stolen, buried in the ground or put in 44-gallon drums, as was suggested by one of my colleagues. In fact thousands of small business people and thousands of vendor-shareholders in public companies may be affected by this legislation. I think the number has been assessed at about 10, 000. Of course, there are provisions that relieve some of those people, but by and large they can be affected. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently on my way to the airport I asked a taxi driver what he felt about this legislation. With expletives deleted, he said that he thought it was terrible that all these great tax cheats had stolen all this money. I said to him: 'What about the cash you pick up every day in your taxi?' He said: 'That is different. They are not after me. They are not after the little fellows. I earn this. This belongs to me. If I can rip off the Taxation Office, that is good sport; that is game; that is the national pastime of Australia. It is those big fellows they are after'. Of course, collectively we all recognise that something like $600m has been lost through bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. But it has been variously assessed that between $10 billion and $13 billion in tax revenue is lost because of the cash economy. I do not hear the Australian Labor Party saying much about what it will do when it gets into office, if ever, about that kind of tax evasion as distinct from the tax avoidance to which the current legislation primarily refers. The regrettable thing about people such as taxi drivers is that, as a result of hysteria whipped up, they imagine that we are talking about a limited number of very wealthy people who knowingly and willingly contrived quite illegal schemes and arrangements to evade tax and that they are suffering as a result. I find that one of the most depressing features of this legislation . </PARA>
<PARA> I find it very regrettable that the Government, presumably not on the grounds of morality but on the grounds of the dollars and cents that it may not collect, cannot accept an innocence provision. Yet I notice that in regard to the taxation on discounted securities it is clearly said:</PARA>
<PARA> The view of the Commissioner of Taxation, which is reflected in the 1982 Return Form Instructions, has been that profits received on sale or redemption of securities purchased at a discount are assessable. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) goes on to observe:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided that income tax will not be payable on profits received on sale or redemption of securities purchased at a discount before 30 June 1982, other than profits made by traders or dealers. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say that the original assessment made by the Commissioner was quite valid and legal. But the Government has a different point of view. The Treasurer says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that this view held by the Commissioner is correct in law. However, representations put to me in the past few weeks have clearly demonstrated that a significant number of small investors had purchased discounted bonds in the bona fide belief that the profit on sale or redemption would not be regarded as assessable income. </PARA>
<PARA>Because of their mistaken belief, poor advice, bad advice, lack of advice or no advice they are now excluded from a provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act which would normally require a payment from them. Of course, one of the sad things about not having an innocence clause is that people will be hurt not only in a punitive, financial way but also in a personal way. There will be both vendor-shareholders and agents or promoters who are innocent. I do not think any reasonable man or woman takes the contrary view that some people are not innocent and will not suffer very badly. Some people will be bankrupted. As a result of being bankrupted they will be subject to all the sorts of things that prevail in the Bankruptcy Act 1966. For instance bankrupts cannot become a director of a company. They cannot continue to engage in their past activity. They must provide to the Registrar in Bankruptcy details of any change of address or employment. They shall not obtain credit or enter into business arrangements without disclosing to any person involved that they are an undischarged bankrupt. They must not leave the country without permission. They must provide full details of journey, flights, times, places and purposes of trip and must surrender their passports on return. Failure to comply with any of these conditions, of course, is a gaolable offence. I suppose that there might be those who suggest that that is not a penalty, that is not inflicting some kind of hardship. I think it is. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in my view one of the greatest casualties of this debate has been the respect and standing in which this Parliament has hitherto been held. In recent years I suspect that the respect and dignity with which people have associated this chamber and the institution of parliament have become fragile, to say the least. They are now in a delicate state of fragility. The conduct of a few individuals, motivated by their prejudices, hates, passions, obsessions and distortions of the truth, has reduced the standing of all members of parliament in the eyes of the public. If any good has come out of this debate it is that the public has now focused on parliamentary privilege. Perhaps before my time here there were isolated cases of people being defamed, damaged and, I suspect, destroyed, with many other pains being inflicted upon them. But I suspect that in recent times it has been like it has never been before. There have never before been the indiscriminate, imprecise and irresponsible attacks by political parties against certain members of the public that we have experienced recently. What adds to the magnitude of this diabolical action by some is that many of these individuals are quite incidental to the whole debate, the whole argument. They just happen to be political pawns in the pursuit of power by one party against another. </PARA>

<PARA> Clearly, taxation matters are complicated. They are sophisticated. There are very few people who can understand all the types of arrangements and schemes and even the sections of the Act. It has been demonstrated in the past that there is nothing so imprecise as a taxation Act. Yet we find now that, because of the emotional strain that is put into this argument, the community is more and more confused except in one area, that is, that everybody who will fall within the framework of this legislation will be a sinner of the worst kind-a tax evader and a cheat. The distinction between tax avoider and tax evader is now lost and I find that very regrettable. If any good has come out of this debate, it is that some people are being seen for what they are and the community has a better perception of the activities, the endeavours and the intentions of certain members of parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are now into the sixth day of debate on this package of Bills and for the sixth day we have witnessed a most undignified and sordid intra-Liberal Party brawl on the matter. It is most distressing to see this once great party tearing itself to shreds day after day as it has been doing for the past fortnight. Even given that, surely the Parliament could have been spared the sordid spectacle of Liberal Party preselection speeches from most of the Western Australian Liberal senators. Those speeches were addressed to the Western Australian Liberal Party-not to the Parliament and not to the nation. They realise that they are in such a desperate situation in Western Australia, largely because of the heavy involvement in tax avoidance and tax evasion of prominent members of the Western Australian Liberal Party, that, if they cannot get No. 2 or No. 3 position on the Senate ticket in a double dissolution, their seats are not safe. Therefore, we have seen this unseemly scramble among most of them who are here to deliver their preselection speeches to the Western Australian Liberal Party under the pretext of a third reading speech on this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As an illustration of the depth of the division between that faction of the Liberal Party which supports unreservedly the tax evaders and that faction which supports them with a few reservations-that is the rest of the Liberal Party-a few minutes ago Senator Crichton-Browne denounced those people who had said that the vendor-shareholders of these companies had stolen money. Among the other people who have said that is the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). On 30 August this year, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> In a real sense the recipients of those funds have in their hands stolen funds whether you want to say stolen from the Commonwealth or stolen from other taxpayers it doesn't matter very much. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the Prime Minister. Frankly, I do not know how Senator Crichton-Browne- after the sanctimonious speeches we heard from him today, yesterday, the day before, last week and the week before that-can bear to remain in the same party as a Prime Minister who, three months ago, was describing the beneficiaries of these schemes, the vendor-shareholders, as recipients of stolen funds. Somehow or other Senator Crichton-Browne manages to make that internal reconciliation because I suppose that if another party were to be started in Western Australia- call it the non-Fraser Liberal Party or something like that-it would not be able to get one senator up. At least the Liberal Party, despite the bitterly feuding elements within it, will probably manage to have three or maybe even four senators up from Western Australia in a double dissolution. The three who have given their preselection speeches this afternoon want to make sure that they are among those first three. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday Senator Martyr treated us to a sanctimonious little sermon about civil liberties and civil libertarians. I think it is fair to say something about Senator Martyr's record as a civil libertarian. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Senator Martyr was secretary of the Democratic Labour Party in Western Australia. He was conscripting kids and sending them to the war in Vietnam. At the time, according to Senator Martyr and his party, all of those who opposed that war were friends of the communists and were traitors. He practised smearing of that kind, as secretary of the DLP, for many years. Now we are exposed to sanctimonious humbug in the Senate allegedly or ostensibly aimed against smearing. </PARA>
<PARA> In association with this charge of smearing we get the big lie that nobody has said anything about any of these tax evaders outside the Parliament. About a month ago, the Sydney Morning Herald had a front page heading: 'How Horgan avoided $7m in 5 years'. During June and July, I put out 12 Press releases and one as recently as last Sunday. I will read it. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The transcript of evidence given to the McCabe/Lafranchi inquiry shows that a belated addition to the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Bill could save millions of dollars in tax for shareholders of Treamog Limited, a company substantially owned and controlled by Mr Denis Horgan. </PARA>
<PARA> Vendor shareholders' liability to tax will be determined by the actions of other people beyond their control, and of which they were supposed to have no knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the effect of Clause 3 (12) of the Bill now before the Senate. Significantly, that Clause was added almost a month after the original Bill was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The Clause exempts from tax people who sold a company 'pregnant with profits'-</PARA>
<PARA>That is a quotation from the Treasurer-</PARA>
<PARA>to a promoter, provided that the promoter then attempted to wipe out the profits with some kind of tax avoidance scheme which may have been subsequently disallowed in the courts! No tax will be paid on profits treated this way. </PARA>
<PARA> If the promoter did not attempt an avoidance scheme, the shareholders will have to pay the tax evaded. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the hundreds-possibly thousands-of companies purchased by Brian Maher, only a handful had their current year profits treated in a way necessary for exemption under Clause 3 (12). It just so happens that one of this handful of companies was Treamog Ltd, sold by Horgan to the Maher organisation on December 10th 1976 with current year profits of $3.7 million. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that Treamog's current year profits were the subject of a tax avoidance scheme was revealed in the evidence of Lee Gabriel Hurley, the former Maher associate and Director, to Messrs McCabe and Lafranchi. An extract of this evidence is attached. </PARA>
<PARA> This is arbitrary and capricious law at its worst. It is utterly disgraceful that some vendor shareholders should pay while others will get off, just because they were lucky or cunning enough to sell to promoters who used tax avoidance schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer and the Government have refused to give any justification for the addition of Clause 3 (12). Indeed, the official Explanatory Memorandum even appears to contradict the Bill itself in relation to the Clause. </PARA>
<PARA> Since it makes sense in no other way, it must be assumed that the Clause was inserted at the behest of influential tax evaders who had the Government's ear. </PARA>
<PARA> It demonstrates more clearly than any previous scandal, the corruptability of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the end of the release. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect, Mr Deputy President, this is relevant, because Senator Martyr was complaining again about retrospectivity. His objection to retrospectivity is selective and not absolute, as are the objections of all Western Australian Liberal Party senators, as the public record clearly shows, because none of them objected to any of those 22 pieces of retrospective legislation passed by the Court Government, some of which had punitive effects. They have had the opportunity, in the Committee stage and in the third reading debate, to draw attention to any objections they may have, and they have not taken it. The plain fact is that what is objected to is not retrospectivity per se but the effects that particular pieces of legislation have on people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been abundantly clear in this debate, and in all previous debates on these Bills, that there are certain people in the Liberal Party who have a very permissive attitude to tax avoidance and tax evasion. Not surprisingly, many of them come from Western Australia. I say 'not surprisingly' because documents tabled here and presented elsewhere have shown that at least five members of the Western Australian Liberal Party's Finance Committee sold companies to the Maher organisation, and that one member of that Committee was a major promoter of these schemes in his own right. Indeed, a meeting of the Western Australian Liberal Party Finance Committee must have been a bit like a meeting of the Brian Maher board. A former Minister in this Parliament, the former member for Curtin, was a shareholder in Automotive Holdings, a public company which sold off at least 13 subsidiaries to the Maher organisation. Whether or when that Minister declared his shareholding in that company to the Prime Minister is a matter which the Prime Minister has, as yet, declined to tell us. But given that sort of background in the Western Australian Liberal Party, it is not surprising that the Western Australian Liberal senators, and members of the House of Representatives, have taken a more permissive attitude towards tax avoidance and tax evasion than the Prime Minister. Likewise, Senator Bjelke-Petersen--</PARA>

That is that the Western Australian Liberal members of this Parliament have a more permissive attitude to tax avoidance and tax evasion than the Prime Minister, who is hardly hard-line on the subject-at least, not these days-and that is related to the attitudes of the branch of the Liberal Party that they represent. Senator Withers made some very valid points about the Income Tax Assessment Act and the broader question of taxation. I believe that one task which is badly needed is a complete re-writing, simplification and shortening of the Income Tax Assessment Act. I sincerely trust that at some time during its first term of office the next Labor government will do that. Senator MacGibbon raised the extraordinary argument that it was not right to retrieve the money from people who should have paid it in tax years ago if they had invested that money in employment generating activity.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps Senator Chipp might like to add to what I have said. I have made only that one note about it. This legislation was weak when it was introduced. It was watered down by the Government. But it should still be passed , and it will be passed because it is better than nothing, albeit only just. It ought to be noted for the record that it will be passed only because it is supported by the Australian Labor Party. Had it been left to the Liberal Party and the National Party, all of the recipients of stolen funds, as the Prime Minister called them only three months ago, would have been able to keep all the money forever, whereas now, because of the support of the Labor Party, some of them will have to pay some of it back. There is no penalty imposed by this legislation; that is another false assertion, repeated ad nauseam. Some people will be required to pay, as taxation, some of the tax that they should have paid anything up to 10 years ago. Even that minority who will have to repay some of what they should have paid years ago is getting out of it very lightly because they have had the use of money, free of interest, for periods of up to 10 years and when they finally pay they pay in inflation eroded dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of guilt or innocence, which really boils down to a question of knowledge as to what the promoters were going to do with it, does not arise, because they will not be punished. All that they will have to do is pay what should have been paid long before. Questions of guilt or innocence are not relevant to this legislation-any more than is the guilt or innocence of an age pensioner who is overpaid because of an error in the Department of Social Security, not because he has submitted any fraudulent claims but because of an error made by someone in the Department and the pensioner must pay the money back. If there are innocent vendor-shareholders they innocently received the money and many years later they will innocently pay some of it back-or at least some of them will. It is not correct, as is asserted by various members of the Liberal Party rump or mainstream-I am not sure which, but it wants to allow all the tax dodgers to keep all the money for ever-that there is no distinction between the innocent and the guilty. That is untrue. Brian Maher, for example, and a number of other promoters have already been charged with criminal offences . The vendor-shareholders will not be charged with any criminal offences. Some of them will have to repay some of the money that ought to have been paid in tax long ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I hope that at some future time Senator Sir John Carrick will not have the audacity to come into the Senate and accuse the Labor Party of obstructing Government business. As I said in the beginning, it is now the sixth day of debate on this matter. Most of the time has been occupied by the rump or mainstream-whichever it is-of the Liberal Party which is opposing its own Government's legislation and denouncing its own Prime Minister. Members on the Government side have occupied a great deal of time in debate, for whatever reason, whether it is to deliver an early pre-selection speech for the State Council of the Liberal Party in Perth, or whether they think they can further wear down this weak Government and extract some further concessions or for whatever reason, the fact is that the time has been taken up by them. The legislation, weak and watered down though it is, will now be passed. It is better than nothing, but only just. </PARA>

<PARA> As I have explained, liability for the vendors recoupment tax will fall initially on the persons who sold their shares, but where it is impracticable or inappropriate to levy the tax at that primary level it will be possible to trace through to more remote links in the ownership chain and levy the tax at levels below the primary level. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill imposes on the taxable amount-which in the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill is called the vendors taxable amount-fixed for each former owner a recoupment tax equal to that taxable amount. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understood that this matter was to be dealt with in conjunction with the report of the Senate Standing Committtee on Education and the Arts. That being so, before we move to the Committee stage I shall make one or two comments about that report. The Student Assistance (Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill was debated in September. The Bill was referred to a Senate committee with specific terms of reference because the Bill was not very clear in its effects in a number of ways, and its lack of clarity was reflected by the report of the Senate Committee. I congratulate the Committee on the concise and clear report which it brought down because now the Senate can be satisfied about a number of matters which were of concern when the Bill was last before the Senate. I refer particularly to certain paragraphs of the report which contain the Committee's recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first of those recommendations relates to the agreement with the banks and the suggestion made by the Committee that that should be renegotiated in time. Recommendations 5, 6 and 7 contain a suggestion, which is very important as far as the Opposition is concerned; namely, that the operation of this proposed student loans scheme be reviewed by the Department of Education on a regular basis and, more particularly, by the Senate Standing Committee. In paragraph 9 of the recommendations of the Committee it is suggested that the Committee should review the scheme in March 1984. I think all those matters are important considerations in determining the viability of the loans scheme. I think they should be taken into account, particularly by the Minister for Education ( Senator Peter Baume), if I might say so. I say that not in any adversary sense; I think it is most important that, if the best value is to be obtained from this scheme, it is subject to constant review. I wish only to indicate that in speaking to the second reading motion I stated the attitude of the Opposition to this legislation as a whole. I shall simply reiterate the points I made. In our view the legislation does not grapple with the real issues in the sense that it does little to increase access to post-secondary education and tends to favour students of more wealthy backgrounds who would be more likely to take out loans.</PARA>
<PARA> In the second reading debate we also indicated that we should perhaps give further attention to existing loans schemes at tertiary institutions, particularly universities. I note that the Senate Committee has recommended that further money be made available to those existing schemes in the hope that they will be improved, with the implicit suggestion that they are of more benefit to students than the proposed scheme now before us. However, as I said, the Opposition does not oppose the legislation. We believe it will provide some benefit to some students. To that extent it is supported. We would like the Minister, perhaps at the Committee stage, to make some comment on the Senate Committee's suggestions. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Page 2, clause 3, sub-clause (3), leave out the sub-clause. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 3 sub-clause (3) reads:</PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of this Act, a person is not an eligible student if he is included in a prescribed class of persons. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the scope of such a sub-clause unfortunately leaves open a doubt as to how this sub-clause could be used. Fairly obviously, there could be some classes of people one may wish to eliminate. If that is the case I believe those people ought to be included in a Schedule in the Bill. In other words, if it is desired by the Government to eliminate a class of persons who are for example, in prison -though why that would necessarily be the case, I do not know; but let us take it that that may be one of the classes the Government wishes to proceed against- that class of persons could be set out by means of a schedule. It is sloppy work on the part of the advisers of the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) not to be able to delineate and name these classes of persons. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have the possibility that whereas a group of people will be eligible under the criteria set down-the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts has discovered that that will be in relation to one item only on the part of the banks in that they may be eligible students in relation to the universities: In other words, the students are undertaking the correct prescribed courses-the Minister may still move on those students. We may be happy enough to allow this Minister to have that power. We may even allow the alternative Minister for Education, the shadow Minister of the Opposition, if he assumes the office of Minister, to have that power. But we may not always have such benign people and I do not believe that legislation ought to be drawn up in terms of whether we have a benign Minister at a particular time. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw on an example in my State of a group of people who were excluded by the Minister from receiving benefits in relation to State scholarships for teaching when they were available. The Minister would not allow known homosexuals to receive those scholarships. It may not be the Minister's intent to exclude homosexuals as a group of people, but I believe that we ought to be very careful about leaving this wide type of provision in the legislation and that a far better method would have been for the Government to have included this provision in a schedule. Therefore, I propose that that sub-clause should be left out and that, at a later stage, the Minister should introduce a schedule of those prescribed people whom he no doubt had in mind when that sub-clause was inserted . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposal from Senator Macklin is that we delete clause 3 sub-clause (3). The Government does not support this amendment. The sub-clause is primarily intended, as the honourable senator indicated, to allow us to exclude certain groups of people such as, to mention the example he took, those serving imprisonment. That was the example that he took. One can take that as an example of the classes of people we are thinking of. The sub-clause would also provide a catch-all facility if, later, some unusual circumstance emerged where there was a group which, in the light of experience, it was appropriate to exclude.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The concern expressed by the honourable senator was that the sub-clause may put too much power in the hands of a Minister and that the Minister may exercise that authority in a way which the Parliament may not approve. Of course, that is not quite the case. The sub-clause, as it exists, does not give to the Minister unquestionable authority. It requires that all classes of ineligible applicants to be prescribed under the sub-clause be prescribed by way of regulations. My understanding of the composition of the Senate over the last 20 years has been that for most of the time it has not been in the hands of one or other major party. Except for a brief period it has been a Senate that could make up its mind, on the balance of numbers, on regulations that had to come before it and which could be disallowed by either House of the Parliament. That, in effect, because of the composition of the Parliament, meant by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the fact that exclusions under this clause would be achieved by way of regulation, because such regulations could be disallowed, and because the Senate has a history of examining regulations and insisting that subordinate legislation be in an appropriate form, I oppose the amendment, while not opposing some of the concerns of Senator Macklin that such a provision would not be used in an appropriate fashion. I believe that the Parliament would have available to it an appropriate remedy if the sub-clause were to stand as presented. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the point made by the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume). However, I feel that to suggest that the Parliament can act by way of regulation does not quite meet the notion of legislating. While historically it may very well be that the Senate has been relatively evenly divided, one does not draw up legislation on the basis of historical accident, on the basis of the way in which electors choose to vote. It seems to me that one ought to draw up legislation in terms of the future. That future could present us with a situation in which, as history has shown in the majority of cases-I mentioned this in a speech last week-control of the Senate is in the hands of the Government. In that case, at some time in the future the Minister, if he so desired, would have power to do as he liked. I do not favour legislation in this form. Time and time again the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has drawn attention to this sweeping type of power. I believe that such a provision is inappropriate; that if the Minister wished to prescribe a particular group of people it would be more appropriate that he move an amendment at the time and leave the matter to decision by a majority of the two Houses. Any other course would simply leave us open to accepting the proposition that the implementation of any legislation ought to be left to the relevant Minister because after all, at some stage in the future, he might have to do something by way of regulation. That has never been acceptable to this Parliament and represents an inappropriate way to draw up legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

I would be assisted in reaching a decision on the matter, which in the Opposition's view is important-although I had not regarded it as an amendment which required major attention-if the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) could indicate precisely what he sees as the positive virtue, in terms of the administration of the scheme, of present sub-clause (3). If he can do that we will be in a position to make up our minds on that basis. Perhaps then we would not be persuaded by Senator Macklin's arguments, which are otherwise impeccable.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answering Senator Macklin I may have given the wrong impression. I was endeavouring to say that in the Senate the disallowance power is real, not theoretical. That has been the case while we have been in government and have had a majority in the Senate. In the last seven or eight years a number of disallowances have occurred . There resides in the Australian Senate a real power to disallow any regulation that seems to be inappropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised that this provision is desirable in order to help the banks in their administration of the scheme. The only criterion that they follow at the moment is that of credit worthiness. Let me use the example given by Senator Macklin, that of people who are in prison, serving a sentence. That may be a fact we may wish to use to say that someone may not get a loan. There may not be any need for them to have a loan. However, the scheme as it is constructed, would not permit the banks to make that decision. We would like to have a power to proscribe those people. In other words, the banks should not have to make that decision. That decision should be made at government level. That is the reason for this provision. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Button asked me how this provision would assist us. We may wish to proscribe groups of people for whom a loan may not be an appropriate thing. We would do this by disallowance before the Parliament. Otherwise we think the banks may have some difficulties because they would not be able to apply anything other than a credit judgment on the people who come to them for a loan. We believe that is the way in which the banks should operate. They should look at no other criteria. This provision will allow us to proscribe certain classes of people before they get to the banks for consideration of a loan. </PARA>

One would be the example mentioned by Senator Macklin, that is those who are serving a term of imprisonment, and the other would be perhaps undischarged bankrupts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (2) Page 4, clause 7, at end of clause, add the following sub-clauses:</PARA>
<PARA> '(2) Money payable to the Commonwealth under sub-section (1) shall be paid in a manner prescribed by way of a surcharge upon any income tax payable in accordance with the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 by the person liable to pay that money. </PARA>
<PARA> '(3) A liability under sub-section (1) shall be deemed to have been discharged at the expiration of 5 years after the payment to the Commonwealth in accordance with sub-section (2) of any money for the purpose of the discharge of that liability.'. </PARA>
<PARA>I have moved this amendment because it seems to me that it will be far more equitable to repay money borrowed under a loans scheme by way of a surcharge upon tax. One of the matters raised in this debate has been the psychological effects that loans may have on a range of people in our community. My amendment seeks to avoid most of the problems. For example, under my amendment a person who enters into a loan and upon graduation is not employed and therefore is not paying tax would not be required to repay that loan in any shape of form. If, on the other hand, a person upon graduation goes straight into a reasonable medical practice he would be required to repay the loan within a short period. I have suggested in the second part of my amendment that after five years there ought to be a cessation of the obligation to repay the loan. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we should look at the family aspect. We know from statistics that a large number of people who graduate from universities do not take up any paid employment. For example, many women graduates choose to have a family rather than take up a profession for which they may have been trained. It could be that one or other of the spouses may not wish to work. It could also be that a married couple have to look after an elderly relative and that the husband, for example, may stay at home to undertake that social duty. One can range far and wide. However, I believe we ought to make it fairly clear that after five years a person in employment would have repaid the money and that a person who had not been in employment would not have to repay the loan. The liability would not be hanging over his head. For example, a couple who were married when they were at university could have a double debt. A relatively short time after they leave university they can apply for a home loan. If they have a debt of $16,000 hanging around their necks they will not be eligible for one. </PARA>
<PARA> If my amendment is passed we can say: 'If you have been employed you will have paid off the loan. If you have not been employed you will not have paid off the loan. But, no matter what the situation is at the end of five years, you can at least return to your normal existance and have the normal expectation of being able to buy a home and engage in other types of activities.' I believe that this would be a far more sensible means of proceeding in terms of repayments. I believe ultimately it would avoid a whole range of problems. My amendment would allow the Government to implement its loan scheme but, on the other hand, it would provide an equitable, fair and just means of repayment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two matters arise in relation to this amendment. The first is the substance of Senator Macklin's argument-and the questions of equity which he raised. I do not want to question or debate them. They may be matters which the Government will consider. The second matter that emerges from his amendment is the manner in which he has framed it. Section 55 of the Constitution states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect. </PARA>
<PARA>The advice the Government has is that Senator Macklin's proposal relating to the payment of income tax in fact imposes taxation. If this amendment were passed and if it were read in conjunction with section 55 of the Constitution, only that part of the Bill would stand and the rest of the Bill would be void. Section 55 of the Constitution states that only that part of the legislation dealing with taxation would be valid and all other matters contained in it would be of no effect. I put it to Senator Macklin that, irrespective of the questions of equity, the mechanism which he has chosen would impose taxation. The advice I have is that his amendment is unacceptable on constitutional grounds and that if it were passed the rest of the Bill would fall. Without questioning the goals of fairness which Senator Macklin is seeking, I put it to him that the mechanism he has used is inappropriate. </PARA>

He probably gets it from the same people who advised the Government about tax evasion. With the greatest respect, I do not think the Minister can rely on that argument. We are not necessarily persuaded about the necessity for Senator Macklin's amendment but we would certainly not oppose it on the basis of a constitutional argument which seems to us to be quite incorrect.

That is the advice we were given. Senator Button, who is a lawyer, may have a different view but the advice I have given is based upon advice we obtained. I do not believe it is fair to say that advice is incorrect. Senator Macklin has attempted to find a mechanism to relate people's payments to their taxable income. I think that is what he set out to do. What may not be apparent to anyone following this debate is that the repayment provisions are extremely generous and are not onerous. We start with a two year holiday. We have a subsidised rate of interest . We have maximum rates of repayment per month. There is a maximum percentage of a person's income which can be called upon by way of repayment. In view of those factors, we have gone some way to try to make sure that the repayment provisions are not onerous. If we add to that the advice we have that there is a constitutional difficulty, we have the basis on which we do not think we can support this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to respond to a point raised by the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) in his first contribution to the debate on this amendment. Whether it is true is quite beside the point. If the Government wished to pick up this amendment, it could simply accept it and the Senate in its wisdom could then repass the rest of the Bill as a separate Bill in toto. Since the Minister for Education is a member of this chamber, I have no doubt he could introduce it straightaway and we could pass it in no time at all. Therefore, to disentangle those two items, if that is the advice given to the Minister, does not meet the substance of the point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Neither am I critical of the methods of repayment that the Minister raised by way of objection to the point I was making. I am raising a point with respect to repayment to try to avoid those psychologically damaging problems which the research and the evidence in relation to such loan schemes around the world has shown up and which were referred to in the second reading debate. People who come from low income families are deterred from taking out loans that will accrue after they leave university and before they have an expectation of employment. That just happens to be the case. We may not like it but we know that it is the case that people from low income families are deterred by those types of considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not critical of the method of repayment that the Government has set out. I believe it involves reasonable and generous ways of proceeding. Nevertheless, the problem for individuals is that if they become unemployed or get married and are not the working partner the bank will still make demands upon them. If the bank does not make demands upon them, the Government will. I merely draw the attention of the Committee again to what used to happen when there were State scholarships for teachers in every State. People were hounded around the country . They were hounded as far as Canada and other countries for repayment, regardless of the fact that their circumstances may have changed. These things are taken into account by people taking out loans. I believe that a person from a low income family entering an arts course with the possible expectation of getting married and not being the breadwinner would then say: 'I am not going into that. I could not go into it. I do not feel I could take on that obligation '. This amendment would make it perfectly possible for such people to go into it because they would know that they would be absolved from having to repay because they had no taxable income. That is the point I was getting at. I was not criticising the Government's proposed method of repayment which, as I have said, I think is reasonable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I repeat what I said earlier: The Government has seen the need to go down the track which Senator Macklin is attempting to explore. By setting a maximum percentage of income-I think it is 10 per cent-which may be called upon for repayment, the Government has attempted to take into account some of the matters which Senator Macklin raised. I think low income earners will be accommodated within that kind of provision. We also expect that both the banks and the Government would be dealing with people in a senstive way should particularly hard circumstances arise.

I believe what we have done is in fact reasonable and will avoid the imposition of harsh loan repayments. It will make it possible for those whose incomes are low to have a lower level of repayment.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting, the question being asked of me was how we would deal with certain people who might find their circumstances straitened and who might find repayment difficult. I undertook to try to answer some of the points raised by Senator Macklin and Senator Button. When people take out a student loan they will, of course, be undertaking an obligation. I would expect that they would undertake the loan with the expectation of repaying it and of discharging that obligation. That is where we all start from and I think Senator Macklin's questions are based upon that presumption.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The provisions which we provide-I remind honourable senators of them-give a preferential discounted interest rate to apply to the loans, give a holiday before repayment is due and impose a limit on income. No more than 10 per cent of a person's income can be called upon as part of a repayment. To pick up one of the points made by Senator Macklin, no more than 10 per cent of the combined income of a husband and wife can be called upon for repayment. In other words, there is no intention to seek to put onerous conditions on the repayment of the loans. But I remind honourable senators that the student has to discharge an obligation which was undertaken when the loan was taken out. The banks have normal procedures by which they renegotiate loans in cases of hardship. It is quite usual. When I was a doctor I had to intervene sometimes for people who were involved in a motor vehicle crash or had severe illness and who had financial obligations. I frequently contacted financial institutions and on no occasion did I find them unwilling to put in a repayment holiday or to renegotiate the loan to take account of the hardship as it arose. I have no doubt that the banks would take a similar approach to student loans if the kinds of circumstances suggested by Senator Macklin were to come to pass. </PARA>

The system has within it a capacity to respond to some of the cases of hardship and some of the difficulties which could arise. We would not anticipate that the loan would be written off in any ready way. I come back to the amendment which suggests a use of the tax mechanism and which has at least a presumption within it that a person's declared taxable income in fact reflects something about his capacity to pay. I was interested in the debate that went on in this place in the past week and the statements that were flying backwards and forwards across the chamber. I will not outline the briefing material that I have here which suggests that there may be at least some difficulties in making that assumption too easily.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I reiterate that the concerns which Senator Macklin has that people in difficult circumstances should be accommodated are concerns which we share. We have tried to construct the scheme in that way and our understanding from the banks is that they also understand that special circumstances will require a sensitive response from them. On that basis, and for reasons which I gave earlier, I do not believe the amendment is an appropriate one. </PARA>

Assuming that the context is as the Minister has outlined-for example, that a person finds himself chronically unemployed, which is quite a possibility, or that the person has been married and he or she is not the breadwinner in the family- perhaps we may make the move on from the banks' position to what the Government' s position would be in relation to that. Perhaps I may suggest, simply for example's sake, that the bank has sought to regain the money from the individual and the individual has resisted payment. Under the material that we discovered from the inquiry by the Senate committee-which I must again say was very useful- I should have thought that the banks would immediately move to writing their letter of demand and recovering the money by way of guarantee from the Commonwealth, as is their right according to everything we have discovered in the committee's report and what the Minister has said. Let us take that as the context. What would be the Government's response in terms of the non-breadwinner in the family or the person who is chronically unemployed?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The whole purpose of the guarantee is to allow the Commonwealth to be called upon if the person concerned cannot repay. If the Commonwealth finds that a person cannot repay, the capacity is there for the Commonwealth to write off an amount of money. It depends upon a judgment as to whether a person can or cannot repay. I really think there will be less difficulty in administering this scheme than people believe. I think in the majority of cases students will take up the loans and will benefit from them and will in fact repay them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not at all sure that the amendment is the right way to deal with the problem, but Senator Macklin has drawn our attention to the fact that the loans scheme as it is designed may very well have a discouraging effect on people from lower socio-economic groups or those who do not see particularly bright financial futures immediately on graduating. During the hearing by the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, at our request, the Treasury provided the Committee with an estimate of the amounts that would ultimately be repaid, and though, of course, over a lengthy period we are talking about inflated dollars, I can imagine a young person setting out on a longish academic career being very severely discouraged by the knowledge that if he or she borrowed, say, $1,000 a year for the six years of the medical course, at the end of the maximum holiday period, which is two years after graduation, at the current subsidised rate of 9.5% the amount owing would be $9, 780, although $6,000 had been the amount borrowed. If this were repaid in the maximum period of 10 years by monthly instalments of $129, the amount that would finally be repaid works out at over $15,000-and that is for a $6,000 loan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If our student is doing, say, an arts course of four years and borrowing $500 a year for each of those four years, making a total of $2,000 borrowed-which has been suggested to me as the amount that a number of students currently feel is necessary on top of their Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowances to just get by-the amount due by the end of the maximum holiday period would be $3, 007. If the total were repaid in monthly instalments of $50 over a maximum of seven years, the total amount repaid would be $4,200, which is well over twice the amount originally borrowed. </PARA>
<PARA> We had put to us by a number of our witnesses the need for extensive financial counselling for students who are having financial problems. The Commonwealth Department of Education assured us that it was in no position to provide any sort of counselling and that it had no ambition to do so. The banks normally have a form of counselling but it is certainly not appropriate to the needs of the young person going into what could be a very significant financial undertaking. The student unions, which have currently provided counselling for the much modified schemes that have been functioning, thought that they would probably be required to fill the gap. One of the recommendations of the Committee was that counselling, especially from experienced student counsellors, could greatly benefit potential participants, help the banks and the Department of Education in their administration of the scheme and minimise default. </PARA>
<PARA> We also heard evidence that schemes of this nature which had been running for many years in other industrialised countries which could be easily compared with Australia have a very high level of default. I am bound to say that, bearing in mind that the loans are guaranteed by the Commonwealth, I am not so much concerned about the default as I am about the anxiety of another worry that is to be heaped on the heads of mostly young and often impecunious people who have quite enough worry getting through their courses, finding jobs and maintaining themselves in a decent and dignified manner. I stress that that was certainly one of the very serious concerns of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we should set Senator Giles's concerns into context. I appreciate that we do not want students to feel that there is a disincentive present but the context is that the kinds of students to whom Senator Giles is referring do have and will continue to have access to the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, many of them to TEAS at a living away from home rate-and that is in the form of a grant, not in the form of a loan-and that those students will have no less an entitlement to TEAS than they have now. That will remain. Secondly, none of those students needs to avail himself or herself of a loan. The loan is there as an option if the student wishes to take it. I imagine that, if people think it is too much hassle or they are worried about what lies in the future, some of them may not wish to repay it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the particular matters that the honourable senator raises, I think she is correct in saying that there would be some things we would like to see written into the management of the loan to try to help the students. The written matter which we will produce and which will be in the form of brochures will, in fact, include a recommendation that students consider obtaining counselling and advice . We will suggest that they seek counselling not only from obvious sources, such as parents or friends who understand something about financial matters, but also from counsellors on campus. On most campuses there are student counsellors. We hope that some of those will provide advice on these loans. In addition to that, the banks will be giving advice on the banking matters. They will not be counselling in the kinds of areas to which Senator Giles referred. But because the loans will be on top of the grants which the students will obtain under TEAS I think that the situation is not quite as fraught with difficulty or anxiety as Senator Giles sets out. We do not want to see students who take loans seeing this as one more difficulty put in their way. We have designed and tried to promote the loans scheme as an extra option to make it easier for people to enter and to remain in tertiary education. That is the approach we have taken. I understand the honourable senator's concern that people should not have undue anxieties, but I do not believe the scheme as we are proposing to introduce it will add to anxieties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No; I am discussing the third amendment only. The changing of the word 'may' to 'shall' may not seem to be of much moment and much may not seem to turn upon it except that the Committee may remember that in the last range of education Bills that this chamber discussed and rejected; that is, those Bills in relation to fees, a similar clause in which the word 'may' was used instead of 'shall' was a major drafting stumbling block to the Government's arguing its case. As I remember it, much turned on that clause at the time. Certainly the chamber in its vote illustrated that fact. I believe that in this case the Government needs to give a firm assurance of payment to the banks of an amount of money as a subsidy. I do not wish necessarily to tie the Government to any particular way of paying that amount. I believe that it is within the administrative competence of the Government to decide when it will pay it and how it will do those types of things. They are best accommodated, I believe, in the administrative arrangements. But I do not believe that we ought to have before the chamber, when the Government wishes to move a very firm proposition to provide a subsidy to the banks, a clause stating that the Minister might do something in relation to that matter. I would be interested in the Minister's response to that point to see whether we want to press the matter further.</PARA></TALK.START>

In terms of some jargon that was used before the last election I understand that he wishes to keep the Government honest in what it is about. In fact, our purpose is quite clear in the way in which we have drafted the clause. Senator Macklin is seeking to make it more explicit. Having looked at this matter, I do not think there is any difficulty in what he is proposing. The changing of the word 'may' to 'shall' is not unacceptable. We would accept that. If the honourable senator wishes to make the clause even more explicit he may even wish to add a few more words. He may wish the clause to end up reading: 'The Minister shall, from time to time . . . but at least once during each year,'. If he were to add the words 'but at least once during each year' that would make even more explicit the point that he is putting. That would put the Government in a position where it was required to do certain things. We intend to do them anyhow but it just seems to me that such an addition might meet Senator Macklin's purpose even better. I suggest to Senator Macklin that a few more words be added.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is unable to accept this amendment. We are subsidising the present rate of interest by 5 per cent. We are not happy about specifying the subsidy rate in the Bill. It may be desirable at a later date to increase or reduce the rate of subsidy. In any event it will have to come back to the Parliament, for reasons which I set out earlier. It would have to be done by way of regulation. I have little doubt that the Senate would have a keen interest in any amending regulations. I believe the Senate, and therefore the Parliament, would have control over any attempt to change the rate, but I submit that it makes the procedures of government more cumbersome. I suggest to the Australian Labor Party that if it were within its administrative responsibility to look at these interest rates it too would want the capacity to do it by regulation-laying the regulations before the Parliament. This would be the appropriate way for this to be done. For those reasons we do not support the amendment. We have given a declaration about what the rate of interest will be. Might I add-I am not basing my concern on this-the amendment as drafted would substantially reduce the rate of interest. I am sure it was not Senator Macklin's intention, but he said the rate of interest shall not be less than an amount equal to 5 per cent of the amount of interest payable. I ask the honourable senator to read what he has written. It might in fact reduce the rate of interest to something well under one per cent. It becomes 5 per cent of the rate of interest payable. There is a drafting problem. The concern I expressed is based upon the merit of the matter, and we would not find that amendment acceptable for the reasons which I have set out.</PARA></TALK.START>

For example, in the extreme case of the rate of interest dropping to 7 per cent, 5 per cent subsidy may be thought to be inappropriate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is now debating cognately the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill and the States Grants ( Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill. These Bills appropriate Federal financial assistance for schools and tertiary institutions for 1983. The Opposition does not oppose these Bills but will be moving amendments to the motion for the second reading of the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill and at the Committee stage to the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill. We have some concern about the funding policies that are to be implemented through the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill. The Fraser Government's funding policies for schools have consisted mainly of directing money away from government schools and needy non-government schools towards the wealthier non-government schools resulting in the proliferation of new private schools, which is a matter of particular concern on which I will be making some comments later in this debate. This redistribution upwards in a socio-economic scale that we see in the Bills before us is, of course, in line with the overall economic and political strategies of this Government, which have been to direct public money away from areas of need towards areas of privilege. Just last week in the Senate, on behalf of the Opposition, I tabled a number of documents that demonstrated that since 1976 the effect of the Fraser Government's funding policies was an increase in Commonwealth general recurrent grants to non- government schools. Of course, within that increase in grants to non-government schools the largest increases have gone to the wealthiest non-government schools . As has been demonstrated in this Senate very recently, government schools have suffered a decline in real funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill has continued the Fraser Government's strategy of treating government schools and non-government schools differently and, of course, the difference has been to the disadvantage of the government school sector. As the Senate will be very well aware at this stage, the Government has dropped the cost supplementation process through which, until this year, schools were compensated for unavoidable cost increases at the end of the year. However, this year the Government attempted to predict the cost increases for the year and to incorporate an allowance within grants to provide for those increases. As predicted by the Australian Labor Party, that allowance was inadequate. However, in compensating schools for the funding that was lost the Government has said to the non-government school sector that it will provide full compensation for cost increases which were experienced during the grant period. On the other hand, in relation to government schools, the Government will only partially compensate for cost increases. The upshot of this decision is that state schools are being asked to absorb some of the cost increases. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government, while maintaining the real value of grants for non- government schools, is allowing its support for government schools to slip further. Half way through this year the Government announced an increase of $6. 3m in grants for the government school system. However, the Government did not announce that at the same time the government school system was losing $5m because of the Government's failure fully to compensate government schools for cost increases. Honourable senators will be aware that most cost increases in schools relate to salary increases, which account for approximately 80 per cent of total expenditure. Other unavoidable costs include increased charges for maintenance and electricity. These kinds of cost increases cannot be absorbed without a reduction in courses or facilities; in other words, without a reduction in the quality of education. The Australian Labor Party believes that all schools-government and non-government-ought to be fully compensated for cost increases which inevitably will take place during any funding period. We believe it is highly discriminatory to maintain the value of grants to non-government schools while asking government schools to reduce their operations. Government schools have been forced to absorb around one-third of cost increases during the latest grant period and this is having a serious effect on the quality of education in those schools. </PARA>
<PARA> A comparison of the different income levels of government schools and non- government schools demonstrates the very different levels of resources available to children in different categories of schools. During last week's education debate in this place some very illuminating tables were presented to the Senate by Senator Button. I refer honourable senators to the tables which appear on pages 2728 and 2729 of last Wednesday's Senate Hansard. They show that in 1982 the standard cost per pupil in a government primary school was $1,480 per annum. The comparable expenditure on a pupil in a wealthy non-government school was $2, 392 per annum, or 162 per cent of the expenditure on the government school pupil . However, in a needy non-government primary school the average expenditure per pupil was only $1,290 per annum; that is, only 70 per cent of the average expenditure per pupil in government primary schools. Comparable figures for secondary schools are $2,402 per annum per pupil in government secondary schools and $3,889 per annum per pupil in a wealthy non-government secondary school. This figure is 162 per cent of the per pupil expenditure for a government school . The figure is $1,729 per annum per pupil for a needy non-government school; that is, only 72 per cent of the per pupil expenditure for a government school. </PARA>
<PARA> I must state again to honourable senators that the Labor Party supports the principle of equal educational opportunity for all Australian children. Huge percentage increases in Commonwealth grants to wealthy non-government schools, which already spend more than twice the amount per pupil spent by the poorest non-government school and 62 per cent per pupil more than government schools spend, is simply not an equitable deal for the majority of Australian children in either government or non-government schools. I remind honourable senators that about 80 per cent of all non-government schools operate on low resources. Of course, many of these schools do not have much chance of raising the level of their resources because they serve poor communities. In the view of the Federal Opposition they are the schools which should have funding priority. </PARA>
<PARA> The effectiveness of the Australian Schools Commission has been continually eroded over the seven years of office of the Fraser Government. The Schools Commission was set up by the Whitlam Government to provide an objective national survey of the needs of Australian schools and to make objective professional recommendations to the Government on the funding needs of these schools. It was from the work of the Australian Schools Commission in its early years that the Whitlam Government's program of school funding-funding which was entirely equitable and which was based on the needs of the schools and the students in the schools-was derived. However, in successive Budgets over successive years the Fraser Government has limited the objectivity of the advice the Schools Commission has been able to give. The Government has imposed guidelines on the Australian Schools Commission and, as a result, it has been increasingly difficult for the Schools Commission to make an objective assessment of the needs of schools, be they government or non-government. I think this erosion of the professional advice able to be given by the Schools Commission has been very much to the detriment of education in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter of great concern not only to the Federal Opposition but also to the community generally is the effect of the Government's schools funding policies in encouraging the establishment of new private schools. In many cases- I must qualify that by saying not in all cases-these policies have led to a very serious waste of public resources. The problem was canvassed by the Schools Commission in its report for the 1982-84 triennium. The Schools Commission raised concern at the likely underutilisation of government schools at a time when new private schools were springing up like mushrooms. Very real concerns are being expressed throughout the educational community and, indeed, in the media, about the educational value of many of the new schools which have sprung up under this system. Only today in the media there has been quite extensive coverage of a report which has just been brought down by the Schools Commission concerning these new private schools. I draw the attention of honourable senators to that. A report appearing in the Age today stated:</PARA>
<PARA> More than 130 new private schools opened in Australia in the past three years and immediately became eligible for Federal Government financing . . . </PARA>

It is the case that any school that is able to receive Commonwealth funding has to be registered by the State but I want to place on record the very grave concerns the Opposition has about that registration process. I draw to the attention of Senator Peter Baume the proliferation of such schools as those of the Hare Krishna movement, which believes in the superiority of the male gender over the female, also the vast number of schools which come under the Accelerated Christian Education Group, a kind of fundamentalist American Christian sect which is establishing schools throughout this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A report in the Sydney Morning Herald, which doubtless Senator Peter Baume has already seen, draws attention to this fact. The article points to the existence of such schools as the Wahroonga Christian Academy and the Sherwood Hills Christian School, which it says take their curricula from an American fundamentalist group called Accelerated Christian Education. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Accelerated Christian Education is part of the right-wing United States Moral Majority group. Its leader, Dr Jerry Falwell, was co-sponsored by ACE on his tour of Australia this year. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Peter Baume might find it quite acceptable that some bizarre cult in the United States of America can move its organisers to Australia and go about the countryside establishing schools; moreover, that those schools should be able to obtain registration from State and territorial authorities and immediately become a drain on public funds. The Minister might find that quite acceptable but I can assure him that the proliferation of such schools, pandering as they do to certain sects which have been imported, is a matter of concern to the Federal Opposition and, I believe, to anyone who takes education seriously. Perhaps Senator Peter Baume would like to take the ultimate libertarian position that anyone should be able to set up a school for any purpose and receive Commonwealth funds. Perhaps he believes that the nazi movement in Australia ought to be able to establish its schools; that neo-fascist organisations throughout the country should similarly be able to establish them and receive Commonwealth funds to assist in running them. If he adopts that position I can assure him that his view is not shared by the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Martyr demonstrates that he pays no attention to what anybody says in this place. I can assure him that he enjoys reciprocal rights in that respect. What I said the last time I raised the question was that, as a democratic society, we had to draw a distinction between the political right to act in a certain way-to establish neo-nazi schools, Accelerated Christian Education schools, or Hare Krishna schools-and the right to receive unlimited Federal financial support for such schools. That is a very important distinction which of course has escaped the attention of Senator Martyr.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that a collective decision must be made by a responsible authority in this society as to which schools shall be entitled to receive Commonwealth funds . I point out to Senator Peter Baume that it strikes me as a very great irony indeed that while all these schools which are promoting ideas that I believe are totally unacceptable to most Australians-the crucial point being that those ideas are promoted at the expense of the Australian taxpayer-an Aboriginal community school in Alice Springs, the Yipirinya School, has been denied registration. That school has been established for some years. It is a genuine community school and is offering a bilingual education to children from fringe camps in Alice Springs. Probably Senator Peter Baume has visited the school. I have and I know that many honourable senators have. It is a legitimate school whose program and curriculum relate to the community that it serves. It has been refused registration by the Northern Territory Government which, of course, is of a political complexion which makes it a coalition partner of Senator Peter Baume. The Yipirinya School in Alice Springs has been refused registration by the Northern Territory Government and therefore is unable to receive Commonwealth funding. At the same time a vast variety of exotic schools, whose purposes I believe do not fit properly into the democratic framework of our society, is able to receive registration and Commonwealth funds. If Senator Baume as Commonwealth Minister for Education is complacent about that situation I can assure him that the Federal Australian Labor Party is not. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume is probably going to point out that the Australian Education Council, which is composed of State and Federal Education Ministers, is examining the problem of registration of schools. But the information that the Opposition has been able to garner about the operation of that inquiry suggests to us that the AEC examination of the criteria for the registration of new private schools is more an exercise in seeking uniform criteria across Australia than a hard look at rationalising education resources and ensuring that new private schools have acceptable curricula and do not duplicate facilities offered by government schools in the same area. I believe that this is a very serious matter. I am heartened to see that today's media has addressed its attention to it. I will be very interested to see whether Senator Baume believes that the proliferation of schools able to receive Commonwealth funds, as now documented in a Commonwealth report, is precisely what was intended by his Government's funding policies. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1982. Of course, in the area of tertiary education it must be said that the bankruptcy of the Fraser Government's entire education policy has been exposed in the recently published Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission's report entitled 'Learning and Earning'. I remind honourable senators that that report shows a number of alarming things including the following: An alarming drop of 18 per cent in the proportion of young people proceeding directly to higher education; a very big loss in high ability students; a serious decline in the availability of student assistance; and an accelerated deterioration in the prospects for jobs and apprenticeships as a result of the current crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's performance in the tertiary education area has concentrated on economy rather than education. In the current circumstances of educational decline as documented by this report, the Government's policy can be described only as inept. Of course, I remind honourable senators of the excellent report on the tenure of academics brought down by the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts. That report also documented the effects of reduced funding in the tertiary education area. Those effects include: Inflexibility in the staffing of our tertiary institutions; a lowering of teaching standard; a reduction in the rank of courses available to students; and, of course, a lowering in research standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The major initiative of the Fraser Government in the tertiary education area has been to demand the amalgamation of a large number of tertiary institutions. This, of course, was one of the last gasps of the so-called razor gang committee . The amalgamation which was inflicted on a number of tertiary institutions throughout this country was, by and large, not developed as a result of educational policy but has been done in the belief or in the rather desperate hope, I suppose, that these measures will save money. Of course, the reality is that these imposed amalgamations will save little money, if any, and will be educationally damaging not to all of the institutions but certainly to many of them. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened and what is provided for in the Bills before us this evening are that the Government is going to withhold money from those institutions which the Government demands amalgamate. The threat, of course, is that the funding to these institutions will be lost unless they follow the instructions laid down by the Government. The purpose of the amendment to the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill, which I will be moving on behalf of the Opposition at the Committee stage, is to safeguard the funding to these institutions. The institutions which are currently under threat in this way include: The Armidale College of Advanced Education and the University of New England in Armidale; the University of Newcastle and the Newcastle College of Advanced Education; the Milperra College of Advanced Education and the Hawthorn Institute of Education in Melbourne; and the Orange Agricultural College and the Mitchell College of Advanced Education. In many of these cases the amalgamations will cause serious problems. More importantly, a number of institutions are being asked to compromise their educational objectives to try to achieve the Government's dubious economic objectives. Of course, the Opposition strongly objects to this. For this reason we will be moving the amendments which I foreshadowed. </PARA>
<PARA> The States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill creates a new fund called the National Unallocated Grant for Higher Education. As a result of this amending legislation grants for 1983 and 1984 for the institutions undergoing amalgamation are to be withheld until these amalgamations are completed. Very briefly, the view of the Opposition is this: We have grave reservations about using this kind of mechanism to achieve the amalgamations. If the amalgamations are achieved, if there is agreement between the Federal Minister and the responsible State Minister then, of course, we have no objections to the amalgamations, and we have no objections to the funding being made available in this manner. But if no agreement is reached-as I have said many problems will arise as a result of these forced amalgamations-between the responsible State Minister and the Federal Minister then, of course, we cannot condone the withholding of funds. The purpose of our amendment will be to make an automatic allocation of an appropriate level of funding available to these institutions in the event of no agreement being reached by the State Minister and the Federal Minister. I will explain at the Committee stage of the debate how this amendment will work. I have outlined the views of the Opposition in relation to these two Bills. I have said that the Opposition wishes to move an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill 1982. That amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that grants to all schools should be fully adjusted to take account of cost increases experienced by those schools'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the course of my time in the Senate, which is now over eight years, we have had a number of different education debates. They have ranged over a wide variety of subjects. When the Senate has been dealing with States grants legislation, as it is at the moment, it has frequently taken the opportunity to debate issues of educational moment. If Senator Ryan, in leading for the Opposition tonight, has placed before the Senate and before the people of Australia what the Australian Labor Party considers to be of educational moment now, I suggest to her that the Labor Party has taken the education debate into the most sterile and divisive debate I can recall in the area of education. It is right that we should debate the level and methods of government funding and to what purpose it is put. However, the question of 'to what purpose' is what is missing from the Labor Party's contribution to education policy in Australia today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will pay some attention to some of the detail of Senator Ryan's speech because I think there has to be some comment on it. But I will go past the content of her speech and touch on a couple of other subjects which I consider to be of real educational moment. I am very sad that so much of the education debate in Australia in 1982 is taken up with this divisive debate on whether or not all non-government schools should be receiving some funding from Government sources and, if so, how much. I am particularly disturbed at the way in which the argument against funding of all non-government schools is advanced by those who put forward that argument. The term that is most frequently used is that the 'wealthy non-government schools' are under attack. These are the schools which, under a Labor government, would not receive government funding. So far as I am aware the number of schools that actually fit into the definitions given by the shadow Minister for Education, Mr Dawkins, amounts to something like six to 10 schools. It is difficult to be precise because Mr Dawkins is not as precise as people might want him to be if he is proposing a specific alternative education policy. However, it is a very small number of schools indeed. Out of the total number of schools in Australia funded by both the State and Commonwealth governments there are very few of those 'wealthy non-government schools'. Yet the term is used again and again by Opposition spokesmen. They will not define or nominate which schools they are talking about. They talk in general terms. They paint a picture of a large group of schools which would not attract subsidies or would not attract the same level of subsidy under a Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Australia and the parents of students of schools in Australia, particularly the parents of students in non-government schools, are entitled to know what the Labor Party's policy is on this subject. Those who are interested in education would like to know. It is just possible that the Labor Party is saying something valuable. One always has to admit that there might be some value in the Labor Party's policy. As presented, it is impossible to tell because the most that we hear from Labor Party spokesmen on the subject is a diatribe against the so-called wealthy non-government schools, and one feels that that is meant to spread over more schools than one can discern from Mr Dawkins's statements. Senator Ryan this evening painted with a very broad brush when she said that the Government treats government and the non-government schools differently, to the detriment of government schools. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In fact it is not right. The Minister quite correctly is disturbed, and challenges that statement. Both government and non-government schools have fared very well in recent years. Nobody could deny that in recent times in Australia there has been a very worthwhile advance in facilities and in the standard of education. There are some who would take issue with some of the detail, and perhaps there are some areas of education to which we need to be paying very much closer attention. We will need to continue to pay attention to literacy and numeracy; and that is right and proper. People do not prosper or succeed in Australia unless they are literate and numerate and we are starting to get together some information which will enable us to tell truly whether standards have declined, as is claimed by some and denied by others. We ought to make that sort of examination, but without doubt overall the standards of our educational institutions, our schools in particular, have improved dramatically compared with some time ago. Both government and non-government schools have fared well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Labor Party constantly refuses to admit that the source of funds for government schools is not confined to the Commonwealth Government. The Commonwealth Government gives very large sums of money directly to government schools but the major direct source of funding for government schools is the State governments. The State governments in turn get large amounts of their funds for education in the form of untied grants from the Commonwealth. So a quite substantial amount of the funds allocated by State governments to schools which are their direct responsibility originates with grants from the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The third source of funds, which applies only to students in non-government schools, is of course fees. In any debate about the level of contribution to government schools or non-government schools we have to consider the contribution by State and Commonwealth governments to government schools and by State and Commonwealth governments and fees to non-government schools. The record of the Commonwealth Government in the government sector as well as in the non-government sector is a record of which we should be proud. If we look at pupil-teacher ratios in government schools and in non-government schools, dividing them into Catholic schools and other schools, we see that progress in reducing pupil-teacher ratios has been greatest at the government school level. I have here a table which shows pupil-teacher ratios in government and non- government primary and secondary schools in 1974 compared with 1981. It is the same table that the Minister incorporated during his speech in a debate in the Senate on education last week. I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I reiterate that this table shows that the system which has shown the most improvement in pupil-teacher ratios is the government school sector. So much for Senator Ryan's assertion this week and last week and assertions by other members of the Opposition on the subject of education in recent times that Commonwealth Government policies have been to the detriment of government schools. Secondly, if we look at total expenditure in the three categories of schools to which I have referred we will see that government schools receive the greatest expenditure in dollar terms at the secondary level. In 1981 prices government schools received $2,363 per capita, Catholic schools $ 1,687, and other non-government schools $2,200. I repeat that, of course, Catholic schools and other non-government schools have sources of funds other than government contributions. They also have fees and perhaps contributions made to them from other sources, such as parishes in the case of Catholic schools. Even including that the per capita expenditure on students in secondary schools is the highest in government schools. I have a table which compares recurrent expenditure in 1974 and 1981 in government and non-government schools, and which illustrates this point.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In short, the table shows that the change in per capita expenditure has been greatest for government schools and least for independent non-government schools. That is, there have been more extra dollars for students in government schools than in other schools. Even on the level to which the Labor Party wishes to turn the entire education debate-that is per capita funding-we see that the government schools have done very well indeed. So they should. It is good that that money has gone into education. It is good that governments, both the Liberal Government and the previous Labor Government, put such a high priority on education and made that sort of contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must turn to the theme in a large part of Senator Ryan's speech this evening which re- iterated, in essence, what she said last Wednesday in the Senate in the debate on the matter of public importance raised by her on the subject of education. She made some extraordinary statements. During Senator Ryan's speech, the Minister for Education pleaded with her that surely she could not mean some of the statements she was making; surely she had not thought through the implications of those statements. But Senator Ryan insisted and went further and further. I had some difficulty in believing my ears that we were hearing an education policy and that the Labor Party in opposition would seriously suggest the sorts of things that were suggested in Senator Ryan's speech. She questioned the value of some of the new schools that are receiving subsidies. The Minister, quite rightly, pointed out that she was wrong in one of her statements. She had said that it seems that virtually anyone can set up a school for any purpose and can apply for and get funds. The Minister rightly pointed out that such schools had to be registered, that they had to go through a system which all schools have to go through before gaining access to any government funds. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the value of new schools is not something that the Commonwealth Government should be questioning in the way that Senator Ryan suggested. Last year in Queensland there was some furore when the State Government brought in education legislation which related to the registration of schools. It was feared that the legislation would be overly restrictive. There was some alarm in the community, and indeed in the Parliament, that the State Government would apply such a stringent attitude towards schools that many independent schools, in particular, specificially those with a religious basis, would be in a difficult position. It was explained that the purpose of the legislation was to ensure that all non-government schools that applied for government funding met important basic and certainly strict educational criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of that legislation was to try to cut out something that might call itself a school that was not genuinely a school, whose primary purpose was not education of the same level that parents could expect their children to receive in government schools or already registered non-government schools. That State Government met that problem that there was a suggestion that some weirdo sort of group would set up these sorts of institutions. When the purpose of the Bill was explained, it was accepted by the Parliament and the Queensland public. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to Senator Ryan that State governments are pretty sensitive to the allegation that public funds would be going to fund weirdo groups-I was going to say 'offbeat', but I do not think even that is strong enough-these fringe groups that are not genuinely interested in providing the essential basic education which should be provided in every school. The State governments, I suggest, would be anything but anxious to be spreading around those funds that they consider to be too scarce at the best of times to groups which were not providing an education that those State governments say is compulsory for all children. </PARA>
<PARA> What would a Labor government do? Senator Ryan did not go quite to the length of telling us. She gave us some general suggestion that someone had made on the subject of registration of schools. But if the Commonwealth is to enter into this area, what would the Labor Party do? The basic criterion for registration of a school is surely that it gives the fundamental education that we expect and , indeed, demand that every child in Australia must receive-not just 'should' receive, because education is compulsory. How far past that can a government go? Can it tell the States what should be taught in their curricula in these subjects? Is it suggested that some Commonwealth body should have some oversight of the basic curricula? Is it suggested that a Commonwealth government should have an oversight of other matters?</PARA>
<PARA> There are subjects offered, courses offered and other things offered in non- government schools which are additional to what are offered in government schools, which are their basic raison d'etre. Those things we accept. We accept religious instruction in schools which have a connection with religion. We accept it, be it Christian, Jewish, Muslim or Hari Krishna. Governments have not stepped in in Australia and said 'That religious teaching is acceptable, but that is not'. </PARA>

If one is to take issue with the teachings of one religion which sets up a school one has to take issue with all of them. I have actually been approached by that religious group on the subject of education funding. It has discussed the subject of education funding with me. It has not asked me to make any representations; we just engaged in a conversation. I queried the subjects that are offered at its school. I was told that it offers the basic educational curriculum, that it complies with what non-government schools are required to comply with in terms of offering the education in certain areas that we demand all children should have.

If one is to introduce that subject in the general terms that Senator Ryan introduced it into this debate one has to be prepared to pursue it to its conclusion or drop it. Senator Ryan was invited to drop the subject. She insisted on pursuing it and got herself into worse trouble. She referred to the vast variety of exotic schools which do not fit into the democratic structure of our society. For heaven's sake, we are talking about eduction presented in our schools. If they do not fit into the democratic structure of our society, does that mean that what is being taught in those school classrooms is anti- democratic? Is that what Senator Ryan is suggesting? Some parents would think that some of the views put by some teachers in other schools are rather anti- democratic too. I have heard parents getting pretty hostile about what their children are taught in government schools. I do not know whether they are right or wrong, but we accept that certain things happen. I know that if a government were to step in on that matter it would be accused of political censorship in the classroom. Senator Ryan got herself right into that area. Which schools do not fit into the democratic structure of our society, why do they not fit in, who says they do not and what is the answer? One cannot use those general terms to put down the Government's funding policy, particularly in relation to non- government schools, and raise these bogies without answering those questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The logical conclusion to the issues that Senator Ryan raised could possibly be , in some people's view, to have no religious instruction; in other words, to allow nothing to happen in any non-government school that does not happen in a government classroom. That is one possible logical conclusion. If Senator Ryan is to continue in that vein in the education debate in the Senate she will have to be prepared to be challenged on those issues and to answer those challenges. I will listen with great interest to what Senator Ryan says on behalf of the Australian Labor Party in response to those points. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not my intention when I rose this evening to spend 20 minutes on Senator Ryan's speech. It was my intention to spend some time on the education debate to which I referred at the beginning of my speech. I shall do so now in a truncated form. One of the issues in addition to funding that I would like to see the Senate debating-it quite properly debates funding but, as I said earlier, it has become a sterile and divisive debate when it is confined to that-is the challenges to education in Australia in the 1980s. The challenges are great; they are debated by many educators. Nobody has any specific answers, but they are urgent issues. They are issues which essentially, I suppose, will have to be addressed in particular by State governments. Those of us in the Parliament who are involved in education have a responsibility to raise those issues with the Commonwealth Government to see whether it believes there is anything relevant that it can do or would want to do in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The two greatest challenges to school education in Australia today are the impact of the technological revolution as it is called-technological change-and the impact of fundamental social change in our society. In the latter context we have debated on a number of occasions in the Senate the implications for our educational system either as a source of youth unemployment or as a cure for it. But other social change is taking place also. In the Senate a couple of weeks ago I referred to the historic disability of women in Australian society and to how we have a problem as a result of major change in the 1970s which was compounded by historic factors. The simple fact is that the majority of adult women in Australian society have on average a very low level of education. The great majority of women over the age of 40 in Australia have little more than primary school education-basic literacy and numeracy. </PARA>
<PARA> That it could have happened is bad enough, but that historical fact is compounded by the many one parent families resulting from the modern trend of a high rate of divorce or from other factors such as widowhood. In most of these families the mother is the parent. Our society is demanding in terms of the educational standards that it sets for people seeking employment. These women very badly need access to a reasonable level of remuneration so that they can rear families, and they do not have an education that fits them for it. If they decide to approach education in their mature years to seek better skills they find that the institutional hurdles they have to clear are enormous. They are not welcome in our high schools. A number of them are attending classes in high schools with teenage students, but that is a very small number. They are not welcome because they disrupt timetables. They do not fit into the model of what our high schools have been, for students and in administration, for decades now. I suggest that we have to take this new social factor into account when looking at what we should expect of our schooling system. </PARA>
<PARA> I think one could look with some value at the Tasmanian community college. It would be valuable to look seriously at whether the upper levels of our high schools-let us say the last two years of high schooling for students in the 16 to 18 years age range-could be so structured and opened up that adults, both men and women, who these days need to return to school had access to them to reach a higher level of education without the very practical institutional hurdles that are now put in their way. I believe that could be done without detriment to the education of our teenagers as they proceed through their normal schooling process. </PARA>
<PARA> It only stands to reason that if women, or indeed men, who may be on a pension and are raising a young family want to go back to school the most reasonable time for them to have that opportunity would be while school is in, when their children are at school. Virtually the only alternative of attending evening classes when their children are at home and need their attention and time-indeed , if they are to have someone else's attention and time it would cost money that those parents do not have-is not a reasonable alternative. I think that is one matter that has to be looked at. Social change and single parent families are not the only reasons though. Also technological change means that a lot of low level skill work will in the future be done more and more by machines rather than people and many people recently entered into the work force will need to return to school to get a higher level of skills than the low or virtually non- existent skills that they have at the moment. Those people need access to that sort of education and they need it in a reasonable way. </PARA>
<PARA> In my experience it has been mainly the tertiary sector that has been debating the future of education in Australia, looking with some worry and puzzlement at the phenomenon of technological change and asking: 'What should we be planning for in our educational institutions in Australia in 20 years time?' That has been my major experience as someone who gets involved in a lot of those conferences and discussions. In my opinion the area at which we should be looking most closely is the schooling level, particularly the upper high schooling level. That is where the real challenge lies. Of course, some of it lies in the technical area and will continue to do so. We must face the fact that already there are very many people in Australia today who do not have what we now consider to be basic education because basic education standards have risen in recent years. Such people had what were basic education standards when they went to school but sadly they have been left behind by a society which has changed in a way that nobody could have foretold when they were at school. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the sorts of subjects to which I think we should be properly addressing ourselves in the Senate. As I said when I started on this subject, they are issues largely for determination in detail and in the final instance by State governments. I believe it is the responsibility of all of us who have some influence in educational policy and who care about education to turn our minds to this issue and to try jointly and as apolitically as we can to come up with solutions to that problem which is the real challenge to education in Australia today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this cognate debate we are discussing the grants made by the Commonwealth to the States in relation to schools and tertiary institutions. I wish to spend some of the time available to me on both the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill and the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill. In the debates that we have had in this place from time to time, I think there is progressively coming to the fore some realistic considerations of the problems that this country is confronting in its education institutions. One of the important aspects that we ought always to remember is that the problems that we face today were not created today. In fact , they were created by the types of policies in place in this country in the last 10 years or 15 years. Today, the problems are the fruit of those types of educational policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The criticisms that have been levelled at those policies are well documented, such as the under-funding in terms of pupils in Australian schools in comparison with countries of comparable levels around the world. Those low level fundings that we provided in the 1960s and in the very early 1970s had only partly started to be redressed in 1972 when the Labor Government came to power. This is so through to the present time. I say 'only partly redressed' because once those additional funds went to schools there was necessarily some falling down in terms of expenditure in the schools. It was relatively easy because of the dramatic increase to point to wastage and to areas where money was misspent. Those types of things occur and occur in any institution. But the unfortunate thing about them is that attention was applied to them on the part of some sections of the media. This meant that almost immediately we had a community feeling which started to arise that perhaps we were not getting value for our dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> Governments of all political persuasions must respond in some way to the general feelings of the community. The problems with those particular feelings within the community is that they latched on to something which had not been a feature of the Australian educational funding scene, that is, large amounts of money were being spent in an attempt to change the institution, to upgrade it and to modernise it. Therefore I believe that those types of community movements allow governments-indeed in many cases force governments-to take a less sanguine view of the usefulness of massive funding to educational institutions. I think that those problems have lasted to the present day. They are now much more difficult problems to deal with because the need for change, flexibility and upgrading is more dramatic than it has ever been. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise one area as an example of how when we do make a step forward, a step that a lot of people in the country have been suggesting, at the same time we manage, because of past educational problems, to create massive problems for ourselves while we are trying to get some advance. I refer in particular to computer and mathematics education. It serves well as an illustration of some of the difficulties of the educational scene that the Commonwealth, quite rightly through the Schools Commission and other instrumentalities, particularly through its own Department of Education, is seeking in co-operation with the States to upgrade massively computer education in this country. That is to be welcomed, applauded and supported. </PARA>
<PARA> The unfortunate occurrence, though, is something that may not have been foreseen and which certainly leads me to have grave doubts about what may be happening in the immediate future in these areas. What is going to occur and is occurring is this. As we manage to introduce into our schools more competent and more useful software in terms of hands-on experience and computers we gather mathematic teachers for that particular instruction. They are generally the ones who are used in the computer area. If one were to look at the availability of mathematics teachers in Australia one would know-we have known for some time- that we have a shortage of them. One of the things that people do not realise is that the vast bulk of mathematics in our schools is taught by teachers who teach only one class of mathematics in their teaching load. What this means, quite simply, is that the vast bulk of mathematics teachers are not specialist mathematics teachers. They are competent in maths; they are competent to take the classes that they are teaching but they are not specialist teachers in the area. More and more we are drawing on our specialist teachers to support computer education. Meanwhile we are leaving mathematics education to the non- specialist in our schools; often, for example, to an English teacher or a history teacher who will pick up a maths lesson here or there. Those problems have not been caused by any government in the recent past. They are indeed the coming home to roost of very bad, very short-sighted, policies that were implemented in the 1960s and 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular one can look now at tertiary institutions in those areas and note a dramatic decline in the number of higher degrees taken in mathematics and science. At the very time when our country needs to be much more than just moving and, in fact, needs to be galloping towards getting itself a highly skilled scientific and mathematic base we are, in fact, decreasing the number of students going into higher degrees in science and mathematics. This is an extraordinary occurrence for a country such as ours which maintains that it can become a high technology society. I believe the example I give has poignancy. With a decline in those science based courses at the tertiary level we also have an increasing inability on the part of our education departments, both at university and college of advanced education level, to attract students into the teaching strands of science and mathematics. </PARA>
<PARA> I have cast around in relation to the projections that the various departments of education in the various universities and major CAEs give for next year. They all project a further decline again in students going into those teaching areas. If anything should send a chill up and down one's spine it is that fact. We talk constantly about the fact that we probably have more teachers than we need, yet that is not the way to talk. We should talk in specific terms. Do we have enough mathematics teachers? Do we have enough science teachers? That is the way to talk. When one looks at every State and every institution we discover that we do not have enough teachers in those areas. We do not even have enough teachers to service our current requirements, let alone to expand our base. That is terrifying for the type of society we believe we need to establish to bring about economic growth in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks further, not only at the number of students who are going into those courses but also at the number of students who are going into all tertiary institutions, as a percentage of our population, we find a decline. In 1977 the figure was 1.32 per cent; in 1978 it was 1.3 per cent; in 1979 it was 1.25 per cent; in 1980 it was 1.21 per cent; and in 1981 it was 1.18 per cent. In other words, there has been a progressive decline in the percentage of our population entering our tertiary institutions. Where are we going in this country in terms of our education if, in fact, we can look with equanimity at those devastating percentages, at that decline in the percentage of our population going into our tertiary institutions?</PARA>
<PARA> I have said publicly in a number of places that the debate about retention rates is misplaced. We are not concerned about dragooning young people into necessarily taking on further courses at school or going directly into tertiary institutions. Indeed, we know from education research that a pause between high school and entering a tertiary institution is a good thing, not a bad thing. So the pertinent figures are not necessarily those of the number of young people entering our tertiary institutions straight from school. In fact, I have argued professionally and will go on arguing that it would be much better if we did not have anybody going straight from school into a tertiary institution. That can be argued on a whole host of bases and not only on an economic basis. It can also be argued on good, educational philosophy grounds.</PARA>
<PARA> The relevant percentage is whether our total percentage of people in those tertiary institutions is growing as a percentage of the population. It is not, as the figures I have just read indicate. It is declining. That is the worry; that is the concern. The percentage is declining in those areas I have just mentioned. I have a range of figures on the declining student load in relation to higher degrees in mathematics and science and they show again a decline. We must stop the decline, turn the situation around and move ahead. Moreover, we must do so rapidly, by way of crash programs. It is not a State matter. To turn those figures around ought to be a Commonwealth priority. It is the responsibility of the Commonwealth to make sure that we have an educated population to support the type of economic society that we believe we will need. We must remember that we have only 18 years left before we reach the year 2000 and that in the interim more than four million young Australians will leave school. We are not talking about the Never Never. We are talking about the immediate future. It is the programs we put in place today that will bear fruit at that time. If they do not people will look back and say, 'It was the programs that were put in place in the 1980s that caused the problems that we face today' . </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to only one of the matters in relation to schools that Senator Ryan raised. It was important that she should have done so. In raising the issue of the funding of particular types of non-government schools she was possibly skating out onto a lake with very thin ice, without necessarily knowing how to get back. Her effort was certainly worth while and I applaud her courage in raising the matter. It is one that is of concern to and a subject of debate in the community. The way in which we handle it is important. I repeat that it is a community issue and I congratulate Senator Ryan for having the courage to raise it. I admit that I have steered clear of it myself. </PARA>
<PARA> Now that she has raised it, I will express the viewpoint of the Australian Democrats concerning a highly contentious area, one that will become more so in the ensuing years. The Australian Democrats do not as a party necessarily subscribe to many of the views that have been expressed by those fringe groups or to what they are teaching in schools. Indeed, we find them abhorrent, but that is not the issue. In a democracy we have to accept a whole range of views, even those with which we do not agree or which we dislike. We have to allow them to exist. A school may be established on the basis of the beliefs of a particular fringe sect such as the Moral Majority of the United States, to which Senator Ryan referred. I find the views of that organisation, as it exists at the moment in the United States, personally abhorrent. Equally, the suggestions that come from it are suggestions that the Australian Democrats have spent their entire existence fighting, and which they will continue to fight. Nevertheless, they may not be breaking any State law. I raise the point with Senator Ryan-on many occasions it has been put to me and I have looked into a number of these organisations-that many of them are running awfully close to the limit of many State laws. I refer not to laws having to do with education but, basically, to those that have to do with the treatment of children. </PARA>
<PARA> We have State laws that apply not only to schools but also to parents in their own homes. Parents have not an absolute right to deal with their children as they will. There are in our society very strict laws to protect and nurture children, to allow them to grow as useful citizens. If the natural parents do not maintain the degree of care of their children that the community holds to be reasonable, the children are taken from them. In most States such laws are pretty tough. Some of these fringe groups may be sailing awfully close to the wind in that regard. I must admit that on the occasions I have examined such organisations as far as I could determine they had not infringed such laws, but I must say that they went awfully close to doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that is the area in which community concern is currently based. There is concern for those children in terms of the type of treatment they are getting in some of those schools. If we move beyond that and think of the types of viewpoints that will be put to those children, I am afraid we have to come down on the basis that we are a democratic society and, much as we as a society may not like and may fight against those views and much as we may hope that those views will never prevail in our society or even be regarded as a reasonable minority voice in the community, we must still, as the Australian Democrats will , allow and fight for the right of those people to express those minority views within the society. The Australian Democrats, as a political minority group in the community, probably are more sensitive than most to that type of view. We believe that we express a reasonable minority view within the community. We believe that we offer an alternative to people within the community. It would hardly be in keeping with the philosophy of our party, which supports very strongly the notion of democracy, to attempt to rub out viewpoints. I remind Senator Ryan that, whilst today we may consider those views as being extreme minority views, there was a time when Christianity was considered to be an extreme minority view. </PARA>
<PARA> The question about funding such schools is extremely important. It really makes no difference to us whether those views be expressed by a minority Christian sect or by a majority mainstream Christian group. It makes no difference to us whether they be expressed by the Hare Khrishna or Catholics within the community . If the principle can apply to Catholics it must apply to other sects in the community providing they remain within the laws of the land that govern all relationships between adults and children. Once again, I am indebted to Senator Ryan for publicly raising this matter. I believe that possibly we can now start a fruitful debate in this area and, I hope, we can get on the table a range of views to see whether we can develop a community consensus on this issue. It probably will be a divisive issue for some time to come, but I think it is useful for it to have been raised. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise a point in relation to the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance ) Amendment Bill. The item of concern here is amalgamations. I have already expressed a concern about where we ought to be going in respect of the overall funding of these institutions. We constantly have expressed the view that tertiary institutions provide us with one of our main life support systems to a reasonable economic future. There are currently available to us within our developed tertiary sector a range of opportunities that we have not pursued vigorously. I have referred in depth and quite extensively on other occasions to the necessity for the individual funding of programs, particularly in the area of biotechnology. We are still not doing that. We are not doing it in anywhere near the type of imaginative, flexible and far-reaching way that we ought to be doing it. We are still investing in pipelines, roads and a whole host of other areas. We still do not have any new imaginative and far-reaching programs in which to invest the intelligence, skills and imagination of our population. I point out to the Senate that this is not the result of lack of imagination or ingenuity within the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said many times that the entire computer industry around the world is in fact based on fundamental research which was done by Australians. Some of the research was carried out here but the majority of it was carried out overseas by Australians. In the biotechnology field Australia has been the leader in a number of specific fundamental areas for some 20 years. We do not lack skills. For example, in Melbourne just after World War II the second mainframe computer in the world was developed. Australia was only something like six to nine months behind the United States in that technological breakthrough. Australia had the skills. How did that industry develop? The computer industry is now the third largest industry in the country. But Australia's second largest import, after petroleum, is computers. That is extraordinary. The computer industry is our third largest industry. It comes after the energy and motor vehicle industries. Yet computers are our second largest import. After we have paid for our fuel, the next bill we have to pay is for our computers. That is a most extraordinary situation for a country which was in the lead when this industry got going. If we invest heavily now in biotechnology we can build on the breakthroughs that Australian scientists have made and give Australia the number one growth industry in the world-an industry which is providing the major part of the growth in the United States economy at the present time, an industry which has put Switzerland's standard of living first in the world, and an industry which is putting Japan high up while Australia is slipping further and further behind. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress again that money spent in the area of tertiary education is money invested in our best resource-human capital. We have the skills, we have the know-how and we have the base. All we need now is the courage to spend money and to invest. In that way we could have a future comparable with that of those other countries. It is in this area of such vital national concern that this Government and the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) bear a heavy burden. They must respond imaginatively. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to move an amendment on behalf of the Australian Democrats to the motion for the second reading of the States Grants (Tertiary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1982, which we are now debating technically. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion add:</PARA>
<PARA> ', but the Senate is of the opinion that it is inappropriate for the Government to threaten the cessation of funds to those institutions which have not presented acceptable proposals for amalgamation to the Minister by the end of this year, and that therefore the Bill should be amended to provide fixed funding levels for the institutions listed in Schedule 18, instead of leaving funds in the National Unallocated Grants to be distributed at the Minister's discretion'. </PARA>
<PARA>This is similar to the amendment formally to be moved by Senator Ryan on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. I will elaborate a little more in the Committee stage but the idea is simply that we do not believe that the Government should make a threat that it does not intend to carry out. I do not believe that this Government intends to cut the throat of an institution to make it healthy. I will elaborate on that point at the Committee stage. Since my time has almost run out, I foreshadow that I will move an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the other Bill we are discussing cognately, the States Grants ( Schools Assistance) Bill 1982. This will have to be moved as an amendment to the Labor Party's amendment, which has been foreshadowed already by Senator Ryan. I foreshadow that I shall move that at the end of the Labor Party's amendment the following words be added:</PARA>
<PARA> , and that increased Commonwealth funding should be provided to promote the language facilities and to assist the language teachers at all schools so that, by 1990, a national language policy can be implemented through which a second language is accepted as an integral part of the learning of every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA>This proposition has been discussed widely in a number of national forums by both the Minister and Senator Chipp. It has been discussed in this place and I believe has general wide support from Ministers and from all honourable senators who wish to see Australia moving towards acceptance of that type of national language program. At the appropriate time I will formally move that amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall not take too much of the time of the Senate, but in the debate on the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill I wish to express some concern that I have about the way in which the present Government's philosophical approach to education has allowed a rise in the number of private schools in the system. I note that according to the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette there has been a rise since 1979 of 139 in the number of non-government schools in Australia. That has taken place at a time when enrolments in schools are generally declining. I note also that 29 of the non-government schools built between 1979 and the current year are based in Victoria. I believe this utilisation of scarce funds to duplicate bricks, mortar and other facilities already in existence within the education system is a waste of taxpayers' money at a time when government school enrolments are declining. Because of that, facilities in many government schools are declining; yet down the street or across the town we see new non-government schools being erected and staffed and provided with all the necessary facilities. In my view, that is a squandering of taxpayers' money. I have noticed it more in rural areas where it stands out a little more clearly than in the cities or metropolitan areas. In western Victoria, at Hamilton High School between 1979 and 1982 there was a decline of 139 students. Yet in 1981 a non-government secondary school was built there.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SO7">Senator PRIMMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is the pill and perhaps that people are moving away from country towns, which has been an historical development over the last 20, 30 or 40 years. The facts are that one government secondary school had a decline in pupils of 139; yet under the philosophical approach of this Government to education another secondary school was built in the town. The same situation applies in places such as Mildura, Shepparton, Warrigal, Murtoa, Nhill, Leongatha, Kerang, Portland, Baxter and Tawonga, to name just a few of the towns in Victoria where this philosophical approach is having its way and where government school numbers are declining. Yet this Government is prepared to fund another school in the same district or in the same town. For example, between 1979 and 1982, in the town of Murtoa the State primary school has seen a decline of 50 pupils. Yet in 1981 a new non-government school opened to pick up the equivalent of those 50 pupils. Again, I believe that is a waste of taxpayers' money. As someone pointed out to me recently, this sort of philosophy divides children not only by creed, country, culture and colour but also within creed and colour-in effect, a nation's children divided within themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I express also my concern over the development of so many so-called Christian schools. Over the recent period since 1979, it seems that more Christian schools have been built in our society than there are Christians in that society, if one wants to be fairly specific about the term 'Christian'. I will read through the list, as it appears in Commonwealth of Australia Gazette of 30 November. The list includes Mulgrave-Bethel Christian School, Bundoora-Northside Christian College, Morwell-Morwell Christian School, Warranwood-Life Christian Academy, Bendigo-Creek Street Christian College, and Campbell's Creek-Olivet Christian College. One can drive through Campbell's Creek, blink twice and not know that one had passed through the joint. Yet it has a Christian college. The list continues with Geelong North-Geelong Christian School, Maribyrnong-Moonee Vale Christian School, Monbulk-Mountain District Christian School, Highton-Christian College, Highton, and Mernda-Plenty Valley Christian School. A whole swath of these so-called Christian schools are being opened up in our society. </PARA>

In my view, Australian customs and culture have already suffered at the hands of the American invasion via advertising, big business and, in particular, television-the Americanisation of Australia, as I describe it. Now they are apparently to be given the opportunity to inculcate Australian children in the classroom.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might help the debate if, to start, I set down briefly five principles on which the Government bases its education policies which have been the subject of so much discussion tonight. We set down equality of opportunity, equity in funding, relevance in what schools offer, excellence of offerings and the development of national cohesion and identity. I believe that those principles are principles which would be endorsed by many Australians and which underpin our funding in education, and certainly in schools which underpin our contribution this year of nearly $1,500m as our share of educational funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the funding of education in Australia, I want to spell out four other principles which underpin the role of the Commonwealth as a funding agency and which, therefore, underpin the policies which are the subject of the Bills which we have been discussing. First, there is not one partner but there are three partners in funding schools in Australia. Those three partners are the Commonwealth Government, the State governments and those private sources which contribute to education. That partnership is an established fact. The relative contributions of the partners may vary or they may evolve over time. But that is a fact-three partners, not one. Any assessment of the resource position of schools must focus on the total contribution of the three partners. Our analysis concentrates on the three partners. The Australian Labor Party analysis assiduously avoids taking into account the contributions of the private sector or the State governments and therefore provides an inaccurate analysis. </PARA>
<PARA> The second principle which underpins our funding of schools is that all students, wherever they go to school, are entitled to support from both Commonwealth and State governments. We believe that is a principle which underlies our funding of education for all Australian children. These Bills provide for that principle to be honoured. Thirdly, we believe that for all schools basic support should be provided by governments, together with additional support according to need. The fourth principle is that we believe that there should be proper accountability, both educational accountability and financial accountability, as part of the deal which underlies our funding. We need to know how the funds are used, and, if possible, we have to know what the educational outcomes are, and we have to know how those outcomes relate to the objectives for which the funds were provided. That is the prudent way to know what has happened to money, and if we are contributors to the government and non -government systems, we might equally ask that question in relation to expenditure in the government system as in the non-government system. </PARA>
<PARA> Against the background of those goals in education and those principles, and against those commitments, the proposals of our political opponents really can be assessed and understood. They do not include in their presentations or their analyses any acknowledgment of the contribution by the States as partners in educational provision, and on that ground alone their figures are false and incomplete. Our opponents also assert that government schools are poor, are badly off, and they assert that independent schools, non-government schools, are wealthy. Those are largely false accusations. Our opponents have apparently forgotten that our object is the welfare of the whole nation, of all schools. We have produced some figures. Senator Martin discussed them tonight. I shall not go over them in detail, but they demonstrate the falsity of the two beliefs-that government schools are poor, and that non-government are wealthy. I remind honourable senators that if we look at the question of pupil-teacher ratios between 1974 and 1981, we see that government schools at secondary level had the best pupil-teacher ratios in Australia. So if we are talking about class size, we know which are the rich schools at secondary level. The best class sizes are in government schools. The worst class sizes are, of course, in the Catholic schools. Our funding is directed largely towards them. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at total cash expenditure across Australia between government schools and non-government schools, we find that the government schools, again, have the best income of all the schools. Looking at all of the sources, we see that the government schools are best off. Certainly at the secondary level they have most money going in each year. Again, it is the Catholic systems which are the poorest. An analysis which has been based upon the fallacy that government schools are poorest is an analysis which leads one to the wrong kinds of policies and the wrong kinds of levels. </PARA>
<PARA> It is disappointing that the Australian Labor Party persists in ignoring the contribution of the three sectors. Looking at the whole picture, it is simply not possible to assert, as our opponents do, that government schools are poorer. I just wish they would stop because it is an inaccurate analysis. It is about time we put the state aid debate and that kind of program aside. Ten years ago we tried to settle this issue. We should concentrate our attention in this debate on the pursuit of educational objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> I must pay tribute to Senator Macklin. He addressed a number of educational issues. I cannot say that Senator Ryan in her speech did anything but make us very sad. I believe that in talking as she did about certain groups on non- government schools she raised the very worst kind of illiberal, unreasonable, inappropriate issues. I hope that people will read Hansard because what she said will stand on its own. She spoke for the Australian Labor Party, she was supported by Senator Primmer in this chamber and she was supported in the Press this morning by Mr Dawkins. I do not want to send my children to accelerated Christian education schools-that is not my cup of tea-but to have Senator Ryan assert that on the basis of their beliefs they are not fit to receive funding, that should be put to either a political or a religious test to determine their eligibility for funding, does no credit to the honourable senator or to her party. She made the kind of illiberal statement that I believe will not help the educational debate or what we are trying to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Any school, to receive funding, must demonstrate its viability, parental demand , that it is registrable and that it is a non-profit organisation. The fact that a school is registrable means that it is acceptable to a State as an educational institution. The honourable senator really suggests that we should look behind State registration and apply tests that are clearly based on the religious or political beliefs of those who run the school. That proposition is entirely unacceptable. I make one final point about non-government schools. Why do parents choose them? They might have narrower offerings. Many of them are in worse surroundings. They have larger class sizes, they have fewer dollars coming in. The parents have to contribute from their after-tax disposable income. There is every kind of disincentive one could think of, yet parents in Australia, for one reason or another, are flocking to enrol their children in non-government schools. Whatever the reasons one wants to attribute to this, it is a fact that should be understood and analysed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Parents are seeing value in sending their children to those schools. I regret that I cannot take the time to discuss this matter with Senator Chipp. Perhaps we could sit down and talk about it some time. I move on to the question that was alluded to by Senator Macklin as the main area of concern to him. I refer to the question of the amalgamations and the way in which the Government is approaching them. This matter is dealt with in the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill. I assert that what we are doing is in the best interests of the educational future, the educational mission and the educational possibilities of the institutions which are affected . It has been alleged that the Commonwealth Government has never set out its reasons for requiring the consolidation of certain colleges of advanced education. That is not true. It is appropriate for me tonight to set down the reasons for the amalgamations. A dominating factor in higher education in Australia in the past few years has been the falling demand for teacher education. This is largely for demographic reasons. The population of that age cohort is dropping. The number of pupils in the schools is no longer growing as it did for about 20 years from the mid-1950s. The Commonwealth Government, when it realised this fall in the need for teacher training, had broadly two options open to it: It could cease to fund certain teacher training institutions-it could in fact close them-and that at least would reduce the number of places and would have been one appropriate response to the falling demand for teacher education, or it could continue to fund their educational programs on the condition that there be a consolidation of the institutions into larger and stronger units.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We looked at the two options, canvassed them and came down in favour of the second option; that we should move to consolidation for a number of reasons which I will set out. That advice was accepted. The arrangements were set in train and an announcement that these consolidations should occur was made in April 1981. We are now at the end of 1982. It has been argued in public-not here in the Senate tonight-that we have rushed the matter. These decisions were announced in April 1981. They were made known to all the institutions involved. A number of them, I must say, did nothing for as long as they could, hoping the issue would go away, but we laid down what was required almost one and two- thirds years ago. Few people who knew what was going on in higher education were surprised that the issue had become urgent or that we took the action we did. For many years it was obvious that this was needed. In 1972 the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts, in a report which led to teachers colleges becoming colleges of advanced education, stressed the need for the consolidation of small teacher education institutions into larger units. The process was advocated also in 1973 in the Cohen report to the Australian Commission on Advanced Education. The issue was in the public as a matter for discussion a decade ago. It was thought to be important then. </PARA>
<PARA> It was at that time in 1973 that Professor Alec Lazenby, the then Vice- Chancellor of the University of New England, attempted to bring about the amalgamation of the two higher educational institutions in Armidale. He tried that in 1973. In 1975 and again in 1977 the Australian Universities Commission and the Commission on Advanced Education respectively advocated the strengthening of teacher education by means of a series of amalgamations bringing together small colleges. In 1978 the Tertiary Education Commission predicted the downturn in numbers and needs, and a series of events culminated in our announcement of April 1981. The Commission gave reasons for what it was proposing and why amalgamation was appropriate. The reasons, each one supported, can be grouped. </PARA>
<PARA> The first reason was that it believed that larger consolidated institutions are better able to handle the problems associated with change, particularly in circumstances in which resources are not freely available. When there is a constraint on resources they are more able to do this than are single purpose institutions. Of course, single purpose institutions were basically those colleges of advanced education which had been teachers colleges. There are a number of reasons why that is so. The second reason for consolidation advanced by the Commission was that larger consolidated institutions are able to offer students a wider range of educational choices and a higher quality of educational programs. There are a number of reasons why that is so. If necessary I will discuss those reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The third reason-not the only primary reason-was that some economies of scale are to be gained from the establishment of larger institutions. The Commission made it quite clear that significant economies are unlikely in the short run but that administrative overhead is likely to be reduced. The Government accepted those recommendations and that reasoning, and consolidation was recommended for 30 institutions. The Commonwealth expressed broad principles as to how that should be done. We did not lay down in great detail how each institution should go about the rationalisation process. We recognised that arrangements would be made best at the local level and that they might vary to meet the particular circumstances of various institutions. As a result of our approach, satisfactory arrangements have been concluded for 26 of the 30 institutions. They are concluded, they are in place, the dust has settled, for 26 of the 30 institutions. The arrangements vary but all the evidence suggests that they will work well and that higher education in the locations will be strengthened in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned a moment ago that several institutions remain. They are the institutions before us tonight in considering the tertiary education Bill. Looking first at Armidale, it is ironical that the greatest determination to refuse to co-operate in implementing the Commonwealth decision occurred at the two institutions at Armidale where just 10 years ago it was clear to most concerned that amalgamation was required. It might interest honourable senators if I quote an extract from the Australian newspaper of 24 January 1973. The headline read: 'University merger plans beaten by politics-Professor'. In that article Professor Alec Lazenby asserted that political considerations had prevented an amalgamation in Armidale. He asserted an amalgamation was necessary and that the educational mission to New England would be set back. The newspaper reported:</PARA>
<PARA> Professor Lazenby said the decision was short-sighted and would have far- reaching effects on the State education system and the university itself. </PARA>
<PARA> He said-</PARA>
<PARA>This is about the decision not to allow amalgamation--</PARA>
<PARA> 'Had the decision been based on reasonable grounds, I would have accepted it without question.'</PARA>
<PARA>He went on and on. At the time that decision was made the Honourable Kim Beazley , the then Commonwealth Minister for Education, criticised New South Wales for not proceeding with that amalgamation. Since 1973 the desire for amalgamation in Armidale has continued. I have been approached by the Pro-Vice-Chancellor of that day, Professor Butland. I have been approached by foundation professors at that University and they have told me that amalgamation was necessary in 1973, that it is necessary now and that in fact it is the intransigence and pride, particularly of a vice-chancellor, that has prevented the parties coming together readily. Against that history and that background, I ask honourable senators to look at what we have sought and to realise that amalgamation was educationally sound 10 years ago, it has been educationally sound since then and still is educationally sound. There has been a decline in full time enrolments at the Armidale College of Advanced Education. That decline has been marked. There has been a 39 per cent drop in full time enrolments in just three or four years. At the nearby University of New England there has been a 27 per cent decline in full time enrolments over the same period. The figures go on. The full time enrolments in those institutions are dropping. </PARA>
<PARA> The other city in which the amalgamation has been sought is Newcastle. Here too there has been a decline in full time enrolments. The two institutions are right next door to each other. At the Newcastle College of Advanced Education full time enrolments dropped by 36 per cent from 1978 to 1982. I stress, they dropped by 36 per cent in that time. At the University of Newcastle the drop was 14 per cent in the same period. Those institutions are dropping their full time enrolments. Why would they not amalgamate when it would produce a strengthened institution with greater offerings? Of course, in both those institutions teacher education was the main feature. Teacher education has been diminishing and in both cases the abolition by the New South Wales Government of teacher- trainee scholarships has not helped. </PARA>
<PARA> Two other teacher education institutions remain to have amalgamation arrangements announced. </PARA>

The Institute of Early Childhood Development and the State College of Victoria have been the subject of amalgamation arrangements which are now being put in place. They do not come into my group of uncompleted arrangements. The Milperra institution is the only institution in south-west Sydney. It is serving an area with a large and growing population. It is clear that special arrangements will be needed to meet the educational needs of south-west Sydney. Using the amalgamation rubric we can see arrangements emerging, in consultation with New South Wales, which will make it possible for an enhanced provision of higher education in the education corridor of south-west Sydney, but we need the amalgamation provisions to bring this about. I have been in recent communication with the State of New South Wales. I have recently received a very lengthy proposal-I am afraid it is confidential; I am not going to table it-from the State Minister which sets out some of the ways in which these arrangements for Milperra might be put into place. The arrangements are in progress and are well advanced. The Hawthorn Institute of Education is unique. It too will need special arrangements but it too is moving particularly because there is a deadline for amalgamation.</PARA></TALK.START>

It may well be that if there is a wage pause some of the amounts allowed for wage increases may not be necessary. Some of the amounts included in these Bills provide for prospective salary and wage increases and, if the wage pause is put into effect, these amounts would not be required. It is not possible to determine what these amounts are at this time as the precise details of the wage pause are, of course , not known.

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The three amendments represent the further amendment of clause 26, also an amendment, on page 44, to Schedule 3. As I said during the second reading debate , they are designed to safeguard the entitlement to funding of institutions that currently are undergoing amalgamation negotiations. As I have said previously, the Opposition believes that the funding of these institutions ought not to be jeopardised if amalgamation procedures run into difficulties, as we expect they will. </PARA>
<PARA> The first amendment requires that amalgamation procedures be agreed to by the State Minister for Education and the Federal Minister for Education. The second provides that, where there is no such agreement, the funding that would otherwise be available to the institution shall still be available to it. The third amendment is a schedule prepared by the Opposition from information obtained from the Higher Education Board in New South Wales and the similar institution in Victoria which sets out as precisely as we have been able to ascertain the amounts of money which would be due to those institutions. I stress that it is our view that if the amalgamation procedures which are not in every case educationally desirable and which are not in every case proceeding smoothly are not finalised to the agreement of the relevant Ministers the funding should be available. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I would like to mention the amalgamation of the two institutions in Orange which were the subject of specific comment in the debate on this matter in the House of Representatives. At that stage the honourable member for Calare, Mr MacKenzie, claimed that he would cross the floor when the vote was taken to protect funding for the institutions in his electorate. In the event, of course, he did not do that. I will be very interested to see what Senator Scott does with regard to these amendments that we have now moved. We believe that if the Government is serious about having amalgamations proceed according to educational criteria it ought to be prepared to support these amendments. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.37)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting these amendments for the reasons that I outlined briefly in my speech during the second reading debate. We believe that, regardless of the merits of the proposed amalgamations, the method by which the Government seeks to proceed is not the correct method for dealing with tertiary institutions. To date the Government has brought a great deal of moral pressure to bear on various tertiary institutions around the country to make them undertake amalgamations that they themselves thought were not necessarily in their best interests. As everybody here is aware, the vast bulk of the amalgamations that the Government announced during its review of Commonwealth functions last year have proceeded. A great number of those amalgamations were accepted by the institutions as having been useful and beneficial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not canvassing in terms of our support of the Australian Labor Party amendments the actual issue of whether the residual amalgamations are or are not beneficial. We are supporting the amendments on the basis that the method by which the Government goes about its dealings with tertiary institutions needs to be of a high level and needs to be done with delicacy. The Government has clearly and openly made a threat that if these amalgamations do not proceed it will cut off the funds of the institutions concerned. Quite frankly that means it is willing to sacrifice those institutions to make them healthy. We do not believe that in any sense that is the way to deal with multimillion dollar institutions. I do not believe for a moment that the Government either politically or educationally could carry out its threat. Therefore, the threat should not be made. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the Government should continue on the line it has proceeded with previously and maintain its moral pressure. The Federal Government can bring considerable moral pressure to bear. I believe that the advances that are currently being made, as the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) has already said, in terms of a number of the institutions which are in question, would suggest that without this legislation those institutions will proceed to amalgamation on an amicable and a reasonable time schedule. It may very well be, as the Minister has also indicated, that there is some intransigence in relation to some of those institutions. But I believe, given good will and constant application on the part of the Minister and the Commonwealth Government, eventually those amalgamations which they are proposing ought to take place will indeed take place. This may not happen within the time frame that the Government wishes but I think necessarily those amalgamations will probably be brought about. I believe that is the method by which one ought to proceed in relation to such institutions. The Government should not adopt this rather heavy handed, 'I am about to kill you off if you don't agree to be nice' type of approach. </PARA>
<PARA> We will support the Australian Labor Party's amendment. We believe it is reasonable for the Commonwealth Government to continue this moral pressure on those institutions to get them to accede to what the Commonwealth Government believes are correct policies. I do not believe, particularly in relation to the proposed amalgamation of the Newcastle College of Advanced Education and the University of Newcastle, that there is necessarily a good educational reason for amalgamation at the moment. However, in relation to the institutions at Newcastle, I believe that a reasonable amalgamation proposal has already been put which is probably acceptable to both institutions. Therefore, I believe that in the high profile case amongst these institions about which we are talking, there probably will be a successful amalgamation of both institutions in the very near future. I think that, as an example, belies the necessity of having such a heavy handed method included in this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief. Three points need to be made in response to the comments that have been offered so far. The Government does not support the amendments and will oppose them. I need to be satisfied-not necessarily immediately but at some time-that arrangements to produce a satisfactory amalgamation have been offered. When I have the promise of arrangements that is enough to allow me to release the money provided for under this legislation. We know that the University of New England and the Armidale College of Advanced Education will proceed to seek from the New South Wales Government an amalgamation once this Bill is passed. We know that because they have said so publicly. Once this Bill is passed they will seek amalgamation. As Senator Macklin said we know that at Newcastle an amalgamation proposal is almost ready. We are aware of the progress being made with the proposed amalgamation of the Milperra College of Advanced Education and the Hawthorn Institute of Education. Finally, in relation to the Orange Agricultural College, if Senator Ryan cares to re-examine the Bill she will find that for 1983 money has been allocated for the Orange Agricultural College. There was no need for any honourable senator to cross the floor. It is not part of the provisions. It is in the national unallocated fund for 1984. Its funds are secured for 1983.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is unable to accept the amendment moved by Senator Macklin. We are very much in agreement with the sentiment in Senator Macklin's amendment, which is that of supporting a national language policy and the opportunity for all children to learn a second language. We very much support that sentiment, but we do not think it appropriate at this stage of the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill to make a specific commitment to funding when the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts is undertaking an inquiry into a national language policy. We do not know how that policy will be formulated, we do not know how it will be implemented throughout schools in Australia; so at this stage we do not really know what the funding commitments will be. Until we have a clearer and more defined educational objective with regard to a national language policy, we do not feel that we can support the amendment moved by Senator Macklin although, as I have said, we are very much in sympathy with the sentiment behind it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very disappointed in what Senator Ryan has just said. I would have thought that, if there was any area in which the Australian Labor Party could have supported an amendment of this kind, it would be in this context. The Minister for Education, Senator Peter Baume, will remember very clearly being on a platform with me, Senator Don Grimes and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Hodges, when the four of us spoke about a national language policy. On that occasion, Senator Grimes strongly pledged the Labor Party's support for that concept. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs at least had the guts to stand up before 300 of the top representatives of the ethnic community of Australia and to say: 'I do not agree with you'. He got into serious trouble for that. Senator Peter Baume was more amenable to that proposition. I hope that the Government will find support for the Democrats' amendment, but the point I am making is that at least a Government Minister was honest in his opposition to it .</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what the Opposition is doing. If members of the Opposition want to raise a Donnybrook, I will accommodate them in a flash. It is all very well for their Deputy Leader in the Senate to stand up in front of 300 ethnic community representatives and say: 'The Labor Party is all for this'. Yet when Opposition members have an opportunity to vote for an amendment in support of a national language policy, to a motion on a Bill before the Senate, to send the Bill back to the House of Representatives, they say that we are talking platitudes. The ethnic communities will be able to determine who is talking platitudes and who is fair dinkum about this. Therefore, I invite the Labor Party to think again about this. One of its members is on record, in front of 300 representatives of the ethnic community, as supporting a national language policy. That is all this amendment seeks to do.</PARA></TALK.START>

How many times are meaningless second reading amendments put before the Senate by the Labor Party expressing a point of view yet, because we believe in the sentiments of those amendments, we have supported them?

Maybe in future we will have to look carefully when the Labor Party puts up what it believes is a meaningful amendment to a motion for the second reading of a Bill. We will have to ask ourselves whether it is meaningful or whether it is just a platitude. I am confounded by the attitude of the Labor Party on this issue. </PARA>

I am sorry that the debate has degenerated into a question of who is the most platitudinous in this place. I think that there would be many starters for that prize.

<PARA> I should have thought that, if one consulted the language teachers who are most concerned about this matter, one would find that they are concerned first about the question of policy development. I am not sure that there is much disagreement between the parties on that question-except that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hodges) did not seem to understand what it was about at that forum. All that the words to be added say is that increased Commonwealth funding should be provided. We agree with that. But, as Senator Ryan has pointed out, it is highly desirable that the Senate committee, for example, which is working on the question of how a national languages policy should be implemented should at least reach some conclusion on that issue before an amendment is necessary here to provide funding for something of which we do not know the full details and nature until that committee is concluded. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember that we had a disagreement with Senator Chipp about an issue such as this over South West Tasmania. We were not prepared to support a proposition of the Democrats in the Senate about South West Tasmania while a committee was sitting on the issue. It is exactly the same in this context. We should not get excited about that. It is not in any sense a rejection of-</PARA>

But, additionally, I have to say that the Democrats' proposal is to add words to the Australian Labor Party's proposal, and the Labor Party's proposal, if we are talking about platitudinous motions, is the most platitudinous of platitudinous motions. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>but the Senate is of the opinion that grants to all schools should be fully adjusted to take account of cost increases experienced by those schools. </PARA>
<PARA>If ever I have seen a platitudinous motion, that is one. It is not consistent with the Labor Party policy as has been expressed by its spokesman on education and, particularly, as has been expressed in the debate in the chamber tonight, because it is evident, both from the Labor Party spokesman for education and from the Labor Party speakers in the Senate tonight, that there will be some schools which will have reduced moneys, and yet the Labor Party put forward a platitudinous motion suggesting that the Senate is of the opinion that grants to all schools should be fully adjusted-</PARA>

<PARA> (2) (a)-The Budget estimate of the cost of the family income supplement (FIS) scheme of $30 million in a full year was based on preliminary income data obtained from the Disadvantaged Persons Scheme (DPS) health care card program, as the low income limits under DPS are generally the same as those proposed for payment of the FIS. Allowance was made for about one-third more families applying for the FIS than for health care cards. Using the same data, it is estimated that the full year cost of a FIS paid at $15 a week per child would be in the order of $45 million. This makes no allowance for persons with income outside the present limits who would become eligible if the limits increased in line with the increased rate of payment. This estimate is extremely rough due to the lack of up to date data on the characteristics of low income families in the population.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 17 November 1982 (Hansard, page 2394), Senator Coleman asked me, as Minister representing the Prime Minister, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer to a background report by the Australian Science and Technology Council entitled 'Australian Science and Technology in International Co-operation and Development Assistance.' I ask: What is the nature of the agreement with the Philippines, dated 8 August 1978, relating to co-operation in peaceful uses of nuclear energy and the transfer of nuclear materials? What activities have so far been undertaken? What are presently being undertaken? What authorities, national or international, oversee those activities.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines concerning Co-operation in Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy and the Transfer of Nuclear Material is an international treaty. The Agreement was negotiated in accordance with the requirements of the Government' s Nuclear Safeguards Policy announced by the Prime Minister on 24 May 1977. The Agreement was signed on 8 August 1978 and presented in Parliament on 24 August 1978 in accordance with the established practice for such agreements. The statement made by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs provides a full explanation of the Agreement. (See House of Representatives Hansard of 24 August 1978.) The Agreement is one of 10 covering 17 countries making up the present network of Australia's bilateral agreements concerning the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.</PARA>
<PARA> On the second and third questions: no activities have taken place under the agreement to date.</PARA>
<PARA> On the fourth question: while as yet no activities have been undertaken under the Agreement, it provides that the States which are parties to it accept responsibility in accordance with international law for its implementation and the fulfilment of the obligations contained in it. As in all international agreements the two parties to the Agreement are responsible for overseeing activities undertaken under it. In the case of this Agreement provision is also made for stipulated government authorities to oversee aspects of the activities concerned. In the case of Australia the stipulated governmental authority is the Australian Safeguards Office and in the case of the Philippines the stipulated governmental authority is the Philippines Atomic Energy Commission. The Agreement also recognises that the International Atomic Energy Agency is applying safeguards to such activities in both Australia and the Philippines in accordance with their agreements with the Agency pursuant to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 10 November 1982 (Hansard, page 2109), Senator Tate asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and is supplementary to that asked by Senator Primmer concerning the general question of aid to the Philippines in the light of its treatment of an Australian national, Father Gore. I ask: Given the pattern of harassment, planting of evidence, concoction of charges and idenfinite detention by the military and its lackeys, of which Father Gore is only the latest victim, will the Australian government immediately terminate any assistance to the Philippines military which is running at the rate of over $1,343,000 this year. Can the Minister explain why the Australian taxpayer should fund even partially a corrupt and brutual military regime which thereby has more of its own money to spend on the suppression of the poor, the oppressed and the downtrodden of that sad nation?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to that part of the honourable senator's question dealing with military aid:</PARA>
<PARA> Australian military assistance to the Philippines is part of the Australian Government's Defence Co-operation Program with countries of South East Asia, Papua New Guinea and the South West Pacific which is designed to develop the capacity for self-reliance of countries in areas of strategic importance to Australia who share our strategic concerns.</PARA>
<PARA> By contributing to regional stability we also assist in providing conditions which are conducive to peaceful national development.</PARA>
<PARA> The program is weighted towards activities that develop defensive rather than offensive capabilities and which assist neighbours to acquire technical and managerial skills which the Australian Services are well-equipped to provide.</PARA>
<PARA> Successive Australian Governments have recognised that the Defence Co- operation Program is important to Australian defence objectives and accorded them commensurate priority. Co-operation programs with the Philippines have run continuously since 1973. Such co-operation, whilst serving the interests of both parties, clearly does not imply on the part of either endorsement of any or all of the other's policies.</PARA>
