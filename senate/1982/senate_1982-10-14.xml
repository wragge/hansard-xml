<PARA> The Committee has noted from the Explanatory Statement that, prior to the making of the Regulations, compensation claims by employees of the High Court of Australia ''have been handled by ex-gratia arrangements'' and would like to know , firstly, why such arrangements were made, and, secondly, the reasons for the delay in making Regulations governing compensation for High Court employees. </PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Social Security Parliament House Canberra, A.C.T. 2600</PARA>
<PARA>27 September 1982</PARA>
<PARA>My dear Senator</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 13 September 1982 wherein you sought information concerning the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Regulations contained in Statutory Rules 1982, No. 117. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of background I should explain that when the High Court of Australia Act 1979 came into operation on 21 April 1980, the High Court was given responsibility for its own administrative affairs in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Unfortunately this legislation did not make reference to the application of the provisions of the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971 to the staff employed under the High Court of Australia Act. As a consequence some degree of doubt arose as to whether certain staff of the High Court were persons to whom the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act applied. </PARA>
<PARA> Legal advice received from the Attorney-General's Department in November 1980 suggested that there was a measure of doubt whether in all the circumstances the Compensation Act applied to persons the subject of arrangements under section 26 (6) of the High Court of Australia Act and employees engaged under section 26 (3 ) of that Act. It was suggested that such doubt could be removed if appropriately worded regulations were made under section 7 (5) of the Compensation Act. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time of receiving this advice my department was working on a review of the provisions of Regulation 11 of the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Regulations which provided statutory workers compensation coverage to certain classes of persons in special relationship with the Commonwealth. This review envisaged possible amendments to Regulation 11 and it was intended that the High Court issue be resolved at the time of the other possible amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The broader review raised policy difficulties which have still to be resolved. When my Department realised that delay was resulting, the High Court issue was excised from the broader question. I approved the issuance of instructions for the drafting of the necessary amendment to Regulation 11 to put beyond doubt the application of the Compensation Act to employees of the High Court on 4 October 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> While doubt was expressed as to whether some staff of the High Court were persons to whom the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act applied , it did appear that the High Court could be under an obligation to provide workers' compensation coverage for its staff under state or territorial legislation if coverage was not available under the Commonwealth Act. </PARA>
<PARA> As an interim measure, the High Court, with the concurrence of the Department of Finance, adopted an administrative arrangement for the handling of any compensation that arose. </PARA>
<PARA> The interim arrangement was that the Court would request the Commissioner for Employees' Compensation-the statutory office-holder charged with determining claims under the Compensation Act-to examine each claim that arose as if the claimants were employees of the Commonwealth and to advise the amount of compensation that would be payable if the claimants were such employees. Pursuant to its powers under section 17 of the High Court Act, the Court would pay such amounts of compensation as the Commissioner advised from funds appropriated by Parliament for the purpose of the Court under section 35 of the High Court of Australia Act. I am advised that twelve compensation claims have been handled on this basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I should point out to the Committee that similar administrative arrangements apply the benefits of the Compensation Act to Ministers, Senators and Members of Parliament. Payment of such claims are by way of an act of grace authorised by the Minister for Finance acting pursuant to section 34A of the Audit Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA> As mentioned in the explanatory statement which accompanied Statutory Rules 1982, No. 117, the purpose of applying the regulation retrospectively was to ensure that employees of the High Court who suffered injury or disease prior to the making of Rule 117 would have a right to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal if they were dissatisfied with a decision made in respect of such a claim. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services. Did the Minister for Finance, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, reveal to a Senate Estimates committee that $52m was spent by the Government on consultants in 1981-82? Did this amount include $2.8m spent by the Department of Administrative Services? Has the Department of Administrative Services budgeted for an expenditure of $270,000 this financial year for a series of surveys on major public issues including unemployment, pensions and education? Will the Minister provide the results of these surveys in detail, as they become available to the Government, since they are being funded by taxpayers' money?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am unable to confirm the particulars outlined by Senator Button as regards the payments to consultants in 1981-82. Nor am I able to confirm the amount included in the Budget for this year. I would need to check that with the Minister and I undertake to do so. The honourable senator mentioned an amount of $270,000 in regard to surveys. I take it that that relates to the total information services that are provided by the Department of Administrative Services. They are included in the total vote we discussed in this place yesterday during the debate on a matter of public importance. However , I will check that matter also for Senator Button.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I imagine that it would require special consideration to determine whether any information obtained as a result of this kind of survey, which obviously relates to the formation of advertising, marketing and information material of various kinds, ought to be made public. I will refer that part of the question to my colleague and endeavour to obtain a reply for Senator Button as soon as possible .</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a much more intelligent question which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence Support. The question refers to a newspaper report that Japan's Toyota group has won a contract worth more than $ 5m for the sale of 832 vehicles to the Australian Army by early next year. The contract comprises 417 commuter buses and 215 diesel four-wheel drive Land Cruisers. The vehicles are to be supplied through the national commercial marketing distributor for the group, Thiess Toyota Pty Ltd. What is the Australian content of the vehicles in this contract? Has there been any arrangement for offsets for the foreign component of this contract?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lewis has asked a very intelligent question. It is one which is of very significant concern to the Australian public at this time when there is considerable interest in the future development of Australian industry.

The value of Australian content approximates the normal offsets target of around 30 per cent. Clearly, the purpose behind Senator Lewis's question is well evidenced by his interest in Australian industry. He, like the Government, is concerned to ensure that Australian industry does get a fair share of this kind of Department of Defence Support business. This question demonstrates the Government's concern in that area. Advantages will flow to Australian industry as a result.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A precedent has been set in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In any event, although it is perhaps in breach of Standing Orders, I think it is harmless and I do not object to dealing with it. The legislation is substantial and contains a series of amendments to implement the very many changes announced in the Budget, most of which, of course, represent extensions of pensions and benefits and indeed, in a couple of cases, the institution of totally new forms of assistance, namely, the family income supplement and the mobility allowance. It also contains some amendments which tidy up the drafting and, in a couple cases, correct what have been seen as drafting errors. The first of the two cases of drafting error that immediately spring to my mind is that referred to by Senator Colston, which affects the administration of supplementary assistance payable to those who are in welfare housing. The second is in a field in which we have had the rather odd situation that people on supporting parent's benefit have been subject to a different income test arrangement from that to which widows have been subject. So, although there is great comparability between those benefits, the recipient of supporting parent's benefit has had an advantage in cases where he or she is receiving maintenance for the children from the non-supporting spouse. Thus, amendments in the legislation introduced in the Senate last night do touch on the area raised by Senator Colston.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The original understanding of the Government and of the Department was that the amendments, as drafted, would ensure that the saving clause operated to permit those who were receiving supplementary assistance, and who were resident in State welfare housing, to continue to receive that assistance. That sort of grandfather clause, if you will, was included in the legislation on the basis that, for people on relatively modest incomes, the loss of income would be felt quite significantly. A pensioner receiving $5 a week in supplementary assistance who suddenly lost it would find it very difficult to make the adjustment. Therefore, a decision was taken to maintain supplementary assistance where it was being received at the time of the amending legislation. It was thought that that provision meant that if a pensioner ceased to be eligible for supplementary assistance under the pre-existing rules-which could occur where, for example, a pensioner obtained non-pension income-it would be the end of that entitlement. In other words, the objective in maintaining in the legislation the pre-existing benefit was to prevent a sudden diminution of income due to the change in the form of assistance granted. It is a difficult area because, whatever decision is made-other than to extend universal benefits-it gives rise to an awkward cut-off point. However, the decision of the Government was that we should avoid a sudden reduction in pensioner income due to a loss of entitlement to supplementary assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> However, where the pensioner subsequently lost the entitlement to supplementary assistance under the old rule-it could occur only through either not having to pay rent or receiving an increased income-it was thought that that would be the end of the matter. I believe that subsequently a legal opinion was obtained on it. But in any event the legislation was more closely examined and it was found that as drafted it provides that, where someone was on supplementary assistance at the time of the new legislation and ceased to be eligible for supplementary assistance, that eligibility can be revived by returning to the same condition. As that was not intended, it is proposed to amend the law to ensure that the grandfather clause operates only until the entitlement to supplementary assistance under the old rules is destroyed by a change of circumstance. The relevant changes of circumstance are either that one ceases to pay rent or that one's non-pension income increases in a way which under the income test removes the entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA> That would probably be one of the less clear answers I have given to the Senate . It is a complicated matter and I will carefully examine the reply I have given to Senator Colston and clarify it if necessary.</PARA>

As far as the administration of the section subsequent to February is concerned, it is my understanding, from memory of minutes given to me some months ago, that the Department administered the section in accordance with its understanding of the meaning of the provision . In other words, it administered it so that the entitlement was extinguished by a change of circumstance of the sort that I have outlined. Whether there was any change subsequent to the reinterpretation is a matter which I will have to check . As far as the instructions that were issued by my Department in respect of the administration of the Act are concerned, I will look at that. There is normally no difficulty about producing them and I do not envisage that there will be in this case.

It is a matter of judgment-thank God it is a matter of judgment and not a matter of government compulsion or duress-as to the choice of diet by people. I repeat what I said in answer to Senator Crichton-Browne. The States all know the state of the world market, the size of the domestic market and the price of sugar. In that knowledge, it is quite competent for any State to promote particular agriculture.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Acting Attorney-General. Is it correct that, since the Commonwealth first proposed the establishment of a national crimes commission many months ago, no State or Territory has supported the proposal in its present form; the States and the Northern Territory have acknowledged that there is a serious problem of organised crime which ought to be tackled as a matter of priority; and both the Australian Police Ministers Council and the Standing Committee of Attorneys- General have approached the matter very positively and have, in accordance with their own initiative and the direction of the June Premiers Conference, undertaken detailed consideration of a number of options? Is it correct that at a joint meeting of the Australian Police Ministers Council and the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General on 24 September substantial progress was made and there was substantial consensus on the kind of structure which might be established to deal with the problems, and that at that meeting it was agreed that further work would be undertaken by officers prior to another joint meeting to finalise an agreement? Finally, is it correct that, notwithstanding the extensive process of consultation and negotiation which has been undertaken between the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory in relation to a crimes commission, and notwithstanding a substantial measure of consensus, the Commonwealth proposes to proceed with the establishment of a Commonwealth crimes commission in the current session, having now unilaterally suspended further meaningful discussion with the States? Why has the Federal Government taken such action and what was the purpose of the negotiations and discussions in the first place?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Is it the case that the Prime Minister on Tuesday clearly acknowledged, if only by implication, that the sale of the companies of which Mr John Reid was a director involved a dry Slutzkin or accummulated profits scheme and that this was confirmed on the radio program AM yesterday morning by his one time fellow director Mr Moore who stated that the shares had been sold rather than the companies being wound up in order to reduce the tax payable by the shareholders? Is the Minister further aware that the dry Slutzkin schemes involving dividend stripping were specifically outlawed in May 1981 by the new sections 177D and 177E of the Income Tax Assessment Act, being described by the Treasurer at the time as blatant, contrived, artificial and beyond the bounds of reasonableness? Finally, does the Government still maintain that it is perfectly proper to appoint to head a public inquiry into, among other things, standards in the Public Service a person who, as a company director, was knowingly involved in a tax avoidance scheme which has been roundly condemned by the Treasurer and now specifically prohibited by this Government's legislation?</PARA></TALK.START>

I am surprised that Senator Evans is looking selectively to one person and not to another, since the facts are similar. The fact is that the companies that are being outlawed by the recoupment of tax scheme of this Government are companies which did not pay their company tax and used the excess of company tax to be transferred by capitalisation and gain to shareholders. The Commissioner of Taxation has made it abundantly clear that in respect of the companies of which Mr Reid was a trustee and from which he gained no benefit in terms of the shares-he was acting , I think, for the estate of a deceased friend-all company tax was paid.</PARA></TALK.START>

So knowingly they received an extra amount of money for their shares above their ordinary value which could come about only because company tax had not been paid and therefore they gained in a capital accretion to their shares that value of money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A dry Slutzkin is a situation in which the company tax had been paid.

My gosh, how low can one get in this situation? The shares were sold after the company tax had been paid. So quite clearly that liability had gone. Also it is a situation in which the High Court of Australia has ruled that the transaction is legal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Part of Senator Coates's question requires an answer in great detail. I will have to seek that detail. He wants to know the numbers of people involved in certain activities. I will ask my colleague, Mr Carlton, whether he can provide that information. However, I am aware that the Fraud and Over-servicing Detection System has directed itself to finding ways of detecting not only over-servicing but also fraud and that methods have been developed which are throwing up a number of these circumstances. I would not pretend-I do not think Senator Coates would expect us to pretend-that we can guarantee that every instance or case will come to light under these procedures. But, having briefly been Minister for Health and having seen the system in operation and how the officers have developed it, I have no doubt that it does bring to light a large number of doctors whose affairs need further investigation. The fact that they are thrown up by FODS does not of itself mean that they have taken part in any fraud or any over-servicing. For example, a patient with extraordinary but legitimate requirements might cause that billing experience to be thrown up by the computer. But it might turn out, on examination, that that has been entirely proper. The system does throw up people who do require further examination. It is on those people who are thrown up by the computer that inquiries are now concentrated. It is as a result of those concentrated inquiries that some examples of fraud and over-servicing are emerging. I cannot give details at present as to exactly what is going on in Tasmania. I will seek them for Senator Coates.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister representing the Minister for Health aware of proposed changes with respect to the prescription of National Health Service drugs in hospitals by medical practitioners? At present medication is prescribed by a doctor on daily ward rounds and if any changes come up he phones the ward sister or the hospital and those changes are validated subsequently by a prescription being written. As I understand the new legislation for NHS drugs, the doctor will be required to be physically present to sign that script before any authorisation for change can take place. This may be possible where resident doctors are present in government hospitals. But will there not be difficulties in private hospitals if a medical practitioner has to be present to authorise that change?</PARA></TALK.START>

Is it true that a planned visit to the South Australian industrial town of Whyalla by the Prime Minister next week has now been cancelled?

In view of the fact that the new federalism, as practised by the Prime Minister and the South Australian Premier, has given South Australia the highest unemployment rate of all mainland States, unbearably high housing interest rates, the highest taxation burden in Australian history and cutbacks in services to the community, especially in the areas of health and education, I invite the Prime Minister to review his decision and to come to South Australia to explain to the State, and especially the 50,000 unemployed in South Australia, why there is such an economic disaster at the moment.

I can only say, having been to these areas in recent times, that there is an enormous and welcome interest in what the Commonwealth is doing. Since Senator Bolkus has drawn attention to the difficulties facing South Australia, let me say that the difficulties of South Australia in providing industrial employment for its people lie entirely in the years when the lotus was eaten, when the Dunstan Government was in office.

I will try to avoid breaching the Standing Orders in any way by simply commenting, without giving a legal opinion, on the question raised by my colleague Senator Thomas. The matter of Ord River sugar has become quite contentious and its treatment is complicated by the fact that there are national media. It is very difficult to say one thing in Queensland and something different in Western Australia. What one says in Queensland tends to follow one back to Western Australia and vice versa. A number of the important elements in the debate need to be borne very carefully in mind. One is that there is no power in the Commonwealth to control land use. The use to which land is put in Australia is a matter either for private commercial decision or for State government regulation. One important thing to be remembered is that it is not the Commonwealth which will determine whether a particular crop is grown in any particular place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Constitution guarantees certain rights to people. The provisions of section 92 are well known even to all honourable senators and indeed to many citizens. That is a substantial restriction on the ability of government to fetter interstate trade and internal commerce in Australia.

I said that I would give him a reply. I gave him an interim reply on that day, 12 October. My understanding is that the Treasurer in another place today has given a reply to a similiar question. First of all, I think Senator Walsh asked who made the actual approach on behalf of the Prime Minister. The approach was made at the level of the Department of Administrative Services, which is responsible for royal commissions. I believe that it was either the head of that Department or the Minister. There were discussions with Mr Costigan. From those discussions it emerged that he himself was considering making, over a period, some wider inquiries into Western Australia and other matters, and that the matter may take some time. He also felt that, if he were to be doing it, it would be under the Royal Commission, and that in that case perhaps the Royal Commission would need extended terms of reference. The Government felt that, if he were to do it , he might do it as a Queen's Counsel and not on the full basis of a royal commission, particularly as that would take so long.

<PARA>They were defended in this place by Labor.</PARA>
<PARA>The clear implication of that statement is that the Australian Labor Party in this place defended the criminal activities of certain ship painters and dockers . For the purpose of the record, I just want to say that there is not one tittle of evidence advanced by anyone, including Senator Sir John Carrick, in support of that proposition. In the course of interjections, I happened to mention that the statement that Senator Sir John Carrick made was in my view a lie, and because of the Standing Orders I withdrew that allegation. The fact is that the criminal activities of the ship painters and dockers have not been defended by Labor politicians in this place or anywhere else.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to make reference to the political record in relation to this matter. The fact is that it was a Labor Government that first set up an inquiry into payments to maritime unions-the so-called Sweeney inquiry-which had the status of a royal commission. In its report to this Parliament-I do not have the document here to quote from it-Mr Justice Sweeney, as he subsequently became, sought extended terms of reference to examine questions related to tax avoidance and tax evasion involving the ship painters and dockers. It was the Fraser Government which, in 1976, terminated the activities of that inquiry by Mr Justice Sweeney, as he became, and refused to extend the terms of reference to inquire into that matter. A month ago I asked in the Senate whether that was correct. I have not yet received an answer for reasons which I think are fairly obvious. I am talking about the governmental record in relation to the ship painters and dockers organisation. It is quite true that following the publication of the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union the Labor Party became aware, as did the Government-in the case of the Labor Party certainly for the first time and I believe in the case of the Government for the first time-that ship painters and dockers were involved as agents for and accessories to large white collar criminals in the Australian community in relation to tax matters amongst other things. The first time that the Labor Party became aware of this matter was the publication of the Costigan report.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is part of the burden of Senator Sir John Carrick's argument, when answering questions on a number of issues relating to ship painters and dockers, to suggest from time to time that the Labor Party has condoned the criminal activities of certain ship painters and dockers-for example for murder, robbery and things of this kind-which took place over a number of years.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to make our position quite clear on this matter. If the honourable senator wants to say that the Labor Party defends ship painters and dockers I will say that as far as I am concerned I do, in terms of the legitimate activities of ship painters and dockers which undoubtedly exist. Undoubtedly many ship painters and dockers who perform that craft or trade are not subject, in my view, to criticism in any way. However, there are other ship painters and dockers who engage in criminal activities. I think it is an important distinction to make. If one wants to reduce this argument to its absolute absurdity, the major crimes committed by ship painters and dockers have been committed in Victoria. They were all committed in the course of Liberal governments in that State and those governments were singularly unsuccessful in prosecuting for criminal offences members of the ship painters and dockers organisations. This is reducing the argument to an absurdity.</PARA>
<PARA> Since the Labor Government came to power in Victoria there have been no criminal activities by ship painters and dockers. That is an absurd argument but it is the level of debate which takes place in this chamber in relation to these sorts of matters. I suppose what brings this sort of response from Senator Sir John Carrick, when answering questions, is the 'my daddy is a policeman' argument and the 'we might be awful but you are just as bad' argument. This seems to reduce politics to its lowest common denominator. If one deals with that argument, this Government has been singularly unsuccessful in spite of repeated requests from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in getting rid of people in the Liberal Party described by the Prime Minister of this country as tax cheats.</PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party has not been so unsuccessful. When it learnt of the Costigan Commission findings that ship painters and dockers were heavily involved in tax evasion and subsidiary activities to white collar crime the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) announced that a decision would be taken by the National Executive of the Labor Party to disaffiliate that organisation. It is absolutely true to say that the ship painters and dockers disaffiliated themselves before that decision was taken. However the National Executive of the Labor Party took a decision, noting that the ship painters and dockers had disaffiliated themselves and determining that they would not be re-affiliated with the Australian Labor Party until such time as the issues and allegations against the ship painters and dockers organisation had been dealt with and determined by the courts. That is an appropriate position for any political party to take.</PARA>
<PARA> I put those matters on the record because I think it is important to look at the records of respective governments in relation to these sorts of activities. I think it is important to distinguish between criminal activities and categorising a whole group of people as being reprehensible-if I can use a word that once became fashionable in this Parliament. The allegation that the criminal activities of the ship painters and dockers were defended by Labor in this place is totally untrue. If Senator Sir John Carrick alleges that it is not untrue I ask him to substantiate that any Labor leader or member has defended criminal activities of ship painters and dockers.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is that what I said then is absolutely true; that is, that the Ship Painters and Dockers disaffiliated itself. Therefore, the outburst was quite unnecessary. The fact is that Senator Button, in his personal explanation, has sought to narrow the matter down to this: To narrow the Painters and Dockers down to white collar crime. He said that when the Labor Party discovered that the Painters and Dockers Union was engaged in white collar crime it set out to disaffiliate itself. The point I have made is that in general terms, over the years, the Painters and Dockers Union has been known to have a record of bloody murder and violence, and the Labor Party has taken no action in that regard. In fact, on Senator Button's own statement today-and Hansard will bear this out-he said that the Labor Party reacted to white collar crime, not to other things. He also said that he would defend the Painters and Dockers as a union. I would, of course, defend any authentic trade union or any authentic trade unionist who was acting lawfully. But I remind him of what the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union said. It said, in effect, that the Ship Painters and Dockers Union was not a trade union; that it was an organisation of criminals organised to recruit criminals for criminal purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I respond only because I think the personal explanations have gone too far anyhow. In the first place I only respond on the subject matter of this situation. The fact is that the whole of my answer to the question was to the effect that Labor had been selective; that Labor would draw upon people whose records have proved to be clear, but in a selective way avoid entirely others, for example, an appointee of the Wran Government, avoid people who may have been associated with Labor. I put it to the Senate that that was a very appropriate line of argument to take. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise this matter today in very specific terms and the specific terms as stated in the matter of public importance are:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The continuing failure of the Federal Government to grant freehold title to Aboriginal and Islander people to their reserve lands in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>The point of the terms being so specific is this: There is no freehold title in Queensland. The State Government in Queensland has made it perfectly clear on numerous occasions that it has no intention of granting freehold title. In recent times, the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has made it clear that he, too, has no intention of using the constitutional powers that this Parliament has to grant freehold title in Queensland. This is of ongoing and serious concern not only to all fair-minded Australians but also increasingly to fair-minded people throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators will be aware, the Commonwealth Games in Brisbane have just concluded. I should like to say, as Opposition members have said on other occasions, that we regard the Commonwealth Games as having been a success. We, along with all Australians, were delighted by the performance of our athletes. We were delighted by the way in which the Commonwealth community of athletes was able to participate in sporting events, by the standard of the events, and by the obvious pleasure and pride that the Games gave to all the participants and those who attended and, I might say, those who were able to view the Games through Australian Broadcasting Commission television, which did an excellent job also in bringing the Games to people throughout Australia. However, everybody who paid any attention at all will be aware that the Games was not the only thing happening in Brisbane in the last couple of weeks. The other issue was the matter of the Aboriginal land rights protests which, in contrast to the Games, is an issue which causes shame to Australians. Increasingly, this is a matter of which the world community is aware. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Games may be over but the issue of land rights in Queensland is not over, nor will it be over until such time as freehold title to land is accorded to the Aboriginal and Islander people. The failure of both the Queensland Government and the Federal Government to achieve freehold land title for Aboriginals meant that the Games were, to some extent, overshadowed by this blot on our national character. The international media, quite rightly, took a great deal of interest in these matters and made extensive reports throughout the world on this gross defect in the situation in Queensland, a defect for which the Federal Government is also responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> We know what happened during the Games. Several hundred land rights protesters, Aboriginal people and their supporters, were arrested. Tens of thousands of dollars were spent on bail and fines for protesters. Although this is peripheral to the major point, it will cause much hardship amongst the Aboriginal community , already the most grossly impoverished section of the Australian community. The point I want to make is that those arrests should not have happened, not because the cause is not just or because our sympathies are not with the people who support that cause, but because that Act should never been enacted. I should like to take this opportunity to say also that the land rights protestors showed great restraint in their activities during the Commonwealth Games. Their demonstrations were peaceful and there was no attempt to disrupt the Games. I think that is a point that ought to go on the record and is a matter about which the organisers of the Games and all authorities who had control of the Games ought to express appreciation. There was no disruption of the Games. There was no attempt to disrupt the Games, and the demonstrations were peaceful. There was no violent protest by the demonstrators. Any minor violence which occurred did so in the process of the police carrying out their arrests, but the protests were never violent. This, I think, is something that ought to be noted, and on the part of the Australian Labor Party it is certainly appreciated that those who chose this forum to make their very just protests acted in a very responsible manner. </PARA>
<PARA> One might ask why a large number of arrests were made. Why did people viewing the Games and the news items associated with the Games witness large numbers of Aboriginal people and their supporters being arrested? It was not because of the behaviour of the protesters but because of the existence of an Act brought into being by the Queensland Government to overcome the fact that it had failed in its duty to grant freehold title to Aboriginal people. If the matter of land rights in Queensland had been settled, and the Federal Opposition made every attempt in this place and elsewhere to get that matter settled, then the Act would not have been necessary and the demonstrations would not have taken place.</PARA>
<PARA> The claim, as I have said many times, and I believe it is a claim that an increasing number of Australians support, is that the Aboriginal and Islander people are entitled to freehold title for less than 2 per cent of Queensland land. That less than 2 per cent is the land covered by existing reserves. The Queensland Government says that it wants the Aboriginal people to continue to have the use of that land. It is not trying to move them off the land and yet it will not give them secure title to that land. In the face of the repression by the Queensland Government and the continual racist statements by Ministers of that Government, the Aboriginal people turned, rightly, to the Federal Government. They sought action by the Federal Government to solve the problem of land in Queensland. What did the Federal Government do? In the House of Representatives it refused to vote on a Bill which would have solved the problem and then subsequently the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), to the horror of all people who have supported this cause, made a statement in support of the Queensland Government and its legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, there is no doubt that the interest of the international media was as much focused on what was happening with the land rights protests as it was on the Games. I draw the Senate's attention to the way in which Australia's performance with regard to its Aboriginal citizens in the State of Queensland has been reported in the world media. This is what Americans read in their 11 October issue of Newsweek:</PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year, the Queensland Government charged that Aborigines had received military guerrilla training in Libya and were setting up secret guerrilla camps, assisted by militant New Zealand Maoris. Aborigine leaders denied the accusations and insisted that their demonstrations demanding land concessions would be peaceful. But the Government then passed special legislation suspending many civil liberties, including protection from unwarranted searches and seizures, for the duration of the sporting events. Police riot squads were issued with formidable new weapons, and an official ban was slapped on public discussion of security arrangements for the games. Queensland's avowedly reactionary Premier, Johannes Bjelke-Petersen, boasted to reporters: 'They can protest until they're black in the face, but they won't get land rights.'</PARA>
<PARA>The article by Carl Robinson and Spencer Reiss went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The message that many will take home from the games is clear. 'There is growing awareness that something is very wrong in Australia.'</PARA>
<PARA>For his attempt to enlighten Americans about the other side of the Friendly Games, Mr Robinson received a rap over the knuckles by the Department of Foreign Affairs at the instigation of the Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser. This was reported in the Age on 6 October. Clearly, in the Prime Minister's view, it would not do for the hypocrisy of the Federal Government on the Aboriginal issue to become well known. However, the Prime Minister has a very steep task ahead of him if he intends to silence the large number of other prominent media outlets throughout the world which have taken up this issue. For example, on 8 October the Guardian described the protests as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . primarily designed to force the right wing Queensland Government, led by Joh Bjelke-Petersen, to follow other States by granting Aborigines freehold title to their reserves. </PARA>
<PARA>The article went on:</PARA>
<PARA> The spotlight has hit upon several murky corners of Queensland life including the authoritarian running of the reserves. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs Mr Ken Tomkins, interviewed by New Zealand radio said that the Aborigines would not know what land rights were. 'Aborigines eat birds and fish and drink a lot,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA>Reports of similar character are to be found in the Times, on British Broadcasting Commission television, in the Observer and in newspapers in Africa and North America. I ask honourable senators: Is this a situation that the Senate condones? Do we want the international media, brought here to witness sporting events, sending back reports of that nature-entirely accurate reports- to people throughout the world? Clearly it is a situation that the Fraser Government is prepared to condone at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn our attention to what the Aboriginal and Islander people want. They want inalienable freehold title to their reserve lands and the Fraser Government has failed to secure that for them. I know what the Minister for Education ( Senator Peter Baume) will say in response to this debate. He will say that the Aboriginals do not need freehold title; that the leasing arrangements that the Queensland Government has come up with are good enough and that the Fraser Government is prepared to guarantee these leasing arrangements. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know what Senator Baume will say because he has said the same thing with tedious repetition ever since this issue became one of national significance and has been raised regularly in this place. Senator Baume will tell us that he knows what is good for the Aboriginal people-that is, this dubious leasing arrangement-and that they are wrong in seeking freehold title. Our response to this is that the demand is for freehold title and that that is a proper and just demand. The Fraser Government has already been prepared to give freehold title in the Northern Territory and it ought to be prepared to achieve the same thing in Queensland. We are not interested in guarantees for legislation which is totally unacceptable to the Aboriginal and Islander people in Queensland. I hope that Senator Baume will have something more interesting and pertinent to say than that. The Queensland Government, backed now by the Federal Government since the Prime Minister had decided that what Premier Bjelke -Petersen is doing is good enough, is offering something it calls deeds of grant in trust which it says will give secure tenure and will provide land for the Aborigines on the same basis as other Queenslanders. However, no, reputable legal opinion supports the claims of the Queensland Government about its legislation or the claims of the Fraser Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us have a look at what Father Frank Brennan, a Jesuit priest and barrister commissioned by the Catholic Bishops to examine the Queensland legislation, has said about that legislation. He has pointed out that the Queensland Cabinet may cancel or vary the deed at any time; that Cabinet may declare the land to revert to the Crown for any reason that it appears to it to be desirable to do so; that the Minister for Lands and Forestry may cancel any lease if he is satisfied that any conditions are not being met; that Cabinet could resume land for public purposes including for tourist purposes, pastoral reserves, air strips and so on ; and that the grant carries no mining, forestry and quarry rights and Cabinet can give permission for miners to enter at any time. </PARA>
<PARA> The uncontroverted and long-published opinion of leading Queen's Counsel, Mr Bill Pincus, obtained by Archbishop Rush, Archbishop Grindrod and Reverend Father Brennan concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> If there was a genuine intention of giving security of tenure, it is manifest that that intention has by no means been achieved under the deed of grant in trust proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>So that is the totally unsatisfactory situation which Malcolm Fraser says he is prepared to support and which Senator Baume will now tell us is what the Aboriginal people really want and need. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent statements by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Wilson, the support for this totally unsatisfactory piece of legislation appears stronger than ever. The reservations about the Queensland land legislation which Senator Baume expressed on 1 April of this year seem to have disappeared in Mr Wilson's recent statement on land tenure for Queensland Aboriginals, the statement he made on Tuesday of this week. Mr Wilson states, and totally inaccurately according to all legal opinion:</PARA>
<PARA> The commitment by the Queensland Government to introduce deed of grant in trust means quite simply, that Aboriginals and Islanders in Queensland will have secure tenure on the reserve lands on which they now live. </PARA>
<PARA>An opinion like that coming from Mr Wilson makes it very clear to honourable senators in this place why Mr Wilson is no longer practising law. In a piece of semantic nonsense--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be delighted to undertake that task. In a piece of semantic nonsense the Minister goes on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reality is that security of tenure now exists, which is more important than the debate about what terms we choose to define that security. </PARA>
<PARA>The reality is that Aboriginal people do not own their land. Either Aboriginal people have security of tenure or they do not. But Mr Wilson's statement ends with what can be regarded only as a veiled threat. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> It-</PARA>
<PARA>That is security of tenure-</PARA>
<PARA>will not be achieved by taking the easy and irresponsible path of breaking laws and ignoring the facts. Indeed, that path might end up leading Aboriginals and Islanders away from the fulfilment of their just and fair aspirations. </PARA>
<PARA>So there is the not terribly veiled threat that they will not even get their deed of grant in trust legislation if they continue to exercise their democratic rights and protests in this matter. The Prime Minister was also reported as saying this week:</PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Government has said it is sincere in making this land available to Aboriginals, and the practical effect of it is that it will be in perpetuity.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA> A deed of grant in trust offered as much security as freehold. </PARA>
<PARA>This is clearly quite wrong and in the circumstances, which include the drastic criticism of the Queensland legislation by informed legal opinion, the Fraser Government's guarantee of this legislation is useless because it is guaranteeing something that nobody, except Mr Bjelke-Petersen, wants. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is timely to ask why the Fraser Government is continuing to resist giving Aboriginals freehold title in Queensland particularly when it has been prepared to grant it in the Northern Territory. Is it because the Fraser Government no longer supports Aboriginal land rights at all? Is this change of policy confirmed by its current efforts to undermine the Northern Territory Land Rights Act?</PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Government's racist attitude to the Aboriginal people was again demonstrated during the Commonwealth Games by the insulting and provocative remarks of its Minister for Aboriginal and Island Affairs, Mr Ken Tomkins. Honourable senators will recall that in an interview with Radio New Zealand Mr Tomkins stated that Aboriginal people were not advanced to a stage where we could give them freehold land. He also stated that because Aboriginal people lived on birds and goannas they did not need much money. Compounding this appalling situation, the Premier Mr Bjelke-Petersen, in a follow-up interview on Thursday's AM called land rights protesters militants, self-confessed communists and agitators and again made it clear that freehold land tenure for Aboriginal reserves was out of the question. This is the sort of regime that the Fraser Government is supporting. People such as Mr Tomkins who are making these derogatory, patronising and insulting remarks to Aboriginal and Islander people in Queensland are being supported by the Prime Minister of this country. The constant outbursts of Premier Bjelke-Petersen along the lines that people who support land rights are communists are now being supported by the Prime Minister . And they wonder why the protests continue. </PARA>
<PARA> Why does the Queensland Government resist so fiercely the move towards freehold title? Why is it retaining ownership of those lands and through its leasing arrangements the ability to resume those lands at any moment it chooses to do so ? I think the answers lie in the areas of mining and tourism. An article in the West Australian of 29 September by Lorenzo Boccabella put the position in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The whole of the Cape York Peninsula in North Queensland could be vital to Australia's future as a major world aluminium producer. It was among the world's largest bauxite reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> Besides the Shell-Pechiney and Comalco interests, Alcan also holds a large bauxite lease next to those held by the other two groups. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context, the last thing the Queensland Government wants is Northern Territory style land rights legislation where Aboriginals have both a say over mining activities and a healthy share of royalties. </PARA>
<PARA> Queensland Government economic interest in Aboriginal areas extends beyond mining. </PARA>
<PARA> On July 20 this year, the Premier announced that tenders would be called for the development of a tourist resort on Sweers Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria.</PARA>
<PARA> The Premier said: The area offers an ideal location for a first class resort with activities based on cruising and fishing. </PARA>
<PARA> Sweers Island is part of the land claims of the Queensland Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA> In early 1977 without consultation or agreement from either the Aborigines or the Federal Government the island was excised from the boundary of the Mornington Island Aboriginal Reserve when that reserve was converted into a shire council along with Aurukun. </PARA>
<PARA>For Queensland Aboriginals who were forcibly moved away from their reserve at Weipa by the Queensland Government to make way for Comalco as recently as 1963, the further loss of their reserves is very real. </PARA>

He has advocated moderation. What he did in Brisbane last week was a credit to him, a credit to the Parliament which he represents and a credit to Aboriginal people. I believe what he did was in contrast to the action of those other people who work in Queensland not to heal but to inflame. The people who went up to Queensland, such as Senator Ryan, Mr Uren, Dr Murphy, Senator Tate, Senator Georges and Senator Gietzelt, made promises which were unrealistic and on which they cannot deliver. They incited people. When the arrests occurred later in the week none of them, but other people, was involved. Senator Ryan said today how terrible it was that they all had to pay out the bail money. They were there to do the inciting. They were not there at the sharp end when the time came. They lit the bushfires. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ryan said that a large number of Aboriginal people were involved. She did not observe the fact that many other people who were non- Aboriginal-many were from out of Queensland-were also involved. Of course, those people did break the law. What is upsetting is that the Aboriginal people in Queensland have now been left to pick up the mess. They have been left with the reaction. I ask: How will this help Aboriginal people? I return to my argument. Our goal is to try to find real and lasting benefits for Aboriginal people in Queensland. To do this is neither easy nor simple. Slogans or nostrums for quickie solutions will not be the way through. The real question is what will benefit Queensland Aboriginal people. What is needed is careful negotiation with Queensland figures, Queensland Government figures, Queensland Aborigines and Queensland community leaders if we are to get the right outcome and if we are to achieve the kind of understanding which is essential to the resolution which we desire. That is why the Commonwealth has so often stressed the importance of real and meaningful consultations with Aboriginal people. Those consultations have begun and they will continue.</PARA></TALK.START>

On the last few occasions when she brought forward this matter she did so to try to get some publicity at around the time of some major event. For example, she timed one of the debates to precede the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and, more recently, the Commonwealth Games. It was said that international audiences would be shocked by the situation in Queensland. The fact is that in relation to both CHOGM and the Commonwealth Games international commentators have been quicker than Senator Ryan to note that the governments of the Commonwealth and the States have done a great deal for Aboriginal advancement. Mr Ordia of the Supreme Council for Sport in Africa said so. I refer Senator Ryan to the Canberra Times of 27 September this year. Mr Ordia said that he believed the Federal Government and white Australians had shown a genuine desire to correct Aboriginal problems. But Senator Ryan either overlooked or chose not to use that comment. Mr Morales, the President of the World Council of Indigenous People, urged the National Aboriginal Conference to get down to the serious business of negotiation. Are members of the Opposition the only ones to stand back hoping that the perfect solution to all Aboriginal affairs matters will drop out of the sky one morning if only we will agree to their simplistic proposition contained in the matter of public importance which is before the Senate today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What failure has there been on the part of the Commonwealth Government? There has been no failure at all to pursue the issue of Aboriginal land tenure. It has pursued the interests of the Aboriginal and Islander people. For some time now, the Commonwealth has pursued patiently the path of negotiations towards this end. I remind honourable senators of the four principles I laid down in August of last year as a negotiating basis. I will not go through them in detail. Honourable senators are aware of them. I remind them also of the statement I made on 1 April of this year when I was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I plainly and openly committed the Commonwealth to guaranteeing security of tenure for Aboriginal and Islander reserves under the Queensland system of deeds of grant in trust. I did that in April. How can it be said that there has been a failure on the part of the Commonwealth Government to take action? That guarantee, solemnly made, was reaffirmed by my successor on 27 August, just a few weeks ago. The Commonwealth Government stands right behind that commitment. It is a public commitment, so who can talk about failure to take action, let alone continuing failure to do so? It is convenient to write motions in such terms but they do not bear comparison with reality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Ryan has couched her matter of public importance in terms relating to freehold. What is in a word? It seems that I have to remind Senator Ryan once again that the objective for Aboriginal people is not to obtain some form of legal title under British law. What is important is that they obtain secure tenure of their land so that they can continue to live on it as they wish. It is the outcome, not the process, that is important. No one has lost a hectare of land and no one is going to. We have given a guarantee. In fact, the deed of grant in trust represents a more secure form of title in meeting the particular needs of Aboriginal communities at this stage of their history than does freehold. The matter of public importance speaks of freehold title. Was it just a slip that the honourable senator omitted the word 'inalienable'? Was it just sloppiness, poor preparation? Does not the honourable senator understand the difference between freehold and inalienable freehold? I suppose she means that she wants the reserve to be held under a form of freehold, similar to that which applies to the ownership of her house or mine-a form of title which we can mortgage or sell off. That is freehold. Is that what she means? Perhaps she should think about going to the United States to see what the Indian people did with their freehold land, so much of which has been lost. It has been sold off to get-rich-quick land speculators. I do not believe that anyone wants to see that happen to Aboriginal people in Australia. Perhaps the honourable senator should be more careful in regard to the words that she puts into these matters. After all, she has had a fair bit of practice. She should also be aware that in the Northern Territory Aboriginal people do not enjoy freehold which can be mortgaged or sold. They have Aboriginal title, which is different from freehold and is inalienable. If that is what the honourable senator meant, why did she not frame her matter of public importance in those terms? Perhaps it is just sloppiness. </PARA>
<PARA> What of the deed of grant in trust? Such a deed, taken with a Commonwealth guarantee-the two must be taken together-represents secure title in Aboriginal hands. The Commonwealth will ensure that the title that is granted meets the needs of the people. Legal aid to ensure that would be available to the communities. Only last week the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Wilson) wrote to Senator Bonner along these lines. The letter can be seen by Senator Ryan. I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>4 October 1982</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Bonner,</PARA>
<PARA> You have told me that there are some questions being raised amongst Aboriginal people in Brisbane at present about the integrity of the reserve boundaries under the proposed Deeds of Grant in Trust arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not aware of any proposal which has been made public to vary the boundaries of any of the inhabited reserves which are to be the subject of Deeds of Grant in Trust. Like you, I have heard some rumours. But I stress that they are not more than rumours. Nor could they be, because it is my understanding that the Queensland Government has not yet notified any Community Council of the details of the area proposed to be granted to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it would be timely for the Queensland Government to make known its detailed proposals and I am writing to the Queensland Minister, Mr Tomkins, accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I should also remind you that the Commonwealth Government has made it clear, in the context of its unequivocal guarantee, that the integrity of the reserve boundaries is one of the principles that is required to be satisfied in any settlement of the land tenure question in Queensland. For this reason, I have said before that the Commonwealth is prepared to ensure that Community Councils have available to them access to legal advice on the details of any proposed Deed that may be offered to any of them. This offer remains on the table and is available to Community Councils when they are made aware of the intentions of the Queensland Government with regard to the particular areas for which each of them will be responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> You may feel it is useful to let Aboriginal communities know of what I have said in this letter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I invite honourable senators to contrast the situation with deeds of grant in trust with that of freehold land in Queensland. In regard to security, which is important, in Queensland freehold land can be acquired under Schedule 2 of the Queensland Acquisition of Lands Act . It can be taken away by mere executive act for any reason declared to be a public purpose. That is what can happen to freehold land in Queensland. The deed of grant in trust that we have negotiated cannot be taken away just by executive action. It is revocable only with the authority of the Parliament. There is a Commonwealth guarantee putting that in place. Anyone who examines the two situations will have to agree that freehold title in Queensland is not secure in the terms which Senator Ryan acknowledges are necessary for Aboriginal people. The deed of grant in trust, with the Commonwealth guarantee, is the more secure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is Senator Ryan speaking about acquiring the reserves? I suppose that she is seeking the taking over by the Commonwealth of all the reserve land in Queensland. Has she calculated how many hundreds of millions of dollars would be needed, under the Australian Constitution, for the acquisition of that land? Has she really thought through how the Commonwealth could or would service these small isolated areas once Queensland's responsibility for them ceased, who would run the schools, who would build the roads, who would undertake public health and safety functions-all these things and a lot more? That is one of the inconvenient details that is omitted. I ask Senator Ryan to nominate which Aboriginal programs might have to be cut back to find those hundreds of millions ? Which other Commonwealth programs would have to be cut back. Where would the money come from? Surely I need not remind Senator Ryan again that when her party was in government it had available to it full constitutional power to go down the road that she is advocating travelling now. It examined the question of acquiring reserve lands and smartly backed away from it. She might wish to look at Hansard of 4 May 1982 at page 1776 if she wishes to refer to what was done or not done by the Labor Party when it was in office. </PARA>
<PARA> Progress is being made. In the last 10 years a great deal has been achieved for Aboriginal and Islander people all over Australia, not least in Queensland. More needs to be done. We have never made a secret of that. I wish Senator Ryan would take a fair look at the progress that has been made and work with us and with Aboriginal people towards still greater achievement. There is no substance in the matter of public importance and has not been from the beginning. The Government will not accept or support that contention. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has authorised the issuance of a selection of statements relating to the Queensland matter. I believe that Senator Ryan would be greatly assisted if she were to undertake a close study of them. I have arranged for them to be circulated to honourable senators and I table one of them for the elucidation and edification of the Senate. I now move:</PARA>

I know that the Minister withdrew that statement as a result of my protest, but he gravely misrepresented my position and that of members of the Labor Party in this regard. It was well known that protests were going to take place during the Games. The Labor Party had a position on this- that the Games ought not to be interrupted and there ought to be no boycott. But we recognised the legitimate right of the Aboriginal people to protest during that time just as other people were protesting in support of particular points of view. We also recognised the right to support the protesters on this occasion .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some members of parliament did not parade before the cameras what they were doing about those demonstrations. I am not in any way denigrating Senator Bonner 's role. He is an elder, a leading member of the Aboriginal race, and his role during that period is to be commended. But it ought not to be used in such a way as to denigrate others. The preparations for the rally on 26 September involved quite a deal of negotiation with the authorities in Queensland. That was done by the Labor Party members through me. In Queensland that involved an approach to the Commissioner of Police. I indicated that such a protest would take place and that I had been asked, on behalf of the black people, the tribal council, the black protest committee in Brisbane, to approach the Police Commissioner. I did that. I approached the Police Commissioner who subsequently introduced me to the superintendent of traffic. We made the necessary arrangements for a peaceful demonstration to take place on 26 September. </PARA>
<PARA> That was one role. That was not done openly because it is fairly clear that it was a black protest. The Aboriginal cause was properly supported by the Aboriginals and anyone who supported that, particularly white people, would need to take a background role. I am telling the Minister this because he has obviously been only partly informed. I will also tell the Minister that on the Friday that I returned from this Parliament I was told that certain arrangements for accommodation had fallen through; that the arrangements to provide accommodation and facilities for the black people arriving in Brisbane had been withdrawn. I was also told that the $20,000 which the Government and the Minister were supposed to provide had not been provided, and that the program for the black protest committee had fallen apart for that reason. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, it was because of that neglect that subsequent events developed. What did members of parliament do in that situation? An approach was made to the police superintendent indicating that no accommodation was available and that tents would be erected in Musgrave Park. I approached the police superintendent and indicated that if his patrols saw such tents erected in Musgrave Park they should realise why those tents were erected. Subsequently, I rang the Deputy Lord Mayor of Brisbane and indicated to him the possibility that tents would go up in Musgrave Park; that he could not be asked for permission because regulations would prevent it but that he ought to be aware.</PARA>
<PARA> I mention all these things to make the Minister realise that there was no incitement on the part of members of parliament on either side. What we did, in our own way, was to prevent confrontation and to prevent incitement. When the Minister praises Senator Bonner-rightly so-he should realise also that members of this side of the House had a role to play to prevent confrontation and violence. When people were unnecessarily arrested on the first occasion, bail had to be found. Members of parliament were involved in collecting that bail in some way or form. I am aggrieved by what the Minister had to say and by the method in which he said it. He got up in this debate as though it were a debate- -</PARA>

Because they were so aggressive, especially against the shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, they were also unjust. They were particularly unjust to those people who endeavoured to do as much as they could. That does not take away from the role of Senator Bonner. He had a particularly difficult role. Whereas the rest of us could stay in the background and do those things that may have been necessary, he had to make an appearance. I mention this to illustrate the contrast. The Minister made his misrepresentation by commending Senator Bonner, as he deserved, but then going on to say that other people, such as myself, misused the situation to incite and to develop confrontation. Nothing is further from the truth. Throughout the whole of that week no member of the Opposition did anything to incite confrontation. But we did understand the need of the Aboriginal people to discuss, to debate and to question. Finally having made a decision-despite Senator Bonner's plea-to break the law on this occasion, they did it only after considerable debate, after considerable thought and with a certain amount of regret. There was not one deliberate attempt at violence on the part of any Aborigine who took part in those demonstrations. They had a right to so do. They did it effectively. they did it to put across their message internationally. In spite of what Senator Peter Baume says, there is still much left to be achieved in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>

In that sense I believe he completely misunderstands the motivations of members of the Labor Party, including the shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs who led our contingent to the legal march , in our participation in that march. The Minister seemed to suggest that there was some element of flamboyance involved in that, and that we were not there subsequently when matters became more heated and got out of hand, and that this placed us in an inferior position in respect to the very difficult position that Senator Bonner had to face.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The facts are that there were at least a dozen members of the Australian Labor Party who were members of parliament who responded to the invitation and only one Government member. We went there in a sense of solidarity and of giving some moral support to the Aboriginal movement. I should have thought that all of us in this place would understand that the Aboriginal movement, for almost 200 years, has been downtrodden and placed in an inferior position in respect to Aboriginal rights to be accepted as citizens and in respect to the campaign for land rights. It is a pity that Senator Peter Baume would take the view that we went there with some ulterior motive and not for the purpose of assisting the Aboriginal movement which, as I understand it, has a unanimous position in respect of land rights. If the Minister accepts that Senator Bonner's motivation was one of assistance to that movement for land rights, he should similarly accept that in respect of the members of the Labor Party who were there. </PARA>
<PARA> We were there to advise and assist and to give moral backing to the Aboriginal movement for land rights. That movement will continue until every State government-Labor, Liberal or National Party-accepts its responsibilities in respect to land rights and grants equality of opportunity in respect to land rights and to the laws and procedures of our country. Therefore, it is a mistake on the part of the Government to suggest that members of the Opposition, quite a number of whom are on the front bench of our party, did not go there with the highest of ideals and with the idea of giving support and solidarity to the Aboriginal people. Other senators, such as Senator Georges and Senator Ryan, played a considerable part in assisting Senator Bonner's efforts to get the point across to the world Press, to the people of Queensland and to the people of Australia that the issue of land rights was justifiable. I believe that in all circumstances members of parliament who went there had those objectives in mind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The trip undertaken by the parliamentary delegation to Africa covered, on the African mainland, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Zambia. Many subjects came out of the study tour which it would be worth emphasising. Already, however, I have briefly dealt with the question of Namibia when speaking to the recent report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on that subject. That Committee is now examining the subject of the Horn of Africa, and I shall deal with the particular problems of Ethiopia and Somalia in due course when that report is put down. I could speak on the importance of the current disunity within the Organisation of African Unity and its significance to Africa. I could also speak on the subject of whether the one-party States of Kenya and Zambia and the emerging one-party State of Zimbabwe can be consistent with democracy, as is their claim. I have, however, decided to address myself to the major problem of economic failure which the delegation witnessed and the potential political consequences of the worsening economic position, and to touch upon the contribution that Australia can make to economic stability in Africa. In doing so, I shall look at the four Commonwealth mainland countries that the delegation visited-Nigeria, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Zambia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nigeria, with a population of over 80 million, returned to civilian government in October 1979 to become the world's fourth largest democracy and ninth most populous country. Its international status is enhanced by the prominent role that it plays in the United Nations, the non-aligned movement and the Commonwealth. Its oil revenue gives it even greater recognition and membership of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Add to this its leadership role in the OAU and it becomes clear that Nigeria is important both inside and outside Africa. But it is a country with major economic difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> Nigeria, which once used to be a net exporter of foodstuffs to neighbouring African countries and a world rated producer and exporter of cocoa, ground nuts, cotton, rubber, palm oil, hides and skins, among other things, is now a major importer of the same. Agriculture, together with livestock, forestry and fishing , contributed about 61 per cent of the gross domestic product in 1962. By 1975- 76 this contribution had declined to under 23 per cent. In 1960 agricultural products constituted 80 per cent of the total value of exports; by 1970, 44 per cent; and by 1979 less than 7 per cent. In part this result reflects the poor performance of the agricultural sector. In part it also marks the spectacular growth of crude petroleum exports. </PARA>
<PARA> The dramatic change in the face of the economy from agriculture to oil led to accelerated distortion and dislocation. The oil boom threw the country's military leaders and their economic advisers into confusion. Active plans to diversify the economy, improve agriculture and establish agro-based industries were abandoned for prestigious and often unnecessary projects at grossly inflated prices. Nigeria opened its borders to the importation of all manner of goods, and the enhanced gains from oil sales were squandered. The construction boom drew workers from agriculture, corruption led to unplanned ordering of products such as cement, and port congestion followed. All added enormously to the cost of Nigeria's imports. </PARA>
<PARA> Then came the crushing blow of the oil glut which drastically reduced the nation's earnings at a time when the prices of other primary commodities were falling. At the same time, the prices of imported finished goods continued to rise. By 1978 inflation, which Nigeria had imported, was about 30 per cent, and in 1979 it was believed to be about 40 per cent. The consequence is not only major economic difficulty but also the inevitable pressure that it places upon the Government's stability. The delegation witnessed a strong commitment to democracy, the desire of Nigerians to make it work, and the recognition that the military experiment had so patently failed. But 13 of its 22 years of independence have been under military rule, and the potential for a return must remain if the civilian government is unable to meet the aspirations of its people. </PARA>
<PARA> Nigeria receives low aid priority from Australia. It looks to Australian expertise and experience in a number of areas, particularly finance, farming, transport and education. What appears to be particularly disappointing, however, is the failure of our trade relations. In 1980-81 Australian exports to Nigeria were just under $4m and imports were just over $1m. This can be compared with the fact that in 1978 Nigeria exported to France goods to the value of over 600 million naira, to Germany 600 million naira also, to Italy 200 million naira, to the Netherlands 900 million naira, to the United Kingdom over 400 million naira and to the United States of America over two and a half billion naira. This enabled imports from such countries as France in the sum of 600 million naira, Germany 1,150 million naira, Italy 550 million naira, Japan 870 million naira, the Netherlands 340 million naira, the United Kingdom 1,800 million naira and the United States of America 860 million naira. </PARA>
<PARA> Negotiations towards a bilateral trade agreement between Australia and Nigeria were shelved in 1979, and in the same year we withdrew our Australian trade representative from Lagos. Nigeria is now being served from Kenya. Even accepting the historical ties between Nigeria, the United Kingdom and other European suppliers, and the fact that they may be better placed geographically and that we have no direct shipping links with West Africa, it is my view that, from the point of view of Nigeria's high population and potentially strong economy-if plans to make it again self-sufficient in food by 1985 are successful -and if oil income can be stabilised, there must be a tremendous trading future for Australia in Nigeria. It would entrench our already strong political relations and in a most practical way contribute to the economic stability that will be necessary if democracy is to survive. </PARA>
<PARA> Kenya created an image of prosperity and stability since its independence in 1963 but is now also facing most difficult economic circumstances. In contrast with Nigeria it must import all its oil which in 1980 cost 40 per cent of its foreign exchange earnings-all the money that it earned from its principal exports of coffee and tea. In 1980 there were serious shortages of some foodstuffs, particularly maize, the staple food, wheat and milk. Large imports, some as food aid from the United States of America and other sources, were necessary. In fact 1981 was the third consecutive year in which Kenya had to import food. Apart from being hit from the substantial increases in the cost of oil, it is conversely affected by the 1978 crash in coffee prices. Additionally, the economy has been detrimentally affected by the failure of tourism to continue to expand at earlier rates, partly because of the growing international recession and rising air costs and partly because of a growing image of East African instability. The closure of the Kenyan-Tanzanian border in 1977 has not helped. </PARA>
<PARA> Britain had developed Kenya as the economic hub of East Africa. With the breakup of the East African community in 1977 its exports were dramatically affected. Problems are compounded by Kenya's population growth of 4 per cent, the highest in the world, by natural increase. A substantial annual gross national product increase is necessary to maintain even per capita income. The Kenyan economy is heavily dependent upon foreign trade. The major outlet continues to be Europe. However it has also been substantially assisted by large amounts of development aid. Almost half of the Government's development expenditure between 1974 and 1978 was expected in the form of aid. Sources of aid have diversified considerably in recent years. The share provided by the United Kingdom has fallen whilst that of the multilateral agencies and some European countries, notably, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands, has increased.</PARA>
<PARA> The economic stresses have clearly played a part in the attempted coup which occurred just after the delegation officially left Kenya. It gives further evidence of the stress that will be placed even upon such show pieces as Kenya unless the economic crisis can be answered. In times of crisis the gaps that have been growing between the haves and the have nots appear to widen and racial intolerance increases. Many of the Indian shopkeepers bore the brunt of the looting that accompanied the recent attempted coup. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly most Australians would also want to support democracy in Kenya and the question again arises as to what part, if any, Australia can play. In contrast to Nigeria, Kenya has had a high priority in Australia's development assistance effort in Africa. The Committee visited the Magarini settlement program which aims to settle 40,000 people on their own land and to improve agricultural techniques for farming in low rainfall areas. Clearly the scheme is making a small but worthwhile contribution to the food shortfall as well as the social welfare of the people involved. Whilst it is succeeding under close supervision, one must have reservations as to whether the success will continue when the supervisors return home. Involvement of the Kenyan Government authorities and regional authorities appears to be a sound policy. Our aid to Kenya in 1982 is approximately $5m. </PARA>
<PARA> Trade between Kenya and Australia is small but slowly growing. In 1981 we exported to Kenya goods to the value of $18.2m and imported goods to the value of $4.5m. Thus there is a significant imbalance. Kenya's exporters are eligible for preferential treatment under Australia's system of tariff preference for developing countries but as yet there has not been any great dividend shown. The regular shipping link between Australia and Kenya should contribute to strengthening trade relations. </PARA>
<PARA> Zimbabwe contrasts with Nigeria and Kenya as the most recent independent African State since April 1980 compared with the earlier oldest independent States I mentioned. The economic problems it faces have not therefore developed in the same way but rather out of years of sanctions and transport difficulties. A war costing a million dollars a day-37 per cent of the Budget-frightened off investors, is causing a continuing exodus of Europeans and the engagement of European manpower in military commitments. Thus the economic difficulties occasioned by the general world recession were exacerbated in the case of what was Rhodesia. </PARA>
<PARA> Conversely, sanctions have forced upon Rhodesia the need for greater self- sufficiency and with this has come the development of infrastructure and a more advanced industrial sector. Thus although the net economic performance at the coming of independence may not have been so impressive, the potential existed for growth that would in part depend on the ability of Prime Minister Mugabe's government to hold its white population, to attract foreign investment and secure World Bank and other loans. At the same time, to maintain internal stability Mugabe had to improve the living standards of the black population or in other words show that they would be materially better off as a result of their many years of struggle. It might be argued that in the shorter term the challenge provided a conflict of priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Its first year of government was a great economic success which was assisted by excellent maize and tobacco crops, but even more significantly by #1,000m of foreign aid promised over three years at the Zimcord conference held in March 1981. However there has since been a marked slow down in economic growth. The euphoria has been replaced with a cautious pessimism. The season has not been good and the Government's somewhat clouded intentions on public ownership have deterred investment. Although there is some dispute over figures there appears to be a growing exodus of skilled whites. The need of Mugabe to satisfy the immediate aspirations of his people with land and income, education and health has also meant an emphasis away from economic development. </PARA>
<PARA> The position in Zimbabwe would therefore appear to be delicately balanced. In recent times there has been evidence of growing instability and again one can surmise that the re-emergence of Zimbabwe African Peoples' Union militance and increased banditry is linked to economic stress. Mugabe's answer principally appears to be to call for more aid but whether the Western world will continue to be so generous is questionable. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no doubt that Australia, seen as a good friend of Zimbabwe, will be called upon to play its part in overcoming what appears to be a growing economic crisis. At independence we announced a grant of $5m for assistance over two years. In the last two years that sum has increased to a commitment of over $20m. Some of our aid has been expended in assisting with the cost of Australian teachers. From the observations of the delegation, that has been a tremendously successful program. Zimbabwe would like to see an extension of the scheme into other skills and if this could be facilitated it would clearly be a worthwhile contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> From the point of view of trade we have given Zimbabwe developing nation preference and have sent trade missions there. Whilst officially we state that trade will grow one cannot be immediately optimistic. The commencement of flights by Qantas Airways Ltd will add a new dimension but the success in relation to Australian tourists staying in Zimbabwe will largely depend upon internal stability. Prime Minister Mugabe was at pains to stress to us that internal stability will be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Zambia is another African country which achieved early independence in 1964. In the same way as Nigeria's economy is now dominated by oil, the Zambian economy is to an even greater extent reliant on one product-copper-with earnings running at about 97 per cent of total export earnings. Like Nigeria when prices were higher and Zambia was profiting, earnings were not always wisely spent. With a severe downturn in copper prices from 1976 the economy had to find itself in difficulty. In fact, the economic position in Zambia is now very serious with a non-convertible over-valued currency, price controls, commodity shortages, adverse balance of payments and payment arrears. </PARA>
<PARA> Zambia has fertile land and a benevolent climate and should be able to feed itself. There is now a concerted effort towards that objective. Unlike Kenya, the industrial marketing and services sectors are heavily dominated by quasi state companies and boards. With some exceptions they appear to be poorly managed, running at a loss and a net economic drain. The Government has indicated that there remains a role for private enterprise and has taken steps to encourage foreign investment. But to date these steps have not shown much success. In addition to economic problems resulting from the downturn in copper prices, Zambia has played a leading role in the struggle for liberation in southern Africa and has suffered as a direct result. To some extent it remains the home of the liberation movements. Clearly its contribution in the Rhodesian war detrimentally affected its economic performance. </PARA>
<PARA> Zambia sees the emphasis in recovery on aid rather than trade. Australia's assistance has not been great. In bilateral aid, the major spending is a development import grant scheme valued at $2m over three years commencing in 1981-82. Zambia is interested in drawing on Australia's expertise in rain-fed wheat cultivation. Bilateral trade is modest and largely in Australia's favour. Again, the economic stress leads to political vulnerability, even in the case of a leader so entrenched as President Kaunda. The President in fact acknowledged to us that coups and counter-coups in Africa are a way of life and the current economic stress will only add to the potential. Australia has warm relations with Zambia and again one must ask whether there is anything Australia can do to assist in stabilising Zambia's economic situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Although Nigeria is in west Africa, Kenya in east Africa and Zimbabwe and Zambia in southern Africa, all are exhibiting the same sign of severe economic stress. All have the potential and have in fact earlier been net exporters of food. All are now running the risk of political destabilisation from failure to meet economic aspirations. Each of the four countries has a plan and a strategy to increase food production. Each also has a program for returning the former agricultural community to the land. This has had the advantage of lessening one form of political stress; but on the other hand, the multitude of small holdings does not necessarily lead to the type of agricultural efficiency to which we are accustomed in Australia. To some extent, the delegation found that frustrating but recognised that African aspirations were not only for a better economic position but also in many cases for a small land holding. The delegation had to adjust to the concept that in such cases as the Magarini land settlement in Kenya, advancement was learning to use oxen for the first time as a step up from purely hand labour. In Nigeria, the highly regarded International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, which the delegation visited, had a program to develop implements simply to make hand labour less demanding. Therefore, implements were being developed not to advance from hand seeding but to enable the farmer to seed without having to bend over to the same extent. </PARA>
<PARA> The direction of economic recovery has to be acknowledged to be dependent upon the political philosophy of government. In Nigeria therefore, the need is trade and Nigeria would see its responsibility as trading out of its difficulties. Kenya has as its cornerstone of economic policy, the paper of Tom Mboya in 1964 on African socialism which described the encouragement of both state and private enterprise. However, capitalist markets forces tend to predominate. It will, however, attempt to overcome its economic difficulties through a state-private enterprise program not dissimilar to that of Australia. Zimbabwe appears to be having teething problems in direction. As the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe acknowledged to us, the objective is ultimate socialisation. But on the other hand, its policy is to encourage foreign investment. Investment guidelines have not, however, been set out and foreign investment has simply not come. The delegation evidenced a certain frustration on the part of the Zimbabwe Promotion Council in that regard. In Zambia, as I indicated, consistent with the political philosophy of its Government, the economy is very much state oriented. Both Zimbabwe and Zambia therefore appear to be looking to aid rather than to trade to relieve pressure in the immediate sense. Both find their economic reliance on South Africa as particularly frustrating and are looking to overcome that frustration. The development of the Southern African Co-ordination Conference is designed to that objective, and Australia is providing support. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus there is also a certain frustration for Australia. It has very warm relations with Kenya, Zimbabwe and Zambia and good relations with Nigeria. Within Australia's economic resources, however, its aid to Africa cannot be great. There may be grounds for greater assistance to Zambia and greater assistance temporarily to Kenya. Within the concept of the North-South dialogue a real and long-lasting advantage exists in increased trading capacity of the Third World. Aid, however, is not in any event the total answer. In trade, as I indicated, there is greater scope in Nigeria and, I believe, Kenya. The European trading nations are showing it to be so. Each of these African countries must determine its own direction and there must be an acknowledgment that small gains are worthwhile because in conjunction with economic change there is also substantial social evolution. Australia's response must be flexible, adaptable and sympathetic. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As this was the second parliamentary delegation to visit Africa in three years, it would appear that parliamentary delegations to Africa will be more frequent in future then they have been in the past. I mention that because prior to the 1979 delegation it had been 12 years since a paraliamentary delegation had visited Africa. In future I would like to see delegations concentrating more on a particular region of Africa and spending more time in the countries visited than in trying to cover the whole continent in one visit. For example, I believe that a delegation should visit west Africa and include some of the former French African countries such as Senegal, the Ivory Coast or Gabon as well as countries such as Nigeria and Ghana which have Australian diplomatic representation. In east Africa a delegation could visit countries in the Horn of Africa as well as Kenya. It would have to visit Kenya if it were visiting the Horn of Africa because nearly all the air links throughout the region go through Nairobi. I think there are other itineraries in east Africa which could include countries where Australia has diplomatic representation, such as Kenya, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Tanzania as well as strategically important countries such as Mozambique and Mauritius. I would like to congratulate the Government for extending diplomatic recognition to Mozambique. That has been done only recently and it is something which I believe ought to have been done some time ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On this delegation I believe that we attempted to visit too many countries in too short a time. But because of the fact that in all the countries, with the exception of Nigeria and Mauritius, we were able to talk to the heads of state, this made even the briefest of the visits worthwhile. For example, even though the delegation was in Zambia for only 1 1/2 days the meetings with President Kaunda and the Zambian Minister for Foreign Affairs were extremely important and certainly made that visit a success. Unfortunately, due to a special meeting of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, the three Labor members of the delegation did not visit Nigeria or Somalia. Further, because of the coup attempt in Kenya on 31 July, I was not able to rejoin the delegation in Kenya as I had been making a private visit to Burundi and therefore missed the visit to Mauritius. I intend, therefore, to make some brief remarks about those countries that I was able to visit with the delegation. </PARA>
<PARA> In Kenya, the delegation visited the Magarini Land Settlement Scheme referred to by Senator Hill which is Australia's first major integrated rural project in Africa. The cost of the Scheme is estimated to be $21.6m shared by the two governments on an equal contribution basis. The delegation was impressed by the progress that has been made and we were pleased to see that current difficulties are being speedily resolved by the joint Australian-Kenyan review commission. The delegation was welcomed by President Moi who informed us that although at that stage Kenya had not made a decision to send a team to the Commonwealth Games, he was sure that a Kenyan team would participate, as it did. He also referred to the imbalance of trade between Australia and Kenya and hoped that this would be corrected in the future. He praised Australia's stand on Namibia and its opposition to apartheid. </PARA>
<PARA> Since independence in 1963 Kenya has been regarded as an example for other African countries as far as political stability and economic progress are concerned. Therefore, the attempted coup on 31 July by a group of Kenyan Air Force officers was received throughout Africa with dismay. It was not surprising , in my opinion, if one considers the problems faced by Kenya today. The economic problems facing the country are frightening. For example, as Senator Hill stated, last year Kenya spent between 35 per cent and 40 per cent of its foreign earnings on petroleum or petroleum products. The rise in oil prices has led also to a decline in tourism, which has compounded Kenya's economic problems . The estimated annual population growth of the country is nearly 4 per cent, one of the highest growth rates in the world, and this is coupled with expectations of the people there, which are probably amongst the highest in any country in Africa. There is no doubt that the attempted coup was a severe setback that will have wide-ranging consequences for a considerable time. Whilst the election of European and Asian members to the Parliament was a hopeful sign, the crackdown on political opposition to the Government, especially the treatment of people such as Odinga, and the pressure being put on the free Press are not hopeful signs for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The High Commissioner and his staff at the Australian mission in Nairobi did everything possible to make the delegation's visit a success, and right throughout Africa we could not help being impressed by the professionalism of the respective Australian heads of mission and their staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The delegation visited Ethiopia. Perhaps the most important recommendation that comes out of the Committee's report concerning Ethiopia is that Australia should consider establishing a diplomatic post in that country. We realise that that would be a small post, but we have a three-person post operating in Zambia and we think it would be possible for a three or four-person post to operate at Addis Ababa. There are a number of reasons for this, the main one being that Addis Ababa is the headquarters of the Organisation of African Unity. The second most important reason is that there is great super-power rivalry in the Horn of Africa, and this is likely to continue, at least for the foreseeable future. There is also the whole question of food aid to refugees, and the claims of abuse of food aid in that country could be better looked after if Australia had a diplomatic mission there. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the delegation was in Ethiopia for only a very short time, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees made available his DC3 aircraft so that we were able to visit a number of centres in that country. First we visited Ginir, where Australia, as part of an aid program, has built silos. It was a quite impressive project, with extremely good agricultural potential. However, the delegation was concerned that the infrastructure seemed to be lacking and also that the machinery that is necessary for the project was in a state of disrepair. The delegation also visited a refugee camp at Jigiga, which is in the Ogaden region of Ethiopia. The refugees there are mainly ethnic Somalis. They all seem to be in reasonably good health and, as far as our delegation was concerned, there certainly did not seem to be any evidence of anyone starving in that region. </PARA>
<PARA> In a meeting with Chairman Menghistu, the delegation was able to discuss a number of issues, including the future of Eritrea. The Chairman asked us to extend our visit so that we could visit Eritrea and this ties in with the remarks I made earlier. I think on many occasions delegations try to fit in visits to too many countries and do not spend enough time in any particular one. It certainly would have been good for all of us and good for the Australian Parliament if we had been able to visit Eritrea. We also discussed the conflict that was taking place with Somalia and the future of the OAU. The Chairman indicated that he wished a delegation to visit Australia in the near future and described Australia's relations with Ethiopia as excellent. Whilst Ethiopia is described as a Marxist state and has been under strong pressure from the Soviet Union to set up a mass party on the Soviet model, it has so far refused to do so . My impression is that whilst the military officers who run the country describe themselves as Marxist, there is no evidence to suggest that they are trying to impose an East European type of communism on the people but instead are following their own brand of African socialism. I believe that Australia has a role to play in Ethiopia, and having a post there would certainly help us. </PARA>
<PARA> In Zimbabwe, unfortunately, the delegation's visit coincided with the kidnapping of a number of tourists, including Australians. In fact, two Australians are still missing, and this is a matter of great concern to all of us. However, I believe a completely wrong picture of Zimbabwe is being presented in the Australian media. Some areas of the country have still not been pacified. This is not surprising, given the fact that a civil war took place prior to independence and also given the fact that a tremendous amount of arms are still in the country as a result of that civil war. Visitors to Zimbabwe are informed of the areas where there are still difficulties and are told to avoid them. Unfortunately, the group of tourists to which I referred had crossed the border by truck and was in an area where many robberies and disturbances had recently taken place. Stories in Australia of this sort of thing happening in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, are nonsense and again are evidence of the bad reporting on Zimbabwe in the Australian media. </PARA>
<PARA> Ever since independence, Press reports have appeared in Australia that the country is on the edge of chaos or on the verge of collapse. Most of the articles, including the article in the Sydney Morning Herald last Saturday, are not attributed to any particular journalist. Others are attributed to people such as Peter Younghusband who, we were informed, gets his information on the telephone and writes the articles in Cape Town. Articles have also appeared in Australia saying that a brigade from the North Korean Army was occupying a key position in the armed forces. The truth is that the North Koreans were there as part of a military training scheme, just as Australia has military advisers in the country. The largest group of military advisers has always been, and still is, British. Most of the North Koreans have now left. The reason they were invited, as it was put to us, was because Zimbabwe is a non-aligned country. I particularly want to stress the role of the Australian media because, as mentioned by Senator Hill, Qantas Airways Ltd will commence its flights into Zimbabwe on 7 November. My impression is that tourism in Zimbabwe has a great potential and is increasing rapidly at the present time. I was pleased to have my impressions confirmed by Senator Missen, who has just recently returned from that country. </PARA>
<PARA> While I was in Zimbabwe, I took the opportunity to discuss the sort of Press publicity that I have referred to today with officials from the Australian High Commission, with Australian military advisers, with Australian school teachers and also, and I think very importantly, with white members of parliament who had split from Ian Smith's party. I am pleased to be able to say that they did not hold the gloomy predictions for the future of Zimbabwe that we have been fed in Australia. That is not to say that the country does not have some real problems economically. There has been a slump in world mineral prices and mining accounts for 5.2 per cent of the gross national product and employs 60,000 people. Agricultural exports are being hampered by the fact that the country is land- locked and that South Africa is actively supporting dissidents within Zimbabwe and also in Mozambique, and this subversion is making it extremely difficult for exports to reach the sea ports. The expectations of the people are very high indeed and the Government for political purposes has to provide schools, roads and bridges to rural communities, even though the cost to the community is extremely high. Again, we saw evidence of the school system being severely strained as thousands of black students receive education for the first time. Of course, this is a service that the Government of Prime Minister Mugabe had to provide. </PARA>
<PARA> Joshua Nkomo and his Soviet backers have obviously not accepted the results of the election and quite serious charges were levelled against his organisation by both the President and the Prime Minister when they met the delegation. They especially claimed that military equipment from the Soviet Union had been channelled to Nkomo's forces since independence, which is a very grave charge indeed. As was also stated by Senator Hill, the 160 Australian school teachers in Zimbabwe have an excellent reputation, a reputation which has spread to other countries in the region. I certainly hope that the Government will extend their term of contract. They are great ambassadors for Australia. I hope also that Zimbabwe will be able to establish a high commission or at least an information office in Australia as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The delegation was in Zambia for only a day and a half. However, as I said earlier, the visit was worth while because we were able to speak at length with President Kaunda and also with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. The delegation was very appreciative of the time given it by President Kaunda, especially as he was hosting a visit from President Nyerere of Tanzania during the time that we were there. As referred to earlier, Zambia played a leading role in independence struggles in Angola, in Zimbabwe and in Monzambique, and is also playing a key role in Namibia at the moment. It has paid a very high price indeed for its support of these independence struggles. We were able to talk with President Kaunda about the recent talks that he had with the South African Prime Minister, Mr Botha. President Kaunda said to the delegation that before the Labor Government came to power in Australia, Australia was seen as an ally of South Africa. The situation at present is that because of the role played by the Labor Government and also because of the very important role played by the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), Australia is now seen as an ally against South Africa and an ally against apartheid. He also spoke to us at length about the Commonwealth Games and said that in his opinion Australia should not be penalised by a boycott of the Games. In fact, such a boycott did not occur. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Hill said, the country is faced also with grave economic problems which are especially due to the decline in commodity prices and the cost of fuel . The delegation was informed that it is costing Zambia $US900 a tonne to produce copper and it is able to sell it for only approximately $US700 a tonne, with the result that the copper mining industry, which is perhaps the country's key industry, is stockpiling and not selling copper. Australia has a three- person post in Lusaka. The delegation considered that even though that is one of our smallest posts it is a success. However there was some feeling that perhaps the size of the post should be increased from three persons to four persons. </PARA>
<PARA> I made a private visit to Burundi. Burundi is a classic example of a landlocked , resource-poor nation that only now is beginning its development. It is one of Africa's smallest countries and until recently it had one of the bloodiest political histories of any country in Africa. However, recently, under the regime of President Bagaza, the country has undergone a remarkable transformation. Because of the time restrictions I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard an article from Newsweek of 1 March 1982 entitled 'Burundi's New Stability'. It spells out in detail the things to which I would have referred.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Burundi's New Stability</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The tiny African state of Burundi's has never had much to boast about. Its economy is among the world's poorest while its population density rates amongst the highest. Burundi has seized international attention only twice in its 400- year history. In the 1940s it served as a backdrop for the Hollywood classic '' King Solomon's Mines.'' And in the early 1970s it staged one of the bloodiest tribal wars in modern African history in which 150,000 people were killed. But Burundi can now claim to be one of Africa's most stable nations. For a country once expected to follow neighboring Uganda down the road to perpetual bloodshed, the achievement is nothing short of extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA> Burundi's turnaround has been largely the work of one man: Lt. Col. Jean- Baptiste Bagaza. When Bagaza seized power in 1976 in a bloodless coup, his striking good looks and tender age, 30, did little to inspire confidence. His advisers were also regarded as mediocre-hardly surprising for a nation that could not boast a single university graduate when it achieved independence from Belgium in 1962. But Bagaza learned quickly. He cornered diplomats at state dinners to discuss the virtues of fertilizer. Bagaza roamed the countryside in a Range Rover, chatting with the farmers to learn about agricultural problems. Within five years, says a Western diplomat in the capital city of Bujumbura, '' Bagaza developed into one of the most exciting leaders in Africa.''</PARA>
<PARA> The young President's strategy has included cautious efforts to repair relations between the perennially feuding Tutsi and Hutu tribes. While the bloodletting has stopped, the enmity remains. The Hutu tribe accounts for 84 percent of Burundi's 4 million people, but the Tutsi tribe still holds most of the land and the political power. Bagaza-a Tutsi-has tried to redistribute the country's meagre economic and political offerings. He has given jobs, Cabinet posts and schooling to Hutu tribesmen. His pace has been somewhat leisurely-but with good reason. ''If he moves too quickly,'' says a European diplomat, ''he will alarm the Tutsi elite and probably start another coup.'' Bagaza's cautious efforts seem to be paying off: many Hutu who slipped out of Burundi during the atrocities of the 1970s are now returning home. </PARA>
<PARA> For all the good news, however, home remains a dismal place. Only 3 percent of Burundi's forests remain, and the soil is severely depleted-critical problems for a nation that is dependent on agriculture. Burundi's sole source of foreign currency is its coffee crop, an export highly vulnerable to volatile overseas market fluctuations. ''When the price of coffee falls on the world market,'' says Energy Minister Isidore Nyaboya, ''we simply halt capital projects.'' Even when the coffee market is healthy, Burundi's sizable economic problems are deeply entrenched. The landlocked country must move all imports and exports through surrounding states-an expensive and chancy business-to gain access to the sea. Increased trade will be imperative in the decades ahead, especially if the population doubles as expected. If an economic downturn should coincide with the anticipated population explosion, renewed ethnic strife could be one result.</PARA>
<PARA> Prudence: Bagaza believes the key to tribal peace is economic development. His discreet management of Burundi's slim holdings has enabled Burundi to quintuple its foreign aid. The United States is currently building a road from Bujumbura to the countryside to help farmers get their goods to market. The Chinese are building hydroelectric plants, the North Koreans are constructing a conference centre and the French are expanding Burundi's air-flight facilities. Says one Western aid official: ''We like doing business here because the government uses aid money prudently and well.''</PARA>
<PARA> The splashiest project is a multimillion dollar mosque in Bujumbura financed by Libya. Burundi has only a handful of native Muslims, but Muammar Kaddafi demanded that the mosque be built if Burundi wanted continued military aid from Libya. Eager to hold on to Libyan jeeps and radio-communications equipment, Bagaza agreed. He also insists that Burundi's Libyan connection is legitimate and he shrugs off Western complaints. ''Criticism of our relations is propaganda by Libya's enemies,'' insists Bagaza. ''That country has its revolution and we have ours.'' For now, Bagaza's primary concern is to keep Burundi's economy moving at such a rapid clip that the Hutu and Tutsi tribes won't have time to brood over their differences. If the strategy continues to prove successful, the long-overlooked African state may finally have something to boast about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I visited Burundi to look at a United States aid project, the preservation of the Bururi rain forest. It is costing more than $US1m over a four-year period. It is a very impressive project, part of a huge United States aid project to the country on a scale that could never be undertaken in Africa by a country like Australia. I was extremely well briefed while I was there by Mr Nyaboya, the Minister for Public Works, Energy and Mines, who I hope will be visiting Australia as a guest of the Government in the near future. I would also like to place on record my appreciation of the assistance I received from the Governor and officials of the Bururi province when I visited the project. The Government in Burundi has heard of the success of the Australian schoolteachers in Zimbabwe and has made a formal request for two Australian schoolteachers. I found this to be quite remarkable, given the lines of communication between these countries. It was some indication of the very good role played by these Australian schoolteachers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The future of the country is economically tied to one issue, and that is whether there is oil beneath the African lakes. I was fortunate enough to be able to talk to some people from Western oil companies while I was in the country. They believe that Lake Tanganyika has a tremendous amount of oil beneath it. If that is correct, the future of central and east Africa certainly will be very different indeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The report to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Wilson) on the social impact of uranium mining on the Aborigines of the Northern Territory, submitted by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, is another report in the six- monthly report cycle that the Senate has had the opportunity to discuss. I believe it is a particularly interesting report which raises a number of important issues. The issues that take up a fair amount of the report concern particularly the Nabarlek and Ranger operations. At present those operations are relatively small. The two approved projects, Jabiru and Jabiluka, are considerably larger, as is Koongarra, which is still under negotiation because it is located on a rather contentious site in the middle of the Kakadu National Park. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise a specific question in relation to the Jabiluka operation. It concerns the workers at the site. At Nabarlek workers are flown in and then flown out. In that way the number of permanent residents can be kept to a bare minimum. As I understand it there has not yet been any firm decision in relation to Jabiluka. However, I do not think from the size of the operation that it is unreasonable to suggest that we would be looking at a permanent population in the vicinity of 7,000 or possibly 10,000 workers. The social impact on the Aboriginal people and their lifestyle can only be imagined. If we were to fly in 7,000 workers on a permanent basis when there are approximately 900 permanent Aboriginal residents close to the site, I believe we would have cause for concern. However, if it is decided to follow the Narbarlek idea and have a fly- in/fly-out operation then presumbly the number of permanent residents could be kept down to somewhere in the vicinity of 2,000 people. I believe that would be a preferable situation and I hope it is the intention of the developers of the Jabiluka project. Indeed, I hope it is the intention of the Northern Territory Government and the Commonwealth Government to apply whatever pressure they can to have the same type of arrangement at Jabiluka as has existed at Nabarlek. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issue I wish to raise relates to uranium mines as they operate in Australia in comparison with uranium mines in other parts of the world. I refer particularly to the problem we have at the Northern Territory mines of monsoonal rains. We have found already-there has been relatively extensive reporting of this-problems at both the Nabarlek and Ranger operations in terms of seepage from the tailings dams, particularly seepage into the water table with subsequent damage to the environment and possible long term effects spread over a much wider area through pollution of the water table. The particular problem that has been raised in regard to the monsoonal areas suggest that the continuation of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies reports would be particularly useful not only up until 1983, which is when those studies are scheduled to end, but also well beyond that time to monitor the social and health consequences that will flow from those mines. I believe that the Government has a moral obligation in this regard since it did make an undertaking in relation to the report of the Fox Ranger Uranium Environmental Enquiry in August 1977 to permit uranium mining only if harmful effects on Aboriginals could be avoided. I believe that monitoring could very well assist. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to discuss the present state of the Australian film industry. The film industry has been one of the dramatic cultural successes in Australia over the last decade. It has been received with acclaim round the world with remarks about our recent films such as 'maturity', 'intelligence', 'clarity', 'unique characteristics' or, as one English critic said about one of our films, 'exciting', 'subtle', 'beautifully made', ' beautifully photographed', 'superbly acted', 'extremely moving', and 'I would regard such a film as just about perfect'. The prominent English actor James Mason confessed last year that he was tremendously jealous of the Australian film industry. International recognition in other forms or awards and nominations for Oscars are beginning to come. Of course, not only feature films have been in the sensational new wave of films. Bruce Petty won an American Oscar in 1976 for the best animated film and documentaries such as The Last Tasmanian and Front Line have been winning widespread acclaim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But the problem for the industry is that it seems to be in a sort of boom and bust cycle. The film tax concessions introduced in 1980 produced a great burst of investment in films but that has now dried up. Last year 33 feature films were made. This year it looks as though only six to eight will be made. This is a dramatic turnaround. I think we must examine what is going wrong and why the film tax concessions are not working as they were originally expected to do. I had some misgivings when these tax concessions were introduced. I said at that time that the only justification the Government can have for such large subsidies for the film industry is that they will raise the level of Australian film culture and the output of higher quality films. I pointed out that the problem is how one controls the quality; how does one stop large subsidies being used to make what can kindly be called rubbish films? Everyone knows that each year some films are produced which never should have been produced. The marketplace is not an appropriate vehicle for controlling such a heavily subsidised industry. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time the tax legislation was introduced I toyed with the idea of requiring that before any investment became tax deductible at least 10 per cent of the money put up should come from one or other of the film commissions-the Australian Film Commission or one of the State film commissions-because, after all, they are supposed to be aiming at quality. The trouble is that their track record, to put it at its kindest, is what one could term as ambiguous. I think we will now have to start looking at this because we must have some control over quality if we are to have substantial public investment in the form of tax support for the film industry. That is not the greatest problem but it is one that we really have to look at now. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Howard) said, when this legislation was introduced in 1981, that he would look at it again in six or 12 months to see that it was not going in the wrong direction. I think now is the time we should look at whether these tax concessions are working in the way we expected and, if not, why they are not working. The reason I say this is that the concessions are in fact very generous . I think most honourable senators are aware of what is given to film makers under Division 10BA of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Magnificent films such as Heat Wave, Puberty Blues, Star Struck and The Man from Snowy River have been made through tax concessions under Division 10BA of the Income Tax Assessment Act. That division provides that investors may have a tax deduction of 150 per cent on their investment. If they are on the highest marginal rate and they invest, say, $100,000 in a film that means they get a $100,000 investment for an actual expenditure of $10,000. If a return is made on a film, and by no means all films make returns, investors are exempt from income tax for the first 50 per cent of their investment. </PARA>
<PARA> These might appear to be, and they were seen to be at the time very generous concessions. Why then has investment in the film industry dried up so sharply? A number of reasons were apparent at the time and were put to the Treasurer, who did not feel able to meet these objections because he was then, as he is now, very concerned about the possibility of tax evasion and unscrupulous tax avoidance. In order to limit that he felt obliged to impose conditions which have caused problems for the film industry and problems for investment in films. The first of those is what the industry tends to call the '12-month rule'. The film makers are forced to mount, film, edit and get public release of a film within the same financial year. That imposes very great problems because within a financial year they are forced to complete a process that would normally take 16 to 20 months or more. It is not even that they have the full 12 months, because very few of the type of investors who go in for film making have any clear idea of what their investment potential or financial situation is going to be before about Christmas. They will not consider such investments until about that time. If they borrow the money they want to have it out for as short a time as possible. As a result, this reduces the film making season from 12 months to about 6 months which is really an impossible period in which to make good films. The industry is being forced into making tax avoidance quickies. Not all films can be placed in this category. However, there are too many of them and they do nothing for the level of film culture in Australia and are not a justified expenditure of public funds. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a further very serious problem. The new companies Act forces producers of films, like any other company, to issue a complex prospectus before they can attract film investment money. This really is an insuperable difficulty. It not only costs a great deal of money to issue such prospectuses but also takes time. The six-month film making time is further reduced by the requirements of preparing and issuing a prospectus. I think we must seriously look at whether it is appropriate and necessary for film producers to be forced to issue a prospectus as is any other company by the companies Act. </PARA>
<PARA> One other factor which has had a very serious effect on the film industry is the way in which the bunching of production has caused an overloading of available facilities and, as a result of the ordinary laws of supply and demand, a sharp increase in costs. Competition for the use of the available facilities shoots up the costs not only because of the competition but also because the season for film making is almost as brief as the ski season in a drought year. Investors have to get their returns over a very short season. Up go the costs again. One of the great qualities of Australian films used to be the way in which one produced first rate films at reasonable costs. These costs are now escalating. </PARA>
<PARA> We must look at how we can reorganise Division 10BA of the Income Tax Assessment Act to see that we provide for three things. The first would be high quality Australian films which would raise the level of film culture in the year ; the second would be to provide for efficient ways to stop a rip-off of the tax system through the film industry; and the third would be to avoid, through spreading production, the rapid escalation of costs. </PARA>
<PARA> One suggestion has been put forward which I think does deserve serious examination by the Government. At present the investment cannot be written off, the tax concession cannot be claimed, until the film has been exhibited-until its copyright has been obtained. That effectively means that it must all be done within a six month period. What is now suggested is that the investors should be allowed to write off their investment and claim it against their tax as soon as they have invested. Obviously this potentially opens the way for tax rip-offs by never producing the film. To overcome that problem it has been suggested that the film must be made and exhibited within two years. If it is not exhibited within two years, the tax concession is revoked and a penalty is imposed. Investors will not like penalties, but I think that they will like this system a lot more than the present system where we are making films that are tax saving quickies. I commend that approach to the Government. I believe the Government must look at it very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> The other problem concerns the way in which section 51 (1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act is being used to obtain tax concessions which are of no benefit to the Australian film industry or to Australia. This is the tax deductibility allowed for in the ordinary business dealing. What happens is that a person invests in an Australian company's books-there are two companies involved in this-and then borrows money from overseas, say, $3 for every dollar invested. That person then puts the whole lot through the Australian company's books and claims an Australian tax deduction. An investor can get a 375 per cent tax write -off on his investment. There is no requirement, as there is in the Division 10BA tax deduction, that the film should be of significantly Australian content. There need be nothing Australian in these films. Films such as Arthur, which has nothing Australian in it at all, have been made under this arrangement. Other countries have faced up to this. Canada had this problem and has outlawed this type of investment in film industries. I think that we have to move very fast to stop this type of rip-off of the Australian taxpayer which has no benefit at all -or very few-from the point of view of the Australian film making industry. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been suggestions by one of the promoters of these schemes, United American and Australian Film Productions Pty Ltd, that it will build a studio complex in Canberra costing several million dollars. I believe that might well be erected alongside the silicon chip manufacturing complex in Canberra. I do not think that either has any likelihood of being built. We are being naive and gullible to be taken in by this sort of talk. The company will not build this studio complex. If it did build it, Canberra would not be the place to construct it. It would have to be in either Sydney or Melbourne if it intends to make any significant contribution to the film making industry. That is an area which we must look at very carefully. We should, as Canada has done, close this tax loophole now. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not suggest, as some film makers do, that if we close this loophole more money will come into the film industry. By blocking off the loophole, that does not mean that more money will go to the industry. People will invest in the film industry if the conditions are changed to make us produce better films. If we make better films there will be a better chance of a return for the investor because in times such as these investors are sensitive. If films do not make money the present Division 10BA is not an attractive investment. A film has to make money in order for it to be an attractive investment. The way to make money is to make more high quality films. This is not being encouraged under the present tax legislation. The proposed scheme is very generous and very well intentioned. Minor alterations must be made to ensure, firstly, that we have a thriving and highly artistic film industry, and, secondly, the Australian public gets full return for the concessions it made to this industry through the tax system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity of speaking at the first reading stage of the Customs Tariff Bill to refer to a matter which has already been the subject of some discussion this morning; that is, the situation of Zimbabwe and Australia's relationship with it. I have not yet had the chance to read the report, presented by Mr President on behalf of the parliamentary delegation that went to Zimbabwe. I have heard what I might call 'potted versions' from my colleagues of what has been said and what has also been said by Senator Hill and Senator Sibraa. I entirely agree with those remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps I can update that information, having spent some eight days in Zimbabwe since the delegation was there. I formed very firm conclusions on matters on which I had already tentatively formed views when I was in Harare earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is relevant today that one should add one's impressions on this because we are constantly seeing in Australia a denigration by the media of the state of affairs in Zimbabwe. These reports are completely out of context; they attempt to raise problems and to highlight the difficulties which are inherent there. We all know that the missing six tourists have not been found. I saw in a report in the Herald of last night that they have been sighted again in Botswana . While I was in Harare the secretary to the Prime Minister, Mr Mugabe, told me it was believed they were probably in Botswana and not in Zimbabwe. That was the explanation for the lack of sighting for some period. It does seem to fit together. One hopes that the tourists are still alive and in due course will be returned to their families. This is one of the incidents which the Press in Australia has highlighted, but it does not highlight other significant and encouraging signs of progress which Zimbabwe is making under its very efficient and able Prime Minister, Robert Mugabe, and other Ministers, many of whom I have had the opportunity to meet. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to put these matters into context. It is also important in this area of media distortion to remind ourselves of an editorial which appeared in today's Australian newspaper under the heading 'Self-evident humbug'. It did not mean to be so but the editorial is a piece of self-evident humbug in itself and is, therefore, well named. The editorial stated that Australians are having conflicting demands in a desire for lucre and a quest for moral purity. It criticises the fact that our trade with South Africa has increased and that we are now providing a Qantas Airways Ltd service to Zimbabwe. The editorial impliedly objects to the fact that Qantas does not fly to South Africa at the present time. I will not at present deal with the South African aspect of the matter; I intend to say a lot more in this Parliament in regard to our trade with South Africa and the extent to which there might be codes of conduct that would regulate that. I will have more to say in other speeches in this chamber about that matter. So far as the remarks which were made in this editorial about Zimbabwe are concerned, I regard the decision for Qantas flights to Zimbabwe to commence on 7 November as a matter of extreme importance and of great value for Australia and Zimbabwe. The Australian editorial can only state:</PARA>
<PARA> And Qantas flies to other countries whose regimes, in their own way, are at least as repulsive as that of South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA>They do not say this is Zimbabwe; presumably this is what is meant. In my opinion an excellent attempt is being made in Zimbabwe to run government properly. There is some talk of a one party state-which I hope will not come about-in Zimbabwe, but it has been a somewhat popular idea among African countries. To compare the viciousness of the regime in South Africa as this editorial does, and its failure to recognise the dangers it is in with the really great efforts which the Mugabe Government is making to put Zimbabwe on its proper feet economically is, I think, a quite monstrous piece of humbug. </PARA>
<PARA> What is objectionable is the attempt of South Africa to destabilise the government of Zimbabwe, the fact that South African troops have gone across the borders into that country. Some have been killed there, apparently in an attempt to destroy the railway service, which is one of the lifelines of Zimbabwe. Most of Zimbabwe's supplies to the world must at the moment go through South Africa. Indeed, South Africa stands condemned for the lack of foresight that it has shown in its dealings with Zimbabwe. Instead it ought to be encouraging a very strong development, both economically and otherwise, of that community. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to deal today with the economic help that Australia has given, concerning which I spoke following my previous trip, or with the other actions taken by Australia, such as the sending of school teachers. I hope that we will be sending more school teachers because they are received with a great deal of satisfaction in Zimbabwe and are doing a great job. I want to speak particularly about the proposed Qantas service to Zimbabwe and what I believe is its major purpose. It is true that, in the first instance, it will cater mostly for people going on to South Africa, but I believe that the position may well soon turn around; that soon there will come an appreciation of the tremendous tourist possibilities for Australians in going to Zimbabwe and spending, on their way to Europe, a week or a fortnight there. In connection with the trip that my wife and I had, the question of danger was raised by some of my colleagues before we left. They urged that we not go. To my mind, we faced less danger during that trip than could be expected in Rome or London. In my opinion, one would be in less difficulty there than in many other places; there are many more dangerous places in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> One does not go at the moment to areas that are destabilised around Bulawayo. One does not travel that road as a tourist. On the other hand, one can travel very effectively around the country to the main tourist places by air. The tourist facilities are very effectively handled. </PARA>
<PARA> Zimbabwe offers tremendous tourist possibilities. They were known before the civil war and they are again becoming appreciated. Having gone down to Great Zimbabwe, to the magnificent and interesting ruins of a former civilisation, and to the game reserves both in that area and at Wankie, I can testify to the hospitality of the Zimbabwean people and the very high standard of hotel accommodation and other facilities in these areas. Victoria Falls, given the great deal of accommodation that is available there, presents such an experience that I believe within a very short period thousands of Australians will be taking the opportunity to fly direct to Zimbabwe and then go on to Europe and other places. They should put aside the fears that some newspapers have tended to exploit and take an early opportunity of visiting Zimbabwe. </PARA>
<PARA> The first flight from Australia will occur soon. I hope that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) or a leading Minister will be on it. The people and leaders of Zimbabwe are anxious that the Prime Minister should take up the long-standing invitation to visit their country. He is held in very high respect by Zimbabwean leaders, who appreciate the work he did in solving problems associated with Zimbabwean independence. As far as Zimbabwe is concerned, Australia has other things going for it also. We are very fortunate in having in Zimbabwe our High Commissioner, Jeremy Hearder and his wife Raye, both of whom speak excellent Shona. I understand that he is the only foreign representative Minister or High Commissioner who can do so. He can broadcast in that language. It is obvious when one sees the contact that he has with leaders, that his ability and interest are appreciated greatly by the Zimbabwean people. </PARA>
<PARA> I had the opportunity of attending the party that was given to Mr Mugabe when the freedom of the City of Harare was conferred upon him and of hearing the delightful speech he made on that occasion. Very real warmth was expressed by the Zimbabwean people both for him and for other guests present. One could sense the very evident pride they felt for their leaders in that they were doing so well. When one meets Ministers and other leaders in Zimbabwe one realises that they possess a considerable depth of talent and ability. I believe that they will overcome their problems, which include the 'Marxist rhetoric' in which some of them are caught up. I do not believe that marxism is really being applied in government, but it tends to frighten some businessmen and has perhaps frightened some of the white ex-Rhodesians who have left the country. One finds that some of those former citizens now are almost anxious that Zimbabwe should fail, that they should be shown to have been justified in making what was, I believe, the regrettable decision to leave that country and not help it during its establishment of independence. I believe that there is a need for more trained people and that people will be coming to Zimbabwe. I have already met migrants from Britain who have arrived since independence and I believe that the trend will become more marked as time goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> I wanted particularly to say something in an effort, firstly, to overcome the campaign of denigration the Australian media has waged-to quite an extent-in regard to Zimbabwe, and to point out that that country has a tremendous tourist potential. That is one way in which Australian citizens travelling abroad can help greatly. Certainly, as a result of six tourists having been captured, there has been some cancellation of bookings, some fear and trepidation, but I believe that Australians, who are doughty warriors when it comes to travelling, will find great opportunities to enjoy a marvellous experience in Zimbabwe. I believe that that fits well the aims the Australian Government has pursued for some time . </PARA>
<PARA> I have returned with other suggestions about which I will not go into detail but which I will be discussing with the Prime Minister when he returns. They relate to relatively small and uncostly ways in which we can further assist Zimbabwe and help our relationship with that country. It is the duty of all of us who have an interest in seeing that Zimbabwe is successful economically, also in a tourist sense and as a healthy democracy in Africa. We must realise that the people who are working there with dedication and skill to make a success of independence really need our help. They are entitled to expect our assistance and I hope that Australians will make every effort to assist, and to see, this glorious country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish this afternoon to deal with a matter concerning the education of students in Australia but would first commend Senator Missen upon the contribution he has just made and ask, if he would not mind, to be associated with the sentiments he has expressed. As honourable senators will recall, I was one of those who were privileged to go to Zimbabwe to observe that the elections there were freely and fairly conducted. We formed the same sort of friendships that obviously Senator Missen has formed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The topic with which I would like to deal briefly this afternoon is the education in Australia of what we might call foreign students. I hesitate to use the word 'foreign' although that is actually the legal situation. I want to talk about students from our northern neighbour countries; people from Malaysia, Singapore and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give just a little background to the comments that I am going to make. We know that the Asian universities find a great deal of difficulty in coping with the numbers of students who present themselves to be enrolled. We know also that some tertiary institutions discriminate against some nationalities. We have been advised that what we might call non-indigenous students have to obtain higher marks to qualify for entrance. For example, we know that in Malaysia people of Chinese background have to get 30 per cent more either to gain entrance to a tertiary institution or, for that matter, to qualify for the civil service as it is called there. </PARA>
<PARA> Another factor which has an effect is that Australia is reluctant-in fact more than reluctant; it will not enrol students from overseas if a course is available in the country of origin of the person applying. Here no discrimination is made in terms of whether any places are available in the course, but simply that the course is available in their country of origin. Another factor which has an effect is that we have excess capacity in our universities and other tertiary institutions in Australia. The final factor, which is relevant here, is that some ethnic groups, particularly the Chinese, undertake responsibility for the education of selected relatives and do so regardless of where this education is undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to take a case that was brought to my notice in Darwin to illustrate what I am saying. A young woman from Singapore, 21 years of age, is the niece of a Darwin resident. The Darwin resident was Chinese and is now an Australian national, married to an Australian. The woman concerned from Singapore did not meet the requirements of the university in Singapore but she does meet the requirements of the Darwin Community College. I have a letter which was given to me in which the Assistant Registrar states:</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to advise you that you qualify for admission to our Bachelor of Business (Accounting) course. </PARA>
<PARA> If you are serious in your intention to study at Darwin in 1982, you should now approach the Australian Embassy in Singapore with a view to obtaining a student visa. If you are successful in your application for a visa, you should forward to me documentary evidence of your visa details, at which point I will be able to formally offer you admission to the programme. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me say that this implies no criticism of the Darwin Community College in the fact that they will enrol this girl. There is no suggestion that the standards are lower; rather there are not the same numbers to cope with in the Northern Territory as there are in Singapore. In this case the aunt is prepared to accommodate the girl, to pay all the expenses associated with her education, and to provide the family atmosphere-for want of another phrase-for the girl to live in. In other words, it would satisfy the girl's parents that there will be-I hesitate to use the word 'supervision'-some oversight of her activities in Australia. She wants to provide this in Darwin but will do it in the United States if necessary. So we have a situation in which the aunt is prepared to pay all the costs involved to provide accommodation for the girl or to pay for accommodation. The girl will do the course in Darwin if she is allowed to do so but is prepared to do it in the United States, where she also qualifies for entry to a tertiary institution. The Australian High Commission wrote to the aunt in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter dated 30 August 1982 regarding the entry to Australia in 1983 of . . . for study purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not quote the name. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Due to the large number of applications selection standard for 1983 entry were tightened. Miss . . . did not meet the minimum requirement, consequently her application was unsuccessful. </PARA>
<PARA>I cannot understand the refusal in this case. The Darwin Community College will accept the girl. I cannot understand what the Australian High Commission means when it says that she did not meet the minimum requirements. What requirements are we talking about? The only requirements should be that she is able to come to Australia at no cost to the Australian Government and that she does not pose a health hazard. Certainly that was no problem because a health certificate was available. The aunt will cover all costs involved and the girl will return to Singapore after she has completed her three-year course. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the advantages of educating the girl in Australia. Firstly, the money will stay in Australia. Those of us who come from the north- although I am sure that places like Melbourne and Sydney have the same situation -see thousands, if not millions, of dollars moving out of Australia to overseas countries either to educate or to support selected relatives. This is the case in Darwin, particularly with the Chinese community, where people of Timorese or Chinese ethnic background support their relatives who remain in the country of residence-in Macau and in other places. Mr Acting Deputy President, you will know that this is the case from your committee inquiries. We do not want to see that money moving out of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The second advantage that I see is that a potential bond will be established if the girl comes here. I do not want to go into the goals of the Colombo Plan here but I will mention them later. The potential bond that the girl could make as one who has committed herself to Australia would be established once more between Australia and Singapore. It has been made quite clear that the Community College has a place for her. That place would be filled and there would be interaction between this Chinese student and the other students in that course. As I indicated earlier, the girl would have a good home and some supervision. Another factor would be that an Australian national, who has asked for something which seems to be fairly reasonable, would go away satisfied. To me, this is very important. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OP7">Senator ROBERTSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will give you the details later. Thank you very much for that offer. What could be the possible objections to this? Firstly, some people might say that it could cost the Australian taxpayer some money. I do not see how. I cannot see how it would cost the Australian taxpayer anything. But if it does, let us think in terms of charging students. I do not want to go into a philosophical discussion of whether people who come to our shores should be charged. But this could be discussed and, if this is an objection, then let us look at the possibility of the aunt paying for the cost of the education. My view-I have put it in the chamber on a number of occasions-is that we ought to sell our educational services. We ought to create institutions, particularly where I come from, where we can offer educational services to the people of the north.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A possible second objection would be that it would keep an Australian student out, would deny an Australian student a place at the Community College. Let me assure the Senate that this is not so. It is quite clear from the letter that a place is available, that the person meets the requirements and that the College would be quite happy to have her there. </PARA>
<PARA> A third possible objection is that the girl, at the conclusion of her education , would not return home. I have an assurance from the sponsor that certainly the girl would return home to do the job for which she would have been trained. Of course, as we all know, a written assurance that the student will return is required before a student visa is issued. It is pointless for the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to say that there have been cases where people have not returned home. That is insufficient evidence to deny one person the opportunity of coming here. We cannot apply this sort of blanket situation and say: 'Well, somebody broke the rules so we must not allow anybody in'. It is very difficult to police these things but proper policing can be arranged. </PARA>
<PARA> I am suggesting more flexibility and more recognition of the credibility of the applicant and of the sponsor. I do not have to go into details of the character of the aunt in Darwin who wants to sponsor this girl, but I could do so and I would certainly have no hesitation in doing so. I think that we ought to give some more thought to the selling of educational services as one more way of bringing money into the community and making use of the multiplier effect of which the Government speaks. It tends to speak of it only when it is talking about the mining industry. It is certainly not of the same quantum but it would bring money into the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory wants a university. I would support a university if it were set up to cover some specialised area not presently covered by a university in Australia. I cannot make a suggestion-no doubt Dr Jim Eedle would give us a lead-on whether it be tropical agriculture, tropical medicine or something in the tropical area that is not being covered at present. I am hopeful that we will look towards selling education to our Asian neighbours with the idea, through our university, of cementing bonds with those countries. I would support it if we were to provide training where none is available at present to meet the needs of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> As a final point, I would be happy to support the university if the money coming in from overseas helped to pay the bills for what the university will cost us both in the Northern Territory and here on the Federal scene. I believe that sufficient safeguards exist. I should like to see a response to this case. I am very grateful that the Minister at the table, Senator Sir John Carrick, has asked for the details. I shall provide them to him today. I should like to see some reaction from the Government to soaking up our excess capacity in the universities, bringing money into the community, and developing the goals of the Columbo Plan, which scheme was, in many aspects, highly successful when it operated in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity of presenting to the Senate a series of questions, which are fairly lengthy and which, according to the forms, traditions and Standing Orders of the Senate, cannot be asked at Question Time and cannot be put on the Notice Paper in the form of a question. If the Senate is to be a House of review and if it is to look critically at legislation in an era in which Bills are becoming more complex and more technical, we must be given the opportunity of placing some practical examples before this House and seeing how legislation will apply. For that reason I shall later seek the incorporation in Hansard of the balance sheets of four distinctively separate and unrelated companies, each of whose balance sheets must be looked at in complete isolation, in relation to a matter which is before Parliament and which is due to come into this chamber in the next week or so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some may say that the opportunity is available in the Committee stage or after the second reading speech. However, because of the complexity and the fact that sometimes these matters go through this House in a matter of hours, or in an afternoon, there would be insufficient time for the Government's advisers to provide an accurate and detailed answer. I mentioned that the opportunities are not available at Question Time or through notice because of the detailed nature of the matters at hand. I shall call these companies Nos 1, 2, 3 and 4. At this stage I point out that I do not want to debate the merits or demerits of the matters but simply to provide the Government with an opportunity to examine the matters and come up with answers prior to the time at which we shall debate this matter at the second reading or Committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA> Companies 1 and 2 have provided for all income taxes currently accrued up to the date of sales. These taxes were passed on to the purchaser, thus giving the vendor shareholders no benefit in terms of primary taxes payable only. These have been regarded in the past as usual business transactions. However, companies 3 and 4 took into account no accrued income tax liabilities, and obviously the vendor shareholders in these companies received a benefit equal to the unprovided primary income tax payable. Such share sales therefore, in my view, would be naturally suspect as abnormal transactions. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, in relation to this series of companies, the balance sheets of which I am about to incorporate into Hansard, I ask whether the Minister, at the appropriate time-not now-could outline the nature and extent of the liabilities for tax and penalties of the company, the vendor shareholders, and the promoters . I seek leave to incorporate the balance sheets in Hansard rather than reading out the detailed figures, because I believe that this will give the Senate and the outside community an opportunity, without having to pay an outside service such as Commerce Clearing House Australia Limited, of understanding what we are intending in a practical way by putting legislation through this House. I therefore seek the incorporation in Hansard of the balance sheets of companies that I have nominated as Nos 1, 2, 3 and 4. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise two matters: Firstly, the limited or loaded terms of reference for Mr Von Doussa's inquiry into Mr Horgan's affairs, as detailed in the Press release by the Acting Attorney- General (Mr N. A. Brown) of 11 October; secondly, the earlier suggestion that Mr Costigan be asked to conduct the inquiry, a matter about which the Government has, at the very least, substantially fudged the truth. The Acting Attorney- General's statement of 11 October does not stipulate the investigator's powers to secure documents, if any. It does not state whether the investigator will have access to bank records, or whether the investigator will have access to tax records-although the worth of those tax records must, in the circumstances, be open so to some doubt. It does not state whether evidence will be taken on oath, or, indeed, taken at all. The statement says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The terms of reference for Mr Von Doussa's inquiry are to inquire into transactions involving the sale of companies in which Mr Horgan was involved with a view to determining whether any action of Mr Horgan's in respect of those transactions was illegal, dishonest or a conflict of private interest and public duty. </PARA>
<PARA>I stress that there are only three grounds on which Mr Horgan could conceivably be found guilty. First, are the actions illegal? Queen's Counsel are already on the record disagreeing about whether wet Slutzkins were illegal, at least up until December 1980. 'Dishonest' in this context presumably means the theft of money, since the whole investigation is about money matters. It would be very difficult, if not impossible, to get convictions on those grounds unless conviction could already be obtained on the previous ground of illegality. The third ground is conflict of private interest and public duty. To convict on that third ground would require showing that Mr Horgan allowed private interests to influence his actions and judgments on one or all of the seven government bodies on which he holds positions in a way which was or could have been prejudicial to the interests of those public bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Horgan has never been accused of doing that. He has been accused of contriving his affairs in a way which reduced the tax revenue which would otherwise have been paid to the Commonwealth. The inquiry's terms of reference ignore that central issue. They do not require an answer to this question: How much tax was evaded or avoided by Mr Horgan's company sales? The terms of reference are contrived to avoid that question. The terms of reference are loaded. Mr Horgan has been accused of being a director of at least seven companies sold to the Maher organisation, all of which finished up with sham directors, some of them being registered painters and dockers. That fact of the painters and dockers is significant in relation to Mr Costigan, and I shall return to it later. Mr Horgan was shown to be a director of two companies sold to the Wynyard organisation under similar circumstances. Irrefutable evidence has been tabled and incorporated in this Parliament to prove all of those allegations. The McCabe-Lafranchi report has shown that at least one of those companies, Treamog Ltd, had a current year profit of nearly $4m on which company tax was never paid. That at least was a wet Slutzkin. I stress that that was identified not by the Labor Party in this Parliament but by the McCabe-Lafranchi investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> Apologists for this Government and its cronies describe the exposure and documentation of these matters as smearing. They add that it has all been done under parliamentary privilege. That is untrue. I put out 12 statements in June and July when the Parliament was not sitting in reference to Treamog Ltd. On 24 September the Sydney Morning Herald had the headline on its front page 'How Horgan company avoided $7m in 5 Years' and it went on to supply the details and the arrangements which were made to achieve that fortunate result for Mr Horgan. That was not privileged. If the Von Doussa inquiry is to have any credibility it must be extended to cover the revenue effects of Mr Horgan's dealings with Maher and others. Explicitly it must determine whether Mr Horgan will be affected by the recoupment legislation currently before the Parliament. But just as the Reid inquiry excluded examination of dry Slutzkins, this bogus loaded inquiry also evades the crucial questions. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to Mr Costigan. On 22 September the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said that he believed Mr Costigan-I use the Prime Minister's words-' should undertake this particular investigation'. On 23 September in the unprecedented move of a joint statement from the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and Mr Horgan, issued by the Treasurer and for which he must take responsibility, it was stated: Initially it was suggested that Royal Commissioner Costigan may undertake the inquiry but it has now been determined that he is not available. The Treasurer said that it has now been determined that Mr Costigan is not available. That statement, if not blatantly untrue, was highly misleading. It was shown to be misleading by the Treasurer's reply in the House of Representatives today to a question from Mr Duffy about which more will be said later. That it was untrue was first suggested by the National Times issued on 26 September. It stated that Mr Costigan had definitely agreed to conduct the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> On 12 October I asked Senator Sir John Carrick whether the Prime Minister had asked Mr Costigan to conduct the inquiry and, if so, what was Mr Costigan's reply. In his usual way he obfuscated and prevaricated. He implied that Mr Costigan had refused but said that he would get details from the Prime Minister and tell the Senate. He did not give details that day. The next day, by which time the Prime Minister had left the country, he was reminded of his promise. His evasive response was that he said that he would get the information but he did not say when. I suggest that he deliberately avoided asking the Prime Minister because he either knew, or was afraid of, the answer, assuming that it would be truthful. Today, following a question to the Treasurer, which the Treasurer could not under the circumstances entirely dodge, the answer of the Treasurer was summarised, I believe not particularly accurately, by Senator Sir John Carrick in the Senate at the end of Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the Treasurer's answer. The question was very similar to the one which I had put previously, namely: 'Why was Mr Costigan not conducting the inquiry as had earlier been suggested?' The Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA> Sometimes one's recollections can be faulty. To my recollection, the discussion occurred between either the Minister for Administrative Services or Sir Peter Lawler or another senior officer of his department and the Royal Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>What an imprecise answer! The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman), the head of the Department or some other officer discussed a question which had first been asked in the Parliament two days before and which was a matter of crucial importance to this Government's credibility. I draw attention to the imprecision of the answer. The Treasurer continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The situation very simply was that Mr Commissioner Costigan was not available to do the type of inquiry the Government wanted because he was willing to do it only in his capacity as the Royal Commissioner inquiring into the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union's activities. </PARA>
<PARA>From the statement made on the 23 September when it was determined that Mr Costigan was not available we have the contradiction that Mr Costigan was available but that he was not available under the terms which were acceptable to this Government. The Treasurer continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government quite properly in my view took the attitude that having an inquiry by a commissioner acting in that capacity in respect of the circumstances surrounding the allegations against Mr Horgan that have been made in this place was quite inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>The allegations against Mr Horgan which were made in this place have been supported by documents showing details of nine companies of which Mr Horgan was a director and which were sold to Maher and other dealer promoters. All of those nine companies finished on the bottom of the harbour. At least two of them had a registered painter and docker as a director. All of them finished with directors who are now colloquially known as painter and docker directors. The other names in those documents which we have tabled in Parliament and incorporated in Hansard are repeated almost ad infinitum in the Costigan report. It was within Mr Costigan's existing terms of reference to investigate the Horgan case because of the very close association with painter and docker names and activities. It was entirely logical that he should do so. Today the Treasurer has admitted that Mr Costigan was willing to conduct the inquiry, exposing in the process a lengthy trail of disinformation laid by him and other Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that Mr Costigan was stopped by this Government from doing the investigation. Costigan was vetoed because the Government feared he would do a thorough job. The Government feared that Costigan would answer the crucial questions, whether or not they were explicitly asked in the terms of reference, about how much revenue was lost by Mr Horgan's contrived actions and whether Mr Horgan would be affected by the recoupment legislation provided he was given access to all the relevant documents. Instead the Government chose to load the terms of reference with the deliberate intention of producing a not guilty verdict. As long as the terms of reference were interpreted in the legalistic nitpicking manner for which the legal profession in general has recently become notorious, the Government may not have been able to select the lawyer to conduct the inquiry. But with loaded terms of reference and even a random selection from the law society there is an excellent chance that the essential questions which ought to be addressed would not be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister nominated Mr Costigan off the top of his head in a careless moment. The rest of the Cabinet vetoed Mr Costigan. The Treasurer tried to cover up the facts with a highly misleading, if not outright untrue, statement on 23 September. Other Ministers, including most recently Senator Sir John Carrick, have joined in the attempt to cover up and deceive the public about the true nature of the suggestion that Mr Costigan should inquire into this matter. The Government yet again in this instance has dug in behind tax evaders and tax evasion and it nearly got away with it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We understand that. I do not think that I need to start an argument about the matter. I want to use my time to draw the attention of the chamber and the public generally to misspending in North Queensland of what is, in fact, taxpayers' money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many honourable senators would be aware that the area in which I live, Townsville, is a very marginal seat in the Federal division of Herbert. Prior to the last Federal election, this Government spent very large sums of money in establishing an international airport at Townsville. Even that was a political move right from the start because an across-the-board committee had been established to plan for the future together with a good working committee largely based on expertise from the James Cook University. At the appropriate political time that committee was wiped out of existence, mostly with the aid of the National Party. That party was largely responsible for it. Then a new National Party committee was set up to run the airport planning. That particular committee was able to achieve some considerable notoriety when, from out of the blue, an announcement was made that the international airport would be placed at Townsville. At the moment that international airport is one of the jokes of north Queensland, if not of Australia, because of the lack of money to develop it properly. When the small jumbos come in there they back and fill for about 15 minutes before they can even turn around. I hope that in this economic and political climate we will not spend a lot more money on something and then only half do it. Even the construction of that airport is contrary to the recommendations of the Bureau of Transport Economics. I am not knocking the airport by any means because there is a place for it and it could be properly utilised. But we need money to develop it properly. </PARA>
<PARA> When the razor gang was stalking this country it made many recommendations which have cost this Government and the taxpayers of Australia many millions of dollars. I want to point to one facility which we had worked for years to establish in Townsville and which was eliminated progressively over the last 12 months, ever since the razor gang made its recommendations. I refer to the North Queensland Branch of the Australian Archives. We had no repository of an orderly nature-I am excluding places such as James Cook University and other institutions that preserve papers, books and many other things of historical value-for such records. The establishment of a branch of the Archives was something that we had looked forward to for years. We had hoped that not only would it be allowed to continue but also it would develop and expand. </PARA>
<PARA> For the record, I will very briefly give the history and then point out where this Government has been responsible for the misspending of about $70,000 and the virtual closing down of the Australian Archives, North Queensland Branch. The Archives opened in what was virtually a broom cupboard in the old Commonwealth buildings on 25 February 1974, during the days of the Labor Government. Incidentally, we have long planned the construction of a new Australian Government Centre which has been deferred in every successive Budget over the life of the last two parliaments. We had hoped that it would be included in the 1982-83 Budget. The only way we are going to get it now is if the Government, in a moment of panic, decides that it needs to put something else of a Commonwealth nature in the federal division of Herbert in a vain hope to try to save that seat for the incumbent Liberal Party member. If that is done , I will make some suggestions in relation to the provision of more space to re- establish properly the Australian Archives. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1975, the then relevant Minister, Doug McClelland, inspected the Archives and promised that immediate action would be taken to upgrade the tiny establishment we then had. Unfortunately, on 11 November 1975, the Government disappeared and the incoming government decided to abolish the Archives for all practical purposes. However, after some pressure the operation was resumed and on 25 February 1977 the go-ahead was obtained to establish a proper branch office of the Australian Archives. At approximately the same time, on 4 July 1977, the office opened in the new building in Sturt Street and a storeroom and a repository at Casey Street, Aitkenvale, were established. Furniture ordered came in in bits and pieces. It started to arrive in early 1978. In mid-1979, staffing took place. One Clerical Assistant, Grade 4, and two Clerical Assistants, Grade 2, were appointed, and a labourer/ driver was also engaged. That has basically been about the size of the staff, excluding the officer in charge, over the period the office operated and, I think, operated very effectively. But when the razor gang arrived, without any examination of what was going to happen, the representatives just said: 'Well, we're closing you down. Thanks, see you later'. And away they went. No proper inspection was carried out and nor did the representatives examine the relevant needs of the local branch of the Australian Archives or anything else. They just said: 'You are closing down, and that's it'. The shopfront establishment in Sturt Street was subsequently dismantled. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give honourable senators an idea of the cost of the Sturt Street premises. It is an excellent concrete building and was mostly properly fitted out, depending on the amount of money available. The monthly rental was about $1 ,000. The cost of electricity to run the building, including air conditioning, was about $45 a month. The cost of the patrol service for safety and security was about $145 a month. Because the building was in good order virtually no money at all needed to be spent on maintenance. But the matter went further than that because of the amount of money that was necessary to shift to the other premises. I refer now to the Casey Street premises. First of all, they needed modification and about $70,000 to move to the outer suburb, to a place where nobody could find it, in a back street. It meant a total upgrading including new partitioning, adjustments to the mezannine floor and a modification of the sprinkler fitting system, to take the extra storage and so on. The sum total of that-incidentally, I have already cited the figures for the cost of the Sturt Street building-was around $70,000; that is, to do the adjustment and virtually to wipe out a branch of the Archives in the far north, the only one that has ever been there. But one should also look at the total annual cost of keeping that shopfront in Sturt Street. The money expended on the shift alone, to move the headquarters to the outer suburb, would have kept the Sturt Street office for certainly another four years. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Australian Government Centre is completed the current plan is to provide for a very small space for the Australian Archives, North Queensland Branch, in the new building. I hope that if this Government decides to do something, whether there is an election in the next few weeks or early next year or whether the Prime Minister has enough courage to allow the Parliament to run its full term, included in that policy will be a decision to set aside some money before the election to start the construction of the Australian Government Centre and that there will be discussions with the people associated with archives, particularly at the national level, to see that there is properly planned spacing. In the shift from one place to another, this meant an elimination of certain members of the staff who, of course, went on to the unemployed list. </PARA>
<PARA> The objectives of establishing archives can be briefly spelt out in these few sentences. </PARA>
<PARA> Provide a service to Commonwealth Departments by efficient records management. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision of low cost storage for records not required for daily or regular use by Departments. </PARA>
<PARA> Preservation of important historical documents, which are likely to be held by Commonwealth Government agencies and available only from North Queensland sources. </PARA>
<PARA>These objectives, of course, did not operate when I started depositing my papers . I suppose in the long term it is a tragedy that all of my personal papers will be lodged in Canberra with the National Library, which has a very efficient filing and recall system. There are staff pressures or staff ceilings applied to Archives, and one would be lucky to get anything out of the Brisbane office under three or four weeks because of the inability to service properly people who need the recall of documents. It is not the fault of Archives at either the national level or the State level; there are just not sufficient people available to do the work. An Archives office would keep the records and historical documents of North Queensland for use there by Commonwealth Government agencies and then later on, in the open period, by researchers. It would service all Commonwealth departments from St Lawrence north and west to the border with respect to records, storage and disposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Surveys in the late 1960s provided statistical data and established the need for the opening of the Archives office in the north. Since its notional opening in 1972 and effective operational status in 1979 there has been a considerable increase in the number of requests for material, and in complexity and output from the offices it was proposed to service. It has a very wide territory. Many historical documents, of course, will never be preserved unless there is a central agency such as the Archives office to provide the care and attention that documents of that nature need and for posterity to be able to do research on them. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Government will take the steps necessary to see that provision for this work is made in the future. It is too late now. The gate has been closed and the horse has gone. I hope that planning will commence immediately to see that there is some restoration of a facility that was becoming very valuable to northerners and which would become even more valuable in the future. The point I complain about most is the short- sightedness of Government action in misspending the best part of $70,000 probably to save, in the short term, $8,000 , $10,000, $15,000 or $20,000. It has effectively crippled the service by putting it into limbo. One wonders whether Sir Phillip Lynch is not using this as one of his means for getting out of the Parliament because of the many scandals associated with the recommendations that came from the razor gang. </PARA>
<PARA> The other big problem that we have in the far north is the decision to incorporate the College of Advanced Education at Townsville with James Cook University. The CAE did not want the amalgamation, and JCU did not want the CAE amalgamated with it. In the short term that was a very costly thing. In the long term it is doubtful whether it will have the same effectiveness as the CAE operating alone and the university operating in its own right as well. I make an appeal to the Government to look at these things in the future and not to take a window dressing attitude in a so-called effort to save taxpayers' dollars. What the Government has done in the areas that I have mentioned has wasted many thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money for a smart operation that in the long term will be disastrous. </PARA>

The Committee, in considering these proposed variations, noted the third report of the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly Standing Committee on Development and Planning and took evidence from several private citizens during the public hearing held on 27 September 1982. The Committee has decided to withhold the approval of one variation and has approved the remaining ten. It has also decided to approve one item deferred from the 76th series.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee is withholding approval on a proposal to degazette part of an existing paved area in Garema Place, Civic. The proposal involves the demolition of the existing toilet block and the development of the site as a restaurant or cafe. The Committee requires further information from the National Capital Development Commission and the Department of the Capital Territory on arrangements to ensure pedestrian access and visual continuity between City Walk and Garema Place, and what is intended for the future development of Garema Place to ensure that its present character, as an important place for public activities and assembly, is maintained. The Committee has also approved item 2 of the 76th series, the deletion and realignment of a length of cycleway between Haydon Drive and College Street, Bruce. The Committee received a letter from the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) dated 16 September 1982, providing the additional information sought on the necessity of the variation. A copy of the letter is included in the report. The 78th series proposes the addition to the city plan of several roads to provide access to the new Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is concerned that the number of modifications and proposals contained in this series has been presented as one variation. It believes that these modifications should have been presented as separate and distinct items in the series, particularly since the total estimated cost for the series is $20.9m . The Committee in its report has itemised the modifications contained in the series. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the modifications proposed in the series have not attracted criticism but the Committee has received conflicting evidence concerning the proposed Commonwealth and Kings Avenue ramps. As a consequence, the Committee has reservations about the proposed ramps and, in light of the NCDC's evidence that work on the proposed ramps would not commence until the 1984-85 financial year, does not at this time approve these parts of the variation that include these ramps. The Committee also defers approval of the associated proposed works at the Kings Avenue-State Circle intersection and the Canberra Avenue-State Circle intersection. It approves the remaining works. This includes the variation to the intersection at Melbourne Avenue and Capital Circle. The objectors' evidence in relation to that matter was that they were concerned about the increased traffic that would come into Melbourne Avenue. The NCDC gave an undertaking with respect to the Stonehaven Crescent end that it would look at the increase in traffic there to see whether any further variations to that end would be required. The concern of the objectors that the variation would enable traffic to flow from the Woden Valley area through Melbourne Avenue around the perimeter of Parliament House and down the Commonwealth Avenue ramp was one of the reasons for not approving the Commonwealth Avenue ramp. If that is not built, then the traffic flow through Melbourne Avenue would be considerably different than if the ramp were to be built there. To that extent the Committee took notice of what the objectors had to say about the Melbourne Avenue entrance. There will undoubtedly be some increase of traffic at that end but not more, we believe, than the Melbourne Avenue road at present can carry. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the second report from the Select Committee. The first report, on the future of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory, was tabled in the Senate on 9 March. To set some minds at rest immediately, the Committee has not recommended closure in this case. The Committee's task in this inquiry was to determine the future of the Australian Government Clothing Factory at Coburg, given the decision of the Government, which followed the Review of Commonwealth Functions, that the factory be offered for sale or lease as a going concern. In short, the Committee recommends that the Government's decision to sell the factory as a going concern was basically correct. It agreed that there were three options open to the Government for the future of the factory-sale or lease as a going concern, retention by the Government or closure. The Committee was united at least in the decision that the factory should not be closed. Very little evidence was given to the Committee on the consequences of leasing the factory. The Committee agreed that it would be unusual for a whole business to be leased as a going concern. </PARA>
<PARA> In detail, the Committee recommends first that the effort to sell the factory as a going concern, suspended for the term of the inquiry, be now pursued with maximum vigour and a particular effort be made to show the work force the benefits of the sale. Secondly, as an incentive to prospective purchasers and in establishing fair terms of sale, the factory should retain all its defence contracts and be given favourable consideration for others in the future. Thirdly, if the Australian Government Clothing Factory is to be retained by the Government, it should be given more autonomy to operate as a commercial enterprise. As a consequence of this, the factory would account for its notional costs and factory management would be given more incentive to pursue profitable purchasing and pricing policies. </PARA>
<PARA> We feel that the embroidery section attached to the factory-I ask you, Mr Acting Deputy President, as a former senior ranking naval officer, to be patient with me when I talk about the embroidery section-ought to be examined to see whether its services are really necessary for the uniforms of the fighting forces and, if so, whether the cost of the embroidery on uniforms ought to be allocated to the wearer rather than the Government. This presumes the availability of cheaper alternatives to embroidery as standard issue. The Committee discovered almost by accident during the inquiry that at that stage there was not a full duplicate set of patterns. In the case of fire or some other damage to the factory, production would have been disrupted. We recommend that duplicate sets of all patterns be retained for safe keeping at a location outside the factory in case of fire. We were not asked to inquire about anything like that but that is one of the things that came out. I suppose it is one of the benefits of having an inquiry into government concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence presented to the Committee revealed that the factory is very efficiently managed. It is capable of manufacturing over 2,000 kinds of garment. It is a small clothing industry within itself and it has supplied the Department of Defence with clothing requirements of a very high standard, often at short notice, for over 70 years. The Department of Defence told the Committee that the factory had served it well over that period and its work was a continuing requirement for the Defence Force. The Committee has been mindful of this in its considerations and concludes that there is no case for closing the factory, as there certainly was in regard to the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. Some of the references on pages 17 to 21 of the report show a comparison quite clearly. During the course of the inquiry the Committee did make some comparisons. They were certainly favourable as far as the Government Clothing Factory at Coburg was concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> All that having been said, the Committee, though, found no real reason for recommending that the factory remain under Government control. The Committee is disturbed by the annual loss incurred by the factory and the consequential cost to the Government of retaining it. That cost is in the order of $1.1m to $1.6m annually. Page 16 of the report shows that the notional costs are a combination of audit fees, administrative support, depreciation, interest on capital, superannuation, repairs and maintenance, insurance and other expenses which would normally be met by a commercial establishment but which are not met in a Government establishment. It is these notional costs which, for instance, totalled $1.3m in 1980, $1.1m in 1981 and $1.6m in 1982. These notional costs were the cause of disturbance among some Committee members. We felt, nonetheless , that there was certainly no case for closing the factory as there was in the case of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. The Committee believes the Government does not have a social responsibility to maintain a commercially non-viable factory. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that the size of defence orders is constant, perhaps increasing, the factory could be sold as a going concern and possibly attract a buyer who would make it viable, bringing his own expertise and capacity. The Committee appreciates the dilemma of the Departments of Defence and Defence Support in that they must attempt always to obtain the greatest possible value for the taxpayers' defence dollar whilst ensuring that defence skills and capabilities already acquired in Australia at high cost are not lost or dissipated. Sale as a going concern would achieve this objective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator McLaren wanted to auction the Defence Force I do not think he would get a bid. The Committee is confident that private enterprise is capable of undertaking the work required by the Services and fulfilling their needs satisfactorily, although certainly the cost to the Government may increase . It would be offset to some extent by taxation paid by a private operator. Delivery might also be affected to some extent but this would be the subject to negotiation between manufacturer and client.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Overall, though, the Committee is satisfied that commercial viability could be achieved and that action to invite selected firms to submit proposals relating to the sale of the AGCF, which was deferred during the period of the inquiry, should now continue. If the AGCF is to be retained by the Government then it should be operated along more commercial lines. At present the factory's aim is to break even, despite evidence which indicated that there might be opportunities to price some garments on a more competitive basis. Accounting for its notional costs and having more flexibility in pricing and purchasing policies would enable the factory to achieve this. I think it was the unanimous conclusion of the Committee that the present management of the factory is quite capable of achieving those limited objectives. The safe-keeping of patterns in the event of fire concerns the Committee and although the patterns are being recorded on a computer for safe-keeping in the future the Committee considers that there should be a safe place for storage in the meantime. </PARA>
<PARA> The sale of the AGCF as a going concern would not result in significant social and economic impact in either the Coburg area or the industry generally. It is probable that AGCF employees would be given offers of employment by a prospective purchaser, and the Committee has said in its report that the Government, in negotiations with the buyer, should consider the matter of retention of staff with a view to the continuation of the existing terms and conditions of service. In these circumstances, the social consequences of the sale need not be as pessimistic as those outlined in some submissions to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I should say that once again I deeply appreciated the co- operation of members of the Committee. Certainly we had disagreement but it was always civilised and understanding. I think that all members of the Committee appreciated the help by the staff which in many cases went beyond the requirements of duty. All Committee members appreciated the co-operation that was shown particularly by Mr Silk, the AGCF Manager, and his staff and also the staff of other Government departments. We thank all of those who made submissions and appeared before the Committee. Finally, I commend this report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Senate will be aware, the Senate Select Committee on the Government Clothing and Ordnance Factories, of which I was a member, was appointed over a year ago to investigate the proposed sale or closure of two government factories as recommended by the razor gang. The recommendation of the Committee in respect of the closure of the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo was in fact not adopted by the Government. Senator Button and I strongly disagreed with the Committee's recommendation on the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo. It is pleasing to note that the new Minister, Mr Ian Viner, has gone even further than the original recommendation made in the majority report and the factory at Bendigo is now becoming a government owned enterprise showpiece.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee was by no means a model committee. Members of the Committee disagreed very strongly on various matters, mainly on ideological grounds. As Senator Martyr has pointed out, our discussions were always amicable. However, difficulties arise with the findings of the Committee in respect of the Ordnance Factory and the Government Clothing Factory because strikingly different conclusions are arrived at. However, it would be a mistake to believe that the work of the Committee has been a waste of time and effort. It seems clear that a lot of information has been gathered by the Committee and that the Government has taken notice of it. Indeed, the committee looking at the Government Aircraft Factories on behalf of the Defence Review Committee unearthed a lot of informationm on the way the Government is running its defence factories. I believe that the establishment of the Department of Defence Support has so far proved remarkably, and even some of the cynics might say surprisingly, successful. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that one or two brief comments should be made about the dissenting report by Senator Button and me on the Australian Government Clothing Factory, Coburg. We have recommended that the factory remain government owned and government operated. I believe the important point in arriving at this conclusion, and I am sure a point to which the Senate will have to give some careful consideration, is that the factory was set up by a previous conservative administration very largely as a result of an exhaustive debate. The Menzies Government set up the commission headed by Sir John Allison, assisted by Mr Leslie Brewster, to look at the question of whether a government clothing factory should be established for clothing members of the services. It recommended not only that there should be a government factory but also that money should be spent on extending its operation and building new premises. Therefore, the present factory is very much the child of the Allison and Brewster report. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that these two gentlemen were leaders in industry. They headed up very large private enterprise companies. Leslie Brewster was a director of one of the largest garment manufactureres in the country and has been for many years the Treasurer of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures. It was not the sort of commission that one would expect to be unduly sympathetic to the establishment of government owned enterprises. Yet it found, for some very cogent reasons, that it was absolutely essential for the Government to have a clothing factory. It said that such a factory was necessary for the quick delivery of items in variety. It said that the factory could be a laboratory for garment design and development. It said that the vagaries of private industry make it very difficult for a government to get uniforms during times of emergency. It said that such a factory was necessary if government was to have the means of keeping industry honest in the procurement of uniforms from private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently Australia agreed to contribute to the Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai. Had it not been for the Government Clothing Factory the uniforms required by the peacekeeping contingent could not have been produced in time for it to meet its commitments. The rapid development of the Army Reserve is another example of the way in which the factory at Coburg has been able to meet such emergencies. It is important to realise that the factory is not set up to make uniforms for Australian forces in the event of war. It is there to meet emergencies and as a nucleus for the development in the event of war. Long production runs, of course, would be let to private industry. However, in between wars and emergencies it is important to have a factory which can develop new uniforms, act as a store for patterns and be the nucleus from which rapid expansion of uniform making can emanate. </PARA>
<PARA> Some things have been said in the majority report which I would say are quite sensible. I think we have reached a greater degree of agreement on the question of the Government Clothing Factory than was reached on the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo. It is agreed that there is need for a factory although the majority report says that such a factory could well be operated by private industry. It is on this point that we believe the majority report is in serious error. Senator Martyr made some quite extensive comments about the fact that this factory would be able to produce uniforms more cheaply if it were operated by private enterprise. I disagree with that. It was suggested that certain notional costs are not taken into account in the costing of uniforms. I believe those notional costs are fictitious and to say that they have not been taken into account is purely a paper exercise. The facts are that the pricing of uniforms from the Clothing Factory is competitive with private industry. It is also very important to realise that the association which represents the overwhelming majority of the garment manufacturers in this country said that it believed the Government Clothing Factory should remain, that it performed a very valuable function and that, by and large, private enterprise was not interested in the short runs that were essentially the function of the Government Clothing Factory . We have here a very clear statement by the industry that the factory is performing a useful function and that its function could not be easily undertaken by any other means. </PARA>
<PARA> It was also very significant to learn during the evidence that some years ago Sweden tried to close downs its government-owned clothing factory for ideological reasons and that the Swedish Government very quickly found that it could not operate without a government-owned factory which was capable of producing uniforms for its Services. Whilst many honourable senators may think that the debate on this issue is somewhat unimportant and academic, it does raise a very basic issue. Unless we can clothe our forces efficiently and quickly we are not in a position to say that we have a properly equipped Defence Force in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other aspect of the majority report to which I draw the attention of the Senate. It was suggested that the embroidery section was not profitable and, therefore, should be abolished. I think that this would give material for a Gilbert and Sullivan type of comic opera. With a little bit of imagination we could write an opera entitled 'The Naked Admiral'. Imagine the Australian Government saying to the Admiral of the Fleet: 'Here is an aircraft carrier which cost about $1 billion, but we have not got the money to supply the insignia on your uniform. We suggest that you go somewhere else and see whether you can get the insignia. It will cost you something; you pay for it yourself. The Government of this country has not got the money'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, or wherever. This is where the whole concept of cost effectiveness has been drawn to a ridiculous degree. Government senators said that the Government Clothing Factory was uneconomic and, therefore, should be closed down. They are not really concerned about where we can get the insignias which are a necessary part of the armed forces. The whole idea conjures up all kinds of interesting examples. During the revolution in Russia it was decided that there would be a classless, rankless, army; no one would give orders and no one would obey. This was a delightful concept but it did not stand the test of time. In 1943 Stalin found that he had to reintroduce ranks. He finished up giving them the same titles as the old Tsarist Army. We must have ranks in our Services and, unfortunately, rank has to be very clearly observable. If Senator Martyr were the Admiral of the Fleet-heaven help us-I think he would too be pleased that the Government had the money to pay for the trappings on his uniform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make one final point in relation to the inconsistency of the majority report. I will endeavour to be brief. Those responsible for the majority report are the champions of the private enterprise system. But they said that the Government should give favourable consideration, in the event of the factory being sold, to defence contracts being guaranteed. They cannot have it both ways. They either believe in private enterprise, and hence that that can operate without government assistance, or they do not. They are saying, 'Sell the factory but keep the government assistance'. I move an amendment to the majority report in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>At end of motion, add:</PARA>
<PARA> 'but is of the opinion that the proposed sale of the Australian Government Clothing Factory at Coburg is primarily for ideological and not practical reasons and:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) would cause the price of uniforms for the Defence Forces to increase;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) would cause certain sections of the factory to be relocated to other Government factories, with consequent unnecessary social and financial costs;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) would create a risk of Australia becoming dependent on overseas clothing technology; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) has not been justified on the basis of any new factors which have arisen since the previous conservative administration set up the factory after exhaustive debate.'. </PARA>

If the Liberal Party, as the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has reminded us recently, Senator Lewis, were consistent now with the principles established by Sir Robert Menzies it would not be in the awful shape that it is. The fact of the matter is that the proposed sale of the Government Clothing Factory at Coburg emanated from the decisions of the so-called razor gang in April 1981. It is sad to say that while most members of the Liberal Party have ceased to talk any more about the razor gang and have abandoned most of its decisions, only those two well named honourable senators-Senator Crichton-Browne and Senator Martyr-battle on in defence of the principles which guided the Liberal Party 18 months ago and which have been abandoned by everybody else. This is, in a sense, their final monument. I am glad that the report of the Senate Select Committee on Government Clothing and Ordnance Factories has been published because it means the Committee can now be disbanded and that those honourable senators who served on it can get down to some work on serious political issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intended to work up to that. At the height of my speech I was going to talk about embroidery, Senator. I thank the honourable senator for his interjection. The recommendations of the majority report of the Committee have the same sort of sad sense of deja vu about them as the report of the inquiry into the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. It was suggested that the factory should be sold as a going concern. As a sop for that suggestion it was said that the question of persuading the employees of the factory of the benefits should be pursued with maximum vigour. I do not know who will do that. I do not know whether Senator Crichton-Browne and Senator Martyr are offering their services to go the the Coburg factory and explain to the workers that they should really understand that their future would be well secure in their hands. Whatever those honourable senators think about that proposition, the people at the clothing factory do not believe it. They do not believe that, just the same as the people at the Bendigo Ordnance Factory did not believe that when the same honourable senators tried to persuade them that the factory should be sold.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The strange thing about the majority report is that nobody who gave evidence to the Committee believed the clothing factory should be sold. No argument was advanced and there was no evidence before the Committee to say that the clothing factory ought to be sold. The Department of Defence was not keen on the clothing factory being sold. The Australian Confederation of Apparel Manufacturers, the employer body, was not keen on the clothing factory being sold. It did not think it was wise. The employees and the management were not keen. On the basis of all that evidence Senator Crichton-Browne and Senator Martyr deduced that it should be sold. It was an extraordinary exercise in quasi-judicial determination, based on the issues. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, he is not too keen. There was an extraordinary lack of material to suggest that it was a wise, prudent and socially desirable course to sell the factory. The Committee, in the course of its deliberations, went to the factory, inspected the premises, saw the work being done and spoke to management , staff and employees. I believe that it is true to say that all members of the Committee were impressed with the standard of the work being done, with the systems organisation, and with particular aspects as revealed in the course of the evidence. I refer, for instance, to the fact that, when the Defence Department came to the factory and said 'We are going to send a contingent to the Sinai in three weeks; will you provide us with uniforms?', it did so and has done likewise on a number of occasions in similar circumstances, providing a range of uniforms for service personnel, often on very short notice. As Senator Siddons said, the Committee was very impressed with the embroidery section of the factory, where highly skilled machinery work is done. The view was expressed there-it is one that I have no difficulty in believing-that it would be difficult to get that work done anywhere else in Australia. In fact, the embroidery section does work for overseas military forces, producing ceremonial banners and objects of that kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne and Senator Martyr, in their majority report, paid one tribute to the factory. They said that the duplicates of all of the factory patterns ought to be retained outside the structure in case of fire. That was a nice way of saying that there was something really worth retaining about it, but that was about all that was said of that nature in the course of the majority report. I do not believe that either Senator Siddons or myself retreats from the view that probably better financial arrangements could be made. I refer to the way in which the factory accounts are prepared and the costing of various items takes place. However, that is not a reason for selling the factory. It is a reason for saying that the Government should look at ways of making that part of the operation more efficient. I believe that everyone who was aware of the evidence would agree as to that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> The minority of the Committee was impressed by the way in which the factory operates, by its work force, by its good industrial relations record, by the particular skills displayed in certain sections, by the concern of the employees about the maintenance of what has been a steady employment situation for most of them over many years, and by the general wider community concern that the factory should be retained. No one is lining up to buy it. No organisation seriously puts itself forward as contending for the work that is done by the factory. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I say that the factory has been the subject of a number of inquiries, each of which has come to the conclusion that the factory should be retained as a public service, a service to the State, if you will, in terms of the work done. The Allison and Brewster report referred to the great variety of items manufactured and its relatively short production runs, which affect costs. That passage is quoted in the minority report. For the reasons I have given I was a signatory to the minority report. I hope that the Government will take precisely the same attitude to this matter as it did to the Bendigo Ordnance Factory report and reject the decision of the majority of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I pay tribute to those other senators who served on the Committee because, although I disagreed with two of them, I at least managed to express my disagreement in most civil ways, as I always do, and they did the same to me. I pay tribute particularly to Senator Siddons who, I think it is fair to say, if I am not telling secrets out of school, was substantially the author of the minority report. I have pleasure in seconding the amendment moved by Senator Siddons. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall be very brief because Senator Martyr, in a very articulate and precise manner, laid before the Senate, as an addendum to the report, those matters that we canvassed, which quite properly should be touched upon. I should say at the outset that it gave me more satisfaction to deal with this part of the inquiry than that which related to the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. To say the least, it was nothing short of depressing to see the manner in which that factory was operating and its lack of capacity and potential for the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe it is reasonable to say that the Government Clothing Factory is very well managed. Mr Silk, from what I observed in a rather superficial way perhaps, is doing an admirable job, labouring under the circumstances of its being a government factory from the outset. The factory seems to be well laid out and there seems to be good morale among the work force, although one could not help but note that when the Government announced its intention to sell the factory, allegedly one of the staff attempted to burn it down. I do not know whether that is a reflection of the employees' dear love for Mr Silk or the Government, or their abhorrence and fear concerning the efficiencies of private enterprise. On the whole, it appears to be a happy work force and to be functioning well. The fact is that it is a Government clothing factory and does operate at a loss, including notional costs-which are as real as any other-of some $1.6m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> One is drawn to the conclusion by the evidence-the same evidence as that upon which we reflected in the first part of our inquiry-that the Government, by its very nature, does not seek to derive a profit from these types of activities or, in many cases, to break even in a proper way taking into consideration notional costs. In fact, when I asked Mr Silk, the manager, whether he was seeking to operate on a non-profit or non-loss basis, while covering all outgoings from charges made to customers, his response was yes. He went on to say that he got into trouble whether he made a loss or a profit; that he was supposed to end up square in spite of the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, I suspect that that reflects the attitudes of government departments these days. They just do not have a profit mentality, even when profit is possible. Perhaps one should not be too critical of modern civil servants, who are steeped in the ways of governments. There used to be a time, at least under conservative governments, when it was felt that government was intended to provide those services and facilities that it could best provide and private enterprise ought to provide those that could more efficiently and effectively be provided by it. It is regrettable that successive governments have ensured that provision of these services and so we find this mentality-that costs and profits are of no real consequence. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Aitchison, the executive director of the Australian Confederation of Apparel Manufacturers, as mentioned earlier, did suggest that private enterprise did not particularly want this factory to be sold out of government hands. I have to say that I have some reservations as to his motives. One could not help but note that, with the high level of protection afforded the clothing manufacturing industry, the more factories that are open and the more diversification of ownership that occurs, the less likelihood there is that protection will remain at present levels. Moreover, I believe it was Mr Silk who testified that one difficulty the factory had was that it trained competently and capably skilled machinists, only to find that they were tempted into private enterprise factories. A number of the staff who commenced their employment with that factory were unable to speak fluent English and there were special training courses to teach them to speak English. The factory was providing a skilled workforce only to have it removed from it and placed, as a result perhaps of better offers or different offers, in private enterprise. I refer honourable senators to page 231 of the evidence where the point was made by Mr Aitchison when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the industry itself has some sympathy for the factory because it does provide a reservoir, I suppose, of training. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the reasons that were given for the retention of the factory in government hands was that the defence forces could very quickly obtain their clothing and equipment at short notice. The example was given to us of the Sinai peacekeeping force's requiring its uniforms in a very short time. I think that that was a unique circumstance and that by and large departments should know their uniform requirements well in advance. On reflection, it seems to me that perhaps we have inefficient management, poor judgments and slow decisions being made by the defence forces and that they are seeking to compound their incompetence by asking for a government factory to ensure that th manifestation of their incompetence is not reflected in the end result of their clothing demands. It has also been suggested that the factory plays a unique role. Of course, that is not the case. It plays a vital role in our defence needs, but it is certainly not unique. Indeed, Mr Ballantine, the President of the Combined Union Shop Stewards Committee of the Australian Government Clothing Factory at Coburg, said:</PARA>
<PARA> I think perhaps we should not get carried away with the making of garments. It is my belief that private industry can make any garment at all. There is not a garment that can be made at the Government Clothing Factory that cannot be made by private industry. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact 35 per cent of the type of work that is carried out by the clothing factory is done in private enterprise. I believe it is reasonable to say that any similar factory in the hands of a private operator could duplicate the activities being conducted in that factory. Of course, in the light of the size of the factory and its workforce, for an effective sale there would have to be some guarantee from government departments as to its work load. Mr Hugh Ryan, the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce, has said that the Government could guarantee a minimum of 500,000 hours per year. I find it interesting to note, at this time of high unemployment and an apparent downturn in the economy, that this particular industry is having difficulty in attracting skilled workers and that the industry is allegedly running at full capacity. In the final analysis, the bottom line argument in this debate is whether the activities of this factory are better managed and better conducted by private enterprise or in the hands of government. That tends to be subjective view dependent on one's philosophical approach to life. Senator Martyr and I believe that we have examined the evidence in an objective way. On the basis of that, we have drawn the distinct conclusion that this factory can be well managed and well run by private enterprise as compared with the way that it is run in the hands of the civil service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has functioned very well in this case. We have all been of the same mind, at least in terms of the facts. It was in the distilling of the facts as they were assembled, and it was in reaching conclusions, that we had to take a different view. I noted the comment made earlier that the factory was set up in the first place by a conservative government. I do not feel bound by the precedents of poor judgments by previous governments, either of our persuasion or that of the Opposition. To illustrate the point I am making, that factory makes uniforms for the Victorian Police Force and it makes them at below cost. As I understand it, the first uniform is provided to police in Victoria by the Government. Subsequent uniforms are required to be purchased by the individual policemen. So in fact that factory is subsidising not only the Victorian Government but also individual policemen in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that there is no sensible approach by Government to place the factory on an efficient, economic and viable footing. In the event that the factory is not sold, I hope that the Government chooses to give more flexibility to management, to give management a freer hand to make value judgments and to allow management to seek to run the factory at least at break-even point, taking into account the notional costs. At present that is certainly not the case and that is one of the reasons why we conclude that the factory ought to be sold. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-On behalf of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) I table a policy discussion paper on extrinsic aids to statutory interpretation. The paper examines the extent to which, in interpreting Acts of Parliament, regard can properly and usefully be had to reports, explanatory memoranda and other materials that do not themselves form part of the Act. For this purpose the paper examines the extent to which the courts already use such extrinsic materials. It goes on to consider whether the range of such extrinsic materials needs to be broadened, and how that could be brought about in a way that would be satisfactory and acceptable from the point of view of the courts and of the audience to which the Act is directed. Finally, the paper sets forth for consideration and discussion a possible procedure and program for the use of specially prepared explanatory memoranda limited, initially at least, to selected Acts considered by their sponsors to be appropriate for this purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The discussion paper arises out of an initiative announced by the Attorney- General in 1981 at the time he introduced the Bill to insert section 15AA in the Acts Interpretation Act. The Attorney-General stated that an examination would be undertaken of the topic, with a view to developing proposals that would be brought into the Parliament for further consideration. There has also been considerable interest in the exercise by groups outside Parliament and indeed overseas as well, and it is hoped and expected that the paper will produce a vigorous and fruitful debate. My only regret is that Senator Durack is not personally able to open that debate, as the exercise is very much his own personal initiative. No official examination of this kind has taken place since Federation in 1901, although as the paper indicates there have been some distinguished precursors. </PARA>
<PARA> The paper is also timely in view of the quite remarkable way in which the problems of statutory interpretation have engaged the attention of both our highest courts and the wider Australian community in recent times. One thing that clearly emerges from the paper is that the courts already can refer to extrinsic materials in certain cases under the existing rules of interpretation. Legislation is not made in a vacuum and each Act must be read in its context. Courts may, and on occasion do, look at reports and other materials leading to the legislation in question. Recently, individual judges of the High Court of Australia have gone to the extent of looking at Hansard to identify the problem the Act addresses or even to ascertain directly what was the parliamentary intent. These judicial developments are of great significance. However, other judges take a more restricted view, and this in itself raises a problem. There are other problems. Often these materials will not be readily accessible to the ordinary users of statutes. They are not necessarily self-explanatory and often require a difficult exercise of evaluation. Finally, as the paper notes, overall there has been much greater reluctance to use parliamentary materials than to use other materials, such as reports, that in fact are more remote from the law- making process than is Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances, the paper proposes for consideration the use in selected cases of a specially prepared explanatory memorandum or statement that would be submitted to Parliament along with the legislation in question. The memorandum, when approved, would be made as accessible to the users of the legislation as the legislation itself. One of the most interesting points that emerges from the paper is that the idea of such a special explanatory statement has received wide interest or support over a considerable period. The paper cites Professor C. K. Allen, in his time one of the most distinguished commentators on the English legal system which we have inherited in Australia. Reference is also made to the detailed study of this proposal by the 1969 report of the English and Scottish Law Commissions, presided over, I should add, by Lord Scarman, one of the most distinguished of the English law lords. Sir Stanley Burbury spoke in favour of the idea on his retirement from the Tasmanian Supreme Court, and associated the idea with proposals along these lines made by the eminent American jurist Dean Roscoe Pound. I therefore commend the paper and look forward to the constructive debate that I believe its analysis of the topic and the proposals it makes deserves. </PARA>
<PARA> Statutory interpretation is a matter that directly concerns all those whose activities are affected by Acts of Parliament. In modern society, that means everyone. However, members of this Parliament have a particular concern in ensuring as far as possible that Acts passed by them give effect to their understanding and expectations of what Acts mean. In our time, there have been a number of developments. One is the increasing use of objects clauses to set forth the object or purpose of Acts. Another was the enactment last year of section 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act directing courts to prefer that interpretation which promotes the object or purpose of an Act to one that does not. The paper points the way to a further possible development, and at the same time draws attention to judicial developments of considerable significance. </PARA>
<PARA> The intention is that time should be allowed for the paper to be studied and debated, inside and outside the Parliament, before any decision is taken on whether its specific proposals should be proceeded with. Clearly the kind of special explanatory memoranda it envisages would require the devising of appropriate procedures for each House, and both Houses jointly, for dealing with the approval and possible amendment of such memoranda. The nature of these procedures is, of course, a matter for the Houses to consider and decide. The paper notes that one of the vital factors in the success of the proposal would be the spirit in which the courts accept such aids to interpretation. It could equally be said that success would also depend on the spirit in which this Parliament receives the proposals and implements them. </PARA>
<PARA> On the machinery aspects, consideration and amendment of a memorandum in conjunction with the consideration of the Bill to which it relates may turn out to be incompatible with the existing practices of the two Houses. However, a motion of approval of a memorandum, quite separate from the consideration of the Bill, could be an acceptable alternative. This could be achieved by the motion being agreed to in the House in which the Bill originated and transmitted to the other House for its concurrence; or the motion being moved separately in both Houses and agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed that a symposium will be held early in the New Year involving parliamentarians, eminent judges and other lawyers, as well as other interested groups. The purpose will be to further the discussion and also to help bring an early resolution of the issues so that decisions can be made as soon as possible on the proposals in the paper. I would like to commend officers of the Attorney- General's Department, in particular Mr Brazil, a Deputy Secretary of the Department, and Mr Kolts, First Parliamentary Counsel, for the valuable work done by them in the preparation of this paper. I commend the paper to the consideration of Parliament. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a fascinating subject, especially for lawyers, and I am minded-indeed, prepared-to wax lyrical upon it for my full half hour. However, bearing in mind other more immediately exciting topics bearing down upon us, I will limit my contribution to just a few seconds-maybe about 120 seconds. I think what should be said-it is really quite important-is that anyone who thinks that statutory interpretation issues of the kind dealt with here are too exotic for anyone but lawyers to take an interest in need only contemplate the havoc caused by the Barwick High Court of Australia in its literal interpretation of tax laws throughout the 1970s which has contributed along, of course, with the neglect of the present Government, to our discontents on the taxation front.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition welcomes very much the appearance of this Green Paper, so-called , although green ink does not seem to have gone anywhere near it in its production and even if it is, in the finest traditions of the Attorney-General's Department, now over a year late in its appearance. It was said back in September 1981 that the Paper would be brought forward before the Parliament rises. Senator Durack did not say which Parliament. The idea of policy discussion papers to generate in the community debate of a constructive kind on complex issues is a very sensible one and one which deserves a lot more repetition, although I do not suppose that we could expect that from this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the proposal for formal explanatory memoranda to be de-endorsed by Parliament at the same time as the parent legislation is neither very new nor very radical but it would, I believe, represent a significant contribution toward more acceptable interpretation by judges. Partly as a backlash to the excesses of the Barwick High Court, courts right around Australia, I believe, are now more alert to the purpose and intent of legislation than they have been in the past and more sensitive to the social and economic effects of their interpretation. But that process needs all the reinforcement it can get. I repeat that we welcome the appearance of this policy paper, congratulate those responsible, particularly Mr Brazil and Mr Kolts for its preparation, and look forward to an early opportunity to debate it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that it will come as something of a surprise to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) to know that the Australian Democrats wholeheartedly support the proposals that are outlined in this little document entitled 'Extrinsic Aids to Statutory Interpretation'. As a lay person and not as a lawyer who is likely to get highly enthusiastic over this matter, I cannot quite understand why taking into account what Parliament wanted in the first place should be considered extrinsic to the legislation. As an English teacher I would have thought that it was intrinsic to it but I do not want to spend a great deal of time debating the title of this paper. It is a relief to see that following the Government's limited success with section 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act, the Government is continuing in what appears to be a proposal to inject further fresh air and common sense into the interpretation of legislation in this country. I for one certainly hope to be able to take part in the proposed symposium that was referred to at the end of the Minister's statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wonder whether the enthusiasm amongst lawyers that Senator Evans referred to will be very positive enthusiasm or whether it will not be more involved with beating of breasts and tearing out of hair since lawyers and some others in this country make considerable livelihood through the adversary system that exists in the law courts of this country. Through a series of mental gymnastics and semantic pedantry lawyers argue the finer points of law arising out of unclear wording and intention in Acts and unwitting and/or unintentional loopholes and anomalies. I suspect that they will not like at all anything which is likely to clarify this and take away the intellectual stimulation that they seem to find from arguing the point. On those grounds alone it means that this proposal is worth supporting. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats have, of course, had occasion to be upset-the matter is quite close to our hearts-with the insistence on some of the judiciary in taking absolutely literal interpretations as has happened to us within the last 18 months in a High Court of Australia challenge regarding the advertising campaign that was mounted against us in Western Australia during the last Federal election. The definition of 'casting a vote' was defined very narrowly- more or less in terms of dropping the damn thing in a ballot box-and no consideration was paid to what was done prior to that to determine fairly or otherwise how a voter was likely to make up his mind. In September this year the Age referred to Sir Garfield Barwick's penchant for narrowly sticking to pedantic semantics in relation to the Westraders case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. We are only up to the second sentence. It is correct, as the point is made in the document, that legislation is becoming increasingly complex. But it is also affecting more and more ordinary people in the community, people who are not lawyers, people who expect to have common sense and the intentions of the Parliament of this country taken into account when the court is asked to make a decision. It is ludicrous for the Parliament of this country, which is allegedly made up of ordinary people and not just lawyers-although I admit that there is a surfeit of them here at the moment-to pass legislation which it thinks it understands, which it believes has a specific purpose, intention and meaning only to find that those very people it is intended to apply to can avoid it, in the case of punitive legislation, or not make full use of it, in the case of legislation which is intended to assist them. An example of the first situation, of course, is the tax law. Any member of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills can refer to any number of examples relating to the second case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Judicial interpretation is clearly important to protect the liberties and rights of the people and nobody is going to argue with that. But it should not act, however unwittingly or coincidentally, to subvert the intention of the Parliament which passed the Act. Section 15AA, as I have already said, has gone some way towards correcting that. The use of specific and special memoranda as a second step to ensuring that the spirit of the law and the intentions of lawmakers-that is, members of parliament-are taken into account, is welcomed by me and by my party. I too, commend the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and his Department for their efforts in this regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-On 22 September 1982 the Government tabled 85 documents relating to straw companies and the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 arising from the debate in the Senate on 9 September 1982. One category of documents tabled included advice from the Commissioner of Taxation, correspondence between Ministers, departmental minutes and other material which even on the most generous interpretation of what might have been tabled in the fullest freedom of information legislation would not normally have been available. There has been this very wide disclosure because the Government appreciates the public interest involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The documents tabled included also three opinions by counsel. As to other legal opinions, a police investigation report and departmental legal advice that were sought, the Solicitor-General advised that their release would be harmful to the administration of justice. He stated that harm, in his view, would be caused both to those who may be prosecuted and to those who may be proceeded against civilly, or to the cause of the prosecutor or civil complainant. In many instances both sides would be injured. He stated also that injury could not, in his view, be avoided by excising names. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate nevertheless by its resolution of 23 September 1982 resolved that the documents withheld should be tabled, and indeed at the last moment added a further document to the list, consisting of the report of a Taxation investigation officer in a bottom-of-the-harbour scheme. The tabling of the papers referred to in the resolution was specifically stated to be 'subject to' the editing of the papers by the Royal Commissioner, Mr Costigan, in consultation with the Crown Solicitor, to ensure that no material is published which would prejudice the conduct of legal proceedings against those involved in tax evasion and avoidance schemes. The resolution raises a number of important issues and it calls for a considered Government response, even if, for reasons to which I shall now refer, the terms of the resolution have been rendered inoperative. </PARA>
<PARA>Editing of Documents by Royal Commissioner Costigan</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>When the Senate resumed earlier this week, the President of the Senate tabled a letter dated 8 October from the Royal Commissioner, Mr Costigan, in which he has confirmed the view that I had already indicated to the Senate when the Senate resolution was being debated on 23 September last. I shall refer to that view in the words Mr Costigan has used in his letter. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was originally advised of the suggestion which ultimately found expression in the Senate resolution I indicated that in my view it was both inappropriate to my present Commission and indeed beyond my terms of reference to undertake such a role. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the resolution of the Senate I have given further consideration to this matter. Such consideration has not changed my opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> I must therefore with great respect to the Senate resolution decline the invitation implicit in it. </PARA>
<PARA>I also seek leave to have the whole of Mr Costigan's letter incorporated in Hansard as an appendix to this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Mr Costigan's reply speaks for itself and needs no gloss from me except to note the obvious, which is that as the Senate's resolution is expressed to be 'subject to' the editing of the document in question by Mr Costigan, and as Mr Costigan has declined that invitation, the terms of the resolution have become inoperative. I have already mentioned that I indicated to the Senate, before it passed the resolution, that this was a view Mr Costigan had already expressed when approached by the Attorney-General ( Senator Durack) on 10 September 1982.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Costigan's letter refers to his terms of reference. The role envisaged by the resolution would not be an appropriate one to graft on to the present terms of reference of the Royal Commission. A totally new kind of inquiry would be involved. It would give the Royal Commission a totally new character and burden it with functions that could interfere with its performance of the role for which it was appointed. It appears on the face of it quite inappropriate to ask a royal commission to inquire into, and report to the Governor-General on, the matters referred to in the resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>Constitutional Issues</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The resolution, however, raises wider issues of a constitutional character which any Government mindful of its responsibilities under the Constitution would be bound to raise, whatever its complexion and whatever the particular issues involved might be. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 61 of the Constitution commits the enforcement of the laws of the Commonwealth to the Executive Government. It is part of that constitutionally assigned responsibility to conduct prosecutions as appropropriate and to recover outstanding tax. It is a further part of that same responsibility to decide what government documents of a legal or investigative character can properly be released in the public interest so as not to prejudice the conduct of legal proceedings that may be brought against alleged offenders against the laws of the Commonwealth. The Government is under the further obligation not to prejudice the fair trial of any alleged defendant by the release of information that might reasonably be considered to be prejudicial to his fair trial. </PARA>
<PARA> That responsibility may be qualified by legislation passed by both Houses of Parliament and assented to by the Crown, but that does not affect the basic position. That legislation then becomes one of the laws the Executive Government should enforce and maintain. Subject, however, to such legislation, the manner, the method and the means of executing and maintaining Commonwealth laws are matters for the Executive Government to decide, subject of course to the conventions of responsibile government. So much was said very plainly by Mr Justice Isaacs in New South Wales v The Commonwealth (1915) 20 Commonwealth Law Reports, at page 89. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet on one reading the basis upon which the Senate resolution has been constructed and passed is that the decision on these matters can be assigned, against the wishes of the constitutionally appointed repository of the function, to some third person. The resolution referred to Mr Costigan. Another suggestion made in the debate was the Ombudsman, Professor J. Richardson. The Government's extensive inquiries on the matter have not been able to unearth any precedent for such a resolution in these particular terms or to like effect, either in the Australian Parliament, or in the House of Commons. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from precedents, a very serious constitutional issue arises as to whether a resolution of this kind is within the powers of either House of the Parliament. It raises the kind of issue that was referred to by the High Court in the Boilermakers Case (1956) 94 CLR, at page 277, where the following comments of Professor Harrison Moore were adopted:</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the Commonwealth Parliament it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the separation of powers was intended to establish legal limitations on the powers of the organs of government, and that the Courts are required to address themselves to the problem of defining the functions of those organs. </PARA>
<PARA>We are dealing here not with a claim of Senate privilege versus Executive privilege but a question of the separation of powers. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of these considerations, it is interesting to note that the motion by Senator Evans at present before the Senate-it is yet to be dealt with and I will mention it at the end of my speech; Senator Evans had notice of a motion yesterday and it is that motion to which I refer-only 'requests' the Government that the editorial role envisaged by the tabling resolution of 23 September be performed by a third person outside government. That formula is, I believe, the more constitutionally appropriate way for the Senate to address matters of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in another respect the latest motion labours under similar difficulties. It seeks to involve the Federal Judiciary in the exercise of Executive responsibility, and in fact compounds the problems to which I have referred by proposing that the Chief Judge of the Federal Court nominate a Federal Judge to perform a non-judicial function of a plainly executive character. Perhaps some analogy with the role of Judges in dealing with claims of Crown privilege in litigation between parties is being relied on. If so, I would point out that the interests in that situation are very different from those involved in the case of a difference of views between the Executive and a House of Parliament. Also, the suggestion does not solve the problem of the separation of powers. As I have said, it only compounds it. </PARA>
<PARA>Role of Solicitor-General and Commissioner of Taxation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As I observed in the debate in the Senate on 23 September there is agreement in the Senate, in the broad, that it would be accepted by all honourable senators from all parts of the chamber that nothing should be tabled that would prejudice proceedings that may be brought against persons guilty of tax evasion or avoidance. I should add to the circulated statement that there would also be common ground between us that nothing should be tabled which would prejudice the proper defence of proceedings brought either civilly or criminally. </PARA>
<PARA> The issues are the narrower ones of whose opinion should be accepted for this purpose and also, what tests should be applied. Senator Evans acknowledged in debate on 23 September 1982 that he is on record about the ability of the Solicitor-General, Sir Maurice Byers, and his freedom from political bias. I do not want to take the time of the Senate in repeating at length what I have already said in the earlier debate on this topic on 23 September 1982. However, I should mention again that, quite apart from the professional independence and integrity of a person of his eminence and standing, the Solicitor-General is an independent statutory officer appointed under the Law Officers Act 1964. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not propose to table documents that, on the advice received from the Solicitor-General, would be harmful to the administration of justice. In view of the very special and sensitive character, however, of the document referred to in item 12 of the Senate resolution of 23 September, I interpolate that that is the investigator's report to the Commissioner of Taxation-the Government has considered it appropriate to refer the question of its tabling to the Commissioner of Taxation. The document referred to consists of the report of a taxation investigation officer into a bottom-of-the-harbour scheme. The Government believes that it should accept the views of the Commissioner of Taxation on that document, which briefly are that even with sanitising and editing, the tabling of the document in any meaningful form would offend against section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. I seek leave to incorporate the Commissioner's statement as an appendix to this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just to add to the sense of the statement I am making to the Senate now, I must quote one further sentence from the statement of the Commissioner of Taxation. He states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>So there is a twofold objection to the tabling of that document-the possible infringement of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act and the prejudice to the prosecution which might be brought with respect to a particular bottom-of- the-harbour scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Test to be Applied</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Senate resolution of 23 September was specifically amended just before its adoption to refer to the exclusion only of materials that would, not might, prejudice the conduct of legal proceedings against those involved in tax evasion and avoidance schemes. While the Solicitor-General has advised that some of the documents in question could with sanitising and editing be tabled under the test in the resolution, he has further advised that other documents could not be tabled even under that test. Also, I have confirmed personally with the Solicitor-General that he is still of the opinion that in the case of all the documents he previously examined their tabling would be harmful to the administration of justice in the sense I referred to at the opening of this statement. It is the Government and not the Senate that bears the responsibility for the enforcement and maintenance of the laws of the Commonwealth and for ensuring that appropriate steps are taken for the bringing of proceedings, civil and criminal, that are presently contemplated in relation to tax evasion. It is idle to think that this is a responsibility that the Executive Government can properly abdicate to this House or some third person. The Government's decision remains that it should take account of the advice expressed by the Solicitor- General and referred to on the tabling of documents on 23 September last. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust and expect that the reasons for this position will be understood and appreciated. It would be easy enough in one sense to table all the documents. As was indicated on 22 September, the legal opinions are not all one way. However, as the Treasurer (Mr Howard) stated at the outset, the only appropriate course the Government can take is to accept and act on the views of the Solicitor- General. As to document 12, it believes it must act on the view expressed by the Commissioner of Taxation. The wider issues I have raised have not been referred to in any spirit of confrontation. It would be remiss of any Government not to raise them having regard to the responsibilities of the Executive Government for the enforcement and maintenance of the laws of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> If I may return briefly to a passage on page 4 of the statement, I repeat that it is part of that constitutionally assigned responsibility to conduct prosecutions as appropriate and to recover outstanding tax. It is a further part of that same responsibility to decide what government documents of a legal or investigative character can properly be released in the public interest so as not to prejudice the conduct of legal proceedings that may be brought against alleged offenders against the laws of the Commonwealth. The Government is under the further obligation not to prejudice the fair trial of any alleged defendant by the release of information that might reasonably be considered to be prejudicial to his fair trial. I commend those reasons for the consideration of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been agreed between the Government and the Opposition that there be a cognate debate on this statement and general business notice of motion No. 63 in the name of Senator Evans. Once this statement and the motion that the Senate take note of the statement are dealt with, I shall be moving to rearrange the order of business to enable Senator Evans to move his motion. In other words, it is proposed that we should have a cognate debate which effectively debates both the statement I have put down and the motion to take note of it and the motion which will be brought up, subject to the concurrence of the Senate, for vote later today, that is, the motion to be moved by Senator Evans to amend the original motion to which I have responded in this statement. </PARA>

<PARA>STATEMENT BY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION IN RELATION TO DOCUMENT 12</PARA>
<PARA> The amended motion carried by the Senate on 23 September 1982 calls for the tabling of a document-Document No. 12-which was not covered by the original motion. This document is an 18 page report by a senior investigation officer to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> I have carefully read this document and am of the opinion that it cannot be tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> The document is an internal working document prepared within the Australian Taxation Office dealing with a particular company's affairs. It contains a full narrative of the case, details of evidentiary material and of admissions made on which a prosecution might be based and it canvasses the legal arguments available to support a prosecution. It contains several pages of verbatim evidence obtained during an interview of a person by a police inspector. It is a document which, by its very nature, reveals the whole substance of the case that might be made against certain people and in my view its tabling would be even more damaging to future prospects of prosecution action than the tabling of legal opinions. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act provides that an officer shall not, except in the performance of any duty as an officer, communicate to any person any information acquired as an officer. It is my view that I am prohibited by this provision from releasing the document in its complete form for the purpose apparently envisaged by the motion. In addition, it is a fact that a great many people are aware of the identity of the particular case dealt with. In these circumstances any deletions from, or alterations to, the document to conceal identities of people would not solve the problem and it is unavoidable that any information at all provided in a so-called ''sanitized'' version would offend against section 16. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the further point that if the document suffered such deletions and alterations as would be necessary to meet the requirements of section 16 the result would be that what was left would be insufficient to convey much, if any, sense to a reader. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that I am of the opinion that the document cannot be tabled and I hope that the Parliament can accept my submission on this point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), taking the high constitutional ground that it does, reminds me of nothing so much as one of those fog machines that were traditionally used on movie sets, cranking out on cue great thick clouds of artificial smoke, designed to obscure key elements in the scene and add a general air of mystery to it at the same time. There is nothing in that statement which should deter the Senate from continuing on the course on which it has embarked, nor will we on this side of the chamber be deterred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me at the outset remind the Senate of the particular documents which are the subject of the resolution of 23 September. I remind the Senate also why we are seeking them and why it is in the Government's political interest not to provide them. The 14 groups of documents fall into two main classes. On the one hand, there are legal opinions obtained from Queen's Counsel and others which, with one or two exceptions, appear likely, on the evidence of the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, to amount to strongly and persuasively argued reasons for believing that legal proceedings could have been taken under the existing law against the participants in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. The second class of documents is a miscellany of letters and memoranda written mainly by officers of the Attorney-General's Department which, on the evidence of the Costigan report again, are likely to amount to a quite inadequate explanation of why proceedings could not have been taken. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems, then, likely that the tabling of the documents will profoundly embarrass the Government in several interrelated ways. It will reveal, as I said on 23 September, that the Government had strategy open to it under the existing law, that it could have actually prosecuted under the existing law but it did not; that it could have run civil proceedings under the existing law to recover the taxes in question but it did not; that it did have well and cogently argued opinions and memoranda arguing that such proceedings could proceed and that it did not have well and cogently argued opinions and memoranda arguing the contrary, just a series of bleating ex post rationalisations from senior officials to justify their inaction. The credibility of the Government very much hangs upon the quality of those legal opinions and the contents of those documents. Its lack of credibility will stand nakedly revealed if those documents are in fact put down. </PARA>
<PARA> What weapons, what armour has the Government then mobilised to protect itself against this possible embarrassment? It seems to me that in the course of the ministerial statement we have five separate propositions advanced, and I want to spend my time going through them in turn. The first proposition is that the Costigan response has rendered the resolution of the Senate inoperative. The second proposition is that no document can be tabled in this case without prejudice to the administration of justice. The third proposition is that Parliament should accept the decision of the Solicitor-General without demur on these matters. The fourth proposition, and here we get on to the high ground, is that it is wrong of Parliament to seek to exercise, itself or through some third person delegate, functions which properly belong to the Executive. The final proposition is that it is wrong of Parliament to purport to delegate the functions in question, in particular to a sitting judge. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go through each of those in turn. The first proposition is that the Costigan response has rendered the Senate resolution inoperative. This is said in Senator Chaney's statement with all the sense of triumph of Little Jack Horner sitting in his corner pulling out his thumb with a plum on top of it. Of course that point was conceded by the Opposition, as the text of the notice of motion that I gave yesterday makes perfectly clear. It is necessary for the terms of the Senate resolution to be amended or supplemented if it is to have practical effect. What we are seeking to do in the motion of which I gave notice yesterday, and will formally move-I hope to have the question put on it at the conclusion of this debate-is just that. </PARA>
<PARA> The second proposition is that no document, it is said, can be tabled without prejudice to the administration of justice. The concept of the administration of justice is used by the Minister here, as it was in the original Government response, in a kind of shifting, sliding way to accommodate almost anything the Government wants it to. The administration of justice has become almost synonomous in the Government's usage of it in this statement with the concept of 'truth, justice and the Australian way'. What we mean by the administration of justice, and the sense in which we are employing that term, and the Senate employed that term in passing the resolution of 23 September, is the prejudice or otherwise to legal proceedings. It is in that narrower sense, which we believe is the only appropriate sense in the context of which this debate should proceed, that we press the point. We regard the only relevant criterion-it is a wide-ranging one-as being that specified in the terms of the motion; namely, would the tabling of the documents in unedited form prejudice the conduct of legal proceedings against those involved in tax avoidance and evasion schemes. Of course I add in parenthesis that there are a number of ways in which proceedings can be prejudiced and blatant unfairness to an accused person may well be a ground for aborting a trial. A number of aspects of the Government's concern are accommodated within that narrower language that I insist, and the Senate has so far insisted, should be the language used as the criterion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate majority never had any desire to interfere with the administration of justice in this sense. That is why we have been concerned to have the filter mechanism that is proposed in that resolution. That is why we want to have someone, independently of politics and independently of the executive filtering the documents, making this decision, in order to avoid any possibility of there being such prejudice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There will still be enough to embarrass the Government, Senator Haines, so I do not think there is too much to worry about in that respect. That is why the resistance is being mounted. There will be sufficient substance left, I am sure, to make the point that we are all interested in seeing made, and to ensure that the truth is revealed. We have also been prepared to conceed that of course it is possible that on examination some of the documents will fail this test of prejudice to proceedings but it is also perfectly likely that a good many of them will pass it in one form or another. So much is acknowledged in the ministerial statement at page 8 where the following passage appears:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the Solicitor-General has advised that some of the documents in question could with sanitizing and editing be tabled under the test in the resolution . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that the Solicitor-General advised that some of these documents could, with sanitising and editing, be tabled under the test in the resolution. So it has been acknowledged even on the Government side that the test is not an unreasonable one by reference to the criterion in question. Why on earth is the Government holding back? I suggest the reasons speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The third proposition is that the Parliament should accept without demur the opinion of the Solicitor-General in respect of the application of this test of prejudice to proceedings. This is a question which we argued at length the last time this matter was debated and no more than Senator Chaney do I propose to repeat what I said in this place on 23 September. It is no disrespect to the ability, character or position of Sir Maurice Byers to say, as we have said and I say again, that he is simply too close to the Executive in this matter. He must be regarded as being an officer of the Executive for all practical purposes and, indeed, his role as an officer of the Executive becomes important as a part of the Government's later argument. We would further say, as we have said before , that we believe that in this instance, no doubt in perfectly good faith, he has erred on the side of caution. It is for those reasons, which I have spelt out at greater length-I do not repeat them now-that I believe he is an inappropriate person to act as the once and for all filter in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA> We now come to the high ground, the constitutional argument-the argument that it is wrong of Parliament to seek to exercise itself or through some third person acting as a parliamentary delegate functions which properly belong to the Executive; that this amounts to some breach, according to Senator Chaney, of the separation of powers doctrine. Let me say at the outset that the whole argument of the Minister and the Government is founded on a false premise, the false premise being that the Senate is seeking, itself, to 'enforce the laws of the Commonwealth'. Of course the Senate by this resolution is not seeking to do anything of that kind at all. Rather, it is seeking the tabling of papers, as it has done on numerous occasions-it is set out for the record in Odgers at page 585-in order to determine for itself whether the Executive arm has been discharging its constitutional responsibility to enforce and maintain the laws. It is because of the profound suspicion not only on this side of the Parliament but also in the community at large that the Executive has not been performing its functions in relation to the maintenance and enforcement of the revenue laws that the legislature, the Senate, has been led to take the present course of action-to exercise its constitutional function as part of the legislature to demand accountability to it by the Executive. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for those reasons-they are central to the argument-that we are seeking these papers. Indeed, tucked away on page 5 of the statement as it was circulated by the Minister, it is acknowledged that anything that the Executive does in its law enforcement role is subject to the conventions of responsible government. I know that those conventions are rather sick under the present administration, but I cannot believe that they are being torn up entirely and that we are having asserted to us today by the Minister a denial of the legislature's role in seeking that degree of accountability and responsibility from the Executive. On this same point, on page 4 of the ministerial statement the extraordinary suggestion is made that in calling for these papers but at the same time seeking to provide for an independent check to ensure that no harm is done to the public interest, the Parliament-the Senate-is itself 'deciding what Government documents of a legal or Executive character can be relevant' and that this is an exercise of the Executive law enforcement power, argued to be, constitutionally speaking, an improper exercise of that power. </PARA>
<PARA> There is so much fudging and so much conceptual confusion rolled up into that particular part of the ministerial statement that it is very difficult to untangle it. All I can really do is put two propositions. In the first place, for the Senate to require, by way of direction or through the delegation of the function, the release of papers in the way it is doing, can hardly itself be a law enforcement function. That proposition is so obvious as to hardly bear assertion in that form but, extraordinarily enough, that does seem to be what is being asserted by the ministerial statement. I add the rider that it seems to me that whether or not that function is performed directly by the Senate itself or by someone acting on the Senate's direction or at its request makes no difference to the force of that basic proposition. The mere seeking of the tabling of papers can hardly be the exercise, in any credible sense, of a law enforcement function. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing I would say, and it is a very important proposition, is this: There may be some room in this whole matter for a claim by the Executive of Executive privilege to the extent that it can plausibly be claimed that the public interest is somehow at risk in relation to the tabling of some or all of these papers in an edited or unedited fashion. It may be that, given the quite rapid development of the law of Executive privilege in this area in recent years in cases such as the Sankey case, the defence papers case and the more recent Northern Territory case, the question of what the Executive can and cannot refuse to produce could fall ultimately for determination in the courts. That may be the case. But that consideration cannot operate right now at the threshold to deny the Parliament the power to require the production of documents in the first place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To make any such claim-and I have no doubt whatsoever, despite the interjection, that that is the claim being made in the ministerial statement -is to turn both law and convention on their head and to do so, of course, for a transparent political purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make one further point in relation to this argument about the separation of powers. Even if we accept, as I do not, that the Parliament here is somehow seeking to exercise itself an Executive function, it really is just claiming too much for the constitutional doctrine of the separation of powers as that doctrine is developed in Australia, to say that this in itself constitutes an absolute barrier to the Senate taking the action in question such as the Executive is entitled to resist. It is notorious that while the judicial power has been kept rigorously separate, and under the separation of powers doctrine as it is developed in Australia, not that that doctrine in the Boilermakers' Case and so on is uncontroversial, it is not the case that anything like the same stringency is involved in the separation of legislative and Executive power . The Executive has always, and without serious challenge, exercised certain legislative functions with its delegated legislation making role, and the legislature, of course, particularly these days with the operation of the investigative committee system, exercises many functions which are not remotely of a strictly legislative or law making character. The whole argument, the attempt to invent a new constitutional doctrine of separation of powers to justify the Government's failure to respond here, I think collapses in ignominy.</PARA>
<PARA> The final leg of the argument as it is put by Senator Chaney is that it is wrong of the Parliament in particular to purport to delegate its functions to a sitting practising judge. This is another high ground constitutional point that is being taken, not just an ordinary, common, garden debating point-we have moved beyond that in this particular statement today. It is argued that it is a separation of powers breach to 'nominate a Federal Court judge to perform a non- judicial function of a plainly Executive character'. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make it clear that I am not denying for a moment that the function that the Senate has been endeavouring to designate of editing these papers is a non- judicial one within the meaning of that doctrine as it has evolved. I have no doubt that it is not an exercise of judicial power, properly so-called, that we are here seeking to have exercised. But so too was Sir Owen Dixon's acceptance of his wartime job as ambassador to the United States of America a non-judicial function; so too is Mr Justice Fox's acceptance of the chairmanship of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry; so too is every judge's acceptance of a royal commission to investigate and report upon matters on behalf of the Executive. </PARA>
<PARA> Judges are constantly being asked to take off their wigs-in the case of Mr Justice Murphy I suppose one has to say his notional wig-and exercise at the request of one or other of the other branches of government non-judicial functions. There is even a phrase that has evolved in law to describe this state of affairs of which Mr Brazil was kind enough to remind me in the corridors outside the chamber today. When a judge is so acting he is acting as a person a designata. He is not acting as a judge. When he is acting as President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, when he is holding and exercising a royal commission, when he is given a diplomatic job, as judges occasionally have been, he is not exercising his role as a judge; he has taken off his judicial hat and is wearing another one for this purpose. That is exactly, of course, what is being sought to be accomplished in the motion that I will later be moving-to get a judge to take off his judicial hat and to do a particular job which he or she as a judge will be peculiarly well equipped to do on behalf of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, of course, some doubt about the willingness of judges, particularly Federal Court judges, to accept these roles. There will be some doubt about their willingness to accept these roles in the future in the aftermath of the contemptible attempt by the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, to discredit Mr Justice Woodward recently in the meat inquiry-discredit, I might add, which reflected on nobody but the Prime Minister and the Government in the result. But the motion that I will be formally moving at the conclusion of this debate, having given notice of it yesterday, is a form of request to the Federal Court which is expressed as a request because we on this side of the chamber believe that it is both inappropriate and impolite to seek to direct judges or anyone else for that matter to perform the functions in question. </PARA>
<PARA> We hope that the Federal Court will comply with a resolution which is a solemn and a deliberate expression of the Senate's views and desires in this matter. But in the event that that does not come to pass, the further possibility is canvassed in my motion that a retired judge might be requested and nominated by formal process to perform that particular function. In the event that that becomes necessary we will cross that particular procedural bridge when we come to it. Certainly, of course, if we do resort to a retired judge in this particular way nobody can possibly object if there is any exercise of judicial power in any technical sense being there involved. </PARA>
<PARA> What I have said I hope is sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the very orotund way in which this statement by the Minister has been both compiled and presented, it really is just a not especially clever little exercise in dissimulated design to protect the Government from profound political embarrassment. The Government's and the Minister's constitutional arguments are nonsense and simply a smokescreen to hide the Government's political embarrassment. If there is any constitutional issue involved here it is the right of this Parliament to demand accountability from the Executive as to its stewardship in law enforement matters as in everything else and to require the tabling of all papers, subject to overriding considerations of public interest, which will demonstrate the quality of that Executive performance. </PARA>

The principles of Executive accountability and the principles of Executive privilege cut both ways. I readily acknowledge that there may be circumstances, and I have acknowledged in the course of this speech today that there are circumstances, in which Executive privilege can properly be claimed as it was claimed in 1975. But I also assert that there are circumstances where it is improperly claimed and claimed for spurious political reasons. I also assert, and this has been the nub of what I have been saying here today, that there is no question of some larger constitutional principle of the kind that is sought to be invented by the Government and its advisers which would in effect cut off this kind of exercise at the knees and in effect deny in the law enforcement area, or any other area that the Government chooses to invent, to add to the list if the mood so strikes it, the very possibility of such accountability being demanded. The Government cannot seriously expect us to stop pursuing this issue. I can assure it, on behalf of the Opposition, that we will not.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; There are a number of aspects of the document before us today which are disturbing, not the least of which is the fact that it is so at variance with the document which was tabled in this chamber not an hour ago, which deliberately sets out to narrow the gap between the judiciary and the Parliament as far as the legislation and the Parliament's intentions are concerned and which aims specifically at directing the judiciary to take note of the intentions of the Parliament. Here we have a situation which is almost totally the reverse of that in which the Government is actively preventing, or attempting to prevent, the judiciary from getting involved in something which is of considerable concern to this Parliament, certainly to the Senate. I was concerned too at the sanctimonious and somewhat arrogant tone that pervades this document. I was concerned, as was the previous speaker, Senator Evans, at the often specious, generally misconceived and almost entirely tortuous arguments that were put forward in support of the Government's case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those misconceptions begin, in fact, with what appears to me to be a doubtful reading by Mr Costigan of what the Senate requested in its original resolution. In his letter which was appended to the Government's paper, Mr Costigan maintained that it was inappropriate to his present role as commissioner and beyond his terms of reference to undertake the role of editing, laundering, sanitising or filtering-whatever term one desires to put on it-the documents that the Senate has asked for. Mr Costigan said:</PARA>
<PARA> I must therefore with great respect to the Senate resolution decline the invitation implicit in it. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate did not extend an invitation to Mr Costigan. The Senate instructed the Government to undertake certain action; namely, to arrange or to attempt to arrange with Mr Costigan, if he was available, for the editing of the documents that were mentioned on 23 September by Senator Evans. He was not asked to act in his capacity as royal commissioner, but because of the expertise that he has attained in the area of tax evasion, bottom-of-the-harbour schemes and so on. His declining, courteous though it was, would seem to be to be based on a misconception-I am sure not a deliberate one-of the intention of the Senate's original motion which was, as I said, a direction to the Government. The fact that certain parts of that motion which are referred to as 'subject to' sections were not able to be fulfilled does not invalidate the intention of the Senate in moving its original motion. The second statement that seems to be somewhat specious in its basis comes from the Commissioner of Taxation, again in relation to the documents that the Senate asked to have tabled. The Commissioner of Taxation said:</PARA>
<PARA> Section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act provides that an officer shall not, except in the performance of any duty as an officer, communicate to any person any information acquired as an officer. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that an officer could act on an instruction from the Government that he produce the document in an edited, sanitised or laundered form in accordance with the performance of his duty. I found it more forceful for the Commissioner of Taxation to argue that it would be prejudicial to produce a document in an unedited form and pointless to produce it in an edited form. I am far more persuaded by that argument than any specious one that relates to section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the arguments put by Mr Costigan and Mr O'Reilly, a series of arguments was put to us by the Government. I wish to deal with these in what I consider to be the order of importance-certainly not in order of weight-since there are probably more notable for their arrogance and tortuousness than for their validity. The first of those arguments is that there is no precedent for this impertinent action by the Senate. It would seem rather strange to me for anybody, but particularly a lawyer, to argue that because there is no precedent we cannot do something. We would all be stuck in the dark ages if we acted simply according to whether something had or had not been done before. </PARA>
<PARA> The second argument put forward is one which I have already partially dealt with. It concerns the original motion which contains 'subject to' clauses which could not be fulfilled. Therefore, the Senate is supposed to lick its wounds and retire suitably defeated. I maintain, as I think the previous speaker maintained , that simply because Mr Costigan apparently misunderstood the intention of the original motion and because that section of the motion was not fulfilled, there is no requirement on the Senate that it cannot pursue the matter. Having been frustrated once is no justification for throwing in the towel. It has the right to press on in its attempt to fulfill its own constitutional responsibilities of review and oversight of legislation and the maintenance and execution of that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The third argument that the Government put for refusing to table the documents was the separation of powers and responsibilities between the judiciary and the Executive, which would apparently be infringed upon if the amended motion of Senator Evans were accepted. Yet, as Senator Evans has already pointed out, that did not stop the Government from commissioning the services and the expertise of Mr Justice Fox or Mr Justice Woodward. To argue that this was done only with the approval of the Government is rather to miss the point that, in fact, the judiciary does have a role to play in these sorts of areas regardless of the feelings of the government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important argument put by the Government for refusing to table the documents in any form, edited or otherwise, is that the Senate is attempting to usurp the responsibilities of the Executive Government under section 61 of the Constitution. This is absolute and arrant nonsense. Section 61 of the Constitution invests responsibilities and powers in and with the Executive Government, but the Parliament itself-in this instance the Senate-also has responsibilities and powers enshrined in the Constitution. Those powers include reviewing the administrative and legislative behaviour of the Government and questioning any failures that it has to fulfil its own section 61 responsibilities. Otherwise there would be no point in having legislative and general purpose committees. There would be no point in having Estimates committees and the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> In effect, what we have in the papers before us today is the Government saying: 'We have certain responsibilities but if we choose not to exercise these, if we choose not to execute the laws of the Commonwealth, as we are expected to under section 61, no one, much less the Senate, can make us probe into why we have not done it or even establish if we have not done it. No one can question us. The Parliament has no right to question our lack of action or apparent lack of action or to ask us to prove that we have or have not acted as fully as possible in accordance with existing laws'. I suggest that that is central to the issue in front of us. </PARA>
<PARA> The request for these documents to be tabled boils down to this: The Senate, as is the other place, is soon to be faced with passing or rejecting new legislation which is aimed at prosecuting tax evaders. Yet we are being denied the documents which would indicate whether that legislation is even necessary, whether previous legislation was adequate to prosecute offenders under a variety of sections, including sections 160, 170 and 201 of the Income Tax Assessment Act and a variety of other sections, and whether the new legislation, which has been removed from the Notice Paper and which is to be attended to, laundered, filtered, sanitised or whatever by the Government, is only a face saving exercise on the part of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to cover the fact that the Government has failed to act in the past, and, therefore, failed to fulfil its constitutional responsibility. Whether this Government likes it or not, the Executive is accountable to Parliament. Nothing in section 61 alters that. There is no reason why a Federal judge could not be commissioned to edit the requested documents. Therefore, the Democrats fully support the motion on this subject that Senator Evans is contemplating moving in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier in the debate Senator Evans made reference to the importance of statutory interpretation, even though that may be a somewhat legalistic concept. I agree with those comments but would like to say how important is the debate that we are having today, even though there are not many honourable senators in the chamber. This again may appear to be a legalistic debate but it is of considerable concern to this nation. I must say that when I heard Senator Evans's opening remarks I could not help thinking, 'Ah , we appear to be taking some steps along the route that was taken in 1975. Of course, it will be for the Opposition and the Democrats to decide how far down that path we go, but certainly from Senator Evans's opening remarks it seems that we might be going somewhere along it'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As far as I am concerned, it is a matter of politics. I observe that two very interesting matters arise from Senator Evans's proposals and the statement made today by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) on behalf of the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown). It seems to me, firstly, that we have here an extension of the working relationship between the Executive and the legislature in relation to the privilege question, in ensuring that material not to be released if so doing may prejudice the conduct of certain legal proceedings. I believe that represents an extension of the question of privilege, or working relationships, as it was described in a paper to which I will refer later. Also, we have had this very interesting proposition by the Government regarding the separation of powers. It seems to me, with respect, that Senator Evans and Senator Haines have confused the question of tabling the documents with the question of editing them. Sir Maurice Byers has said that the tabling of the documents would be harmful to the administration of justice. I shall come to that question later. The request that Senator Evans has made to the Senate is not only that a judge should vet or inspect the documents but also that the judge should edit them. That is an executive act. It seems to me that is what Senator Chaney, on behalf of the Government, is asserting. The Minister said in his statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are dealing here not with a claim of Senate privilege versus executive privilege but a question of the separation of powers. </PARA>
<PARA>I should like to examine that aspect, but certainly do not want to express a final view upon it. The Minister also stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Section 61 of the Constitution commits the enforcement of the laws of the Commonwealth to the Executive Government. </PARA>
<PARA>That seems to be a correct assertion. The Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the manner, the method and the means of executing and maintaining Commonwealth laws are matters for the Executive Government to decide . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Again, that seems to be a right and proper assertion. The Minister states further:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . on one reading-</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister refers to the motion-</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the basis upon which the Senate resolution has been constructed and passed is that the decision on these matters can be assigned . . . to some third person. </PARA>
<PARA>I take up with the Senate what I would call the interesting use, or perhaps even misuse, of the judiciary by executive governments all over Australia, both State and Federal, over a period dating back to the last century. That has been an increasing trend during the last decade or so. I refer the Senate to an essay by Professor G. S. Reid, Deputy Vice-Chancellor and Professor of Politics at the University of Western Australia, entitled, The Changing Political Framework. The essay was written in 1978 but was reproduced in the January-February 1980 issue of Quadrant. That is probably the most convenient place for people to look it up . I strongly urge honourable senators and others interested in these questions, which are of great political moment, to give consideration to the essay, which is certainly excellent. Professor Reid, in the final part of the essay, refers to the great changes in the law in recent years, to the establishment of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, of the Administrative Review Councils, of the office of the Ombudsman, of legal aid commissions, of the Law Reform Commission and of the Human Rights Commission. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> In the midst and in the wake of this reforming turmoil two interesting trends are discernible-the first I shall call 'Judicial Imperialism' and the second ' Executive Imperialism.' The trends are inter-related but both are changing the framework of government in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Reid refers to the action of the Chief Justice in advising the Governor-General back in 1975 and says:</PARA>
<PARA> In this case the exercise of parliamentary power was subordinated to Executive power by the Governor-General with the public support of the Head of the Judiciary. </PARA>
<PARA>Then he refers to the cases of Cormack versus Cope in 1974 and Victoria versus the Commonwealth in 1975, and states:</PARA>
<PARA> Here the Court held that some sections of the Constitution relating to the process for passing legislation in Parliament, which previously had been held to be matters of parliamentary procedural concern and thus the privilege of Parliament, were in fact justiciable before the Court. Thus, the High Court expanded its jurisdiction into subject matters previously considered to belong to the sphere of parliamentary politics. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on further to talk about judicial imperialism and states:-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . also relates to the interest displayed by the Judiciary in the evolution of the legal reforms presently surrounding us. There is an unprecedented judicial activism in policy-making in Australian Government. Judges are taking a prominent role in the activities of Law Reform Commissions throughout Australia, and their enthusiasm to participate is taking them into membership of a wide range of Executive Commissions, Tribunals and Councils. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . The Executive Government in Australia has long sought to use members of the Judiciary to its own advantage, particularly to take the Chair of governmental enquiries and Royal Commissions established to report on vexing and complex social and political problems. </PARA>
<PARA>He points out that Chief Justice Irvine of Victoria said as long ago as 1923:</PARA>
<PARA> The duty of His Majesty's Judges is to hear and determine issues of fact and of law arising between the King and a subject, or between a subject and a subject presented in a form enabling judgment to be passed upon them . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, Professor Reid goes on to point out:</PARA>
<PARA> The practice is fraught with dangers for a fearlessly independent Judiciary. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that Professor Reid, in this paper, raises matters of great moment which are, in fact, supported by Sir Zelman Cowen. In a speech made on 24 May 1982, shortly before he finished his term as Governor-General, Sir Zelman Cowen said:</PARA>
<PARA> We have been involved in a massive reshaping of the law arising out of the way in which public administration has developed in a complex modern federal society . </PARA>
<PARA>* * * *</PARA>
<PARA> What we have done is to give sweeping authority in such matters to judges to substitute their own view of what is good policy or a more just outcome for that of elected or administrative officers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The final paragraph of what Sir Zelman Cowen said that I wish to quote is this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that what has been done in Australia in the way of administrative law reform is exciting, remarkable and impressive, but in some respects I wonder whether it has not gone too far. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is the point that Professor Reid was making. I find myself in some agreement with the points made by Professor Reid and Sir Zelman Cowen. But I find here a government asserting, or should I say re-asserting, its belief in the separation of powers. It seems to me that that is a matter which ought to be encouraged by the Senate. The Government is asserting that its proper role is to govern-to govern without the aid of some judge imposed upon it by the Senate; to make these decisions itself and to be responsible for them. It seems to me that there is some considerable merit in that proposal. As to whether the proposal put by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) today in this paper is in fact the law, or the way the law ought to be, I think I would have to defer to another date before offering my final view on the subject because it seems to me to be a new development, an interesting development which I would like to encourage but which may require further debate and consideration not only in this place but also in academic circles. However, Senator Evans and Senator Haines went on to talk about the matter which the Minister said he was not putting forward; that was the question of Crown privilege or Executive privilege . I turn now to that matter. Odgers, in the fifth edition of Australian Senate Practice, states at page 562:</PARA>
<PARA> This fifth edition contends that the Executive Government enjoys no privilege which puts it above Parliament, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Then, on page 563, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Certainly there are affairs which in the public interest, or for reasons of national security, should be kept confidential; Parliament recognises that principle and the practice is not to press for certain disclosures, such as in relation to Cabinet documents and advice given by officers to Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA>Those proposals put by Mr Odgers at that point seem to me to have been expanded, as I mentioned earlier, by the proposal which is contained in the resolution of the Senate, that material should not be published which might prejudice the conduct of legal proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the famous dissenting report of Senators Greenwood, Webster and Wright on matters referred to the Senate by resolution of 17 July 1975 and published by the Senate on 7 October 1975 in which the powers of the Parliament as opposed to the powers of the Executive were dealt with at considerable length . Again, I have some quotations which I would like to read. Referring to the basic question of parliamentary-executive relations, on page 49 the dissenting reports states:</PARA>
<PARA> The core of the question is the fundamental relationship which exists, or should exist, between the parliamentary and executive arms of government-a matter which is so fundamental to Parliament, and so steeped in the history of the Westminster style of parliamentary democracy, that it should not be overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA>The dissenting report went on to support the supremacy of the Parliament over the Executive. On page 50 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>There may be some who would suggest that such a power is appropriate to a Lower House, but not to an Upper House. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . Such a suggestion clearly has no place in the Australian Commonwealth Parliament</PARA>
<PARA>Although Senator Evans would not say that he would have adopted this proposal, I think what he was putting today was very much along those lines. I would not disagree with the assertion put by this dissenting report. But it seems to me that the next paragraph of that dissenting report contains matters of fundamental importance to the Senate in its debate today. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> This assertion of power leads to the next basic issue-one which again goes to the core of the present matter-and that is the perennial problem, inherent in the possession of power, as to the exercise of power. The closer power comes to the absolute, the more difficult is the decision as to the proper exercise of it . Parliament's power-or, in this case, the power of each House of the Parliament -is paramount, but its exercise must be a matter of particular discretion. That this is so is evidenced by the 'working relationships' which have been developed over centuries of parliamentary experience, and it perhaps is proper to treat what has been described as Crown privilege as a working relationship between the legislative and executive arms of government. </PARA>
<PARA>We now turn to the fundamental question raised by Senator Evans and Senator Haines today-not by the Minister-and that is the question of whether, presuming that the Senate has the power to require the tabling of the documents, the power should be exercised. On that point I should like to draw attention to the motion which Senator Evans has proposed. It is a conditional request; in other words, the documents should not be produced if they might or would-I think he changed the word 'might' to 'would' which I think was to the detriment of the motion- prejudice the conduct of legal proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Maurice Byers, the Solicitor-General, has advised the Government against the production and the Government has informed the Senate of this advice. The Government has made it clear that it accepts and agrees with that advice but the proposal now before the Senate does not accept that judgment. It seeks to have that decision made by some third person who will have no responsibility in the subsequent proceedings. It is very interesting to consider who that third person might be. He might very well be Mr Justice Ellicott. According to Senator Evans, as Solicitor- General Mr Ellicott would have been too close to the Government to make this decision, and as Attorney-General Mr Ellicott would not have been entitled to make the decision. But now that he is a judge of the Federal Court his opinion would be quite acceptable to Senator Evans. It seems to me that that is a perfect example of the sort of thing that I was talking about when I raised this paper by Professor Reid. So long as one can have an opinion by a judge, the opinion is acceptable. In other words, we put on the decision a veneer of respectibility by having the decision made by a judge. But if we have the decision made by the Executive Government, which is the body which ought to be making the decision, we do not accept that decision. It seems to me to be a perfect example of what Professor Reid was talking about, and that the responsibility ought to rest with the Minister and the Government. Here is the Government asserting its responsibility and being decried by Senator Evans for so doing. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the question of Sir Maurice Byers. Senator Evans has given him praise. He has said that Sir Maurice is not prejudiced; he acknowledges that he is highly respected. Senator Evans highly respects his legal ability. It is just his judgment that Senator Evans does not accept. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to refer to Senator Harradine's very fair and proper addition to Senator Evan's original proposals-that is, if there is to be any reference, any material which might prejudice any future prosecution of tax evaders should be withdrawn from the papers. But the Government has said that its view is that material cannot be laundered in this way; it cannot be edited so as to avoid its becoming known whom we are talking about. The reason is obvious. It is the McCabe-Lafranchi report, which has named so many companies and bodies that clearly anyone who applies his mind to that report and then to legal advice which is given-no matter how much that advice is laundered-would be able to work out who was involved in the proceedings and what the advice was about. </PARA>
<PARA> What would happen if this so-called third party, this so-called independent, this judge of a federal court, happened to blow the decision, perhaps, to make a mistake, and agreed to produce in the Senate material which prejudices the proceedings, such that some active journalist were able to analyse the material and to give it front page publicity, putting it all together and naming the parties, disclosing the material and laying it on the line, blowing it absolutely sky high so that everyone in Australia knew the nature of the advice that was given and knew the parties about whom the advice was given? This third person would have prejudiced the performance by the Government, the Executive, of the duties which the Constitution imposes upon it. The important point is that the Government would be excused because the decision would have been made not by the Government but by some so-called impartial third party. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view it is clear that the responsibility should rest with the Government. The Government claims that responsibility and asserts its responsibility in the matter. So, taking up the opinion of the dissenting senators in that very famous report-Senators Greenwood, Webster and Wright, who said that the question is as to the exercise of the power-in my view the Senate should make it perfectly clear that it would not exercise this power. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply- I thank Senator Lewis for his contribution to what has been, perhaps, a surprisingly brief debate on a matter of some significance. I must say that when the debate commenced, following my putting down of the statement, with Senator Evans claiming that the statement was somewhat fog-like or something like a fog machine, I thought that we were engaged in a little political hyperbole. He has a rather colourful turn of phrase in some of these debates. However, as the debate continued it became obvious that to some extent Senator Evans is somewhat confused about the statement put down and perhaps has misunderstood a couple of fairly fundamental points put forward in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am particularly puzzled by the total failure of both Senator Evans and Senator Haines to come to grips with the problem posed by section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act concerning the production of the investigator's report . We are dealing here with a situation in which the Opposition is seeking, among other things, the production of the report of an investigative officer on a particular and, indeed, quite notorious case. To suggest that the disclosure of that is not a matter of some moment is to ignore current reality. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to refer the Senate again to the statement by the Commissioner of Taxation in relation to document 12, which I had incorporated in Hansard as an appendix to my statement, because the Commissioner of Taxation makes two extremely significant points in that memorandum which should not be ignored by the Opposition or by the Australian Democrats, or by anyone else who will be voting on this motion or on the subsequent motion to be moved by Senator Evans on which we shall soon be voting. I should like to quote the two key paragraphs. The Commissioner states:</PARA>
<PARA> The document is an internal working document prepared within the Australian Taxation Office dealing with a particular company's affairs. It contains a full narrative of the case, details of evidentiary material and of admissions made on which a prosecution might be based and it canvasses the legal arguments available to support a prosecution. It contains several pages of verbatim evidence obtained during an interview of a person by a police inspector. It is a document which, by its very nature, reveals the whole substance of the case that might be made against certain people and in my view its tabling would be even more damaging to future prospects of prosecution action than the tabling of legal opinions. </PARA>
<PARA>So in that paragraph there is a statement of the concern by the Commissioner that the release of this document would be damaging to the future prospects of prosecution action. The public interest in seeing a proper orderly prosecution in that case cannot again be overstated. Clearly there is a very great public interest, and it is important in those circumstances not only that should the prosecution be in order but that, from the point of view of the defendants, nothing should be done which would in turn prejudice their position, and it is important that the whole matter is dealt with fairly. </PARA>
<PARA> The next paragraph of the statement, however, makes the point about section 16. I again quote the Commissioner's statement:</PARA>
<PARA> Section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act provides that an officer shall not, except in the performance of any duty as an officer, communicate to any person any information acquired as an officer. It is my view that I am prohibited by this provision from releasing the document in its complete form for the purpose apparently envisaged by the motion. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioner is saying that he does not believe that he can release it for the purpose of being vetted by some third person in the way that is currently being sought. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, it is a fact that a great many people are aware of the identity of the particular case dealt with. In these circumstances any deletions from, or alterations to, the document to conceal identities of people would not solve the problem and it is unavoidable that any information at all provided in a so- called 'sanitized' version would offend against section 16. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me to be a fairly important question to face. If the Commissioner's view is that he would be in breach of the law to comply with the request being made with respect to item 12, it becomes apparent that the Senate should not pass the motion or should not have acceded to the motion which it previously passed and it certainly should not be seeking to amend that resolution now to try to make it work. But in any event, it is clear from the statement of the Commissioner of Taxation that he sees himself as being unable lawfully to comply with the suggestion being made. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one area which either involves misapprehension or was simply not dealt with in the debate this afternoon. But the second point is one which appears to involve some misapprehension. Before dealing with it I would like to re- emphasise, as is set out in the statement, that we are here dealing with a situation in which the Government has responded in a very open way to a request for documents. In September we tables 85 documents many of which had not been specifically sought. They included all of the documents which could be found and which were thought to be relevant to the area of inquiry raised, namely, the internal handling of the bottom-of-the-harbour proposals-</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I made that statement, having been a party to a number of discussions as to what was being sought to be achieved by the Government and I believe that to be the situation. We are here dealing not with a failure to disclose documents generally but a situation in which a limited number of documents has not been disclosed because the advice of the second law officer of the Crown, the Solicitor-General, is that to do so would cause harm to those who may be prosecuted and to those who may be proceeded against civilly or to the cause of the prosecutor or civil complainant. The only issue between the Government and the Opposition with respect to this matter is the issue of who ought to make the judgment or on whose advice the Government should be guided in coming to a decision as to what ought to be withheld in what is a commonly agreed interest to protect the integrity of subsequent legal proceedings. It is a narrow point of difference. I will not go over again. The material that Senator Evans and Senator Lewis went over and that I touched upon in my statement about the independence, status and ability of the Solicitor-General. That has been confirmed all around the chamber. I am therefore a little puzzled at this falling back on some vague question of judgment to suggest that the Government should not rely on the opinion of its second law officer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That brings me to the fundamental point of misapprehension that was apparent in the remarks made by Senator Evans. Senator Evans made the point that the Senate, in passing the last resolution, was not trying to enforce the laws of the Commonwealth; it was seeking the tabling of papers. He made the point that the production of papers is not part of law enforcement. I understand the force of that comment. The key difference between us, therefore, is that we are not here talking about the tabling of papers; we are talking about the suggestion that there needs to be an editing or vetting of those papers before they can be tabled. The question at issue is who ought to be responsible for the determination of that vetting procedure. Senator Evans and the Opposition are seeking to throw the responsibility for giving advice which can be relied upon by the Government into the hands of some third party. They tried to throw it into the hands of Mr Costigan who declined. They are now seeking to throw it into the hands of some judge of the Federal Court of Australia or some ex-judge.</PARA>
<PARA> The important point is that the Government is alleging that this lies within the province of its Executive responsibility. It clearly has the responsibility for the conduct of these prosecutions. It clearly has the responsibility for ensuring that it and its officials behave in a way that is consistent with the probity of that prosecution. Therefore, we are saying that that being our clear responsibility, that is a matter for the Executive government and not for determination by the Senate. We are not here dealing with the question per se of the production of papers. We are dealing with which part of government has responsibility for determining how we meet the commonly agreed objective of ensuring that there is no prejudice to the legal proceedings which we know are before us. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite true that I specifically say in the statement that this is not being put forward as a claim of privilege. It is also true that that is a claim which may rise to be argued at a later time. I accept that there may be another step-that I might be arguing the question of privilege solely. But I do not seek to do that this afternoon because in my view and in the view of the Government we have not reached that point. We have reached the point where we are dealing with a suggestion of the Senate that there should be some third party involved in the Executive's responsibility of determining what should be withheld to protect the integrity of those prosecutions. That is the point on which the statement focuses. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other points on which I will touch quickly because I think they warrant some mention. Reference was made to the fact that it is not uncommon in Australia for judges to be assigned various roles. Reference was made to Mr Justice Fox and his inquiry with respect to uranium made on behalf of the Executive arm of government. Reference was made in somewhat different terms to the fact that Mr Justice Woodward recently undertook similar duties. Reference was also made to the fact that judicial opinion around Australia varies. For example, there is a view in the Victorian Supreme Court which differs from the view generally adopted by the judiciary in Australia about the correctness or otherwise of assuming functions as royal commissioners and so on. I think the distinction which needs to be drawn between the examples which were referred to in debate and what is being sought today is that in the cases referred to in the debate individuals holding judicial office have effectively accepted some delegation of executive functions from the Executive government. What has been sought today in the motion before us is a situation in which the legislature is seeking to delegate part of the Executive's function to the judiciary or to some other third party. I believe there is a very significant difference in a situation in which this House, or indeed any house of the legislature, seeks to delegate the Executive's responsibilities for it as against the Executive delegating part of its own responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The clear responsibility is placed on the Executive under section 61 of the Constitution for the enforcement and maintenance of the laws. It is the interference with that and the attempt to interpose some third party to pick up part of the Executive's responsibilities that the Government sees as being an improper exercise of the Senate's power. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point which I think needs to be made is in respect of Mr Justice Woodward about whom some passing comment was made. I have said before in the Senate and I wish to repeat it so that it is part of the record of this debate that it is certainly my view and I believe the view of the Government that Mr Justice Woodward is one of our most distinguished Australians and a man of particular value. This is evidenced by his contribution across a whole range of activities. He has contributed to Australia as a lawyer and as the Aboriginal Land Commissioner-the role in which I first became aware of him. For a period he was head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, an appointment which I understand had great bipartisan support. He has contributed as a judge and more latterly-I think it is his second contribution-as a royal commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA> However, I wish to make this point: Whatever respect one might have for any royal commissioner, no matter how well one might regard him as having done his job, the fact is that in any series of recommendations there can be differences of opinion. On an earlier occasion when there was a view put by a royal commissioner with which I disagreed I expressed the view that it is perhaps unfortunate that there is no court of appeal from the findings of royal commissioners since their findings can be as difficult and as damaging for an individual as any finding of a court at first instance. But the fact remains that royal commissioners make findings which do affect individuals and which reflect on people. One is entitled to examine those and to decide whether one accepts them as holy writ or whether one believes that they can be changed. I have, on an earlier occasion, challenged another view of a royal commissioner, meaning no disrespect to him. In exactly the same way the view which was taken about one finding of Mr Justice Woodward that was contested-it was not to be supported-was a view that the Government or indeed any person was entitled to take. I make it quite clear that no disrespect was meant to the Commissioner and no diminution of his reputation could be possible from that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> The key point, on which I conclude, is that we are here dealing with a situation in which I think Senator Evans said that he believed the Senate had the right to demand papers subject to the public interest. The Government objects to the notion that these particular papers can be demanded in an edited form, the nature of the editing to be determined by some third party, because it sees that as an attempt to take its responsibilities out of its hands and to vest them in some third party. In any event, I believe that most Australians would accept that the public interest requires the proper pursuit of legal remedies in the cases which have been exposed by McCabe-Lafranchi and by Costigan, and the various other disclosures which have been made over recent months. To do anything which would shake the ability of the Government successfully to bring those legal proceedings to fruition would, I think, be clearly against the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The second law officer of the Crown has advised us that he believes that both the parties who may be proceeded against and those who proceed against them could be harmed by the publication of the material which is now sought. I think this is the clearest possible case where the Senate should not insist on the request but rather should enable the Government to proceed with the most important task of pursuing these legal proceedings with expedition and, one would hope, success. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We can always get these figures. It is admitted by Qantas and by the Government that most passengers will continue on to South Africa, most probably to Johannesburg, and connections have already been arranged, I believe, with South African Airlines to transport passengers from Zimbabwe with a minimum of fuss. I think that is the expression that is being used in British Airways parlance. Yet we have to remember that many other Commonwealth countries-I think about 11-fly to Johannesburg. It seems to me that Australia is always trying to prove that it is purer than the driven snow and will not deal with South Africa. I believe that this is self-evident humbug, as was said in the editorial in the Australian today. As the editorial points out in part</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . Qantas flies to other countries whose regimes, in their own way, are at least as repulsive as that of South Africa</PARA>
<PARA>I must voice my disapproval of the attitude of the Department of Foreign Affairs , which has really been the force behind stopping Qantas flying to South Africa for many years. I believe that our whole attitude to South Africa, an area which as Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) has said in this House is important to the defence of the West, is crazy. We appear to be captives and almost crawl to countries which, as I have said, are quite as oppressive as South Africa. Our Commonwealth Games Committee recently signed a document that I believe will cause it a great deal of concern and trouble. The minute it tries to interfere with the rights of individuals because of that document, it will certainly have my opposition. However, that is a different matter and something that I will deal with at a different time. I am disappointed with the Government's decision not to include South Africa in the proposed flights. I hope that that matter will soon be altered or, perhaps even better, Qantas will fly direct to Johannesburg, as it should, on a reciprocal agreement with the South African Airlines. I think it is time we gave Qantas a go and stopped bureaucratic interference in its attempts to get into the black. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I want to deal with very briefly is the matter of sitting hours. This was brought to my thoughts by a magazine I received today, the Sydney Chamber of Commerce journal, which carries on the front cover the statement 'Executive health overstressed and under- exercised'. Inside is a headline stating 'Overweight and underexercised', which made me think of the risks that politicians are still under in this place. I do not think we can blame our recent sitting hours for the lack of Government business getting through this chamber. It is simply that the Government now does not have the numbers. We now sit about 21 hours a week. Briefly, I believe we should alter slightly our sitting hours. On Tuesday we should sit for a slightly longer time, from 2 p.m. until 7 p.m. We should alter the arrangements for Wednesday so that we sit from 10 a.m until 1 p.m. and then 2 o'clock in the afternoon until 7 o' clock in the evening, and likewise on Thursdays. That would still give us a total of 21 hours. </PARA>
<PARA> This would create a few problems with some meetings but I believe it would make life a lot better for Ministers, who would have evenings available to them without interruption to do the work that they have to do, and it would be better for staff, for people such as those who work in Hansard and the cafeteria and the office staff who have a considerable amount of work to do. At the present, due to our sitting hours on Thursday, they do not really get the breaks that they need. Although I do not usually comment on the House of Representatives, I believe that it could well follow our example. We should all encourage members of the other House to look at their hours. We would all be a lot better off if we brought the sitting hours of this place into line with what the people of Australia would regard as being somewhat more sensible. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Customs Amendment Bill (No. 2) will require that any licence issued for the export of mineral sands from an area listed on the National Estate will need approval by both Houses of Parliament before it can come into force. This legislation will protect Moreton Island from sand mining. It was necessary to draft this Bill because this Federal Government cannot be trusted to protect Australia's heritage areas. The Fraser Government has refused to block the flooding of South West Tasmania's Gordon and Franklin Rivers. It has permitted the uranium mining enclaves of Koongarra, Ranger and Jabiluka in Kakadu National Park. It has refused to declare the entire Great Barrier Reef a marine park to protect it from oil drilling. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 30 of the Australian Herritage Commission Act calls on a Minister to take no action which would adversely affect a place listed on the Register of the National Estate unless there is no prudent or feasible alternative. This Bill will provide the additional safeguard of parliamentary approval for decisions by the Minister for Trade and Resources, who may have disregarded the Australian Heritage Commission Act. Only sand mining operations proposed for those areas deemed to be of national significance and so listed on the Register will come under the scrutiny of Parliament. Proposals in other areas will be dealt with by the normal processes of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act or under State procedures. It would be inappropriate for Federal Parliament to consider every minor sand mining proposal in areas of no particular environmental significance; for example, abandoned farmland. </PARA>
<PARA> Only eight areas will be covered by the legislation and most of these are already protected as national parks. Unfortunately, two important areas have been threatened-Moreton and Fraser Islands. The Queensland Government has issued sand mining permits on both islands. The Federal Government implemented the recommendations of the Fraser Island Inquiry and revoked export permits. Such an export ban protects Fraser Island only while the Federal Government adheres to that decision. While Fraser Island is currently protected, Moreton Island is not . In June 1981, the Queensland Government decided to allow Associated Minerals Consolidated Ltd and Mineral Deposits Ltd to mine sand from 6.4 per cent of Moreton Island. Recently, Associated Minerals Consolidated wrote to the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony), stating that it will be applying for export licences. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike Fraser Island, Moreton Island has never been mined. Moreton Island is the largest area of untouched recreational land close to Brisbane. It has the highest sand hills in the world, magnificent beaches and dunes, perched lakes and unspoiled vistas. This island is pristine, not blotted by sand mining areas and canal estates. During the 1970's, the Queensland Government proposed to allow sand mining on Moreton Island, but the outcry from the people of Brisbane prevented it. A recent poll in an electorate in Brisbane showed that 87 per cent of the people opposed sand mining on Moreton Island. Brisbane City Council opposes the sand mining but the Queensland Government removed the Council's ability to protect the island. The Island was nominated for the register of the National Estate and approved for listing in December 1980. It was not listed until August 1981 because of lack of funds for the Australian Heritage Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of the public opposition and the heritage value of Moreton Island, the Queensland Liberal-National Party Government approved sand mining on the island. There have been over 90 objections lodged with the Brisbane Mining Warden's Court over an application for a Moreton Island mining lease by Mineral Deposits Limited. The Queensland Branch of the Australian Labor Party, along with the Brisbane City Council, the Queensland Conservation Council and the Moreton Island Protection Committee, are appearing as objectors in the Mining Warden's Court. Unfortunately, even if the Mining Warden upholds the many objections, as the Charters Towers Mining Warden did with the Ben Lomond uranium mine, the Queensland Government can override the decision. The two mining companies will mine 6.4 per cent of the island but this includes 50 per cent of the eastern beaches and the area extends to the edge of the Blue Lagoon. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Government made its decision based on the recommendations of the Cook report, which is six years out-dated. It ignored comments in an even earlier environmental study, the Heath report, that there may be no net national benefit from sand mining on the island, if mineral sand and prices are low. While the production rate of the proposed mining has not been published, recent figures extracted from the Heath report indicate that 36,000 tonnes of rutile and 32,500 tonnes of zircon will be produced annually, earning $14.4m in exports . Sixty million tonnes of sand will be ripped out of Moreton Island. Less than 200 people will be employed by the two companies and many are already employed in current operations. Associated Minerals Consolidated plans to ship sand to Stradbroke Island for processing at its plant. Actual new employment could total less than 100. Queensland will receive less than $500,000 per year from royalties, payroll taxes and rates from such a sand mining operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The benefits of recreation and tourism to the people of south east Queensland far outweigh those that would come from sand mining. Such activities would have to be within the environmental constraints of a proper management plan for the island. Under a management strategy proposed by the Moreton Island Protection Committee which allows for a variety of types of recreation and tourism, direct and indirect employment would be 416, with $4.25m generated from visitor usage of the island. Since then, estimates of visitor usage have been increased by one third. In addition, there are many non-monetary benefits of having such a recreational resource so near to Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA> The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation recognised the value of Moreton Island and recommended that no export licences be issued for Moreton Island mineral sands unless a public inquiry was held under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. The Committee's report was tabled in Parliament on 1 October 1981 but the Government has not responded to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Last month, Associated Minerals Consolidated notified the Minister for Trade and Resources of its intention to apply for export licences for Moreton Island mineral sands. The Minister named Associated Minerals Consolidated as 'proponent ' under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. The Government has not decided whether it will have a public inquiry or even an environmental impact statement. Section 30 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act should force the Minister to refuse the application for the export licence but, on its present stance regarding Australia's National Estate, the Federal Government may issue it and claim that sand mining is a State matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government cannot be trusted to meet its responsibilities and protect Moreton Island. This legislation is necessary to ensure that the island is protected from the Minister for Trade and Resources in his desire to permit development at all costs. The Queensland Government has ignored all the reasons to prevent sand mining on Moreton Island, so it becomes the responsibility of the Federal Government to act decisively to protect this piece of Australia's heritage. This legislation will accomplish this. </PARA>
<PARA> A Federal Labor government after the next election will not issue any export licences for Moreton Island's mineral sand and will not feel bound to continue such licences issued by the present Government. Since it is preferable to refuse export licences rather than revoke, and the present Government may issue them, the legislation which the Labor Party proposes would, it is hoped, obviate the need for revocation at a later date. I urge all honourable senators to support this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think eight speakers took part in the debate last night on the Student Assistance ( Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill. I was fascinated by the very academic offering. All but one of the honourable senators who spoke were university graduates. In fact, five of the speakers had had professional associations with universities. There was certainly no lack of background in respect of those who contributed to the debate. I imagine that those honourable senators, with their experience, know what happens in universities. Some of them, of course, have had experience in using and giving out loans and I imagine that some of their statements were influenced by moderate vested interests and I think that helped the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button, in leading for the Australian Labor Party last night, mentioned that this Bill was part of the Budget package and for that reason the Australian Labor Party was not going to oppose what the Government had put forward. I am not sure whether the Australian Democrats have adopted the same position. The argument is about how we should go about providing the support that students need to produce certain educational outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> We had two main inputs to the debate. First of all, members of the Australian Labor Party said that although they did not like the proposal they would support it but they recommended that it be referred to a committee; the Australian Democrats said that they did not like the legislation, that they hoped to defeat it but in any event they would try to amend it if they had to in the Committee stage. The Australian Democrats' argument, as I understood it, went to the level of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme benefit. I think I do Senator Macklin no disservice if I say that certainly from what the Australian Democrats have published and what they have said in other places they are worried about two things-the level of the TEAS benefit and whether or not that benefit was or should be indexed as an earnesto of our good intentions. I am worried because I am not sure how realistic those requirements are. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot give a promise about the level of TEAS benefits. That is a matter which is considered each year in the Budget context. I will, as I will explain in a few minutes, inform Senator Macklin and the whole Senate that the Government is prepared to give an assurance now that TEAS will continue. If in fact the Australian Democrats oppose the loans scheme students who need extra support to study will not be helped; they will not have access to a higher or indexed TEAS benefit. Of course, such opposition would be one way of denying to students a resource which we are offering and which they could use to their benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Teague and Senator Martin in their contributions last night set out many of the arguments in favour of the scheme being promoted by the Government. I doubt whether it is necessary to restate these arguments. However, I mention just a couple of features. This is a new option. What is being proposed here is a benefit Bill to give to students something that they do not have at present, to provide something extra. This is a new option with an interest subsidy; a new option with a repayment holiday; and a new option with a long repayment period. Many benefits are available and, if necessary, I will refer to them during the Committee stage. However, in view of the debate that has taken place that may not be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Much was made during the debate about the concern of honourable senators that the TEAS allowance might be discontinued. I am able to give an assurance to the Senate on behalf of the Government that the TEAS benefit will be continued. We tried to signal this in this year's Budget with the substantial increases in TEAS. I am now able to give a formal assurance that TEAS will continue. I must say to honourable senators that the level of the TEAS allowance would be a matter for determination in the Budget context, as it always has been. Of course , as some honourable senators including Senator Teague, have pointed out, the benefits which are relevant to this Bill go beyond TEAS; they go to other benefits as well. However, the concern that has been expressed in public during debate has related to the TEAS allowance. Senator Teague made it clear that there was being offered to students an extra $50m that is not at present in their hands. Senator Teague made it clear that a $200m benefit pot would become a $250m pot and that this is a very substantial increase. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary in this summing-up to refer briefly to the various assertions about a failure to maintain the level of TEAS allowances in accordance with changes in the level of inflation. It is reasonable here to compare the performance of the Fraser Government with that of the Government which preceded us and to try to identify what happened to the level of TEAS allowance in relation to the level of inflation over the same period. I suppose one can worry about the sort of index that one can use for the purpose of making such a comparison. However, I will use the consumer price index. During the period of the Labor Government-Labor Budgets were brought down in 1973-74, 1974-75 and 1975-76-the at home rate of TEAS and the away from home rate or independent rate of TEAS went up by about a quarter-actually 25 per cent and 23 per cent respectively-at a time when the CPI went up by almost 45 per cent. In summary, during Labor's time the increase in the TEAS allowance fell 20 per cent short of the rise in the consumer price index. Just to get the record straight, during the years of the coalition government-that is, from 1977 through to the 1982-83 Budget-the rise in the TEAS allowance for the at home rate has gone up by 101 per cent. The independent rate has gone up by 94 per cent at a time when the CPI has risen by 99 per cent. So for the at home rate the increases in TEAS under our Government have just stayed with or just slightly ahead of the CPI and the independent rate has stayed just a little behind it. </PARA>
<PARA> The only point I want to make from those figures is simply that the rhetoric that the allowance has dropped behind under the Liberals and did not drop behind under Labor is not really sustainable. To be perfectly fair, I must say that if one looks at the means test, Labor had a better record than we have. Whereas our means test increase has been about two-thirds, Labor's means test increase was about 80 per cent. Labor stayed a bit ahead of the increase in average weekly earnings, which is the proper marker to use for the maximum adjusted family income, whereas our increase stayed a bit behind average weekly earnings. There is no truth in the argument which is put out sometimes that there has been a deliberate or regular diminution in the value of the TEAS allowance under the coalition parties. It is not true and it cannot be sustained by reference to figures. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue before the Senate is whether the Bill should be passed. This is a benefit Bill, a new option Bill. If it is not passed, the only people who will be harmed are students who are undergoing higher education. The only people who will lose out are students who might wish to use the benefit. That is a decision for the Senate. The argument has been put forward and I will not canvass it again. But there is another option before the Senate; that is, whether this Bill should be referred to a Senate committee. A reference to a Senate committee will not help. At present we require a number of administrative actions and regulations to be put in place. We have to make arrangements with the banks and take appropriate action with institutions on campus if we are to get the scheme going by the beginning of 1983. I think that Senator Martin has already addressed herself in some detail to the terms of reference and has expressed some concern about the terms of reference as they have been proposed. I commend honourable senators to read what she said last night because she set out some of the reasons that these terms of reference are improper. My concern is that if the Senate refers this matter to a committee it is doing so only to delay the introduction of the student loans scheme. There is no other reason for that action and it will put in jeopardy the introduction of a loans scheme in 1983. I am also concerned that there is no need for a reference to be made to a committee. </PARA>
<PARA> During the debate a large number of honourable senators addressed themselves to one or other of the inquiries that have taken place over the last few years on the question of loans and student finances. I am not sure that honourable senators understand just how many times this matter has been put under study. I refer to the work of Hayden Williams and his Committee for the Review of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. That Committee reported in May 1975. Also in 1975 the Australian Government Publishing Service published a document entitled 'Income and Expenditure Patterns of Australian Tertiary Students in 1974'. That was done to provide a detailed survey of student income and expenditure. In May 1977 the AGPS published another document entitled 'Student Loans'. This was a report of the Committee Appointed to Examine the Desirability and Feasibility of Introducing a System of Loans for Australian Post-secondary Students. That is another study on the question of loans which has been referred to in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a continuing study within the Department of Education on the analysis of TEAS application forms. That study will analyse data provided by beneficiaries in their TEAS application forms from 1979 onwards. This study was undertaken to give us information about the socio-economic characteristics of the people who are assisted, as well as their pattern of study and progress. In 1981 a review of recent literature and research was published by M. Hayden. This review was entitled 'Financial Assistance to Tertiary Education Students'. In May-June 1981 a 1979 survey of full time tertiary student finances was published by the Department of Education. A review entitled 'Validation study of the Costs of Full-time Tertiary Students' was conducted by Professor Gruen. This was published in May-June 1981. This year-late 1982-there is a review entitled ' Evaluation of TEAS: An Investigation and Review of Policy on Student Financial Assistance in Australia' conducted by the Centre for Study of Higher Education in the University of Melbourne. In late 1982 or early 1983 we expect a document to be produced from the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee on the review of student finances. </PARA>
<PARA> Each of those publications has addressed the question which it is now being suggested should go to a Senate committee. I put to honourable senators that this subject has been looked at by people who have been selected as being expert and equipped to do the job. They have had time to do it; they have published their results. The information is available. The question of a loans scheme has been included. It is simply not correct to say that we lack the information. What is required is that we use the information that is already available. We cannot argue that the reference to a committee is required to give to the Senate information which it does not have or could not have simply by going to the available literature. As I say, if we are to give to Australian students the benefit, the extra capacity which loans will give them for 1983-if we are to do that for 1983-we need to act and proceed now. Therefore, I urge the Senate not to proceed to refer this matter to a committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that many of the matters in this Bill will be settled later by means of subordinate legislation. Each piece of subordinate legislation will come before this chamber. Each piece of subordinate legislation can be disallowed in the usual way by the Senate. Therefore, the Senate will have a continuing role in examining a number of matters which the regulation making power in this Bill gives it a capacity to keep examining. The Senate will not yield its capacity to review and oversight the question of student loans by passing this Bill today. It will allow the process to get started. It will allow us to get underway. The beneficiaries will be the students who will be ready to use the loans next year. I put to honourable senators, with the best will in the world, that to move to delay this Bill by sending it to a committee will not serve any useful purpose. Senator Martin has already set out in some detail why the terms of reference are inappropriate to the committee. In fact, as the honourable senator pointed out they are nonsensical. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make a contribution on the proposal that the Bill be referred to a committee. The Senate has before it an amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Button, to the motion for the second reading which would refer the Bill to the Standing Committee on Education and the Arts for inquiry and report by 16 November 1982. The amendment asks:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (b) the Committee take into account (i) the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission reference to the declining participation rate in tertiary education and the contribution which the inadequacy of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme (TEAS) makes to this alarming development, and (ii) the finding of the study on tertiary student finances that the proportion of tertiary students of less privileged backgrounds is declining; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the Committee report on (i) the proposed agreements between the Government and certain banks, and (ii) the need to provide for regular and automatic adjustments to TEAS to prevent the proposed loans scheme from replacing TEAS as the basic form of student assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not propose to canvass this matter at great length. I have had the opportunity of considering all the submissions that have been made to the Senate and the arguments advanced last night. I have had the benefit of reading the Hansard record of last night's debate and, in the light of all that has been said to this point, I intend to move an amendment to Senator Button's motion if the first part of it-'Leave out all words after ''That'' '- is carried. I will then propose the insertion in his original motion of certain words which will have the effect of replacing paragraphs (b) and (c) of Senator Button's amendment with the following paragraphs:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Committee take into account the likely effect (if any) on the Commonwealth Post-graduate Awards Scheme; the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme; the Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme; and the Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the Committee report on ther proposed agreements between the Government and certain banks; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the Committee report on suggestions from secretarial, commercial and other colleges that the maximum loan per annum be increased to $2,500; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) The Committee report on the limitation of the scheme to grantees specified in section 2 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that Senator Martin disposed, to a certain extent, of some of the reasons advanced for the wording in the original reference to the Committee. However, first let me deal with the allegation that any reference to the Committee, of even this short duration, would jeopardise the loans scheme coming into existence. The point is that the Opposition has stated categorically that it is not opposed to the Bill. Senator Button said last night:</PARA>
<PARA> We are not going to oppose this Bill, in spite of the dreadful shortcomings and the sort of stunt element in it which is just a hangover from bygone days of heady rhetoric. It is not our task to oppose this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, the Opposition has indicated to the Government that the scheme will be allowed to pass into law. Therefore, I assume that the Government will take certain steps with the banks to ensure that the scheme it has proposed is ready to go when the Senate passes the legislation. However, I believe that it is important to give Government members of the Committee in question, in particular , but also non-Government members an opportunity to address the aspects that I am raising. I support the referral of this Bill to the Standing Committee on Education and the Arts for inquiry and report by 16 November 1982. That is a very short time. Senator Button would ask the Committee to take into account a number of matters, which may well have meant that it could not adequately canvass them in the time available. Indeed, already the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission is preparing a study on the participation of young Australians in tertiary education. That study is required by the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) to be undertaken against the background of enrolment patterns and the availability of tertiary education opportunities. It will be most interesting to see what the Commission's findings are in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> The ambit of Senator Button's proposal is too broad. The purpose of my proposed amendment is to refine, as it were, the areas to be taken into account by the Committee and provide it with a manageable task in the time to be allotted to it . My amendment refers not only to the likely effect on the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, which is the only form of assistance referred to in Senator Button's motion, but also to the likely effect that the measure would have on the Commonwealth Post-graduate Awards Scheme, the Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme and the Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme as well. Surely the Department concerned would be able to give the Committee information on this matter. Also it is important, if at all possible, that the Committee report on the proposed agreements between the Government and certain banks. Reference to that is made in Senator Button's proposal, and as a member of the Senate I would like to see precisely what those agreements would consist of before making a final judgment on this measure. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of my amendment, concerning which honourable senators have received representations, is the suggestion of secretarial, commercial and other colleges in regard to the maximum amount on loan. Probably it is reasonable that this question also should receive consideration prior to the measure again coming before Parliament. I would like to know the views of the Committee and, indeed through it of the Government and the proposers of the Bill, as to why the scheme is to be limited to the grantees specified in section 2 of the Bill. Why limit it to those particular grantees? What is the philosophy behind that? Indeed, in going to that point, it may well be that we will be able to see the philosophy behind the whole of this measure. In short, so as not to delay the Senate, at this moment I flag my intention to move accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already spoken in this debate. I want to speak only very briefly in relation to the amendment that Senator Harradine has moved. We think the Opposition amendment is a preferable amendment to the motion. We understand Senator Harradine's concern that the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts should not take on an enormous reference, with the time available to it, and his apparent desire in paragraph (b) of his amendment to limit the terms of the inquiry in a very significant way. It is a sort of two-card trick. I do not attribute any dishonesty to Senator Harradine in saying that, but it is a sort of two-card trick because he has expanded in a sense what the Committee would be required to do by inserting all those other schemes, and at the same time he has asked the Committee to take into account the effect of the scheme on all these other schemes. I suspect very much that the answer that the Committee will find is that it has no effect at all on any of those schemes. So although it is an expanded reference, it is very limited in its scope.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In our view, it is a matter of regret that Senator Harradine has in effect deleted from our proposal the reference to declining participation rates in tertiary education and the question of the socio-economic background of students participating in tertiary education and the fact that those of less privileged backgrounds are a declining number participating in post-secondary education. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am in the happy position-I rarely say this to other senators- of saying that I have been here longer than you, Senator. I remember the Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training addressing itself to this matter. I recorded last night, during the second reading debate, the fact that the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission has twice expressed views about this matter. The inquiry into the validation of tertiary assistance schemes, the other inquiry quoted from last night, also expressed a view about the changing socio-economic background of students, indicating that that change was adverse, certainly from my point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Should we wait for another sort of recycling of this issue on the basis of yet another inquiry set up by this Government? It has been the most monumentally historic government in terms of the number of inquiries that it has launched and the very few results on which it has acted. I should have thought that at this stage of the present Government's history it would be getting a bit sick of inquiries of one sort or another, but apparently that is not so. I am sceptical about another inquiry, which is, of course, just postponing a decision about this matter, about what ought to be done as regards access in education and about what ought to be done by the less well off who seek access to education. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chipp has addressed, as I have said, a full-blooded question to me, and I hoped that he might give me the courtesy of listening to the answer. The reason why we will not oppose this legislation is that the view that the legislation should be opposed outright is really based on certain slightly paranoid assumptions that this scheme is the thin end of the wedge. That may have been so. We are not sure that it still remains the thin end of the wedge, because any wedges that the present Government establishes are reduced to splinters. What we are saying is that, if there is a further attempt in any way to expand the loans scheme at the expense of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, we will oppose that very strongly at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But as I said last night, we see this scheme giving some marginal benefit to some students. It is not the function of the Opposition in this place, the next government, which will have the opportunity to deal with these things, to be carried along on a sort of wave of paranoia on the basis of thin end of the wedge arguments. Although that may be something in which the Australian Democrats can indulge themselves, it is not something in which we can indulge ourselves. As I said last night, we in government will repeal this legislation in the context of the provision of adequate assistance for students. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It appears that the Senate will see the numbers with the amendment moved by Senator Harradine. Therefore, it appears that the heads of these various matters-(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e)-will come to the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, of which I am Chairman. There is always benefit in extra information that relates to a Bill, but I do not believe that it will greatly inform or add to the basic information that is available to us now about this loans scheme. This has been referred to by all those who have spoken at the second reading stage. But if the Senate wishes it to go to a Senate Standing committee, who am I, as one Senator, to oppose the majority of the Senate?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another matter flows from this amendment being passed. I take this opportunity to point out to all the interested parties that for this to work within five weeks, any submission relating to the various factors involved in the amendment would need to come to the Senate Committee by the end of October so that public hearings may be conducted in the recess week-the first week of November-in order that we can meet the deadline, 16 November, that is required by the amendment. That means putting on notice not only the Commonwealth Department of Education, the banks, the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission and other interested student bodies but also any member of the public who needs to respond. Five weeks is a very short time frame in which to conduct the considerations a Senate committee. In that respect I welcome the amendment by Senator Haradine which seeks the deletion of the two quite immense matters. One is the alleged decline in participation rates. There has been a decline in school leaver participation rates in higher education but there has been an increase in mature age participation and an increase in part time student participation. The matter, of course, is subject to a full investigation by the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission at the moment which will report in December. The second matter, the socio-economic background of students, being no longer part of this reference, is also welcomed for practical reasons. How could such an immense question be dealt with, even by a Senate standing committee with the reputation of the Senate Standing Commitee on Education and the Arts, within five weeks?</PARA>
<PARA> I take the opportunity also to refer to my speech last night and my references to the unrepresentative nature of the Australian Union of Students. The president of the AUS, Mr Paul Carrick, spoke with me after I made my speech last night and wanted to give his response to the statement that I made. The Acting President of AUS changed the convening of the executive meeting of AUS last week because of a Communist student meeting to be held at a certain time. The date of the AUS executive meeting was changed. I was more specifically concerned about the fact that the Acting President of the AUS had, on AUS letterhead, convened a group called the Executive Caucus. It is an Executive Caucus with a capital E and a capital C. It is not known to the students of Australia. It was convened as a covert body to look at the whole agenda of the meeting that would transpire the next day. To be fair to the President of the AUS, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard his letter to me dated today which refers to these matters. </PARA>

<PARA> Pursuant to our discussion of last evening, Wednesday 13th in Kings Hall, I wish to confirm and elaborate on a number of points I made at that meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, there are meetings of the various political groupings, tendencies and factions from across the political spectrum prior to meetings of the A.U.S. Executive. Like the Senate, the A.U.S. Executive is elected by proportional representation. This method of election allows the representation of minority views such as those of the National Civic Council (N.C.C.), the Communist Party and even the Liberal Party. In the same way that Liberal and N.C.C. representatives meet to discuss means of best representing their particular minority interest prior to Executive meetings, so do the Communist Party. Surely , in a democratic society, the right to hold such meetings should be afforded regardless of whether we may personally disagree with such minority views. </PARA>
<PARA> If one is to be consistent in asserting that the A.U.S. Executive is not ''open and representative'' because its members enter Executive Meetings with ''pre- formed views'', then one must also denounce the practice of the Parliamentary Liberal Party, in meeting prior to sessions of the Senate and so entering the Senate with similarly ''pre-formed views''. </PARA>
<PARA> In my opinion, it was inappropriate for the Union's letterhead to be used in the manner that it was, a view that I also held when Liberal and N.C.C. members of the Executive also used A.U.S. letterhead for their own particular factional purpose. This matter is currently under internal review and I am confident that students will democratically resolve against such practices in the future. I should however seek to point out that responsibility for the scheduling and conduct of Executive meetings normally resides with the President. However, due to my absence from the Secretariat, the E.V.P. sought to alter the scheduling of the Executive due to a mix-up in dates. Communist students had planned their meeting well in advance of the Executive meeting. In precisely the same way that the date of the Executive meeting would have to have been changed if it clashed with the Australian Liberal Students Federation Conference. The E.V.P. acted in good faith. </PARA>
<PARA> In the spirit of our discussion last evening, it would seem appropriate to have this letter incorporated into Hansard so as to clarify the position, and I would formally request that you ensure this happens. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude in expressing concern at the grave upset your actions have caused the particular individual concerned, and the quite erroneous impression given with regard to the conduct and organisation of the Executive meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> Regardless of this particular incident, students have consistently opposed the Government's proposed loan scheme, as will A.U.S., until students direct us to do otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA>Respectfully yours, PAUL CARRICK, National President, Australian Union of Students, Canberra. 14 October 1982. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my remarks last night I was not in any way setting out to upset any individual who is involved in public affairs but rather to clarify for the students of Australia and indeed for the Senate whether or not, in the light of such activity by the AUS, it is seen to be acting constitutionally or in a way which is open and representative of Australia's students. My allegation in this matter and some other matters is that it was not. I wish that the AUS were representative of students and acted constitutionally and openly so that all of the students could have more and more confidence in it. I believe that over the last few years this confidence has been sadly lacking. I think that the situation in AUS may be improving. I hope that there will be more accountability in that body so that the representations that it makes to honourable senators in a matter such as the Student Assistance (Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill may be taken as a more credible statement on behalf of the students of Australia. I am glad that I have had the opportunity to clarify that matter. I will leave it to the students of Australia to read the material from last night and today that is in Hansard to make their own judgments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, chaired by Senator Teague, will do an admirable job in the time that is available to it with the reference that has been made to it. Last night I expressed the Australian Democrats opposition to the Student Assistance (Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill. It is of regret that the Senate will not be voting against it. There is merit in the Senate Standing Committee, that impartial body which has produced such extraordinary reports recently. I am quite sure that it will be able to present a correct report which will show the points I raised last night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find the position expressed by Senator Button somewhat hard to follow. Apparently the Australian Labor Party will vote for the legislation in 1982 but will repeal it in 1983. I would have thought that if the Labor Party was prepared to vote for it in 1982, it could wait to see what actually happens, but we have been given a promise that it will be repealed. I would have thought that if it was to be repealed it would save the country a lot of money not to pass the legislation in the first place. The setting up costs will be revealed to the Senate Estimates Committee. There will be a great deal of organisation involved in setting it rolling. I presume it is a firm promise of repeal. I am not quite sure because at the last platform which I shared with the ALP spokesperson on education Mr Dawkins, who is from another place, he promised that his Party would vote against the legislation. It may well be that when it comes to the crunch the Australian Labor Party will not repeal this legislation. I believe that that will probably be the case. Once things are installed they tend to remain which is why we have taken the opposition that we have to this Bill. I believe that if it is voted into legislation some time next month-which presumably will be the case-it will be operable. I cannot see the Labor Party Cabinet operating any differently from a Liberal Party Cabinet when it gets around to discussing this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second reading speech for the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Grants) Amendment Bill 1982 is a useful, though incomplete, assortment of the Fraser Government's political opportunism and economic idiocy. It is a fine example of the Liberal Party of Australia eating its own policies and eating its own propaganda. The Bill extends for one further year the $80 a tonne subsidy on liquefied petroleum gas used for certain purposes first introduced in March 1980. As a result of this 12-month extension of that subsidy the subsidy will continue to be paid until March 1984. In other words, the reason that this Bill is before the Senate today is that the Government felt a political need to extend the subsidy just long enough to get it past the next general election. It is a product of what the recently returned prodigal son, Andrew Peacock, described as the 'manic determination' of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)-in this particular instance, the Prime Minister's manic determination to have an election before the end of 1982, a manic determination I think diminished somewhat by the events of the last couple of months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1980 the initial subsidy was introduced. That was for the purpose of the last election, the 1980 election. The subsidy was introduced in March; the election was held in October. A subsidy of $80 a tonne was paid for LPG for household use and was later extended to certain types of industrial use. In respect of the industrial usage, the Government has now discovered that the subsidy provisions have been abused, something which the Opposition and, I would expect, even some of the more rational people inside the Government itself, told the Government at the time they would be. The LPG subsidy is not paid on LPG used as a motor fuel or as a feed stock for petro-chemical industries. The policy, therefore, directly contradicts the Government's stated policy on energy and the use of LPG. The stated policy is that LPG should be reserved for its premium uses as a motor fuel and a petro-chemical feed stock. For that purpose it is sold at market prices. For other purposes, low grade industrial use and crude space heating, the crudest of all purposes, a subsidy of $80 a tonne is paid. It is one manifestation of this Government's competence in the area of economic management!</PARA>
<PARA> The apologia advanced in 1980 for the existence of the amending Bill, which contradicted the Government's stated energy policy in general and its stated policy on LPG in particular, was that the measure was necessary to cushion households against the sudden rise in LPG prices which had then recently occurred, as a direct result I add parenthetically, of the Government's import pricing policy. So we have two tiers of contradiction. </PARA>
<PARA> As the second reading speech said, the LPG subsidy was introduced for three years in March 1980 with the objective of providing sufficient time for household users to adjust to rapidly rising LPG prices. Since then, the price of LPG in real terms has fallen by nearly 30 per cent. The 1980 apologia was no longer tenable. In these circumstances, the Government has concocted and repeats in the second reading speech a breathtaking piece of fiction which says that the subsidy is being extended 'to cope through a period of uncertainty in world LPG prices, expected to occur in the next year or two'. Expected by whom to occur in the next year or two? For what reason? Who says that? Does the National Energy Advisory Committee suggest that we are about to enter a period of substantial instability in world LPG prices? Everything I have read and everything I have been told suggests to me that the more likely outcome, the more likely result, over the next 18 months is that the real price of LPG will either remain constant or will fall slightly. I do not know whether the NEAC is the author of that piece of brilliant, creative writing or whether at some time after the NEAC gave an opinion the opinion was doctored by somebody in the Government. It should get the parliamentary award of the month for creative writing, completely divorced as it is from reality. The second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand the Government does not intend that the subsidy encourage new scale industrial use of LPG. This policy was clearly stated in 1980 when the subsidy was made available to industrial and commercial users in areas where natural gas was not readily available. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has now discovered that moral suasion is not a successful antidote for tampering with market prices. The economic theorists of the Liberal Party are apparently astounded to learn that if the price of one commodity is subsidised then that commodity becomes more competitive than it would have been if it had not been subsidised. As a result, LPG has become more competitive after subsidy than certain other fuels. It has been used to replace certain other fuels. The economic theorists of the Liberal Party are apparently startled that this wholly predictable and predicted outcome has eventuated. The second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA> Over the last two years the competitiveness of LPG as an industrial fuel has created a situation where large industrial consumers with heavy reliance on fuel oil could be encouraged to convert to LPG. </PARA>
<PARA>It would be astonishing if they were not encouraged to do so, in marginal cases at least. That was a wholly predictable result of paying the subsidy to industrial users in the first place. Then we see in the second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not wish to encourage such conversion for a number of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA>How is it proposed to stop it? If we look a little deeper into the second reading speech we see how. The Minister for the Capital Territory and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr Hodgman) states:</PARA>
<PARA> The considerations that I have just mentioned led the Government to announce on 25 September 1981 its intention to impose limitations on the amount of subsidised gas to which industrial and commercial enterprise would be entitled. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say that as from 1 October 1982 most industrial enterprises will be restricted to a subsidy on a maximum of 1,000 tonnes of LPG per annum. The Government started with a tough policy-that it was going to stop this astonishing, this startling, substitution of a subsidised fuel for an unsubsidised fuel, by restricting the amount of fuel which would qualify for subsidy. It was a tough and rational policy. It then decided that it would fix that limit at 1,000 tonnes a year-not quite so tough. The second reading speech goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does recognise, however, that on 25 September 1981 some users were already using or were committed to use LPG in excess of the equivalent of 1 ,000 tonnes per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> How does the Government propose to cope with that difficulty? We are told later in the second reading speech that it will cope with that problem by giving the Minister arbitrary power to decide which industrial users will get a subsidy on more than 1,000 tonnes of LPG a year and which industrial users will not. That is a repudiation, I would have thought, of what are supposed to be two of the fundamental tenets of liberalism. Firstly, it repudiates the supposed fundamental tenet of liberalism that market forces should be allowed to determine choices made by individuals between alternatives, rather than bureaucrats of governments. Secondly, it repudiates what is thought was supposed to be a second fundamental tenet of liberalism, that arbitrary power should not be placed in the hands of politicians or bureaucrats. that to the extent that the power of the State was to be used in the market place or anywhere else, it should be enshrined in legislation and not left to the arbitrary and perhaps capricious or even, dare I say it, on occasions corrupt judgment or abuse of politicians or bureaucrats. Yet that is precisely what the Government proposes to do with this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, despite some reservations about this policy and a very grave reservation, of course, about the flat contradiction between the existence of the policy and the Government's fundamental energy policy, and graver reservations about the industrial limitations component of the Bill before us tonight, the Opposition is concerned that some of the people living in some parts of Australia have access to relatively cheap natural gas whereas other people living in other parts of Australia do not have access to relatively cheap natural gas. Therefore, we will not be opposing the Bill. I think it is fair to observe, given the blatently opportunistic nature of this piece of legislation and the fact that the subsidy is to be extended by it for a 12-month period only , that in the highly unlikely event of the Fraser Government being returned at the next election, which it now appears almost certain will be in 1983, the fact that this Bill extends for one year a subsidy previously provided for a three- year period is an excellent, indeed I would say infallible, indication of the fact that this subsidy will cut out completely at the end of March 1984. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Liquefied Petroleum Gas ( Grants) Amendment Bill 1982 is to extend the period applying to the subsidy for liquefied petroleum gas of $80 per tonne for another 12 months. The subsidy was introduced in 1980 for a three-year period with the aim of providing sufficient time for household users to adjust to the rapidly escalating price of LPG brought on by the second oil shock of 1979. So LPG has become an important primary energy source in many rural areas in Australia. Without the subsidy it would be difficult for these areas to secure adequate heating. From that point of view the subsidy is very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important also to realise that LPG has become a very important alternative to petrol. The Australian Democrats believe that this usage of LPG as an alternative to petrol should be encouraged. Its price is only half the price of premium fuel. Many taxi drivers in the country report that they get better engine life from the use of LPG. Certainly it is less polluting and is in very many ways a much better fuel than petrol. It is significant to note, however, that three-quarters of our production of LPG at present is being exported, mainly to Japan and it is to this aspect that I wish to draw the attention of the Senate. We believe that it is necessary to introduce a Bill such as this to extend the subsidy for another 12 months, and for that reason we will not be opposing this Bill. However, it does raise the issue of what fuel we will use for our motor cars after the oil reserves in Bass Strait run out. We all know that these reserves are limited. They will probably begin to dry up about 1988, the year of the bicentenary. Do we have any plan as to what fuel we will use after that? Will we import oil? If so, where will we get the foreign exchange to pay for it? The Government, in other words, has not come up with any basic planning on energy over the next decade or so. It seems to me very short sighted of the Government to be allowing three-quarters of the production of LPG in this country to be exported to Japan. That means in effect that our very limited resources of crude oil in Bass Strait are being refined in our own refineries and an important by-product of those refineries, LPG, which could be used to run our motor cars and to extend the life of the Bass Strait oilfields is not being used for those purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats are very concerned about the whole state of the petroleum industry in this country. We believe that the industry needs a thorough investigation from top to bottom. We have been drawing attention to the fact that while the oil companies have control of the retailing of petrol, they are in a dominant position to dictate to the Australian people and in fact to the Australian Government what should happen with regard to the pricing of petrol. I believe the fact that there is no marketing strategy in this area is the reason why three-quarters of the LPG produced in Australia currently goes to Japan. It goes to Japan simply because the Japanese are prepared to pay a higher price for it than we can get on the Australian market. This takes no account of the fact that it is a very scarce resource in this country and plans should be made to use it in the most economical way. If we do not plan now we will face a very serious problem in a few years time. The facts of the matter are that we could plan to use alternative fuels for our motor cars. We have large quantities of natural gas in the North West Shelf. That gas could be used to produce ethanol to run our motor cars. We could decide that that is the way we want to go in the future. If we do decide that that is the way to go then we have to plan now to modify our motor cars, to give the manufacturers of motor cars sufficient time to put a vehicle on the market that is suitable for the use of a mixture of ethanol and petrol. We do hope that eventually these very big problems will be faced up to by the Government, that there will be a total divorcement of the retailing of petrol from the oil companies and that a long term plan will be brought down so that it is clear to everybody just what will happen as our scarce resources of petroleum dry up. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the specific matter before us, we believe that the widespread use of liquefied petroleum gas in this country should be encouraged and for that reason we support the 12 months extension of time applying to the subsidy. It is needed . We just hope that the Government will make use of this extension of time to do something fundamental about the long term problems of which the usage of LPG is one aspect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for the somewhat equivocal support that the Liquefied Petroleum Gas ( Grants) Amendment Bill has received. I understand that, notwithstanding the lack of direct oral support, it will have the voting support of honourable senators. I do not wish to speak at length; indeed, I could not speak at length in light of the hour. However, I want very quickly to mention a couple of points raised by Senator Walsh. He expressed concern about that passage of the Bill which permitted an exception to the 1,000 tonne limit for certain industries and, in the way which is fairly characteristic of him, he raised inferences that there could be corruption at the political or bureaucratic level in respect of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to refer very quickly to the Bill, which provides in clause 7 for the limitation of subsidised use by industrial users. It lays down the limit of 1,000 tonnes which has been referred to in the second reading speech and in debate this evening. The provision makes a very sensible exception for a situation where, on the basis of the law as it applied without this limitation, industries have undertaken usage greater than 1,000 tonnes per annum. In sub- clause (6) there is a provision that where that is the case or where contractual obligations have been entered into before 25 September 1981 relating to either the purchase of gas or the purchase, construction or modification of a plant, then an exception can be made. That exception is one which depends on the words of the clause, which require either the prior greater use of gas or the entering into of firm commitments. In respect of the administration of that clause, a later clause in the Bill provides for the decision to be subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. So the matter is subject to appropriate controls. It is quite specific and it is subject to an appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other thing I wish to say is that there is a marked difference between the approach adopted by Senator Walsh in this place and the speech made by the Opposition spokesman, Mr Keating, in the other place. One would be hard pressed to conclude after comparing the two speeches that both could represent the official views of the Australian Labor Party. I can only ask those people who might be concerned about the attitude of the Labor Party to take their chance on whether Senator Walsh or Mr Keating accurately set out the attitude of the Labor Party to this subsidy. Senator Walsh gave us a lecture on the economic undesirability of maintaining this sort of subsidy, pointing out that it was contrary to the wish of the Government to divert this resource to automotive use . On the other hand, Mr Keating acknowledged the difficulties which are felt by communities which do not have access to the natural gas pipeline. He made a speech which, as I say, sits at complete odds with the comments of Senator Walsh this evening. I commend the legislation to the Senate and trust that it will have a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the special Commonwealth drought assistance measures announced on 31 August 1982. They are a subsidy on interest payments over 12 per cent made by eligible drought declared farmers and a subsidy on fodder purchased to be fed to drought affected sheep and cattle. The fundamental aim of these measures is to help prevent drought affected farmers from walking off their properties because of difficulties in servicing their debt, and reduce the cost of drought feeding and so enable graziers to retain stock, particularly breeding stock. This will also contribute to a more rapid economic recovery in the rural sector when the drought breaks. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be disastrous for the nation if the drought was allowed to cause a major exodus of farmers from the land, or a serious depletion of sheep and cattle breeding stock. </PARA>
<PARA> There are currently an estimated 100,000 farms across Australia that are drought affected. Already the net value of rural production is forecast by the BAE to be some $1,300m below last year's level. If the drought does not break very shortly, the Bureau believes the net value of rural production could fall to half of last year's level. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect on the cash surpluses of farmers will be extremely severe. The BAE estimates that in 1982-83 cash surpluses in the Eastern States will be down by at least 50 per cent in both the agricultural and grazing industries and the horticultural industries. In NSW, currently the worst affected State, cash surpluses could be down by at least 70 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the interest payment and fodder subsidies will be totally funded by the Commonwealth. They are special initiatives for the duration of the current drought only, and they are both effective from 1 September 1982, for eligible farmers. They are a recognition of the fact that we are now facing potentially the worst rural disaster in our history. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides specific funding for the two subsidies. Needless to say, it is extremely difficult to estimate what the overall actual cost might be, particularly as it is impossible to predict how long the drought will continue. consequently, the funds appropriated in this Bill are based on the best available estimates of the effects of the drought, and the depressing assumption that the situation will not ease over the remainder of this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> I should mention that there is nothing particularly unusual about not having firm estimates for natural disaster relief programs of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to budget for natural disasters and when they do occur it is the duty of the Government, and the whole community, to be prepared to provide adequate assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me also stress that adequate provisions are being provided with regard to the administration of both of these subsidies to ensure that they are not abused . In particular, we will not allow Pitt and Collins Street farmers to take advantage of the interest rate subsidy. We are not in the business of helping part time farmers who also have outside incomes. We are in the business of helping the nation's full time farmers to stay on their properties through this very difficult period. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the detail of the two subsidy arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Interest Payment Subsidy</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This scheme will be subject to strict eligibility criteria:</PARA>
<PARA> It will only be available to those involved in the business of primary production who are also, in normal circumstances, predominantly dependent on their farm for their living. </PARA>
<PARA> The farm must be drought declared by the State. </PARA>
<PARA> To obtain the Subsidy on debt existing at 31 August both the applicant and all other individuals with a direct or indirect beneficial interest in the farm must not have, in aggregate, readily available liquid assets exceeding 12 per cent of the eligible debt. This will allow eligible farmers to hold sufficient liquidity to meet their share of the interest payments. Furthermore, a farmer can become eligible at a subsequent date, if evidence is provided that readily available liquid assets have been used to reduce debt to meet the 12 per cent eligibility criterion. </PARA>
<PARA> Examples of readily available liquid assets are cash deposits, term deposits, various forms of Government bonds and securities, stocks and shares traded on the share market, and Income Equalisation Deposits. An individual with a direct or indirect beneficial interest in a farm is anyone who by virtue of being a partner or share holder or trustee, derives some form of income from the farm operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Providing a farmer meets all the eligibility criteria, he will pay the first 12 per cent of interest on eligible debt and the Commonwealth will pay the balance.</PARA>
<PARA> The Subsidy will apply to interest payments on interest which is accrued since 1 September 1982 on eligible debt held at 31 August 1982. Debt must be for the purpose of primary production, and most types of formal loans will be eligible, including solicitors' funds and hire purchase. Leasing is not included. The Subsidy will also be paid on new debt advanced by banks and pastoral houses after 1 September, where these lenders certify that it was for the purposes of carry-on necessitated by the drought. The Subsidy will not be paid on loan charges, stamp duty, State loan taxes, etc; only on interest payments. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to administration, application forms will be available from Post Offices, and farmers will apply direct to the Department of Primary Industry in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> Claims cannot be made until interest has either been paid, or debited to the farmer's account; claims cannot be made more frequently than once a month; and payments will be made directly to the applicant by mailed cheque. </PARA>
<PARA> Farmers who believe they are eligible will need to complete detailed application forms and a claim form in respect of each loan on which the subsidy is being claimed. The farmer will also be required to complete a statutory declaration attesting to the truth of all the information he provides, and lenders will also be required to certify as to the details of the debt and that the interest has been paid. </PARA>
<PARA> These arrangements are necessary to ensure that there is no abuse of this subsidy. There are severe penalties for false declarations or attempts to defraud the Commonwealth, including fines and up to 4 years gaol under the Crimes Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth will provide $36m for this subsidy. This provision is based on estimates by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics that there are currently some 30,000 drought affected farmers with average interest rates exceeding 12 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> These farmers have average debts just over $32,000 per farm. Estimates prepared by my Department indicate that some 10,000 farmers may qualify immediately for the interest subsidy with an estimated further 17,000 likely to qualify if the drought continues for another 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA>Fodder subsidy</PARA>

<PARA> This subsidy will apply to all fodder purchased from 1 September 1982 for feeding to drought affected sheep and cattle. it will be claimable once a month and there will be upper limits of 80 cents per sheep per month and $8 per cattle beast per month, that can be claimed. </PARA>
<PARA> The subsidy will be administered by the States under conditions and guidelines agreed with the Commonwealth. Claim forms will be available from, and claims should be submitted to, State agencies administering drought relief. </PARA>
<PARA> A farmer will have to purchase the fodder and complete an application form together with appropriate documentation and receipts before being paid the subsidy. A common form will be used throughout Australia and will be available through State administrations before the end of the month. </PARA>
<PARA> If farmers sell fodder after 1 September then receipts from these sales will be debited against any subsidy entitlement before actual subsidy payments are made. Farmers will have to include as fodder sales feed wheat and feed barley. They will not have to include other wheat delivered to the Australian Wheat Board or its receival agents, or sales of malting barley. </PARA>
<PARA> When making a claim for the subsidy the farmer will be required to sign a statutory declaration certifying the truthfulness of all the information included on the claim form-in other words, that he has purchased the fodder to feed to drought affected sheep and cattle that he owns; the number of sheep and cattle he is feeding; and details of any fodder sales. </PARA>
<PARA> The subsidy will not be available on fodder purchased for feeding to sheep and cattle held in commercial feed lots. </PARA>
<PARA> The subsidy will be paid on all grain, fodder and manufactured stock feed purchased for feeding drought affected sheep and cattle. In the case of wheat, the subsidy will be 50 per cent of the purchase price, ex source. For other feeds, the subsidy will be calculated on the basis of the feedstuff's nutrient value relative to wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth and State officials have agreed to a three category system for nutritive values, and this will operate uniformly throughout Australia. Category one will include fodders that are taken to have the same nutritive value as wheat; category two will include those that are taken to have a nutrient value of 67 per cent of wheat; and category three will include fodders with a nutrient value of 50 per cent of wheat. In no cases will the subsidy payment exceed 50 per cent of what the farmer paid for the fodder. Details of the relative nutrient values will be widely publicised, and will also be included on the back of the claim forms. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's general philosophy is to allow the subsidy to be paid on all feed and supplements which are normally used or required in a particular State or region to keep sheep and cattle alive in a drought. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme is designed to prevent fodder prices from escalating abnormally. As the wheat price cannot be manipulated, if other fodders become too expensive, then logically farmers will switch to wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth will provide up to $320m for the fodder subsidy. This provision is based on current livestock numbers of about 14 million cattle and 94 million sheep on drought affected farms, and the assumption that there will be a need to subsidise around 70 per cent of feed and grain fed to those sheep and cattle. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that these measures, together with changes and additions that it has suggested to the States to the core measures operating under the Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements will provide much needed additional relief to drought stricken farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(6.59)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want very briefly to bring to the attention of the Senate the concern of members of the Tasmanian community at the prospect that the public telegram service could be reduced to virtually a non-service to the Tasmanian community. It is apparent when one looks at the statistics that, with some 136,000 households in Tasmania and only 96,000 private telephone connections, only some 71 per cent of Tasmanian households have a telephone service in order to carry out those communications with other persons which are so essential for the conduct of social life and those commercial transactions which are undertaken from home. There are many cases, therefore, where the telegram service is an essential link to persons in households without a telephone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It appears from information which has been given to me, particularly in a submission from Mr Alan Riseley, the Tasmanian Branch Secretary of the Union of Postal Clerks and Telegraphists, that the telegram service in Tasmania may be under threat of extinction. There has been some discussion in certain circles to the effect that the service may be cut out altogether on 8 February 1983. Therefore, it is a matter of some urgency that Tasmanian senators express their views on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the public telegram service has served the Australian and Tasmanian communities very well in the 100 years in which it has been operating. But it also seems clear from documentation that has been provided to most honourable senators that there has been a breakdown in co-operation or trust between Telecom Australia and the unions concerned in this area. When those unions on 10 August 1982 asked the Chief General Manager of Telecom very pertinent questions as to the plans of Telecom in relation to this network, Telecom replied that it was reviewing its total approach to the structure of the service including staffing arrangements. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of that review, it is not possible to answer the detailed questions . . . which you have posed. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there is a refusal by Telecom management to answer the very reasonable questions of the union which has a concern for the general community and, of course, for the livelihood of its own members. </PARA>
<PARA> Certain management studies have been undertaken by W. D. Scott and Co. Pty Ltd. If that company's recommendations were put into operation, particularly those in regard to the greeting telegram service, it could well be that there would be an increase in revenue to Telecom of some $6m. That respected management consultancy firm predicted that Telecom would gain an additional $1,160,000 as a result of a strong promotions campaign for greetinggrams over each year of the first two years of the campaign. That proposal has not been taken up by Telecom. This seems to indicate that the Telecom management has made its own decision that the public telegram service ought not to continue because, it has to be admitted, losses are being made in the conducting of that service. But, as I say , steps which have been recommended by respected outside consultants to reduce that loss have not been undertaken. In any case, as I have already put to the Senate, I think it is apparent from the number of households in Tasmania without a telephone that there may be a strong case for the community subsidising the operation of such an essential service. In other words, some losses may be quite properly borne by the community and by general tax revenue in order to ensure that people are not totally isolated in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter to which I wish briefly to give some attention is the case of Mr Solomon Gebreab, an Eritrean, who has fled his country and who has been travelling as a merchant seaman around the world for the last half dozen years. He has resided in Australia for the last 12 months during which time he has made an application for refugee status. I understand that some recommendation has been made by the Determination of Refugee Status Committee to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hodges) in relation to that application, though I do not know the nature of the recommendation before the Minister. As one of the sponsors of the Eritrean Relief Committee-Senator Missen from Victoria is another-I would like to make a special plea on behalf of this man. To require him to return to Ethiopia would be to condemn him to the fate of other people in that country who are subjected to indiscriminate and brutal killings and suppression by the military dictatorship in Ethiopia which is backed by Russian generals who plan and devise military campaigns which are genocidal in their effect. To send Mr Gebreab back to Ethiopia would be undoubtedly to condemn him to death. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that there has been some talk in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to the effect that this gentleman ought to be returned to Italy. The basis for that seems to be that at various times in his career as a merchant seaman Mr Gebreab has worked for Italian companies and spent some time necessarily in Italian ports. But the fact is that he has spent the last 12 months of his life in Australia. In fact, he has not developed any longer standing relationship with any other country. In other words, he has spent more time in Australia than in Italy. Here he has developed friendships with Australians, a good understanding of the Australian way of life and could settle well into this community. The fact is-and this needs to be noted-that repatriation to Italy would not be a suitable or acceptable alternative, because whilst that country is a signatory to the 1961 Geneva Convention and the 1976 Protocol it appears from information supplied to me that Italy has restricted its commitments under these conventions to events in Europe prior to 1951 and therefore is not committed to accepting African refugees. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government is thinking that it can place Mr Gebreab on a vessel of the line from which he jumped ship some 12 months ago in Australia with some undertaking by that shipping line that it will land him in Italy, that plan is bound to founder. As I say, in any case Italy has no obligation under any international convention to accept this man. But quite apart from that, the Government should exercise its humanitarian concern on behalf of this Eritrean who is a refugee from his country through no fault of his own but because of the persecution of the Eritrean people which is the subject of a reference to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. I will not go into the actual substance of the conflict in that country, but it is well known to the Government. I hope that the Government, in view of its knowledge of this situation, will grant to this man the humanitarian asylum which he deserves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I think I will leave it where it is until about 9 November. For the fifth time since 24 August I am forced to raise the plight of the timber industry in the south-east of South Australia. Because of large imports of New Zealand and North American timber the local industry is suffering a huge loss of income with the resultant loss of employment and others in the work force being put on short time. I first raised this matter in the Senate by way of a question to Senator Chaney on 24 August. It was quite a long question and the Minister gave me a much longer answer. I then had to ask a supplementary question. I remind Senator Chaney of what he told me on 24 August. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have no information in my brief on this matter and I have no independent recollection of it. I will have to check that point and let Senator McLaren have a further reply. </PARA>
<PARA>I am still awaiting that further reply from Senator Chaney, despite the fact that during the adjournment debate on 16 September and 23 September I again raised the matter. On Tuesday of this week, that is, 12 October, again on the adjournment debate, I had to raise the matter again. As I say, tonight is the fifth occasion on which I have raised the matter in this chamber. I want to be as brief as I can, due to the lateness of the hour, to put on record that on 11 June this year I sent telegrams to the following Ministers: The Minister for Trade and Resources, Mr Anthony; the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr Lynch; the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon; the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney; the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Macphee and the Minister for Transport and Construction, Mr Hunt. All of those telegrams were addressed to those Ministers at Parliament House. The text of the telegram is thus:</PARA>
<PARA> Respectfully draw your immediate attention to the pending economic crisis in the Mount Gambier Area of South Australia, due to the loss of pay to Workers in the Timber Industry because of the introduction of a four day week by the Timber Producers. </PARA>
<PARA> This reduction in working time has been caused by the lack of orders for the local product due to the large imports of Timber, particularly from New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA> Your urgent action is necessary to relieve the extreme anxiety and financial problems facing the Workforce and Business people in the South East of this State. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, you are a South Australian and you would be well aware that since I sent that telegram on 11 June this year the industry has suffered much graver problems in the months that have gone by. I did receive an acknowledgment to my telegram from each of those Ministers. Some came fairly quickly. The last one was dated 3 August. It took Mr Macphee from 11 June, when he received my telegram, to write to me on 3 August acquainting me that he was aware of the problem and the Government intended to do something about it. I have had no reply as to what the Government is actually intending to do except, as I said here on Tuesday night, that I have heard on the grape vine that there is a proposal to set up a Temporary Assistance Authority inquiry. I have received no official information and neither has the South East Trades and Labour Council of South Australia, which I introduced as a deputation to Mr Lynch back in July-it may have been August-in his office in Melbourne. We have received nothing official about that. </PARA>
<PARA> What concerns me is that although the Government has been aware of the problems for all of this time, it has not yet told us officially what it intends to do to help the problem in the south-east. During the Estimates committee hearings I posed a few questions about the use of consultants. I found that the department which is mainly concerned with the timber industry was Mr Lynch's department, as it was then. Of course, there has been a change there. During the last 12 months the Department of Industry and Commerce has engaged 12 consultants at a cost of $235,217. Surely some of those consultants would have been looking at the plight of the industry in Australia as a whole but particularly in the south-east. Senator Chaney's own Department engaged the services of seven consultants at a cost of $249,299 for that 12 months' period. Surely they must have looked at some of the aspects of what the problem of unemployment was going to cause to the Department of Social Security. I am sure that the consultants would have been aware of the huge increase in unemployment in the south-east without having to wait for me to tell the Senate about it some weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the overall total of consultants engaged by this Government for the preceding 12 months we will find that 2,699 consultants were engaged at a huge cost of $52,051m. That is a huge amount of public money. Yet we cannot be told officially that the consultants have come up with any answer as to what ought to be done; it might not be successful. One of the things which they ought to be doing is preventing this timber coming in from New Zealand and North America. It is of great concern to me as a person who spends a lot of time in the south-east of South Australia and it is of great concern to the mill proprietors, the timber growers and, of course, the employees whose wage packets are decreasing. In turn, they do not have the spending power which was once available. As a result the small business people in Mount Gambier, Millicent and to a lesser extent in Tarpeena are suffering great financial loss. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a three-year history of what is happening in the south-east insofar as the State Government goes. I will give a brief background of what has happened in the last three years. The last three years have been years of missed marketing opportunities for the South Australian Woods and Forest Department and falling employment and profits both for the Department and the industry as a whole. The woodchip and pulp contracts have been cancelled by the Tonkin Government and subsequent market downturns have deterred possible interest in the utilisation of the pulp wood resource. Lack of stimulation of the building industry has also had a depressing effect on the initiatives in the soft wood construction materials that had been developed by the previous Labor Government. Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd, which is the owner of the Cellulose Australia Ltd paper mill, has continued its program of consolidating its production in its larger eastern States paper mills and has decided to close the No. 2 paper mill at Cellulose, which of course, is very near to Millicent, with the loss of 130 jobs and a related downturn in the prosperity of the township of Millicent. The Tonkin Government has not pursued opportunities for overseas forestry consultancies involving South Australian forestry expertise and the building of complete tree nurseries which were in the process of negotiation between the previous Labor Government and the governments of Algeria and Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> Diversified markets for sawn timber products have not been explored. This failure to develop the marketing side of the Department's operations by the Tonkin Government, through product and market research, has contributed markedly to the downturn in activity in the timber industry. It means that the south-east regional economy is not getting the full benefits in terms of jobs and profits from the forestry resource that is there. Over the last three years of the Tonkin Government, the Department of Woods and Forest, coasting along on the initiatives of the previous Labor Government, has generated millions of dollars for the State Treasury Department. Most of this money has been taken into general revenue by the Tonkin Government and none of it has been invested into sales and development areas. Apart from the investment in a new green mill which was initiated and fully funded under the previous Labor Government, no new capital investment of any magnitude has been undertaken by the Tonkin Government . This anti-development strategy by the Tonkin Government in the timber industry has reduced the ability of the Department of Woods and Forest to compete with imports. The recent decision of the Tonkin Government to divert surpluses to subsidise private farm forestry will contribute to the present oversupply of timber and reduce even further the Department's competitiveness on domestic and export markets. </PARA>
<PARA> During the Estimates committee hearings I was alarmed to note under one of the headings of the Department of Primary Industry that it was anticipated that somewhere near to an income of $3m would be received from the States. That would be by way of interest payments under the softwood forestry agreements-that is, where the loans have been made available to the various States. The Commonwealth Government has a vested interest in seeing that the timber industry in Australia remains viable because those States which have borrowed money will be unable to pay the interest on the loans. If the downturn in the timber industry continues we will find that those States will not be able to repay any of the principal off the loans and also the interest accrued. That will bring about a further drag on the taxpayers of this community. It is in the interests, not only of the mill owners in the south-east of South Australia, at which I am directing my attention this evening, as I have done on four previous occasions, but also of the employers, the small business people and, at the end of the scale the Commonwealth Government, to do something to protect this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> To save the time of the Senate I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the policy of the South Australian Labor Party on the forestry industry of that State. It occupies some two typewritten pages. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Labor's Policy</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> A Labor Government will vigorously pursue markets for South Australian forestry products and expertise in order to maximise job opportunities and profits in the S.E. of the State. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular:</PARA>
<PARA> Labor will seek markets in Australia and overseas for surplus forestry thinnings either as woodchips or pulp. The disposal of surplus thinnings will not only create additional jobs and income for the State but is crucial to the good management of the forests and the supply of sawlog in future. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor will explore overseas markets for sawn timber and pre-cut components in order to reduce the Woods &amp; Forests Department's dependence on the ups and downs of the Australian building market. Diversified markets will provide greater security of employment for workers in the industry. Labor will also assist other producers to seek alternative markets for products such as particle board. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor will follow up the many enquiries from countries in the Middle East and North Africa seeking S.A. forestry expertise. These projects aimed at controlling soil erosion and landscaping new town development will provide jobs for South Australians and export opportunities for South Australian firms supplying equipment for forestry. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor will change the investment priorities of the Woods &amp; Forests Department away from the provision of subsidies for private farm forestry and return it to the continual updating of the Department's sawmills. Unless the Department is kept in the forefront of modern technology it will be unable to compete with the flood of imported timber and more jobs will be lost. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor will increase investment in new product research and development. This work is essential if timber and timber products are to hold and expand their share of the market. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor will make strong representations to the Federal Government to provide adequate safeguards against unfair competition from New Zealand under C.E.R. Unless the Federal Government is prepared to insist on the New Zealand Government removing export incentives royalty subsidies and other artificial forms of assistance, Labor will develop with the other major forestry States of New South Wales and Victoria ways to give preference to Australian timber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply- Mr President, it is not only the mills of God that grind slowly and exceeding small, I must say. In any event, this is the fourth or fifth time that Senator McLaren has raised this matter at Question Time, on the adjournment, or in the Estimates committee hearings. A fair amount of information has been provided to this point. The former Minister for Industry and Commerce gave me information concerning it some time ago. I passed that on in the course of one of these debates. It concerned the discussions that were taking place at interdepartmental level between New Zealand and Australia in relation to the difficulties about which Senator McLaren has been expressing concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, it is very simple to respond that a very easy way to handle these problems is simply to cut off imports. No country is more dependent upon its ability to export than is Australia. If we were to reach a situation in which our automatic reflex action was to stop all imports, clearly Australia itself would soon be in even more significant difficulties. For that reason, we do not have a policy of simply responding by totally closing off imports. Rather, we have procedures which enable a reference to be made to the Temporary Assistance Authority or other action to be initiated of the sort originally taken here, in respect of which there was international consultation on the point. However, I do have some additional information that will be of interest to the Senate in regard to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> As was mentioned previously, the industry sought a dumping action against square dressed structural softwood of New Zealand origin. The investigation has progressed to the stage at which New Zealand has been notified formally that the 60-day consultation period required under Article 10 of the New Zealand- Australia Free Trade Agreement was deemed to have commenced on 27 September. Furthermore, in accordance with standard dumping procedures, a meeting of parties has been arranged for 18 October 1982, a matter of days from now, to discuss certain factual aspects associated with the determination of normal values. Towards the end of last week, the Softwood Timber Producers Council sent additional information to the Department of Industry and Commerce, together with a request that its application for a TAA reference be re-activated. The Minister expects the Department to analyse this information and prepare a report for him by the end of this week on the industry's request for a reference to the TAA. That further information may be of assistance to the honourable senator. </PARA>
<PARA> Reference has also been made to my own Department. I was in South Australia a week or so ago and had an opportunity to meet my State director and also other officers of the Department. The general view put to me is that the Department is managing well in the circumstances it faces-an increased volume of activity in the unemployment area. The Government is being careful to respond to the additional staffing needs. I believe that the Department itself has responded well to the additional demands that are being made upon it. I would be disappointed if that generalisation, which I would apply to the State of South Australia, and indeed to the States generally, could not be applied to the south -east region of South Australia. Other things need to be done by us to respond to those pressures, but I assure the Senate that, given the differing circumstances we face, with an increase over a period of perhaps a little more than half a year of some 100,000 in the volume of unemployed on our books we are facing the challenge of presenting an appropriate service to those who need the assistance the Department provides. I think that position is being fairly satisfactorily covered. To the extent that it is not I would appreciate that being drawn to my attention because the Department would wish, of course, to deliver entitlements efficiently and effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate raised matters in the fields of immigration and telecommunications . I will see that the matters he raised are directed to the attention of the appropriate Ministers. The matter of the refugee status of a named individual from Eritrea is one that is already formally being dealt with by the processes which the Department has established to deal with refugee status. However, I will ensure that Senator Tate's remarks are referred to the officers of the respective Ministers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Average rates of growth of the standard measure of the money supply (M3) in each year-to-June from 1977 are given in the following table:</PARA>
<PARA>1977 1978 1979 1980 1981 1982</PARA>
<PARA>Growth rate</PARA>

<PARA> (2) The latest estimates of rates of growth in gross domestic product at current and constant prices in each year from 1976-77 are given in the following table:</PARA>
<PARA>1976-77 1977-78 1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 Current Prices</PARA>
<PARA> (per cent)  14.2 8.6 13.0 12.2 13.9 13.6 Constant Prices</PARA>
<PARA> (per cent)  2.8 0.9 4.8 1.2 3.7 3.0</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Gross domestic product (GDP) during a particular period is a measure of the total market value of goods and services produced in that period after deducting the cost of goods and services used up in the process of production but before deducting allowances for the consumption of fixed capital. Transactions (sales) may occur at the input, output and various intermediate stages of production, depending on the manner in which production is organised, while transactions involving existing physical assets, financial assets and transfer payments may be undertaken quite separately from current production. There need therefore be no precise relation between the total value of transactions and the value of GDP . Nonetheless if the overall patterns of production and of transactions in the economy are relatively stable, the two might be expected to grow at broadly similar rates.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) and (5) The total value of transactions depends on the prices at which they are carried out. The rate of increase in total transactions therefore responds to changes in the rate of growth of the money supply through the impact of the latter on inflation. At the same time, there has been a long term tendency for M3 to grow less rapidly than nominal GDP (and so presumably the total value of transactions) due to increasing efficiency in monetary use due to technological, institutional and other changes. The cost and availability of credit need to be assessed in terms of interest rates and the growth in relevant monetary aggregates in relation to current inflationary expectations. If expectations are slow to adjust to changes in the rate of growth of monetary aggregates, pressures may be placed on the cost and availability of credit. Any such pressures are not considered to have been undue in the period since 1976-77.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The sales tax law does not provide a general exemption for tools of trade. A person who is carrying on business as a manufacturer is entitled to exemption from sales tax in respect of machinery, implements and apparatus used in the manufacture of goods. There is also provision which exempts hand tools of the kinds used for industrial purposes. It happens that hand tools covered by this item are exempt irrespective of whether they are used by persons carrying out their trade or are for use by non-tradesmen. However, in the Budget Speech the Treasurer announced that it is proposed that some goods which are at present exempt will be made taxable as from 1 January 1983 at a rate of 7.5 per cent. This broadening of the sales tax base is to include goods such as hand tools.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Musical instruments purchased by professional musicians are not exempt from sales tax.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Export Inspection Service of the Department of Primary Industry.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Officers of the Department of Primary Industry carry out export inspection of meat, dairy products (including edible oils and eggs), honey, fish, canned and frozen fruit and vegetables, and dried fruit.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of grains, fresh fruit and fresh vegetables inspection is carried out by officers of the State departments responsible for Agriculture under the direction of senior Department of Primary Industry officers.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Crown Solicitor's Office advise that its statistics in regard to prosecution matters do not itemise prosecutions into primary produce categories and for this reason it is unable to provide relevant information.</PARA>
<PARA> Records held within the Department of Primary Industry indicate that between 1921 and 1979 there were in excess of 13,600 minor offences against regulations. The then Part XV of the Customs Act 1901 provided for relatively minor contraventions to be dealt with administratively and these offences were handled in this manner. The administrative procedures resulted in the imposition of fines or the issue of warnings in all cases.</PARA>
<PARA> Departmental records further indicate that in the past 10 years there have been 12 occasions on which more substantial proceedings have been brought under the Crimes Act 1968, the Customs Act 1901 and the Exports (Meat) Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) On the basis of Australian Federal Police investigations since August 1981, 5 prosecutions have been initiated by the Commonwealth.

<PARA> (1) The final report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System did include the words referred to by the honourable senator.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) It is not a case of the Government agreeing or disagreeing with the first part of the statement. It is merely axiomatic that, within the context of a given growth in the monetary aggregates, if more funds are attracted to a particular sector of the economy then other sectors in aggregate must get less.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the second part of the statement, it should be noted that it is qualified by use of the word 'might'. That qualification may have been designed to recognise that the Government, through various policies available to it, may secure certain objectives which purely market forces would not produce. Elsewhere in the report, the Committee of Inquiry gives more explicit recognition to this; for example it is stated in paragraph 1.43 that ''For equity or other social reasons, governments may choose to assist particular classes of savers or borrowers''; and paragraph 1.44 goes on to state that ' Social priorities are basically matters for governments to determine'.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The anticipated annual revenue from charges for admission to the Australian National Gallery in 1982-83 is $600,000.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The design of the Gallery building does not allow separate access to certain facilities such as the Gallery shop, restaurant and auditorium. Normal admission charges will apply to users of the Gallery's various facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) It is anticipated that the bulk of visitors to the Gallery will be one-day visitors (Australian Capital Territory tourist figures indicate that 72 per cent of visitors to the Australian Capital Territory stay for a maximum of three nights and visit facilities once during that stay).</PARA>
<PARA> The ANG has developed an on-going programme of education courses and lecture series. Some of these will be available on a drop-in basis, others will require prior booking. Admission to the Gallery will be inclusive in the programme cost.</PARA>
<PARA> For Gallery patrons who undertake frequent visits, a number of initiatives apply. These include a unique membership programme offering yearly and season memberships. These will permit unlimited acess to the Gallery during hours when the Gallery is open to the public.</PARA>
<PARA> Sufficient flexibility exists to enable the Gallery to increase the number and frequency of its programmes to meet demonstrated need.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) As yet the Gallery Council has not formulated a clear policy as to when and on what occasions, admission charges will be waived.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Admission charges to the Tate and National Gallery in the United Kingdom were introduced in January 1974 and withdrawn three months later. It is therefore not possible to draw conclusions on the effects on admissions. However , for several years prior to January 1974, attendance at the major United Kingdom arts institutions revealed a significant down trend. It is also important to note that under the United Kingdom proposal funds raised from admissions were not available for the purchase of works of art.</PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be borne in mind that the majority of United Kingdom institutions have well developed collections, whereas the ANG is a very young institution and needs to build as rapidly as possible a collection of richness and excellence in national and international terms. The fact that the net revenue from admission charges will be used exclusively for acquiring additional works of art will greatly facilitate this.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 18 November, 1981 (Hansard, page 2262) Senator Bolkus asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice which contained a number of figures dealing with recent movements in housing loan repayments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> From the information provided by the honourable senator it is assumed that he was referring to the interest rate on a savings bank loan for a home for owner- occupation. Since April 1980, savings bank housing loan interest rates have increased in five steps from 9.5 per cent per annum to 13.5 per cent in March 1982; they have remained at that level since then. These interest rate charges would have increased the repayment on a mortgage of $30,000 taken out over 30 years by about $90 per month. The increase in average weekly earnings during the same period was of the order of $350 per month.</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, as the honourable senator will be aware, many recent borrowers will be shielded for a time from the increase in interest rates announced on 18 March 1982 by policy measures adopted at that time and all homebuyers will be assisted by the introduction in the Budget of tax rebates on all interest payments in excess of 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bolkus also asked whether nominal and real interest rates had reached an 'all-time-high'. The following table prepared by the Treasury shows annual movements in the nominal and 'real' savings bank housing loan interest rates since June 1960. While nominal rates are at an historical high, it can readily be seen that recent 'real' rates were well below the levels recorded in the early 1960s and early 1970s; even higher 'real' interest rates were recorded at times during the 1930s and 1950s.</PARA>

<PARA> * Change in consumer price index, June quarter over June quarter of previous year.</PARA>
<PARA> * Maximum nominal rate at 30 June.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bolkus also quoted figures which suggested that house prices in Sydney had risen more rapidly than average weekly earnings in the period since December 1975. It should be noted, however, that Sydney house prices are generally higher and have generally increased at a faster rate than in other areas of Australia. Nevertheless, estimates of the Sydney house price figures indicate that increasing housing prices have been a significant factor in increasing the loan repayment burdens confronting new home buyers in Sydney; the same has been true, generally to a lesser degree, in most other areas. Indeed, in areas such as Sydney where house prices have increased relatively sharply in recent years, increasing house prices have been more significant in adding to housing loan repayment burdens for new home buyers than have rising interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA> The figures quoted by Senator Bolkus clearly indicate that the most effective assistance any Government could provide to home buyers is to bring about sustainable reductions in interest rates and in the rate of increase in house and land prices, both of which will only occur with a sustained fall in the rate of inflation. Needless to say, this is a central objective of the Government's economic policies.</PARA>

<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I have seen the article referred to by the honourable senator.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian exchange control policy generally does not permit direct loans to non-residents by Australian residents. Proceeds of most exports are required to be received in Australia no later than six months after exportation, but the Government has no detailed knowledge of trade credit provided by Australian residents, other than that insured by Export Finance Insurance Corporation as referred to below. It is understood that the overseas-based offices of Australian banks are involved in some limited degree of lending to Eastern bloc countries. Details of such lending, however, are commercial matters that are generally confidential to the banks concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the operations of EFIC I am advised that as at 30 June 1982 it had outstanding one loan to an Eastern Bloc country under its Export Finance Facility. This facility is given in support of export of Australian capital goods and related services and provides credit of up to a maximum of 10 years. The one loan was to Romania for $1,037,000 of which $933,300 remains to be repaid.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition EFIC has insured normal trade credit on terms up to 180 days from date of shipment. As at 30 June 1982 the estimated outstandings of such credit supported by EFIC totalled approximately $197m made up as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>$'000  USSR  155,271  Romania  1,295  Czechoslovakia  3,489  Bulgaria  nil Hungary  287  East Germany  nil  Poland  36,563</PARA>
<PARA> The only direct involvement of the Australian Government in the above relates to EFIC insurance of exports to Poland of wool, hides and skins (shown above) which the Government has agreed to underwrite under the national interest provisions of the EFIC Act.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to guarantees of repayment, EFIC has advised that the repayment obligations are assumed by State trading organisations or State banks in these countries and consequently no specific guarantees are obtained.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 17 August 1982 (Hansard, page 22) Senator Sibraa asked me, as the Minister representing the Treasurer, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask the Minister whether she is aware of a Sydney tax consultancy service which offers its very large ethnic clientele tax refunds before their income tax returns are even lodged with the Australian Taxation Office in exchange for the clients signing over their income tax refund entitlements to the agency. As a result, the agency is pocketing large sums of money since the true Taxation Office refunds are usually a great deal more than the original sum paid to the unsuspecting clients by the agency. Further, I ask the Minister: What are the powers of the Tax Agents Registration Board in dealing with such an agency? I ask this because I have good reason to believe that the Board has known about this agency's operation for some time but has not done anything about it. Will the Minister agree that the practices mentioned in my question are completely unethical? If so, will the Government take steps to immediately outlaw these exploitive practices?</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to add the following to my answer to the honourable senator's question on 7 August last:</PARA>
<PARA> The registration of tax agents is a matter for the Tax Agents Boards, which are independent bodies located in each State capital. One of the grounds on which an agent's registration may be cancelled is that the agent is guilty of misconduct.</PARA>
<PARA> The practice of discounting income tax refund cheques is known to both the Commissioner of Taxation and the Tax Agents Board in Sydney. It is understood that the practice is confined to a very small number of tax agents whose clients are drawn largely from the ethnic community.</PARA>
<PARA> Although the discounting of refund cheques is considered undesirable, legal advice received by the Australian Taxation Office is to the effect that it is purely a private matter between the agent and the client. However, where a Tax Agents Board receives information that a person is carrying on discounting (or any other aspect of a tax agent's business) in such a manner as to render that person no longer a fit and proper one to be registered as a tax agent, the appropriate action would be taken. Naturally any such action could only be taken on the basis of reliable evidence received by the Board.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 19 August 1982 (Hansard, page 287) Senator Siddons asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to a Press release by the Treasurer, Mr Howard, on 20 January 1982, in which he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I am requesting the Australian Bureau of Statistics to reintroduce the surveys measuring the extent of foreign ownership and control in sectors of the Australian economy that were discontinued in 1978.</PARA>
<PARA> Is it correct that now, eight months after that statement was made, these surveys have not been reintroduced. Is it correct that the Australian Bureau of Statistics has in fact not even received any instructions to reintroduce them? I ask the Minister whether the Treasurer intends to keep to his public undertaking? If so, when does he propose to take appropriate action?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is contained in Press release No. 182, dated 7 September 1982, issued by myself as Acting Treasurer. That statement reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Resumption of Foreign Ownership and Control Statistics</PARA>
<PARA> In January 1982 the Treasurer announced that he had requested the Australian Bureau of Statistics to reintroduce the studies, discontinued in 1978, of the extent of foreign ownership and control in sectors of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA> The Statistician has now advised me that he has examined a number of matters related to the resumption of such studies, including a review of experience with the earlier studies, the views of potential major users of the figures, the range and frequency of possible studies and the most appropriate concepts, definitions and measures to be used. He has also given attention to how to accommodate work on these statistics within the resources available to the ABS and without disrupting other high priority statistics.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of this examination, the ABS is to recommence a program of foreign participation studies. In order to retain simple and objective criteria for classifying companies, the concepts, definitions and measures used for the new series will be similar to those used in previously published statistics of foreign ownership and control. The main change will be that, as far as possible, separate aggregates will be published for the following categories which would otherwise come within the statistical definition of foreign controlled:</PARA>
<PARA> naturalised and naturalising companies;</PARA>
<PARA> joint Australian/foreign controlled enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA> Steps are being taken to staff positions in the Bureau in order to carry out these studies. The first publication, which is planned for release in the second half of 1983, will relate to foreign ownership and control of the mining industry and selected mineral processing industries for the year ended 30 June 1982. Work will also be started on the preparation of foreign participation statistics for other sectors including manufacturing and possibly agricultural industries.</PARA>

<PARA> Can the Minister representing the Minister for Communications explain why advertisements deemed by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to be unsuitable for television viewing can be shown as news items and what further powers the Tribunal has in such situations? Finally, is the Minister aware that it is planned to release the advertisement in question, involving Ronald Biggs, on the cinema circuit?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question, based on advice from the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal considers the advertisement for 'Cafe de Rio' featuring Ronald Biggs to be unacceptable in terms of its Television Program Standards. The Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations agrees with the Tribunal's interpretation and has rejected the advertisement for use on television. As this action created considerable interest it was to be expected that the use of the advertisement in the context of a news item was acceptable on a once only basis. The public, otherwise, would not have been in a position to appreciate the motivation of the Federation and the Tribunal in deciding on the prohibition of the advertisement on television.</PARA>

<PARA> I ask the Minister representing the Acting Attorney-General whether the Treasurer, Mr Howard, announced yesterday that in the past few weeks the Government had received $171,000 from the shareholders of one company that would come within the ambit of fore-shadowed legislation to recover tax avoided through use of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. Are the secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act now to be read as permitting the Treasurer to be acquainted with the details of the discharging of tax liability in one particular case? Has the Attorney-General or the Crown Solicitors given any legal opinion to the Australian Taxation Office or the Treasurer as to the legality of this relevation to the Treasurer of the discharge of a particular tax liability rather than, as hitherto, the aggregating of a number of unnamed cases to reveal some trend or the gravity of a particular problem?</PARA>
<PARA> The Acting Attorney-General has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question without notice:</PARA>
<PARA> I confirm that the Treasurer made a statement along the lines indicated. The answer to the other parts of the question is no. It is not correct to infer from the Treasurer's announcement that the information was given to him in a form that would enable the Treasurer to identify the shareholders who had paid the amount referred to in the announcement or that the information given to the Treasurer was in breach of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act.</PARA>

<PARA> In the event of the Student Assistance (Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill being passed by this Parliament, will a student who repays a student loan after graduation be able to claim either loan repayments or interest payments as income tax deductions?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation has stated that, in the absence of the relevant legislation, it is not possible to express a firm opinion on this question. By way of general comment he stated that, where a student repays a loan after graduation, the question whether he or she will be entitled to an income tax deduction for repayments of principal and interest will be governed by the general deduction provisions of the income tax law. So far as is relevant they provide a deduction for losses and outgoings incurred in gaining or producing assessable income other than losses or outgoings of a capital, private or domestic nature.</PARA>
<PARA> The repayments of the loan would be of a capital nature and, consequently, precluded from deduction. Interest on borrowed moneys qualifies for deduction when the moneys borrowed are used for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income. Under the proposals relating to the Tertiary Student Loans Scheme, the loans are intended for the maintenance of the student and his or her dependants. In these circumstances the interest paid would not qualify for income tax deduction.</PARA>
