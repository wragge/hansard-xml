<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) That US, Australian and allied forces used huge amounts of toxic chemicals for military purposes, such as Agents Orange, Blue and White, in Vietnam during the war there;</PARA>

<PARA> That the continuing high level of tax avoidance and evasion is cause for grave concern for honest Australian taxpayers, and demands stringent and immediate action by the Commonwealth, noting in particular:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The latest estimate by the Australian Taxpayers' Association is that $7,000m a year is being lost in taxation revenue;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. This figure can only continue to rise because of the timid approach by the Government in closing off tax loopholes; and</PARA>

<TITLE>Yugoslavia</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That your petitioners are gravely concerned that the Federal Government of Australia discriminates against Croatian migrants in Australia the target of combined Yugoslav and Australian security operations with the express purpose of discrediting the movement for Croatian independence and statehood, and that in so doing it is aiding and abetting the Yugoslav regime in the sentencing and imprisonment of Croatian intellectuals, students and priests and ordinary people in the thousands, the imprisonment of more than two thousand Albanians as a result of the uprising in Kosovo at the beginning of this year, and the murder by Yugoslav Secret Police of more than 70 Croats in Western Europe in the past few years.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate urge the Government that diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia be called into question and discontinued as a sign of protest, and that Australia ask the United Nations General Assembly to supervise a referendum whereby the constituent nations of the so-called Federation of Yugoslavia might vote on the question of secession.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Church of Mary Queen of Peace Klaipeda, Lithuania was the only church permitted (by the Soviet authorities) to be built in post-war Lithuania.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should say in answering this question that later today, perhaps at the time listed for statements from Ministers, I will make a statement, which Mr Anthony will be making in another place, on the broad terms of the Premiers Conference. As to this particular amount of money, the Government's intention is to act as early as possible. It has decided that it will make this money available throughout the Commonwealth for employment generating projects of its indication. It will seek from the Premiers their views, and also through them local government involvement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Will the Minister for National Development and Energy concede that those charges and prices which are set by the Government should be controlled so that prices are frozen or minimally increased during the next 12 months? In particular, I ask: Should the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting in Vienna on 19 December result in a lowering of the Saudi light crude bench-mark price of $34 a barrel, will he ensure that Australian motorists get the immediate benefit of a lowering of the import parity price for Australian produced oil? If there is no lowering of the bench-mark price at the Vienna meeting, will the Government in any case freeze the price of petrol to motorists insofar as it is within the Government's control?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3215" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon Sir J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has decided that it will take steps within the areas for which it has responsibility, including medical fees and so on, to get restraint. That was part of our announcement yesterday. The Government has indicated, and I have indicated here, that it is its intention to maintain the link with import parity pricing. That means that if the prices were to rise, we would follow that; if the prices were to fall, we would follow that. The Government makes these adjustments on 1 January and 1 July of each year. It would be the Government's intention to continue to make that adjustment on 1 January of next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whereas some quite wild statements have been made by some, including State Premiers, that there is likely to be an 8 cent to 10 cent rise because of the ordinary events of the past, if the normal conditions occur and the $US34 price still maintains as at 1 January, the anticipated increase would be 2 cents to 2 1/2 cents. The extreme estimates are quite wrong. The Government intends to maintain its import parity pricing because it is fundamental to this country's recovery that we should have an energy balance, a petroleum balance. If there were to be a departure from import parity pricing, one could immediately expect that there would be a falling away in oil and gas exploration in this country, and a loss of employment in that regard, but, more importantly for the future, a tremendous increase in our dependence upon imported oil and, therefore, upon foreign exchange. It would be the utmost stupidity to have policies that were ' stop and go', which would destroy the one thing that is going for us.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that import parity pricing has changed the face of Australia's future with regard to oil and gas. Whereas it was very likely that there would be a fall-off in our self-sufficiency from 67 per cent some two years ago to 40 per cent by the end of this decade, and perhaps 20 per cent by the end of the century, now, because we are finding more because of the impact of import parity pricing, we shall almost certainly have a maintenance of that self-sufficiency over this decade. It is too early to predict that fully, but at least there is that reason for optimism. That is an enormous saving and value to Australia. We should do nothing to disturb that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to ask a question concerning the dam on the Franklin River of a Minister who was in the Cabinet discussions on this question when the decision was made-preferably Senator Peter Baume, but, if he was not in the Cabinet discussions, then the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Is the Minister aware of an interview that Mr Anthony, the Acting Prime Minister, gave this morning in which he indicated that the compromise to which he alluded over the Franklin consists of letting the dam and the world heritage listing proceed together? Does not the Minister consider that to indicate that the Federal Government will allow the dam to proceed, only three days after winning the Flinders by-election on a 'no dams' policy and some five days before the World Heritage Committee meets to discuss the South West Tasmania nomination, is to hold the World Heritage Committee in contempt, to treat our nomination as a farce and to bring Australia into international disrepute? Can the Minister indicate how the building of a dam that will flood 133 square kilometres of wilderness, 13,000 hectares, and destroy archaeological sites of irreplaceable value will be achieved while that area is to be preserved? Can the Minister indicate why the Federal Government regarded the Franklin River as an area of international significance in December 1981, when in November 1982 it is prepared to see the area inundated? Can the Minister indicate what proposal the Australian delegation will be putting to the World Heritage Committee in Paris on 13 December-five days hence-now that the Government appears to have done an about-turn on the Franklin River and allowed it to be flooded?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not appropriate to comment in any way on Cabinet discussions, on who was present or on what was said. Senator Chipp, as a person who served in Cabinet, would know that as well as anyone. The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment will be making a statement to the Parliament later this afternoon. That is an appropriate thing for him to do. I do not intend to pre- empt that statement. He will make a statement about the dam. Of course, the dam site represents a part of the area for which listing is being sought. I do not regard it as inappropriate that the Commonwealth should want to continue with the listing. I regard the application and the listing as being of importance. The submission which the Government has sent to Paris to be put before the World Heritage Committee will be covered in the statement by the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think it could be fairly said that the two hottest issues in this country at the moment are the proposed wages freeze and the damming of the Franklin River. Senator Button has asked a question on the former and received no answer from the Leader of the Government. I have just asked a question based on a Press conference-not on a Cabinet meeting-given by Mr Anthony on the steps of Parliament House this morning wherein he stated that it was possible to proceed simultaneously with the World Heritage listing of South West Tasmania and the flooding of the Franklin River. My question was based on that.

In other areas that have been listed on the World Heritage List-Kakadu National Park, for example-it was compatible with the listing to set aside some areas for a particular purpose.

Is it not also a fact that the Government's take from the oil levy is a further $4,000m? Is it fair now to ask where all that money is going? Is it fair to ask, with such substantial support, why the Government has not been able to manage the economy much more effectively than it has? Has the Government now forgotten its intention to pursue and to recover the massive further amounts of money that have been lost to the Treasury through tax avoidance and evasion?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Georges asked his question in five parts. As to the first part of his question, that the deficit is approaching $4 billion, yesterday I made the point that essentially there are three elements to that. The first is the drought which could not be predicted and which is therefore absorbing approximately $360m. I would have thought that no honourable senator here would object to that being an additional expenditure to our previous deficit. Secondly, there has been a more rapid growth in unemployment than had been predicted by any of the departments or by the Government and also the nature of unemployment involving mature adults and married people, pushing up the costs. Thirdly, because of the slowing down of the economy due to overseas influences there has been a fall-off in revenue. So the answer to the first part of the question is yes, the deficit is now considered to be in that region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The answer to the second part of the question as to whether it is a fact that the oil levy is in the order of $4,000m is no. From my recollection, but subject to checking, it is in the order of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion. But I will check that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Billion dollars, yes. I will check that and let the precise figure be known. It is something of that magnitude. Senator Georges asked where that money is going to. I am very happy to say that it is going to such matters as allowing a cut in taxes, as announced recently, from 1 November; a substantial increase in family allowances, as announced in the Budget; an increase in the dependent spouse allowance; a subsidy on housing and a whole variety of new social services and welfare benefits going to the people. So the money that is accruing from the processes of the oil levy is going back to the people in the way of social welfare benefits, education benefits, Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowances and in the extension of benefits generally. Quite clearly, that program was applauded and approved recently in the Flinders by-election. With regard to any suggestion that the deficit reflects bad management, I draw the attention of Senator Georges to the fact that the proposal of the Australian Labor Party was to have a deficit of at least that magnitude. The fact of the matter is that the Government has managed well. It has passed the revenue that it has gained back to the people by way of a large number of benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final part of the question related to pursuing the recovery of revenue lost by way of tax evasion or avoidance. Legislation has been passed through this Parliament. It will be the subject of vigorous action by the Australian Taxation Office. I remind the Senate that this Government, in the course of its seven years in office, has had an unprecedented record in pursuing tax evasion. It will continue to do so. It is mindful of the fact that pay-as-you-earn wage earners should not be asked to bear a burden for others who, by using the cash economy or other devices, try to avoid their fair and just burden.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The labelling of processed foods is really a subject of State and Territory legislation. For that reason the Commonwealth has a limited capacity to take the action recommended by Senator Walters. Of course, the food standards to which the States refer are standards which have been developed by the National Health and Medical Research Council through its Food Standards Committee. This Committee is aware of public concern regarding food labelling. A working party has been formed recently to consider the provision of improved information on labels, including percentage ingredient labelling. The working party report will go to the Council. If it is endorsed, it will go from there to the States and to the Territories to see whether their governments will adopt into legislation the recommendations which are made. It is only in the Australian Capital Territory that the Commonwealth could consider a direct application of any recommendations. We will, of course, take it under consideration in relation to the Australian Capital Territory. It will take some time for the processes I have described to be completed. The advice I have is that after the appropriate consultations have taken place the matter would probably not be finalised for the NH and MRC's consideration until early 1984 at the earliest.</PARA></TALK.START>

But as far as Australia is concerned, what needs to be looked at is the level of profitability of the companies which are seeking to employ people and the level of prices of the commodities which we seek to sell. It is fairly evident that a wages pause would be of assistance. That does not mean that we will drop our wage levels and conditions down to those of countries with which we would not be able to be compared in any terms, but we may be able to have a better relationship between profitability and competitiveness than we will have if we have continuing wage increases, especially at the level of the last year or two.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Construction. I refer to the fact that earlier this year the Government announced that it had decided to implement the recommendations of the Crawford report on the revitalisation of the Australian shipping industry, including the granting of tax concessions and investment allowances for Australian-owned ships. Implicit in this decision was the requirement that overall manpower costs for Australian ships should be reduced to competitive international levels. I ask the Minister: Is it not an obvious fact that total manpower costs are affected not only by crew sizes and pay levels but also by other factors, such as the amount of annual crew leave, overheads such as workers' compensation and the proportion of routine ship maintenance done by the crews? Can the Minister say what progress has been made in each of these areas to bring Australian shipping costs down to competitive international levels?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that the points outlined in the question asked by Senator Hamer in respect of overhead costs are a very important factor in shipping costs in the context of the kind of overseas trade situation that he outlined. I might just draw attention to the fact that obviously Sir John Crawford, being an eminent man, would have recognised that point in taking into account those industrial practices in the preparation of his report. However, the major thrust of his recommendations was to seek a trade-off of manning levels more in keeping with international levels in return for increased opportunities in an expanded participation of Australian flag ships in the overseas trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The package developed following that report was a positive attempt by the Government, in association with the unions and the shipping companies, to make Australian shipping on the whole more competitive. It is a sensible self-help policy which stresses the importance of proper commercial development of shipping based on productivity improvement and, very importantly, improved dispute settling procedural arrangements. It was never expected to produce substantial growth of the Australian industry in the short term but to lay the foundation for long term growth of Australian shipping. While there are other factors affecting crewing costs, including those to which Senator Hamer has referred, it is difficult to make international comparisons of the indirect crewing costs.</PARA>
<PARA> The whole thrust of the Government's revitalisation package is the first real attempt by any government in maritime history in Australia to make Australian shipping more commercially attractive. However, in the current international climate freight rates are falling and, indeed, the number of ships laid up is increasing very significantly. That must be seen as militating against immediate introduction of additional ships in our overseas trade. Hence, much of the immediate incentive to improvements in the areas mentioned by Senator Hamer are perhaps not of as great advantage as might be seen in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA> The Crawford package is based on commercial consideration rejecting cargo reservation. There is no compulsion on shippers to use purely Australian vessels . Despite these very serious short term problems, steps have been taken by the industry to work towards longer term improvements in productivity. That has culminated in the agreement to form a peak council of shipowners and unions. This council will be meeting next week. The council results from Sir John Crawford's recommendations on industry consultations. It is expected to make a significant contribution to achieving improved efficiency in the industry. I am sure that that will include the aspects outlined by Senator Hamer in his question which are most relevant to the particular problems of overseas shipping competitiveness.</PARA>

This freeze comes against the background of a very substantial rise in average real wages over the last year. Indeed, excessive wage increases brought about the inflation which has caused the present situation. There has to be some decline in real wages. It is agreed by all leaders that it is necessary to stop wages rising in order to stop the further disemployment of people and to allow some profitability in industry so that it may employ people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, I did not want to be pedantic. Having got that correction we can proceed to the other matters. I think that was the reason for the interjections. I think it would be fair to say that of all Australian wage earners more than 48 per cent receive less than the average weekly wage. That is the simple fact. Therefore, if the figure that Senator Button has given me is correct, the Commonwealth employees would be slightly better off than the average person in private employment. Of course, another very much more important factor has to be considered. Public servants have permanency of employment whereas the threat outside is the loss of employment. That is not so with Commonwealth public servants. The factor which Senator Button raises was taken into account. However, what we and all Premiers are aiming to do is to place a freeze on all persons, whether in the public or private sectors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no dispute amongst the eight people-the six Premiers, the leader from the Northern Territory and the Acting Prime Minister-that it is desirable to have a wage freeze in the public sector. The only dispute is about the length of time. Therefore, all eight leaders took into account the impact upon all public servants. But they went further than that, and it is important to understand this. All agreed that they would intervene in the appropriate ways in the arbitral tribunals to seek a similar freeze for the private sector. Therefore, it is not just an intention to single out one group in the community. All are involved in this. In one case it would be an intervention collectively of Premiers plus the Commonwealth; in others it would involve their own interventions. But all have agreed that they would take steps in the arbitral bodies to seek to bring about a freeze in the private sector. This is aimed to be across the board; it is aimed to be fair to all Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Jessop rightly draws our attention to the letter in the Advertiser of last Saturday which outlined several things which the Government is undertaking, including counselling of veterans who are claiming problems from herbicide exposure or from the broader experience of having served in the war in Vietnam. I encourage veterans who feel in need of that service to get in touch with either the Department or the counselling service and to take advantage of it. Senator Jessop asked what progress has been made in connection with the scientific studies. I would like to point out that we expect the results of the study on the birth defects of the children of Vietnam veterans which has been undertaken by the Commonwealth Institute of Health to be in the hands of my officers by about the middle of January. That study will then need to be referred to a body of scientific advisers for their review and opinion, which should reach me by the end of that month or, at the very latest, in the earlier part of February. I should therefore be in a position to make some public statement as to the outcome of that very important study by that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second study which is under way concerns mortality amongst Vietnam veterans . That study is reaching an advanced stage of preparation. There has been considerable difficulty in co-ordinating all the activities of various State authorities in this area but we have received a great deal of co-operation from the State governments. We expect to have at least initial results on that very important aspect in the earlier part of 1983, followed by the final results in the middle to latter part of 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> The third study that is being undertaken, and concerning which a great deal of preparatory work has been done, is in relation to the morbidity of Vietnam veterans and the problems arising from various illnesses experienced by them. That study, given the degree of progress that can be made in that area, is in its last stages and I expect to be able to report on it in the earliest part of 1983.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Now that extensive alterations and additions to the Hollywood Repatriation Hospital have been approved and funds allocated, there appears to be a substantial amount of unused ward and operating theatre capacity in the adjacent Queen Elizabeth II Hospital at Shenton Park. I ask: Has consideration been given to the feasibility of the shared use of the existing facilities and whether this would obviate the need for the costly upgrading of the Hollywood Repatriation Hospital? Have there been any discussions with the Western Australian Government and, if so, what has been the result?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of the operating theatres at the Hollywood Repatriation Hospital in Perth has caused considerable difficulty. As I announced during the Budget debate, in the next two years work, to cost $6.5m, will be undertaken on the operating theatres at Hollywood. That work is being accorded a high degree of priority because there is a very real need in the hospital for the theatres. I emphasise that the work to be undertaken includes also the provision of surgical wards and various other facilities that should be made available in that hospital.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Giles has drawn attention to the fact that the hospital is contiguous to the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital and that the question of rationalisation of facilities therefore arises. For some years a committee comprising officers of the Repatriation Department, medical personnel from the Hollywood Repatriation Hospital and representatives of the State Health and Medical Services Department has met in an endeavour to rationalise various services that are available at the Hollywood and Sir Charles Gairdner hospitals. A considerable amount of work, one for the other, is done by the two hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the development being undertaken, the overriding question is what facilities would be available in the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital for patients who would otherwise seek treatment at the Hollywood Repatriation Hospital. That represents a considerable problem. Some 18 months ago, in conjunction with representatives of the State Health and Medical Services Department and the Minister for Health in Western Australia, Mr Ray Young, the question was examined in great detail. It was found that there were in Sir Charles Gairdner insufficient beds for the use of the veterans and that the capital expenditure to which the Federal Government would be committed if it redeveloped the facilities at Sir Charles Gairdner, for their use by veterans, would be greater than would be involved in the development contemplated at Hollywood.</PARA>

I have also seen a statement put out by the Catholic Education Commission and endorsed by Catholic bishops. They reject specifically the two parts of the Australian Labor Party's policy on which it bases its differentiation from the Government's policy. The first point is that the Government believes there should be a basic grant to each child in non- government schools. The Labor Party does not agree.

The Government believes that it must be a percentage of what it costs to educate a child in government schools. The Labor Party says it will do away with that and put in something else. The Catholic bishops and the Catholic Education Commission reject that proposition. So, on the two things that separate our policies, the education authorities in the most needy part of the non-government system have come down firmly on the side of equity and have rejected what is a misjudged, ill-advised, divisive and inequitable proposition from the Labor Party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Where there are appeals against decisions of officers of the Department of Social Security-they are always appeals against a failure to give benefits; we find that, of course people do not appeal against favourable decisions-the decisions are first made the subject of inquiry by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. In cases where the Social Security Appeals Tribunal's view is thought by the Department not to be correct, the matter is first referred to Central Office for consideration. Unfortunately, there is no regular statistical collection which would reveal the length of time taken to process these appeals in the Department's Central Office. There have been periods of delay longer than I would have thought appropriate, or indeed the Department thinks appropriate, but in recent months strenuous steps have been taken to reduce outstanding numbers and the time being taken.</PARA></TALK.START>

I understand that a significantly higher figure was recorded in the Budget for this year, but that may have to be modified depending upon the decision on prices of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and also because of the downturn in output of oil. Tragically, right at this moment, there is a tugboat strike that is causing a loss of almost half of the output from Bass Strait. When that happens, less revenue accrues; we are forced to buy more overseas oil; and less money is, therefore, available to Australian production.

The average period referred to in the answer prepared by my Department was 15.8 weeks. At the time I commented that that figure was somewhat better than I had anticipated and I took this to be a reflection of the efforts being made within my Department since August to improve the processing of appeals.</PARA>
<PARA> However, I am now advised by my Department that this figure was incorrectly calculated, and that the revised figure is approximately 31 weeks for the average processing time between registration of an appeal and the date a recommendation was made by the Queensland Social Security Appeals Tribunal, for medical appeals finalised in the quarter ended 30 September 1982. I very much regret that incorrect information was previously given to the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After weeks of obfuscation and false denials the Government has finally admitted that the Budget deficit will blow out to an all time record of $4 billion. Significantly the admission was made three days after a by-election in Flinders. This is not to say that a deficit of that magnitude per se is wrong. The fault is not in the amount of the deficit but in its structure and the fact that the estimates were falsified in order to deceive the public as to the size of the deficit in the lead-up to a planned general election in December, and subsequently in the lead-up to a real by- election in December. Present conditions justify a deficit of that magnitude, or arguably even higher, providing it is directed towards capital works and the stimulation of economic growth. But instead of a deficit derived from capital works expansion and a stimulation of economic growth this deficit is a function of a sequence of bribes directed to politically sensitive groups and also a function of the falsification of the estimates upon which it was based because the truth had to be hidden from an electorate conditioned over many years by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to believe that increasing deficits were both irresponsible and economically disastrous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 1982 Budget was a political and not an economic document. It conforms to a sequence of such documents. This Government has had no consistent economic strategy since and including the Budget of 1977. Instead of a strategy we have had a series of stunts and pre-election gimmicks. In 1977 the stunt and pre- election gimmick was the fist full of dollars, the tax cuts, followed immediately after the election by tax increases. The stunt in 1980 was the resources boom. Recklessly, Government Ministers talked up the resources boom and thereby touched off the wages explosion, the effect of which they now stand back from in horror as though they were not responsible for it. Of course, that was compounded by the Prime Minister's irresponsible decision to abandon centralised wage fixing in May of 1981 because he thought it was more important to attend the royal wedding in Buckingham Palace. He could not jump quickly enough on to the 707 and he wrecked centralised wage fixing and aggravated the wages explosion that the reckless talking up of the resources boom for the purpose of the 1980 election had already touched off. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the gimmick in 1982 for the election planned in 1982 was the family Budget now being advertised to the public at great expense to the public. There was no general election in 1982, but the fact that the deficit had been deliberately underestimated was withheld from the public until after the Flinders by-election. Of course, there is still no economic strategy from this Government. We have a continuing political strategy, the latest manifestation of which is a wages freeze aimed at a March election. In no other area has the Prime Minister so debased economic debate in this country as on the question of deficits. For opportunistic reasons in 1975 and beyond he created deficit fetishism when, with respect to the deficit in 1975, he asserted:</PARA>
<PARA> We are like a family that has greatly overspent its income. Our house is mortgaged. </PARA>
<PARA>In April 1977, continuing the family budget analogy, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> We all know in our own families that if we spend too much for too long we will discover eventually that we are too much in debt to the bank. We also know that debts can take a long while to pay off. We know that while we are paying off debts we are going to have to give up other things that we would normally want. </PARA>
<PARA>On 7 November 1977, in the run-up to the 1977 election-this is again the political strategy, there was no economic strategy-he said in the House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA> Throughout 1978, starting with the peak period in January-February, there will be a sustained reduction in unemployment . . . The one factor that would prevent that happening would be a return to the mad deficit financing of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA>This is an appropriate time to note that the deficit now admitted by this Government will be the largest ever. In conjunction with the theologians in Treasury and having created deficit fetishism, the Prime Minister then produced deficit dogma, which was often contradicted by the empirical evidence. The dogma incorporated such nostrums as if the deficit is reduced ipso facto inflation will fall; if the deficit is reduced ipso facto interest rates will fall, and, of course, vice versa. Those two nostrums have been flatly contradicted by the statistics ever since 1978. However, they retain a life of their own. The dogma has a life of its own, independent of reality. On Budget night the Opposition knew that the Estimates, from which the deficit was derived, had been falsified and the deficit understated, and we said so at the time. On 20 October I moved to refer the Estimates of receipt and expenditure to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations for examination. We did that for two reasons; because the economy was collapsing at a faster rate than even we had anticipated and because we frankly did not believe what we were being told by the Government. We wanted to hear from Treasury officials, not from Ministers , what the honest Treasury assessment of the position was. In moving that motion to refer the Estimates to the Finance and Government Operations Committee-I stress on 20 October almost eight weeks ago-I said that the deficit would be between $3.2 billion and $3.7 billion. Senator Sir John Carrick said in reply:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh's argument is that there will be a blow-out in expenditure; that there will be something terrible about this blow-out; that there will be a deficit of, on the basis of his calculations-I do not accept the figure-of the order of $3,300m, and that that would be very bad. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Sir John Carrick got the figure wrong, as he gets almost all figures wrong, but still he was within the range that I had quoted. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh says that we should inquire into pay-as-you-earn receipts. How can we, by 28 October, know with any certainty what the trends will be? My advice from the Department of the Treasury is that it is too early to judge, that at this stage no major change is expected. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe that Senator Sir John Carrick was telling the truth when he made that statement. That is why we wanted to get the Treasury officials here, to hear from the Treasury officials-from John Stone or one of his officers-what the Treasury actually believes and not what Ministers falsely asserted. On that day-that is, on 20 October-I gave to the Senate details of expenditure in excess of that to which the Government had admitted at the time of the Budget. Those details included expenditure of between $356m and $600m on drought relief; $300m on unemployment benefit payments; receipt shortfalls from pay-as-you-earn taxpayers of $200m; provisional taxation of $200m; company taxation of $300m; tax recoupment of $100m; health insurance rebate of $100m; and sales tax excise of $50m. The figures given by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in the House of Representatives half an hour ago either corroborated or showed that those estimates which I had given almost eight weeks ago were, as I said at the time, probably conservative. I prepared those estimates literally in a matter of minutes. I know that I have a conceptual grasp of figures and arithmetic qualities immeasurably superior to any of the innumerates who populate the Government benches. But there are numerate people in the Treasury. They must have known and they must have been able to produce, either on 20 October or before that date, as accurate an estimate of the deficit as that presented yesterday by the Treasurer to the Premiers. The Treasury must have known on 20 October that the deficit would blow out to something like $3.5 billion. Senator Sir John Carrick said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before passing from that subject, on the matter of taxation, I note that on 26 August 1975 the present Prime Minister, who was then Leader of the Opposition, condemning the Budget which had just been produced by the then Treasurer, Mr Hayden, on the grounds that it was profligate and the deficit was excessive, among other things said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why should Australian taxpayers support an extra 504 employees in the Taxation Office . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Everyone now knows that there was very good reason for putting more resources into the Australian Taxation Office. There would have been an enormous net gain to revenue because the tax cheats would not have escaped with some of the billions of dollars with which they did escape. The components of the Budget are wrong, of the individual items which have contributed to the deficit blowout are not the types of items which ought to be the components of a deficit Budget in times of deep economic recession. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, there is nothing wrong or irresponsible about a deficit of this size under present economic circumstances when unemployment is running above 8 per cent and is headed for double figures. Deficits of that size and even greater have been consistently produced by the Government of Japan in association with low rates of unemployment and inflation and high rates of economic growth. The fault is not in the aggregate; the fault is in the components of the aggregate and the way in which the public has for so long been deceived about those components and their aggregate effect. For example, the Government appropriated $356m for drought relief. I noted today that the Treasurer is sticking to that figure. I do not believe that is a correct figure. The advice I received from inside the bureaucracy is that the present truthful estimate of the bureacracy is $500m, but we can take it either way. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has said that it will tolerate no blow-out of the deficit for expenditure to generate employment. But it blew out the deficit without any serious thought, by an amount of between $356m and $500m, for drought relief. How much employment will that $500m blowout of the deficit generate? The answer is almost none. There is no limit to this relief and there is nothing to stop millionaires qualifying for assistance under that scheme. Millionaries will qualify to receive a slice of that $500m and there is no limit to the amount that they may receive. This was another enormously costly political stunt which was divorced from any concept of long term economic strategy and produced against the planned horizon of a December election. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest such political stunt is a freeze on wages for Commonwealth employees . There is a quite widespread misconception that Commonwealth employees are fat cats. Some of them are. Among the fattest of all are those of us who sit in this Parliament. But we are not all fat cats. Today I inquired what was the take home pay of a railway fettler at Cook or at any of the other small towns on the Trans -Australia railway line. I was informed that it is $190 a week. I believe that Senator McLaren asked a question about this. I again remind honourable senators that this Government provided $500m-that is, it added $500m to the deficit-for a program which among other things will enable millionaires to make claims on that $500m and imposed no limit to the amount that those millionaires may claim. This Government has now said that the real wages of railway fettlers, which currently stand at $190 a week net, will be reduced by 10 per cent before Christmas 1983. All Commonwealth employees are not fat cats. This latest political stunt was used as a substitute for economic strategy in the run up to an election, which is now planned by the Prime Minister for March. I inform Senator Martyr that I do not believe it will be held, but it is now planned. That illustrates the sorts of inequities which are being imposed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The former member for Flinders has been allowed to grab almost half a million dollars, 95 per cent of it tax free, on his retirement from this Parliament. That is a scandal. Even more scandalous is the fact that should he be survived, on his death, by a spouse-if he has a spouse at the time of his death-the spouse will collect for the rest of her life a penson of $40,000 in 1982 dollars. He has received half a million dollars in cash almost entirely tax free and his spouse will receive $40,000 plus if she outlives him. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon, meanwhile is living it up in Paris at the Crillon Hotel in a room that is costing the taxpayers $410 a day. These are the people who have just frozen for 12 months the money wage of the railway fettler at Cook who gets $190 a week after tax. They have decided that that railway fettler's real wages will be reduced by 10 per cent between now and Christmas next year. They are like a herd of pigs with no sense of responsibility and no economic strategy, just a ferocious determination to hang on to power and keep their long snouts in the public trough. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has brought forward a matter of public importance which refers to the Government's so-called belated acknowledgment of the massive Budget deficit increase. I would like to remind the Senate of statements that have been made since the announcement of the Budget which have given information to the Parliament and to the nation with regard to changes that have arisen since the Budget was introduced. On 16 September a public statement was made concerning the introduction of drought assistance of $356m. That might be called a political stunt by Senator Walsh but I think that those people who will benefit from the drought assistance in one of the worst droughts in Australia's history would not regard it as a political stunt; they would regard it as a matter of necessity and as a matter of extreme importance to them in their very grave situation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh was listened to for as long as we could tolerate it. I think he should listen to me. On 14 October the first announcement was made of a revision to the estimate of the number of unemployed beneficiaries for this year. On 24 November a further revision was announced of the number of unemployment beneficiaries expected in 1982-83. A review of the figures and financial statements of the Government is made in November. That gives the first preliminary estimate. The result of that was received by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and by the Government on 30 November. There is a February review of figures which is more definite. At this stage many of the figures are preliminary figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Estimates at this early stage of the financial year can be uncertain, particularly as the economy is entering a period of flux. But the available indicators suggest that the deficit for 1982-83 could be in the vicinity of $4, 000m. That figure was given yesterday by the Treasurer during the conference with the State Premiers. The growth in the deficit stems principally from a deterioration in the economy which has affected both the receipts and the expenditure of the Commonwealth Budget. Perhaps I can describe some of those in a little more detail later. The current outlook is subject to a deal of uncertainty. The Government is shortly to undertake its normal mid-year review of the Budget outcome, which should provide a better basis for forecasting more accurately the growth of the 1982-83 figures. We have been able to accommodate some of the effects of the downturn in the economy caused by the drought and the effects of the international recession, for example, by introducing drought relief programs. But we are still aware that the significantly enlarged deficit is imposing upward pressure, for example, on interest rates, which rates impinge on prospects for medium term recovery. In discussions with the Premiers on the wages pause the Government outlined the difficulties facing the economy. Some of the statements that were made publicly yesterday arose from that meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> The deterioration in the Budget figures can be given in some detail. As I said, it is due mainly to unexpectedly rapid deterioration in the economy in both receipts and outlays. The figures now given are that the outlays will be $1,343 higher than budgeted. That is 17.1 per cent higher than in 1981-82. One of the main items causing that $1,300m increase is a figure of $603m for unemployment benefit. This figure has arisen from the increase in the forecast of the number of unemployment beneficiaries from 395,000 to 525,000. The increase in the financial figure is also a result of the increase in the average benefit because a higher proportion of the unemployment beneficiaries are adults with family responsibilities. There is the addition of $356m for drought assistance; $52m for natural disaster relief; and $93m for public debt interest to finance the higher deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other side of the Budget, the receipts are $708m lower than budgeted. The Budget receipt figure of $44,685m which is 9.5 per cent higher than the 1981 -82 figure excludes some effects of the wages pause, but the main items in the changes are the lower gross pay-as-you-earn collections of personal income tax, a lower figure of $323m mainly because of the lower earnings and the revision of the average weekly earnings. The average weekly earnings have been revised from 12 per cent to 11 1/2 per cent and also there is the effect of lower employment, a decline by one per cent rather than constant as was assumed at the time of the Budget figures. There are lower other personal income tax collections of $123m which reflect the severity of the drought and the higher proportion of primary producers who are self-assessing. Also there are the delays and the changed scope for the special tax to recover the evaded company and Division 7 tax, a reduction of $155 on the Budget estimate; the lower private consumption and other expenditure showing a reduction in sales tax of $84m; excise duties, excluding oil and liquefied petroleum gas, $170m; Customs duty on imports, $100m ; and increase in excise revenue from crude oil and LPG, $240m. The figures showing those changes have therefore led the Treasurer at the first available opportunity to him to announce that the likely outcome of the 1982-83 Budget is $4,000m. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we ought to keep in perspective the $4,000m as it does arise from the factors that I have just mentioned. That $4,000m is about 2.5 per cent of the gross domestic product. Whilst Senator Walsh likes to call it the largest ever deficit, we ought to remember that the deficit in the year 1975-76 was $3,566m or 4.9 per cent of the gross domestic product as against 2.5 per cent of the gross domestic product for this year, 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> In other countries, the deficit is approaching 5 per cent of the gross domestic product in the United States of America, about 5 1/2 per cent in Japan and about 6 1/2 per cent in Canada. In all countries, an increasing deficit is automatic when economic conditions deteriorate. For instance, welfare expenditure will increase and tax revenue will decrease. I do not think that anyone would suggest that we could control that increase in the deficit by, for instance, cutting down social security assistance or other assistance to individuals or by raising taxes and other charges. Of course, we get the effect of the downturn in the economy and at the same time we get the increase in social welfare expenditure and things of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA> I do want to say that the deficit is being financed in a responsible manner. I think that that is the most important thing that ought to be stressed. The M3, in the target range of 9 per cent to 11 per cent is the figure that was given at Budget time. The financing of this deficit can be undertaken in a responsible way. There is no reason why we should expect any loss of control over the money supply. The funding task will be larger than expected. But we have considerably greater flexibility through the tender system. Our securities have been selling well. Between 1 July 1982 and 10 November 1982 the non-official take-up has been over $3 billion. This compares with $662m in the same period of last year. That is quite a considerable increase in that non-official take-up. The non-bank take -up in the same period was $1,907m compared with $133m last year. The other thing that ought to be kept in mind is that the Budget is only one element in the growth of the money supply. There are also offsets; for example, there are indications that corporate demand is declining and placing less stress on the money supply. </PARA>
<PARA> The money supply growth is well within the Budget target of between 9 per cent and 11 per cent. The end of October money supply figure was 10.2 per cent higher than the October figure in 1981. The crucial factors in what happens to interest rates in Australia are what happens to interest rates overseas and what happens to wage rises and the inflation rate in Australia. I think we could address ourselves to those things very profitably at this time. Senator Walsh said that this Commonwealth deficit is the highest ever. In considering that statement we should look at the percentages of gross domestic product in relation to the Commonwealth Budget deficit for the last 10 years. In 1972-73 it was 1.6 per cent of GDP; in 1974-75 it was 4.1 per cent; in 1975-76 it was 4.9 per cent; it fell to 3.3 per cent the following year and ranged down to 0.4 per cent in 1981- 82. We have estimated that the Budget deficit of $4,000m will be 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned some countries with comparable Budget deficits in the present very severe economic circumstances. There are many comparable countries in the world. I think we ought to consider at this time how a Budget deficit would be financed by the Opposition. I think we need go no further than the Hayden alternative Budget Speech on 24 August this year. Mr Hayden said:</PARA>
<PARA> A Budget deficit could be financed by a net addition to money supply financed by Treasury Bills bought by the Reserve Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Opposition would print more money. Mr Hayden's statement of August this year was that he would print more money, print more Treasury Bills and we would have the consequent effect of that. In relation to the Budget deficit that the ALP would like to see, on 17 August Mr Hayden said:</PARA>
<PARA> We would have aimed at a domestic deficit of the order of $1,000m to $1,500m instead of a surplus. </PARA>
<PARA>If that deficit figure is taken with an overseas deficit of $1,900m, we see that Mr Hayden's deficit in August, without taking into account the circumstances that have occurred in this financial year, would have been in the order of $2, 900m to $3,400m and he would start printing Treasury Bills to fund it. But what size deficit would Mr Hawke like? He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . Budget deficit is talked about as 1 per cent of the gross domestic product as though that's some sort of terrible thing when in fact if you look at the rest of the Western countries with which we're co-operating and the OECD . . . figures that have been published for 1982, the 13 of them, the average is a deficit which is 4 per cent of the gross domestic product. In other words, there would be by the standards of what other countries are trying to do to stimulate their economies there's a hell of a lot more room for this government to take. </PARA>
<PARA>That was what was said by Mr Hawke in an interview on 18 August. If he wants Australia to have a Budget deficit comparable to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average-namely 4 per cent of gross domestic product -he would want a deficit of about $6,600m. We can take our pick of Mr Hayden's figure of $3,400m and Mr Hawke's figure of $6,600m. Senator Walsh is saying that he does not mind having a deficit. If we look at the Budget deficits during the Labor Party's period of office we find that in 1973-74 the Budget deficit was 0. 5 per cent of GDP; as I have said, in 1974-75 it was 4.1 per cent; and in 1975- 76 it was 4.9 per cent. I should point out that 4.9 per cent of GDP in current dollars would imply a deficit of about $8,000m. So, on that basis, Mr Hawke's figure is closer than Mr Hayden's to the Budget deficits of Labor's period of office. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say a couple of things about wages. In the Budget forecast average weekly earnings were set at 12 per cent. That figure has since been revised to 11 1/2 per cent because of slower earnings growth during this financial year. It is difficult to quantify the reduction in average weekly earnings growth. If fully effective it could achieve an outcome as low as 10.5 per cent. The effect of the lower AWE figure and the level of employment down by one per cent instead of being constant as forecast has caused estimates of tax revenue to be revised down by $323m. If average weekly earnigs of the order of 10 1/2 per cent could be achieved this would reduce gross pay-as-you-earn estimates by an additional $ 250m to $300m. Therefore, as a result of the wages pause the deficit could increase by a further $250m to $300m from the PAYE revision. The lagged effects, which are more likely to affect the 1983-84 Budget, need to take into account the respending of wage savings by governments and the subsequent taxation of and expenditure by beneficiaries of respending and some reductions in the numbers receiving the unemployment benefit. But wage effects and average weekly earnings are quite crucial to what will be the PAYE receipts in this Budget and in the Budget of next year when the effects of the wage pause are taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is appropriate to give details of some changes to the Budget-time forecasts. In the Budget gross farm product was expected to decline. It is now expected to decline by around 20 per cent, which is about twice the decline expected at Budget time. I think that reflects the severity and the consequences of the drought. One needs to take very seriously indeed a decline of about 20 per cent in gross farm product and recognise the effect that that has on the general economic climate in this country. Non-farm product is also expected to show a small decline, whereas the figures in the Budget Papers indicated that there would be a no-growth situation. Because of these factors gross domestic product is expected to decline by about 2 per cent, whereas at Budget time it was predicted that there would be no growth. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already quoted some of the main changes to forecasts of expenditure aggregates within the domestic economy. Private business fixed investment is now expected to fall by 15 to 20 per cent. Private consumption expenditure is now expected to show little, if any, growth. Government expenditures are expected to increase strongly, mainly reflecting very sharp increases in capital expenditures by both State and Commonwealth governments. Imports are now expected to decline, whereas the Budget showed no growth, reflecting the weaker domestic economy. I have mentioned average weekly earnings. The level of inflation was forecast at Budget time to be at around 11 per cent and it is expected that there will be little change in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the level of employment is now expected to decline by one per cent or so. I have already given revised figures as to numbers of unemployment beneficiaries. I have stated also that the growth in monetary aggregates is broadly on target. These are the changed circumstances that yesterday led the Treasurer to give the most up-to-date information that he was able to give with regard to the likely outcome of the 1982-83 Budget. Most of the aspects dealt with are of a very serious nature and the Treasurer has provided the reasons the figures have had to be changed. </PARA>
<PARA> At Question Time today a question was asked regarding the sum of $300m that is expected to be realised as a result of the wage pause in the Commonwealth sector . Next week a Bill to appropriate that sum will be introduced. The funds will then be available to be drawn upon month by month as employment-related programs call for expenditure of that nature. The support given yesterday to the wage pause, and its likely result, is significant in terms of the Budget outcome and the economic circumstances in which we live. I believe that support for such action is of crucial importance at this time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Government's belated acknowledgement of the massive increase in the Budget deficit. The history of the 1982-83 Budget is well known to us all. It was an election Budget that was carefully designed to appeal to married couples who are paying off houses and to people who are earning about the average wage. It was superficially a mildly expansionary Budget, but in this case a superficial examination is quite misleading. Many of the Budget figures were subsequently revealed to be such as to remind one of a super ball. So pliable are the Budget figures that this could be called the super ball Budget. The figures just keep on bouncing. They have now bounced right out of court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is obvious that the Budget figures on unemployment were inaccurate when the Budget was brought down. Many economic analyses available at the time showed that in 1982-83 there would be a real decline in gross domestic product, that tax revenues would fall and social expenditure rise. The result is incomprehensible in any other terms than that the Budget figures were designed deliberately to deceive and were offered purely as an election gimmick. It has also become very obvious that the Government seriously miscalculated the extent of the recession. To anyone who has ears and eyes it is very apparent that, unless we are very lucky, a depression looms. It is also very apparent that the Government intends to do nothing constructive about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Back in August, when the Budget was about to be brought down, it was very obvious to me, and should have been to the Government, that the economy had stalled and that if something was not done it would nose-dive. Expenditure was needed then on job-creating projects, projects that would benefit as many as possible and increase the quality of life. It was with this in mind, in the hope that one could stimulate the thinking of the Government to do something constructive about the state of the economy, that after considerable thought I published in great detail an alternative Budget, one that was unashamedly expansionary. It would have stimulated demand, consumption and production back in August. It would have lowered costs and therefore the inflation level. Accordingly, it would have lessened the pressure on interest rates and the need for capital inflow to the country. Measures could have been taken then to restrict the very considerable capital outflow from Australia. Among other things, it would have meant a Budget deficit of some $4 billion, or slightly in excess of 3 per cent of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> In a scurrilous document circulated by the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party, entitled 'Australian Democrats-the dangers of too much power', I am accused of planning the biggest deficit in Australian history. A deficit of the order of $4 billion, such as I then proposed, was, in the words of the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party, a recipe for economic collapse. Yesterday I asked Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle whether she believed that economic collapse was imminent. The senator was then on record as saying that she could not really tell how large the deficit would be but that it would certainly be in excess of $4 billion. Today we have heard a lot about deficits from the Government. It is now talking about deficits as a percentage of gross domestic product. That should have been its approach right from the beginning. We have been told about the size of deficits in countries such as Japan and Canada. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard figures that set out the size of the deficit in countries such as Austria, Japan and West Germany. They show also the deficit in Australia from 1971 through 1981 as a percentage of gross domestic product. </PARA>

<PARA> There is no satisfactory single measure of the economic impact of Budget transactions. The Budget deficit (or surplus) is sometimes taken as a shorthand or summary measure of budgetary impact but its use for this purpose is subject to some important qualifications. The deficit simply indicates the difference in total between outlays and receipts; it cannot adquately reflect the differing economic impacts of the various components of total outlays and receipts, or of changes in those components. The mix of Budget outlays and receipts, as well as their total size, can be very relevant to the assessment of the Budget's overall impact on the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important to recognise, as is pointed out in the next section, that the Budget deficit is only part of the total deficit of the Commonwealth sector.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of their economic effects it is useful to distinguish between domestic and overseas transactions. Government payments made overseas do not add directly to domestic incomes or to the demand for locally produced goods and services, while government receipts from overseas sources increase total receipts without withdrawing purchasing power from the domestic private sector. In the table above overseas transactions have been netted out to arrive at estimates of domestic and overseas deficits (or surpluses). With substantial reductions in the overall deficit in 1979-80 and 1980-81 (after it had been at historically high levels for five years) there was a domestic surplus in 1980-81-the first since 1973-74. A larger domestic surplus is budgeted for in 1981-82. The size of the Budget deficit is of considerable significance for monetary conditions and economic developments generally, as are the transactions by which the overall Budget deficit is financed. Table 7 at the end of this Statement provides a summary of Commonwealth Government Budget Financing Transactions for each year since 1971-72. </PARA>

I find it encouraging that people are looking at figures that take into account the inflationary period we are experiencing, figures that are related to the size of our gross domestic product . Perhaps from now on we can have constructive debate about what the magnitude of the deficit should be. I point out that there is a vast difference between a deficit that is designed to create jobs, to stimulate the economy, and one that occurs very largely because of payments to people who are unemployed. Unfortunately, because of Government failure to act in August of this year, there has been a massive increase in unemployment payments, whereas if the money had been spent a few months ago those who are now receiving unemployment payments could have been given constructive, satisfying work to do-work that would have been of use to the community and a greater satisfaction to the recipients personally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What has the Government proposed? It has proposed a wages freeze. I believe that anybody who considers this answer by the Government to a problem of such magnitude as that which confronts us today will be unable to treat it seriously. The problem is not so much one of containing wage increases; the severe economic conditions we are going through will automatically ensure that we do not have excessive wage increases. The problem is lack of demand. That demand can be found only by the Government putting sufficient money into circulation to ensure that people have the purchasing power to buy the goods and services that our economy is capable of producing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is doing the opposite, now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sentor SIDDONS-Indeed, it is. Governments are not households. We heard reference today to the Government needing to be frugal and to balance its Budget as a good household does. Governments do not have to balance their books. The fact is that the Government is the only place from which money comes. To say that the Government has a deficit is really nonsense. That is essentially saying that the Government owes money to itself. The Government's responsibility is to control the amount of money in circulation. It is obvious from the table of deficits that for the last two years the Government, with its domestic surplus and its very small overall deficit, has been taking money out of circulation. It has been taking money out of circulation through taxation at a greater rate than it has been putting it back into circulation through social benefits and other government payments. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has consistently refused to recognise the historic counter- cyclical role of governments. When the economy is in a boom time, governments should have smaller deficits and even modest surpluses. They should restrict their spending when there is excessive demand. But in bad times they must be prepared to stimulate the economy wisely so that there is a demand from consumers for what the economy is capable of producing. It is inevitable that we turn to the situation that applied in the 1930s. It is frightening, at least to me, to see how many similarities there are between that time and now. It was in the 1930s that governments of the day restricted wage increases. They tightened the money supply and increased taxes. They said that the only way in which inflation could be controlled was by a tight money policy. That is precisely what is happening today. It seems to me that we have only to apply simple common sense. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that Franklin Roosevelt never really accepted the economic theories of Keynes. He has often been credited with pump-priming the American economy back to health. In fact, that was not the case. Roosevelt agreed with the economic orthodoxy of his day but he also wanted to do something about the unprecedented unemployment and the failing banks. For that reason and that reason only he embarked on a vast policy of Federal spending which provided jobs and wages. That is what got the American economy out of the Depression of the 1930s. Surely it is a simple matter of common sense that we must do the same. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats are not opposed to the wages pause as such but we are opposed to it in isolation. A wages pause accompanied by control of imports- control of money going out of the country-and accompanied by an injection of funds into the economy to stimulate both consumption and production is a package that would make sense. Control over imports is often criticised because it is said that it will unfairly benefit local industry and will be inflationary. In this sense a wages freeze certainly would eliminate any dangers of excessive wage demands caused by import controls. The Government now finds itself with a deficit of considerable proportions-about 3 per cent of the gross domestic product-and it has not yet come up with a strategy that will stimulate the economy and create jobs. So it has some very careful thinking to do. Obviously the deficit will increase even further. We are saying that the money available to the Government should be spent with the primary objective of making sure that our unused human resources are used wisely and beneficially. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon the Senate is debating a matter of public importance raised by the Opposition in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's belated acknowledgment of the massive Budget deficit increase.</PARA>
<PARA>Earlier in this debate we heard the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) give a chronological list of announcements detailing the changes that have been made since Budget night. I believe that that list substantially refutes any credibility that this matter of public importance had. I am concerned at the implications and aspersions that the Opposition cast not only on the Ministers of this Government but also on the senior echelons of the Public Service. Not only the Department of the Treasury but also the heads of all government departments and their advisers prepared the very detailed estimates that eventually passed the scrutiny of this Parliament and of this chamber. The Opposition, which includes the Australian Democrats, has echoed an outrageous indignation in this matter, using all the benefits of hindsight. We have heard flippant comments about people being able to do exercises more accurately on the back of an envelope. The Democrats have suggested using increased inflation techniques and increased Budget deficits to overcome the present situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The detailed budgetary processes refute the allegations of shonky figures and alterations by the Government. Let me outline to the Senate the detailed procedures that are necessary before the figures find their final form on Budget night. Firstly, in early January the forward estimates are prepared. These examine trends for the coming three years. The second step is in March and April when the general parameters are outlined. The third step is in about May when discussions take place with the Ministry. Bids are also received in May; that is the fourth step. The fifth step is that new policy proposals are considered in great depth. The Budget Committee meets in June and July and Cabinet then considers the items which have been referred to it by the Budget Committee. So the basic strategy is determined in May and June. All this indicates a very detailed involvement by many people. Many figures and many people from the senior echelons of the Public Service are involved. </PARA>
<PARA> To imply that all these sorts of situations that are now facing the community could have been envisaged at that early stage of the beginning of January this year is something of a falsehood. Indeed, the Opposition is using the benefit of hindsight in proposing this motion. Also, Opposition senators fail to realise that in the figures in 1974-75 when they were in power there was over a 12 per cent difference between the estimate and the outcome; but even acknowledging our present projected $4 billion deficit, the percentage difference between estimate and outcome for this year will be less than 5 per cent. Much of the Opposition's criticism is, therefore, based on a falsehood and a failure to recognise the comparison between these two results. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that there have been difficulties. These have been brought about by five main factors. Firstly, there is the severity of the great Australian drought which has resulted in increased government payments to the agricultural community on the expenditure side as well as a loss of revenue. Secondly, there are the implications of the international recession which has hit Australia very much in a rush. It has resulted in a severe downturn in demand and prices not only for agricultural exports but also for the mining industry and export oriented manufacturing. Thirdly, it would have been hard to envisage the massive wage increases and the associated shorter hours campaign, which had a dramatic effect on many businesses and employment opportunities in those areas. Fourthly, I refer to the unprecedented number of people who have applied for unemployment benefit and social security payments. This has been reflected in the fact that the Government will have to put on an extra 1,800 people to process claims. Fifthly, associated with the international recession there has been a vigorous dumping of goods on the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA> So the net result, inevitably, has been that revenue projections have been down and expenditure projections have been up. Naturally, this has increased the projected deficit. But as the Minister for Finance mentioned, the matter is still very much under control. The Government must recognise the need to be able to fund its services but at the same time to get maximum dollar value into the pockets of taxpayers. Australia is still very much a high personal income tax country. In the long term, there is a need to review the tax mix. It may not be entirely inappropriate to consider an appropriately structured form of capital gains tax, provided that there is an exemption of the family home. </PARA>
<PARA> We must still seek to create opportunities for people to invest. We must provide the right environment for people to work and an incentive to work and to work offered overtime. At the same time, however, we recognise that a post- Budget problem exists which requires the co-operation of all sectors, because the Federal Government cannot do it alone. Yesterday, at the Premiers Conference , we saw a basis for a good co-operative approach. It reflected the typical Australian characteristic of trying to help one's mate when in distress. We have recognised that these are hard times. I believe that these ideals were manifested earlier at Gallipoli. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been estimated that savings from the wage pause affecting the Commonwealth and the States could be $1,000m. If extended to the private sector the figure would increase to $3,000m. Although in the national interest, yesterday's conference did not achieve all that the Government hoped for but we recognise that it went a very long way. Certainly the general thrust has been put into place. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee ) has the responsibility of introducing appropriate legislation into Parliament next week involving a wage pause. That will affect members of parliament, judges and public servants. It is a recognition of the need at present to batten down the hatches at a time of not only domestic but also international difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA> Wage increases have had a significant effect on employment in Australia. Last year the average increase was 17 per cent, whereas the consumer price index increase was 12 per cent-a net gain to wages of 5 per cent. Because of that and other factors, Australia's competitive position has slipped. Many people are still advocating a measure of price control, or perhaps price surveillance. Price control gives tremendous benefits to importers, where goods would not be subject to price controls. Secondly, there are difficulties with primary industries with varying supply and demand differences. Thirdly, there is a problem of the adequacy of recovery of prices in those manufacturing areas where manufacturers are currently unable to recover full costs. In other words, we would be making those manufacturers and employers worse off and we would be putting them in a position in which they would shed labour rather than increase labour with price controls. At present, the States hold the power over prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The savings which will be gained from this wages pause will be used for work- related activities. The States will nominate those activities, but the Commonwealth will control the money. It is expected that this could be released as early as within a couple of months. What will be the result? Employees can go on their Christmas vacation in the knowledge that their jobs will be much more secure than they would be without a wage pause. I believe that there is an increasing awareness on the shop floor, out on the farm and in the typing pool that wage increases are visibly causing a reduction in employment in people's own working environments. The thought at the back of their minds is 'My mate's job or my neighbour's job today may be mine tomorrow'. All too often when industry closes its doors they are seldom reopened, and in decentralised areas there is great social cost to the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Budget was to pass on benefits to people-this is an aspect that the Opposition has failed to acknowledge-especially in the form of tax cuts , increased family allowances, mortgage interest relief, increased educational allowances, increased payments to the handicapped, rent assistance, pharmaceutical benefits to low income earners, and increased numbers entitled to fringe benefits. But recognising the current problems, the Government has further acted to assist families-for example, with the six weeks extra family benefit for school leavers to cover the gap between leaving school and the normal time for receipt of unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> From the international point of view, there is some evidence that Australia is being used as a dumping ground for marginally costed and subsidised goods. But our Government is taking action to ensure the effectiveness of fast-track anti- dumping procedures to enable the taking of securities. We have also responded by increased short-term protection measures. I believe that consideration is being given to the return of some form of government preference in government purchasing, and that government departments may have to pay duty when purchasing imported goods. All these measures should dramatically assist local industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Consideration is also being given to preference for Australian industry in allocating overseas aid and in seeking an extra $25m for the Australian Industry Development Corporation. We have a whole range of measures designed to overcome the worst problems of the recession that is affecting Australia at the moment. We not only have the policies but also are enacting them. We acknowledge the difficulties. We are not hiding them irresponsibly as was alleged in this debate . I believe we have the answers. The Australian Democrats seek to put Australia into hock in perpetuity following a line of Third World country economic thinking. Long term one must seek to balance one's budget. I believe that our Government is acting responsibly. I now move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to make a statement, it being the statement by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) on the special Premiers Conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government called yesterday's special Premiers Conference to achieve concerted action by all governments in Australia to address the deteriorating employment situation. The Commonwealth put to the Premiers and the Chief Minister a set of proposals around which it hoped to achieve agreement, the central thrust of which was to put in place the widest and most effective pause possible in wages for the next 12 months throughout the Australian economy , as a means of saving jobs. Full agreement was not reached on the proposals put by the Commonwealth. That fact, however, should not obscure the great measure of agreement which was achieved, and its significance. The conference produced an unprecedented agreement among eight governments to effect a pause in wages in the public sector and through concerted action before tribunals and by other means to achieve a similar pause in the private sector. I shall enumerate the points of agreement in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth was seeking agreement on a 12 months' pause in wages. The Premiers of Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory will be fully supporting the Commonwealth Government in this respect. The Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia will be seeking a six months' pause in wages. I do not rule out that, depending on the state of the Australian economy during next year, the Premiers of the latter three States may well extend the action they are taking to 12 months. That is for the future, however. What must not be overlooked is that all eight governments have agreed on effective action to secure a pause in wages throughout the economy of at least six months' duration. That is the unprecedented central aspect of the agreement reached yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the governments represented at the meeting here in Canberra yesterday reached such an historic agreement is a reflection of the seriousness of the economic situation we are now facing. I think we have all been surprised at the suddenness with which the international recession finally impacted on Australia. It may have been late in coming to Australia, but there is no doubting now that our domestic economic performance is being affected by-</PARA>
<PARA>reduced demand for our exports;</PARA>
<PARA>rock-bottom commodity prices which are not only affecting the profitability of our resources sector, but have also contributed to the drying up of new resource investment plans;</PARA>
<PARA>increased import competition as overseas suppliers search for market opportunities wherever they can find them. </PARA>
<PARA>All of this, of course, is being exacerbated by the worst drought in memory. In those circumstances it will become increasingly a matter of absolute survival for our businesses to maintain and improve their competitive position. Unfortunately, as we all know only too well, domestic wage developments have been working in the opposite direction. Over the year to the September quarter average weekly ordinary time earnings rose by about 17 per cent, and this does not take account of reductions in standard hours. Real wages rose by about 5 per cent; while productivity was virtually unchanged. With domestic demand weak, the world economy in recession and an increasingly difficult world trading environment, many Australian businesses have not been able to pass on these increases in wage costs. As a result, profits have fallen by about 13 per cent over the last year and retrenchments have multiplied. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, excessive wage increases have worsened our economic problems; they have weakened our competitiveness, contributed directly to unemployment, and weakened demand. They have meant an increase in the real incomes of those in employment, while their less fortunate fellows have lost their jobs. It was against that background that all those present at the conference yesterday approached the discussions in a constructive and co-operative spirit. Each had his own perspective on the problems, but each was seeking constructively to find a consensus on urgent and effective measures to deal with the worsening employment situation. Specifically, this is what was agreed:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government will legislate for a 12 months' pause in wages and in reductions in standard working hours in its own employment. There should be no 'catch-up' at the end of the wages pause to recoup wages which might have been forgone in the course of the pause. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland, Western Australian, Tasmanian and Northern Territory governments will effect a similar 12 months' pause in wages and in reductions in standard working hours in their own employment, by legislation as necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian governments will effect a six months' pause in wages and in reductions in standard working hours in their own employment. </PARA>
<PARA> To achieve the widest and most effective pause in wages throughout the private sector, the Commonwealth, Queensland, Western Australian, Northern Territory and Tasmanian governments will approach the arbitral tribunals seeking a 12 months' pause in award wages and in standard working hours in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian governments are expected to intervene alongside the other five governments by supporting a six months' pause . The Commonwealth Government will be seeking the support of the Peak Councils for a 12 months' pause in wages. The Government will be meeting the Confederation of Australian Industry later today and has sought an urgent meeting with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. </PARA>
<PARA> The wages pause is to take effect as soon as possible, with exceptions restricted to processing of applications for those few groups not yet in receipt of a wage increase in the most recent 'community wage round'. </PARA>
<PARA> Legislation to give effect to the wages pause will be introduced as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Resumption of wage increases after the end of the pause would depend on restoration of capacity to pay, which would be determined by appropriate Commonwealth and State tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA> All governments will urge a pause in over-award payments. </PARA>
<PARA> Professional incomes funded from the Commonwealth Budget will be included in the pause by legislation where necessary. The States are expected to take similar action, where professional incomes are funded from their Budgets. </PARA>
<PARA> All governments will seek commitments from professional bodies for a pause in professional fees. </PARA>
<PARA> All governments will urge maximum restraint in other non-wage incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Subject to all legislation to effect the wages pause and achieve the necessary savings being passed, the savings to the Commonwealth Budget achieved through the wages pause, expected to be some $300m, would be expended on employment- related projects of the Commonwealth's nomination throughout Australia, projects of high labour content and high Australian content, capable of being implemented quickly. Special consideration will be given to projects in areas of high unemployment within States. The Commonwealth will be consulting all the States and the Northern Territory to identify such projects. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that State governments participate in the wages pause there would be some savings to their Budgets which they might use in similar activities. Alternatively, they would be relieved of the need to increase taxes or charges or to reduce services. </PARA>
<PARA> Semi-government and local authorities are to use their savings from a wages pause in additional employment-related activities or, as appropriate, to defer increases in charges or reduce borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government will be taking a range of other measures to help Australian businesses to weather the present economic difficulties, and to maintain their employment. These measures include a 'Buy Australian' campaign, reintroduction of preference for Australian goods in government purchasing, together with increased availability of finance through the Commonwealth Development Bank and the Australian Industry Development Corporation and acceleration of payments to businesses under various existing assistance schemes . We are also acting to ensure that Australian businesses have effective recourse to anti-dumping action against unfairly priced imports. The Government has also considered the proposals being advanced to divert some of the funds spent on the unemployment benefit to enable the unemployed to work on projects of value to local communities. Apart from questions of cost and effectiveness, such proposals may simply replace jobs. They therefore require careful consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the seriousness of the unemployment problem, the Commonwealth has indicated to the Premiers that it will introduce a community projects program for a trial period of 12 months. Letters will be sent to State governments shortly outlining specific guidelines for the trial and inviting their nomination of projects. The Commonwealth would provide grants through the States for local bodies to undertake specific additional projects using part time labour recruited from the longer-term unemployed. These grants would cover employment at casual award wages for a period necessary to earn an equivalent of benefit plus $35 a week. Each project could run for up to 12 months and employ up to 50 people. As a guide the Commonwealth would be willing to provide funds equal to the benefit rates involved plus an amount of $2m to cover the $35 a week supplement. This would enable trial projects involving about 1,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures I have just outlined constitute a vigorous response to the serious employment problems facing the Australian community. They are not a total cure and we still have a difficult job ahead of us. But the unprecedented nature of the agreement struck among the eight governments represented at yesterday's meeting shows how seriously the problems are viewed by governments. The mood among ordinary Australians throughout the community is equally realistic. There is a strong sense throughout the country that those who have jobs should now make some sacrifice to help their fellows who either do not have jobs or whose jobs are at risk. It is now up to all of us to join in this consensus and give our strongest support to making the program work. I commend the statement to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition believes that this is a statement which deserves consideration. We believe that we need a proper debate on this matter in this place after we have taken note of the many proposals which have been put forward in this statement. We also think it is important that we study this statement and consult some of our State colleagues and await the reaction of other State colleagues because in the time since the Premiers Conference it has become quite clear that some of the claims made in this statement, both by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) and by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) in another place, are not true. </PARA>
<PARA> I will take only one example because I do not want to take up the time of the Senate. On several occasions we heard the Leader of the Government in the Senate say in his statement that there is unprecedented agreement between the States as to what should be done and what was the result of the Conference yesterday. Yet anyone who listened to the radio this morning and at lunch time, or who read the newspapers today, knows that quite clearly there is no such agreement. The Premier of Queensland, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, announced that he will look at a 12- month wage freeze but that in fact, in six months he wants to review the whole thing because of his doubts as to its effectiveness. We had another Premier saying that he made no such agreement and that he in fact will make no such agreement until he has consulted trade union members and business people in his State. We have no details in this statement of the employment project which was mentioned at the very end by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. All these matters have to be studied by the Opposition. We hope that the Government will agree and provide a time for a proper debate on this most important subject .

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The statement we have just heard from the Government is a most important one, deserving of thorough consideration and investigation. Whether the actions that have been taken by the Government over the last two weeks or more turn out to be a political stunt or part of a practical solution only history will tell. One thing is certain: The proposal will not work unless based on fact, accompanied by general incomes and prices restraint and directed towards job preservation and creation. Even so, it is doubtful whether this prescription is in fact economically indicated. I will, of course, advert to a number of the supporting arguments in relation to the statements I have just made. Let me just mark one particular aspect. It must be recognised that the problem at present is quantitatively different from the problem that emerged in late 1973. At that stage we had a combination of demand- push and cost-push inflation. At present, if nothing else, we certainly do not have demand-push inflation. Therefore, one wonders whether the medicine that has been prescribed for the current disease is appropriate to that disease or whether it would have been more appropriate for the disease that we experienced as a nation in 1973 and 1974. However, that is a matter which could be developed at a later stage. It is not appropriate for me, having regard to the fact that I am speaking by leave, to develop it at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that for far too long Australia has allowed costs and prices to escalate with consequent erosion of the value of money. It is my intention, at the stage when this statement is to receive time for a substantial debate in this chamber, to amplify the measures which would be more appropriate, in my mind, than the simple solution that is being suggested at this time. I do not deny that central to the trade union movement's wage fixing policy ought to be the preservation of jobs. However, it is important to have practical solutions based on facts. Too often the Government has pointed out that whilst prices as measured by the consumer price index have risen by 12.3 per cent in the past 12 months, average weekly earnings have risen by 16.9 per cent to $335 a week. That sort of background is implicit in the statement made by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick). The figure of $335 a week includes earnings of highly paid executives and, indeed, of highly paid politicians. But most workers, including workers in my State, are receiving a weekly income nearer the average award rate which is now $229 a week. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not. I have regard to what the honourable senator said in a debate about a fortnight ago on this question. So the typical wage earner has not had a wage increase which has kept pace over a period with inflation. Therefore, one must wonder whether the prescription that is being applied at the moment should be accepted as a total prescription rather than as part of a package. The thing that concerns me about the statement we have in front of us is that it fails to identify the jobs that are supposed to be created by the amount of money that the Government will have saved by imposing a wage freeze on its employees. It fails to say how this will affect, for example, young women who seek to enter the paid work force. I notice that there is a preoccupation with works programs. One of the problems with works programs is that they do not provide job opportunities for young girls seeking employment. This statement does not say that there will be an inquiry into the structure of the work force. After all, for many years now I have suggested that it is time that we had a look at the structure of the work force to see who is in the paid work force at present who wants to come out of the paid work force but who cannot do so through economic circumstances. However, those issues need to be considered at a later stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I give notice now that I will seek to move an amendment to the legislation or ensure in some other way that the Government audits expenditure on its works or job creation programs so that once every sitting week a report is made in the Parliament as to where the money is going. I wish to flag that intent now so as to ensure that the Parliament and the people of Australia know the precise effect on employment opportunities of the Government's proposals. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to inform the Senate of the Government's intentions regarding South West Tasmania. The Government reaffirms its wish that the Western Tasmania Wilderness National Parks be inscribed on the World Heritage List along with the other nomination of Lord Howe Island. If these nominations are accepted by the World Heritage Committee, these areas will join the Kakadu National Park, the Great Barrier Reef and the Willandra Lakes Region on the World Heritage List.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators would be aware that the World Heritage Committee is meeting in Paris commencing 13 December. Professor Ralph Slatyer, the former Australian Ambassador to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation and the outgoing Chairman of the World Heritage Committee, will lead the Australian delegation. Professor Slatyer will be assisted by Dr D. F. McMichael, Secretary, Department of Home Affairs and Environment, Mr Max Bourke, Director of the Australian Heritage Commission and Mr Ernst Willheim of the Attorney-General's Department. Additionally, the Government, in response to the request by the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Gray, has issued an invitation for the Tasmanian Government to be represented in the delegation subject to the conditions which normally apply to State representatives on Australian Government delegations. For the information of honourable senators, it is the practice at meetings of the World Heritage Committee for the nominating country to respond only to questions put by the Committee. Notwithstanding this limitation on participation in the discussions on the nomination, I hope the invitation to Tasmania will be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has provided to the Bureau of the World Heritage Committee the additional information sought on the nomination of the Western Tasmania Wilderness National Parks for inscription on the World Heritage List. The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh), whom I represent, gave Professor Slatyer this morning, just before his departure for Paris, the Government's response which he will deliver to the Bureau prior to the meeting of the World Heritage Committee. In responding to the request the Government noted that the Bureau has recommended the inscription on the World Heritage List of the Western Tasmania Wilderness National Parks. I should like to confirm to the Senate the Government's firm belief in the international importance of this area and its outstanding biological and cultural qualities which have been recognised by its inclusion on the Register of the National Estate. Here I would make special reference to the archaeological sites, the Huon pine habitat, the temperate rainforest and the other unique features of this area. The Commonwealth Government has co-operated with the Tasmanian Government over a number of years in documenting the natural resources of the area as a basis for future planning and management. The Commonwealth looks to continuing this co- operative approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Towards this end the Government stands by its commitment to provide financial and other assistance in the establishment and management of a national park of world significance which includes a substantial wilderness component. Nonetheless, the Government has to face facts. The Premier of Tasmania has stated firmly and with the backing of legislation that the proposed dam is to proceed. Accordingly, the Government has indicated to the World Heritage Committee that the Tasmanian Government is constructing a hydroelectric power scheme in the nominated area and that the Commonwealth has been and is discussing the scheme with the Tasmanian Government with a view to minimising the damage that the dam might cause. The Government does not intend to intervene in the construction of the dam. The Government in its discussion with the Tasmanian Government will make it clear that it will back its concern for these features with money, manpower and technical resources. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to inform the Senate that the Tasmanian Government has agreed that the Commonwealth will be consulted in the development of the management plan for the area. The mechanism for consultation is to be the subject of discussions with the Tasmanian Government. Whilst Fraser Cave and other caves of archaeological significance will be flooded by the dam, I am advised by Mr McVeigh that every endeavour will be made to preserve this important part of our heritage. The Senate will understand that the position taken by the Government will be welcomed by parts of the community and opposed by others. The expressions of concern have been clear and widespread. Nevertheless, the Government has to strike a balance between competing intentions. Confrontation between the Commonwealth and the States and between individuals in the community is not the road to prosperity, development or the conservation of our heritage. The Government believes, on balance, that its decision is the right one and seeks from the community support in its continuing discussions with the Tasmanian Government. Finally, Mr McVeigh joins with the Premier of Tasmania in exhorting those who oppose the construction of the dam not physically to interfere with construction works. Mr McVeigh makes the comment that he abhors violence, as I am sure do all in the Senate. Nothing can be gained from violent confrontation. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>I must express on behalf of the Opposition our deepest disappointment with the statement which the Government has just put down. It is one of the most contradictory, hypocritical statements that I have heard in this place. On the one hand the Government insists that it will maintain the nomination of the South West Tasmania region for the World Heritage List. It acknowledges all the reasons why this area should be protected and the reasons that make this area unique. It does not attempt to disagree with the evidence to the effect that in many respects this area is irreplaceable. On the other hand it concludes that the Government does not intend to intervene in the construction of the dam. It is incomprehensible to the Opposition and I think it will be incomprehensible to the general public that the Government has adopted this contradictory position. Either the South West Tasmania region is important and unique enough and is a significant enough possession of the human race to deserve its nomination for the World Heritage List or it is not. If it is-the Government agrees that it is and restates that it is-why is the Government unprepared to take the necessary steps to protect it?</PARA>
<PARA> The hypocrisy of the statement is really quite unbelievable. Let us take the particular reference to the caves which are of enormous archaeological significance. I remind honourable senators that when I had an opportunity to speak in support of the Australian Democrats' Bill to protect the South West Tasmania region I referred to the evidence that was given to the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania which inquired into this matter by pre- historians such as Dr Rhys Jones and Professor Mulvaney from the Australian National University. I quoted at some length the evidence they gave because I believed it was, in a way, the most gripping and the most important evidence that had come before that Committee. Their comments are recorded in Hansard, but briefly what they said was that the ancient nature of these caves and the information which they contain about Aboriginal Tasmanians was of outstanding significance to our understanding of the development of the human race. I would say that, particularly in the light of the treatment of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people by the European colonisers, we have an even more overwhelming responsibility to protect that information than we would have had if the Tasmanian people had not been destroyed in the way they were by the invasion. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragic irony of what the Government is now proposing to allow to happen has not escaped pre-historians or Aboriginal people. Attention has been drawn to the irony of, first of all, the almost complete genocide which was carried out in Tasmania. Secondly, now that there has been this discovery of the caves which contain the early history of those people who were subjected to genocide we seem to be prepared to sit back to enable that information, that part of the history of the Aboriginal race and the history of humankind, to be wiped out. That is a tragic irony which the Opposition finds intolerable. I remind honourable senators that this is very important evidence because it was not available when the Gordon-below-Franklin dam was first proposed. We believe it would be proper for both governments involved to review their situation and attitude to the damming proposal on the basis of the new evidence which was revealed to the Senate Committee. I do not know what the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) meant when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that whilst Fraser Cave and other caves of archaeological significance will be flooded by the dam, I am advised by Mr McVeigh that every endeavour will be made to preserve this important part of our heritage. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, that is a statement of complete self-contradiction and hypocrisy. The significance of the area is acknowledged, as is the importance of the preservation of this part of our heritage; yet the damming will go ahead. How can the heritage possibly be protected if the damming is to proceed?</PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Opposition I express our complete disappointment with the Government's failure to look at the alternative package which we have proposed for the economic development of Tasmania. As I said when I spoke on this topic recently, the Federal Australian Labor Party is very sympathetic-extremely sympathetic-to the economic problems faced by Tasmanians. We are all too aware of the unemployment situation in Tasmania. We are all too aware of the collapse of a number of industries-the textile industry, the mining industry and so on. We are not unsympathetic to the pressures on the Tasmanian Government to enter into activities which will create employment and which will start to bring some economic growth. But we do not believe-along with the Senate Select Committee, I might add-that the proposed dam is the economic solution to Tasmania's problems. We believe that a whole range of other economic measures which have been outlined a number of times recently by Senators including me, would be a much more effective form of job generation for the State of Tasmania, which would have a much more stable future than the building of a dam-which, after all, is a one-off thing in terms of employment-and which would provide a great deal more employment across the board for a range of people who are unemployed, not just the people who can work in the construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise that many honourable senators wish to comment on this statement because it has come as such a shock. It is an abrogation of Federal responsibility in a vital area. I believe the Federal Government has taken an extremely shortsighted approach to this problem. It is a complex problem. As I have said, the economic problems in Tasmania are great and cannot be solved easily. But the Federal Government's hypocrisy in, on the one hand, recommending the inclusion of the South West Tasmania region on the World Heritage List and on the other hand, refusing to stop the destruction of that region must be condemned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with Senator Ryan and the Australian Labor Party in expressing the Australian Democrats' deep shock, dismay, and devastation at this most incredible decision of the Fraser Government-one might say the currently National Party-led Fraser Government. I have a personal feeling of disappointment because of my personal commitment to this cause which goes back three or four years, including rafting down the Franklin River. I am dismayed at the hypocrisy in the document which was referred to by Senator Ryan, namely, that the Government intends to proceed with the listing of the area at an international meeting but then to allow a huge hunk of it to be covered by water. Why did the Government not have the guts if it wanted to say 'Dam the Franklin' to do it and then cancel the application for listing on the World Heritage List? Why does not the Government show some guts in these sorts of matters instead of being an absolute hypocrite. It is not just making itself a hypocrite, it is making all Australians hypocrites before a world forum on Monday when application is made for listing. That is what the Government has done by its action. I do not know why--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Peter Baume is describing himself with utter perfection when he uses the word 'sham'. At least he has the grace to recognise his own hypocrisy in presenting this particular document. This statement is hypocritical not only because of its decision but also because of its cynical timing. Only three days ago at almost every polling booth in Flinders on hoardings the slogans appeared:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 'For an effective vote for no dams vote 1 Peter Reith'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Liberal Party secretariat was responsible for these slogans yet, while they were erecting those signs, the Liberal members of the Cabinet knew damn well that a decision had been made to dam the River Franklin and allow it to be gone.</PARA>
<PARA> But even worse than that political hypocrisy, that home town hypocrisy, to win Flinders by lies, be deceit, and by distortions-let that go-is the fact that the Government made this decision just five days before the World Heritage Committee meets in Paris to discuss South West Tasmania's nomination. This holds the World Heritage Committee in contempt. It treats our nomination as a farce and will bring Australia into international disrepute. I should like to quote what the Australian Heritage Commission has had to say. Does any Liberal opposite say that the Commission comprises a group of people who are rampant communists or rampant left wing militants? I would have thought not but what it said is that this decision will make Australia the laughing stock of the world at the meeting in Paris next week. That is a comment by the Australian Heritage Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposition that Senator Peter Baume has put to us this afternoon is that Australia is nominating an area for listing on the World Heritage List, namely, the South West wilderness of Tasmania. Why are we doing that? We nominated it because the Liberal Government believed in November 1981 that it had international geographic values, cultural values, historical, sociological and aesthetic values. That is why we nominated it in November 1981. The Government says: 'We have a duty to protect the area under Article 4 of the international World Heritage Convention. We pledge that we will do everything in our power to the utmost of our resources to protect the area that we nominate'. Five days before the Committee is due to sit the Government says that it will allow some barbarian to plunder the area. Thirteen thousand hectares of the area we have nominated will be submerged under water, water diverted by a State Government in Tasmania. That action is now approved by this Government which has the effrontery, the gall, to go to Paris to present a case for listing. I would not be surprised if the Committee just threw out Australia's representatives on Monday of next week. The Committee would be perfectly entitled to do so. We are not talking about a little backwater. We are talking about an area as important-</PARA>

We are talking about the South West Tasmanian wilderness which has been nominated, along with Lord Howe Island, for listing on the World Heritage List. The only other Australian areas presently listed are the Great Barrier Reef, the Kakadu National Park and the Willandra Lakes region. The South West Tasmanian wilderness is in that league for its uniqueness, its beauty, and its historical and sociological importance. That is how important this proposition is. Yet, this Government is asking us to accept that we will proceed with the listing and simultaneously ask Dr McMichael to say: 'Look, we have asked you to list this but just cut out 13,000 hectares which are going to be flooded forever'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The Government does not intend to intervene in the construction of the dam. </PARA>
<PARA>This hypocrisy has only to be stated to be understood. We can draw an analogy if we roll the clock back a few years to when Dr McMichael was in Paris at a meeting of the World Heritage Committee before the Great Barrier Reef was listed . We would have had the same position then if Dr McMichael, on behalf of Australia, had said: 'We, Australia, nominate the Great Barrier Reef for listing but we must tell you something before you make your decision. We have leased a portion of the Barrier Reef to a multinational oil company to explore for oil. Now will you please go ahead and list it?' The analogy is perfect and total. Yet that is the proposition that Australia is putting now. The Government statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In responding to the request the Government noted that the Bureau has recommended the inscription on the World Heritage List of the Western Tasmania Wilderness National Parks. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA> I should like to confirm to the House the Government's firm belief in the international importance of this area and its outstanding biological and cultural qualities which have been recognised by its inclusion on the Register of the National Estate. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is even without the shame to nominate some of the area's qualities. The Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA> Here I would make special reference to the archaeological sites, the Huon Pine habitat, the temperate rainforest and the other unique features of this area. </PARA>
<PARA>Then there follows the classic statement of them all by Senator Baume, the Minister for Education:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ah! I note the intellectual capacity of Senator Harradine, the paid sycophant of the Liberal Party. He interjects: 'Haven't you heard of excavation?' I would have thought that Senator Harradine would be more original than that, that he would have suggested that we put a glass cage around the cave . I would have thought at least that that was a proposition that was worthy of consideration, but Senator Harradine says that we should excavate it. I will treat Senator Harradine with the utter contempt that he truly deserves. What a statement to make! I appeal to all members of the Senate, except the paid sycophant, to whom I have just referred. Is the Government foolish enough to believe that this is a statement that can be comprehended: That whilst the Fraser Cave and other caves of archaeological significance will be flooded, the Minister assures the House that every endeavour will be made to preserve this important part of our heritage? What the Minister's statement-he has the shame to use the word 'sham'-does not state is that the evidence before the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania was that this could be, perchance, the most important archaeological discovery ever in the southern hemisphere, and yet what will we do? We will put 13,000 hectares under water. This particular cave, named ironically enough after the Prime Minister of Australia, will be flooded. It shows human habitation of 20,000 years ago. To my knowledge it is the only such cave in the southern hemisphere that can link important research into that era with research being conducted in the northern hemisphere. The Prime Minister himself has received representations from a score or more of world renowned archaeologists, pleading with him not to flood the Fraser Cave. I am sure interested people will take a great deal of heart from the interjection from behind me that it is all right, we should not worry, that we can take out the cave piece of dirt by piece of dirt. I do not know whether the interjector would nominate a spot where it could be resurrected after it has been taken out of the Franklin River. I repeat that the building of this dam will flood 133 square kilometres of wilderness-13,300 hectares-and destroy those archaeological sites of irreplaceable value. With such a proposition, how can that area be preserved? Why did the Federal Government regard the Franklin River as an area of international significance in December 1981, to the extent of nominating it for the World Heritage List while in December 1982 it makes a decision to allow it to be dammed? I quote a comment by a person I admire enormously, Mr George Pizzey, the naturalist who writes for the Melbourne Herald. On 2 December he stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All this lost forever to produce 180 megawatts of power. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that to produce 180 megawatts of power we will dam 13,300 hectares of the most beautiful country in the world. How much is 180 megawatts of power? Let us compare it with Melbourne's Newport power station, which produces 500 megawatts; Yallourn, which produces 1,450 megawatts and Loy Yang, 2,000 plus megawatts. Yet here is a proposition to produce 180 megawatts of power. With regard to the employment aspect, I wonder whether honourable senators know how many full time jobs will be provided by this dam once it is concluded. The full time jobs provided will amount to 29. </PARA>

If he chooses, I can give him the reference to the evidence on that point that was given to the Senate Select Committee. The number of permanent jobs created by this scheme will be 29, for an expenditure of $1,100m to provide 180 megawatts of power. Mr Pizzey concludes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many experts dispute the view that Tasmania's severe economic problems and unemployment can be solved by the availability of more electricity. </PARA>

<PARA>That is all the majority of the Senate Select Committee asked for. We asked for three years breathing space, that the project be held up for three years to see whether alternative methods of power can be forthcoming. A majority of five out of six members of the Committee concluded that there was no need to proceed with the dam at this stage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Government Business has been taken out of the hands of the Government once again. This is a ludicrous waste of time. We now have a situation in which, tomorrow, we will be debating Senator Mason's private member's Bill, the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill, and will continue debate on Senate committee reports. It seems to me quite illogical to spend time on this matter now when we could debate it tomorrow. However, if this is the way that the Senate wants to proceed, I dare say it is in line with the Opposition's efforts to frustrate the passage of business through the Senate. This once again is evidence of the Opposition's efforts in this direction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Ryan and Senator Chipp have told us that the damming of the Franklin River will mean that there will be nothing left for the Australian Heritage Commission to look at. Maybe they do not understand the situation. Perhaps that is the reason for the venom in Senator Chipp's speech today. The area to be flooded is less than one per cent of the total area defined by the Cartland Committee as the south-west conservation area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How much? One per cent?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Less than one per cent. It is just 1 1/2 per cent of the total area of the three nominated areas-that is, the South West, the Wild Rivers and the Lake St Clair National Park. Anybody listening today could be forgiven for believing that what Senator Chipp said was accurate, for thinking what on earth is the Government on about. We were going to put up for World Heritage Committee listing the area that we are now damming, nothing more. In point of fact what the Government is doing is putting up for World Heritage Committee listing nearly one-fifth of Tasmania of which less than 1 1/2 per cent is going to be dammed. This is an indication of the idiocy of the statements made little earlier by Senator Chipp.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chipp said that the Government's announcement is not a compromise; that it was taken only for political purposes. I say that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has never deviated from his original statement that this is a State matter. At the very beginning he said that the question of whether a dam would be built was a State decision. The Prime Minister said that he would put forward for inclusion on the World Heritage List the three south west parks nominated by the then Premier Doug Lowe. At no stage has the Prime Minister deviated from that. Right from the beginning it was said that this is a State matter. Senator Chipp now has the hide to say that a decision on this matter was made only three days after the Flinders by-election. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess that the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party do not understand the complete freedom enjoyed by each member on this side of the Senate. They do not have that freedom and they do not understand it. I was in East Germany at about the time the last Olympic Games began. I tried to explain to those few sympathetic East Germans I met that although our Government had asked our Olympic athletes not to go to the Games it had said they could make up their own minds and if they wanted to go they could use their Australian passports. The East Germans kept asking me why they were allowed to go if the Australian Government did not want them to take part in the Games. I again explained the Government's attitude but they still asked me why this was allowed to happen. They wanted to know why the Government allowed them to participate in the Games. They did not understand because they do not have the sort of freedom that exists in Australia. Likewise, the Opposition and the Australian Democrats do not understand because senators on their side of the Senate do not have the freedom under which a Liberal candidate can say: 'I will fight for a no dam decision. It does not matter what the Liberal Government decides, I will fight for a no dam decision'. Our candidates have that freedom. Our members of parliament have that freedom and, really, I do not blame members of the Opposition for not understanding it. They have never had that freedom and they are never likely to have it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask Senator Missen not to interject. Senator Chipp spoke about the Great Barrier Reef. He said that although we are able to say to the World Heritage Committee that we want this area contained we are going to allow the State that owns the land to build a dam as part of its own energy resources. He likened that situation to the Great Barrier Reef.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;None of the Democrats is in the chamber. Senator Chipp has had his say and off he has flown. Whilst Senator Chipp likened this area to the Great Barrier Reef he did not liken it to the Kakadu National Park because that national park does not happen to suit his purpose. I remind the Senate that the Commonwealth put barriers around the mining area when the Kakadu National Park was put forward for listing on the World Heritage List. So in point of fact the Kakadu National Park was listed and accepted by the World Heritage Committee although mining was being carried out within that park.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not within it.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To be accurate the mining is not within it; boundaries were put around the mining area. I have no qualms about boundaries being put around the Franklin Dam area. That would delete 1 1/2 per cent of the national park nominated for listing. Senator Chipp said that the whole area will be dammed, that 1,300 hectares of land are going to be flooded. However, he did not mention the percentage that was of the total area. It did not even enter his head to bring that into his argument because if he had his speech would have been completely ludicrous. These facts would have put the damming into perspective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have also been told by Senator Chipp today that 41 per cent of people in Flinders voted for no dams, that they wrote the words 'No Dam' across their ballot paper. The other day during Question Time I asked Senator Baume whether this claim was based on an official count figure. He said that there was no official count. I also asked from where the figure came. I asked whether the figure was a figment of the imagination of a scrutineer who had Tasmanian wilderness sympathies. Of course, the only answer is that this must be so. There is no official figure. I could claim that 10 per cent, one per cent or 0.5 per cent of people wrote 'No Dam' across the ballot paper and nobody in this place could correct me. There are no figures whatsoever in this respect. I could claim right here and now that less than 0.5 per cent of Flinders voters wrote 'No dam' across their ballot paper. But we do not know. No one knows whether that is correct because there are no official figures. I do not hazard a guess like that . Only people who want to mislead would hazard a guess and say that 41 per cent of people acted in this way. As I say, such an estimate is just a figment of the imagination of one of the scrutineers. </PARA>
<PARA> What did the Labor Party and the Democrats suggest we do? The Federal Government has said to the State: 'Right, it is a State decision to go ahead and build the dam in your area. We would like you to look after that area. We will assist you financially to look after it and to preserve as much as is physically possible'. Do the Labor Party and the Democrats suggest that we send in the troops, that the Government say: 'You will not build that dam'? The Tasmanian Premier has already had the relevant legislation passed in his State and has sent men in to build the dam. What does the Opposition want us to do? Are we to send in the troops to stop that work proceeding? Obviously, it must accept responsibility for sending in protesters to lie in front of the bulldozers. I tell Senator Button that I am very sincere when I say that that prospect terrifies me. I am sure that if honourable senators had seen on the program Nationwide bulldozer drivers at Queenstown being asked what was likely to happen they would be terrified also. I am extremely concerned that there will be not a peaceful demonstration but rather one that could end in violent confrontation. That is something about which surely everyone in the Senate should be concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> Rather than the representatives of the Labor Party standing up in this place and saying: 'Do not go in' they should remember that we live in a democracy; that a decision has been made by the elected government of Tasmania and the elected government of Australia that the dam should go ahead. Let us not try to use mob rule. Let us abide by the true democratic principles that Australians regard as precious. Instead, the Labor Party and the Democrats are sending in a number of supporters to demonstrate, a prospect that I find absolutely terrifying. I find it difficult to believe that the two Opposition parties would seek to create that kind of confrontation in an isolated, tough area, one that is not closely scrutinised. It could end in the sort of confrontation that I believe the Australian people would not want to see. I will hold the Labor Party and the Democrats primarily responsible for anything that occurs there. They have not been seen to stand up and plead that that kind of thing not be allowed to occur. On the contrary, the Federal Government and the State Liberal Government have done so; the Democrats and the Labor Party have not. In that regard they have been very remiss and, as a result, must certainly accept the blame for anything unfortunate that happens there. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to return to the subject of the listing and how it took place because I think many honourable senators are not aware of the facts. The then Premier, Doug Lowe, submitted the area for listing while he was in the last stages of his premiership. The proposal was not passed by the State Parliament. That Parliament did not submit the South West for listing. It was submitted by one man. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Chipp said that 29 jobs would be created as a result of the damming of the Gordon below Franklin. Then turning to Senator Teague, he said. 'If you do not believe me I will show you the evidence that was put before us'. Good heavens, there would not be in this place a senator who had not sat on Senate committees that had had all sorts of evidence put before them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Hydro-Electric Commission submitted evidence that maintenance would involve 29 jobs. It did not say that the building of the dam would result in the creation of that number of jobs, which is what Senator Chipp said. The honourable senator omitted to list all the jobs that would result from the supplying of additional energy in Tasmania. At no stage did Senator Chipp suggest that it would result in even one job.

I can assure him that when the dam proposal was first mooted Premier Doug Lowe was asked in the State Parliament how many industries he had to knock back because of the absence of an energy source. That was quite some time ago. He admitted that quite a number of people had sought to bring industries to Tasmania but had been knocked back because they could not be given hydro-power. They could have been given Bell Bay power.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I do not intend to speak further on this statement by the Government. The debate that will take place tomorrow on the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill and the report of the Senate Committee will be sufficiently time consuming. As Senator Peter Baume has said, the relevant matters should have been discussed as one. That is why the Senate suggested that the statement be listed for debate tomorrow. However, the matter was taken out of the Government's hands by the Opposition and the Democrats, who said: 'No, we want a full debate on this statement now; we will debate the other matters tomorrow'. That is a pity because it is a complete waste of the time of the Senate to debate them separately rather than jointly. I intend to continue my remarks on the South West in the course of the discussion on those related measures tomorrow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I refer to the terms of the statement I wish to make one or two comments that I believe to be important about Senator Walters's remarks. The honourable senator spent much time in attempting to prove to the Senate that it was most unlikely that 41 per cent of the electorate of Flinders had written 'No Dams' on their ballot papers, that it might well have been only 10 per cent or half a per cent. But that is quite irrelevant to the argument that she has put in this place on numerous occasions. Her argument, as I understand it, is that it does not matter how many people on the mainland write 'no dams' on the ballot paper. The figure could be 100 per cent; it is still not relevant. It is a matter entirely for the concern of Tasmanians. The honourable senator talked about wasting time in the Senate but I am not sure why she spent so much time on that argument because, according to her own argument, it is irrelevant.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is because we advance a different view in the Senate from the view advanced by the Government. That is what Senator Walters is saying. If that is her view of a democracy, my spine shivers at the thought of all the arguments she has put about democratic processes in this country. Senator Walters went on to say that one of the great defects in the nomincation to the World Heritage Committee is that it was made intitially by one man-Doug Lowe. She said it was a disaster that that nomination should be made by one man, Doug Lowe.

Let me go to the details of the statement, which is a very important statement in terms of consideration of conservation issues in Australia and a very important statement in consideration of economic issues in Australia. The first point I want to make is that this statement is reminiscent of everything this Government does. Political survival comes before everything else in terms of this Government's considerations. Look at what is said in the second paragraph of the statement. The Acting Prime Minister says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If these nominations are accepted by the World Heritage Committee, these areas will join the Kakadu National Park, the Great Barrier Reef and the Willandra Lakes Region on the World Heritage List. </PARA>
<PARA>What does that mean? That is a horrifying statement in terms of people who are concerned about, for example, the Great Barrier Reef. It is absolutely horrifying. This statement says that we will put the South West region of Tasmania on the World Heritage List and at the same time we will make no national decision about whether this region is essentially destroyed or not. What does that say about the Great Barrier Reef being in the hands of this Government? What does it say about the Kakadu National Park?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want Senator Teague's view because it does not count when the hard decisions are made. What does it say about any of these things in terms of the Government's policies? It says that none of them can be relied on in regard to these issues. The statement then goes on at some length to deal with the history of the matter and what will happen at the meeting of the World Heritage Committee. On page 2 it gets to the nitty-gritty and the important considerations which, as I have said, are totally contrary to the expressed views of the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I join Senator Chipp on the issue of total lack of comprehension in this statement of the special reference to archaeological sites, the Huon pine habitat, the temperate rainforest and the other unique features of this area. These references are made in the same statement which says that a significant part of it will be destroyed. The statement goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government has co-operated with the Tasmanian Government over a number of years in documenting the natural resources of the area as a basis for future planning and management. </PARA>
<PARA>How much has been spent on that, I wonder, by the Commonwealth Government pursuing the Liberal Party policy of 1975, the Liberal Party policy enunciated by Senator Peter Rae in the Senate last week? How much taxpayers' money has been spent on that exercise by the Commonwealth Government in pursuit of documenting the natural resources of the area? This statement identifies the key natural resource and then goes on to say that it will be destroyed. How much taxpayers' money has been spent on that in pursuit of Liberal Party policy? The statement goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>the Government stands by its commitment to provide financial and other assistance in the establishment and management of a national park. </PARA>
<PARA>Then the statement says:</PARA>
<PARA>the Government has to face facts. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is-not 'facts' in the plural-that Premier Gray in Tasmania has stated firmly that the proposed dam is to proceed. That is the fact with which we must deal. We are not allowed to examine that fact because that would be putting a different view from that of the Government, and one which might encourage some young conservationists to go down there and demonstrate, and then it would be on the Opposition's head if they did that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but that is the essential fact, is it not? As has been pointed out, that is accepting a Commonwealth obligation with one hand and denying it with the other. The statement goes on, in what must be the most classic example of double-think ever displayed in a statement by a Minister to say that the Commonwealth Government will discuss with the Tasmanian Government:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>with a view to minimising the damage that the dam might cause. </PARA>
<PARA>Then the statement says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not intend to intervene in the constrution of the dam. </PARA>
<PARA>Those two extraordinary sentences are lying together in one statement by an allegedly responsible Minister. Then, on page 3, there is the part of the statement with which Senator Chipp dealt. The Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that whilst Fraser Cave and other caves of archaeological significance will be flooded by the dam, let me assure the House that every endeavour will be made to preserve this important part of our heritage. </PARA>
<PARA>There was a bit of debate, by way of interjection, as to what on earth that meant. No one knows what that meant. I believe that no one in this Senate still has any idea of what that means. The reason is that it is gobbledegook. But if it is intended to mean anything, one would have thought that a Minister in the Government would have said what it was intended to mean. It just does not mean anything. We could have 64 speeches in this place interpreting what that silly sentence means. It is crucial to the whole issue, and it is written in absolute gobbledegook. In the second last paragraph there is this classic statement of political philosophy:</PARA>
<PARA> The House will understand that the position taken by the Government will be welcomed by parts of the community and opposed by others. </PARA>
<PARA>Those who oppose it are guilty of some offence, according to Senator Walters' views. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the Government has to strike a balance between competing intentions. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not a statement about striking a balance between competing intentions. It is about striking a balance about votes. It is trying to strike a balance about competing votes. That is why it is couched in these mealy-mouthed terms, giving with one hand and taking away with the other. The statement goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Confrontation between the Commonwealth and the States and between individuals in the community is not the road to prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the most serious economic statement that has been made by this Government in months-'confrontation between the States and the Commonwealth Government is not the road to prosperity'. This Government has not been able to tell us what is the road to prosperity, but at least it has told us something- that confrontation with Mr Gray is not the road to prosperity. The statement goes on to refer to confrontation being not in the interests of development or the conservation of our heritage. I, for one, do not know what that means, either. Then there is, of course, the exhortation about violence, which is tagged on most government statements about anything, and which does not have much more relevance here. </PARA>
<PARA> There are very sound conservation reasons which are terribly important to the national identity and heritage of this country which have been advanced in this debate and which are crucial to the content of this statement. Another argument which is very important in political terms is when in Australia we shall confront the situation of making national economic decisions. All the major problems of this country at present relate very much to its incapacity over many years to make national economic decisions. That is why we have a car industry scattered all over the country which is going down the chute day after day. We have all sorts of industries which suffer from the fact that we have never been able to make national economic decisions about them. I am not making a partisan political point; I am saying that it is an important point in terms of good government in this country. The fact of the matter is that the decision about South West Tasmania is a decision of national economic significance, because if $1,100m is to be spent on this dam-the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick) knows that the projections of the Tasmanian Government about the demands for energy are wrong, as his Department knows; they are vastly inflated-</PARA>

The facts of the matter are, as other speakers have pointed out, that the Hydro-Electric Commission, on its own evidence, will employ 29 people after the dam is completed. Up to the time that it is completed, it will employ perhaps 1,000 people. In terms of the cost of this dam, $1,100m, we could pay each one of those 1,000 workers-not the 29 workers-a sum which would allow them to live on the French Riviera, in a manner to which they have never been accustomed, for the rest of their lives, and we would still have saved money for this country in national economic terms. If Tasmania borrows the money, it will not be able to service the debt in respect of this dam and this Commonwealth Parliament will be asked to do so.

Of course, what we in this Parliament also have to face up to is that manufacturing industry in this country is now steadily on a decline and has been for the past 15 years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Neither has Senator Hill. Unfortunately, one of our colleagues chose to muscle in ahead of members of the Committee on the first occasion and, of course, more muscling in has been done today. We probably will not have a debate on the important issue of the Committee report and what should be done. These matters will be more fundamental than the political decisions being made at the moment, one of which was handed to Professor Slatyer this morning-just before he left. The way in which these things are done is really incredible. The people in Paris will have to decide what they will do about the issue of putting this area on the World Heritage List. Whatever happens, this issue is a big issue. I place much more reliance than I place on that statement on the fact that last weekend 41 per cent of the voters of Flinders chose to mark their ballot papers. That is something which Australian citizens are fearful of doing because they fear it might upset their ballot and might be disregarded. But they chose that course and very careful scrutineers counted the votes. Of course, it was unofficial-Senator Walters seems to think that fact is very important-but it was very reliable and nobody has sought to challenge its accuracy. Nobody has suggested that anyone wrote 'More dams' or 'Have more dams' on their ballot papers last Saturday. Nobody has suggested that even a single person did that. But 41 per cent of the electors down there at Flinders turned their minds to writing 'No dams' on their ballot papers and that is a very fundamental action. It will be observed by people in many other electorates across this country, particularly on the eastern seaboard. I have no doubt that as a result of the developments which will come from this most alarming and absurd decision there will have to be reconsideration of it. As anger rises in the community and as great trouble occurs in the community, which one regrets, one will realise that this cannot be taken as a sufficient answer by people who are responsible in Parliament. Indeed, I am ashamed of the decision that has been made.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Martyr, sitting next to me, giggles now because he thinks we were conned. I do not think I was conned. Indeed, I believe that Peter Reith was elected on a proper issue. If the Government makes the mistake of thinking that the vote in Flinders was an endorsement of mere economic policies, it is wrong. It was certainly no endorsement of alternative ALP policies; that was very clear . But it was a very clear endorsement of a candidate who took an initiative and who gained votes by it. More importantly than that, 41 per cent of the electors determined to show their views. These matters will not go away. This afternoon in the Senate the debate has perhaps dwindled in significance and gone on too long. Perhaps there are more important things, even with regard to the Franklin issue, that we should be debating now. But we should listen to what the public has to say.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am in no way lost in my determination to ensure that this great area of Tasmania is preserved, that the people who write to me and to members of parliament in their hundreds are not going to be left alone and neglected.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take a few minutes of the Senate 's time to speak to the statement on South West Tasmania made this afternoon by the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume). It was a very disappointing statement. The Government took nearly two pages to say how committed it was to nominating the Western Tasmanian Wilderness National Parks for inscription in the World Heritage List. It built up people's hopes but then towards the bottom of the second page of the statment it let all those people down by saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nonetheless, the Government has to face facts. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not intend to intervene in the construction of the dam. </PARA>
<PARA>I will come back in a few moments to comment on a few of the sentences in the statement. Looking at it as a whole it is very obviously a cut and paste job, hastily put together. Sentences begin at the right hand side of the page. Bits have been whited out and other bits have been cut out and the page stuck together again. The sense of some paragraphs does not follow on. For instance, at the bottom of page 2 it states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not intend to intervene in the construction of the dam. </PARA>
<PARA>The next paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government in its discussion with the Tasmanian Government will make it clear that it will back its concern for these features with money, manpower and technical resources. </PARA>
<PARA>It is very difficult to see what these features are. Perhaps they were mentioned several paragraphs earlier. As I say, it is a very poorly put together statement and it obviously reflects the Government's very poor decision. Before I continue I seek from Senator Peter Baume an indication of whether the Government intends this statement to be the considered Government response to the report to the Senate last week of the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania. The Minister does not give me any such indication. He obviously does not know whether it is supposed to be such a response. There is no reference to the recommendations and conclusions of that report in this statement. The statement does not deal at all with the question of power demand and supply and whether the dam is needed at all. The Government has ignored the report altogether. I am not suggesting that it necessarily should have brought down its total response to the report in one week, but at least it could have made some reference to it and indicated whether it was going to give further consideration to the conclusion that there is no need to start construction for at least three years because of the power demand and supply question. </PARA>
<PARA> If the statement is not a response to that Senate Select Committee's report I would like to know when the Government will respond. If it does respond, to what extent would the Government allow that response to be different from the position mentioned in the statement today? Perhaps Senator Missen is right; that this is just a temporary statement to cover the position until the Government has given consideration to the Senate Select Committee's report. But it would be difficult to know how the Government expects the South West Wilderness area-the nominated area-to be listed by the World Heritage Committee when it has made a clear announcement that it has no intention of protecting the area in accordance with its obligations under the very World Heritage Convention that it has signed and under which it has nominated the area. How does it expect that listing to happen? How does it expect the World Heritage Committee to respond to such a blatant notice by the Government that it will not comply with the terms of the Convention, let alone the spirit? As other speakers have said before me, it is hypocritical to expect to be able to have both. This statement is just a statement of words in respect of the nomination. I would like to put one specific question to the Minister concerning the last paragraph on page one which states:</PARA>
<PARA> For the information of honourable senators, it is the practice at meetings of the World Heritage Committee for the nominating country to respond only to questions put by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>This is in relation to the involvement of the Tasmanian representative at the meeting in Paris. It is not clear to me whether that sentence means that the Government wants to emphasise that it is only the nominating country-that is Australia-and not the unrecognised body-Tasmania-which will respond, or whether the Government really means that 'only' to be where it is. Perhaps the Minister might like to tell me about the deliberate nature and placement of that word. The statement went on to refer to:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government's firm belief in the international importance of this area and its outstanding biological and cultural qualities which have been recognised by its inclusion on the Register of the National Estate. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement specifically makes reference to the archaeological sites. Let me point out that without those archaeological sites the cultural value, which is the other arm of the nomination and of the Convention, disappears altogether. Certainly there would be some natural value left in the area being nominated but not 98 1/2 per cent as Senator Walters would have us believe. She makes great play of only a small percentage of the area actually being flooded and that it is not a significant part of the area being nominated. But the important thing that has to be realised by everyone, including the Committee in Paris, is that it is amongst the most significant parts of the area being nominated that will be affected by the dam. Whether it is 1 1/2 per cent or some other percentage that is actually flooded is not important; it is the parts that will be lost because of that, including the cultural parts, those parts with archaeological value, and the most significant natural parts. Of course, in answer to Senator Walters, there are other things to look at in Tasmania and other parts will not have a lake over them. The whole concept of wilderness obviously is not understood by Senator Walters and apparently not by the Government either, despite its mouthing those words and suggesting that this area can be nominated for the World Heritage List and that the dam can proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret to say that the wording of the statement is a joke. It would have been more honest of the Government to have said that in view of the Tasmanian Government's intransigence it withdraws the nomination for World Heritage listing. The Government is trying to have it both ways but it cannot. On page 2 there is the curious statement that the Government will:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . provide financial and other assistance in the establishment and management of a national park of world significance which includes a substantial wilderness component. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not one suggesting that the wilderness will be totally destroyed by the intrusion of the flooding, but it will be virtually destroyed. One cannot say: ' We have a wilderness here and 100 yards away we have human intervention'. The area is either wilderness or it is not. To say that there will be a substantial wilderness component when the area is destroyed-the Government is now supporting its destruction-is not to face facts, although the Government is claiming to do so. Even more amazing is the statement that the Government is discussing the scheme with the Tasmanian Government 'with a view to minimising the damage that the dam might cause.' That is a laughable statement. The Government would have done itself more credit by leaving out the stupid suggestion that it could minimise the damage that the dam might cause. I hope that the Minister in reply will also explain the following statement, which stands on its own and is inconsistent with what appears before it:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government in its discussion with the Tasmanian Government will make it clear that it will back its concern for these features with money, manpower and technical resources. </PARA>
<PARA>I trust that the Minister will give us more details about what that means. Another statement which will be impossible to comply with relates to Fraser Cave . The Government says that, whilst the cave will be flooded, every endeavour will be made to preserve this important part of our heritage. It is either flooded or it is preserved. It cannot be both. It is just not possible to preserve such an important part of the world's heritage by flooding it. I do not know whether the Government is suggesting that archaeologists in future will be trained in underwater diving, but it is a crazy notion. A further impossible suggestion which appears later is that the Government will strike a balance between competing intentions. I suggest that there is no balance at all. The Government is not striking a balance. It is purporting to strike a balance but in no way is it doing so. I understand that Fraser Cave was named after the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in the hope that he would not wish something named after him to disappear under water. Today the name ought to be changed since it has not had its desired effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters made great play of the fact that the Australian Labor Party has not opposed the demonstration in the South West by those who are concerned about the matter. She tried to attribute blame for that activity to the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats and, presumably, to those members of the Liberal Party who support the nomination of the area and voted last week for the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill. I am worried, too. She does not have the sole ability to worry about people getting hurt. Demonstrating is not necessarily the wisest thing that people do when they feel strongly about a matter. But it is the right of people to demonstrate their concern and, of course, they should accept any consequences that arise. During demonstrations against the Vietnam war people were arrested because of their desire to be conscientious objectors. The law was wrong and they had the right to demonstrate against it and had to take the consequences. But let not Senator Walters say that anything that happens in Tasmania will be the fault of the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats or those Liberal Party members who were overruled today. Her talk of mob rule only encourages a reaction. I hope that the right of people to demonstrate will be supported. I do not think that the offer by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) to send Australian Federal Police officers into the area to assist helps the situation. I suggest that it is a most inappropriate offer, quite apart from being contradictory. If it is inconsistent for the Federal Government to interevene, it is inconsistent for Federal Police to be involved in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by referring to the earlier vote on whether this debate ought to proceed. It may not have been observed by people that apart from the pairs that were involved, several Government senators abstained from voting and obviously wanted the debate to proceed. I hope that now that that vote is well past they will return to the chamber and vote on this question. I can understand the disappointment of those honourable senators, including Senator Missen, who spoke before me, in the Government's position especially so soon after the Flinders by -election, which to some degree was won by the Government on false advertising. It is another indication that such Liberal Party advertising cannot be trusted. It is also unfortunate that the Government deferred its statement until today, after the by-election. It is difficult to believe that it was not deliberate that the statement was delayed until now. There is nothing in it that could not have been said last week. It is not as if a lot of attention were given to the contents of the report of the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania, which would have given the Government an excuse to delay its statement until this week. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe, although it is an interesting suggestion, that the Government 's decision today was made in order to stop a resignation from the Ministry. I do not believe that the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) is so important to the Government's fortunes, even in the eyes of the Government. But, of course, we heard the suggestion from Mr Hodgman that he would consider resigning unless the Government decided not to intervene. It is possible that a strong consideration on the part of the Government was that it could not afford to have the disruption of a Minister resigning and the consequential reshuffle that would occur, something which would further show its instability and division. I am pleased to have been able to make these comments on the ministerial statement at this stage. I repeat that it is a very sad day that this statement by the Minister was put down in such terms. I am pleased to support the position of the Australian Labor Party on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not my intention to canvass a number of the points that have been made in this debate.

Nor do I intend at this moment to address myself to the vitriolic nonsense that was engaged in by Senator Chipp, particularly his unwarranted remarks about honourable senators. Suffice it to say that Senator Chipp has been caught out previously with his statements which, when matched with the truth, have not stood up. I refer, of course, to the comment that he made on 25 November wherein he said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>At that stage I said:</PARA>
<PARA> That is untrue. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Chipp indicated that I ought to go and get lost, or words to that effect . I have a statement that was prepared by the Department of Environment in Tasmania which indicated that all of the 13 drums of oil were recovered intact from the river and that, in fact, the samples that were taken showed that in the areas where they were taken-Sea Reach, Barbers Pole, Champ Cliff, Butler Island and Sir John Falls-there was roughly six milligrams per litre of weathered diesel oil in the water.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Also it was not in accordance with the facts. Today I wish to address myself to the statement that is before us. I say very clearly: The statement is both constitutionally proper and timely. On behalf of the Government the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government has co-operated with the Tasmanian Government over a number of years in documenting the natural resources of the area as a basis for future planning and management. The Commonwealth looks to continuing this co -operative approach. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement adverted to the fact that the project has the backing of legislation which has been passed by both Houses of the Tasmanian Parliament. Fifty-one out of the 54 members of the Tasmanian Parliament voted for the project to be continued. No one can say that that was a party vote. The 51 out of the 54 included members of the Liberal Party of Australia, members of the Australian Labor Party and Independent members of the Legislative Council. These people have the responsibility and the capacity to evaluate the projects and come to a democratic decision. This they did. This statement recognises that there was a responsibility by the Tasmanian Parliament so to act and that the Commonwealth will not use any conceivable power that it may have already under the Constitution to intervene in a matter which is properly a matter for the State. In respect of the nomination of the area to the World Heritage Committee the statement goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Government . . . has issued an invitation for the Tasmanian Government to be represented in the delegation subject to the conditions which normally apply to State representatives on Australian Government delegations. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an important recognition by the Government that in its responsibility as a state party to the convention it must have regard also to its character as a federal state. Although it does not go as far as the umbrella prospects of the Canadian situation it at least goes to the extent of including a representative of the State concerned on the delegation. The statement is very important. It is one upon which the Government should be congratulated. The Government indicates in the statement:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government in its discussion with the Tasmanian Government will make it clear that it will back its concern for these features with money, manpower and technical resources. </PARA>
<PARA>I turn to the second reason why I congratulate the Government on this statement. It is timely because a blockade has been organised in South West Tasmania for next Tuesday. The organisers of the blockade ought to understand that democracy has spoken. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a motion 'That the Senate take note of the statement' moved by the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) on behalf of Mr McVeigh, the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment on the subject of South West Tasmania. I indicated prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner that the statement was both constitutionally proper and timely. I indicated that the statement had promised continued co-operation with the Tasmanian Government in the future planning and management of the area. I indicated that the statement was constitutionally proper in that it recognised implicitly the right and the responsibility of the Tasmanian Parliament to make decisions in respect of the area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Tasmanian Parliament has done so. After exhaustive examination and exhaustive deliberation both the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council came to a conclusion, as I said prior to the suspension of the sitting, by a vote of 51 out of 54 parliamentarians in that State. Only three parliamentarians voted against the proposal in respect of the development project which, incidentally, affects only 1.7 per cent of the whole of the area which is being nominated by the Australian Government to the World Heritage Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now turn to the reason I believe that the Minister's statement is timely . On Tuesday next a blockade is to be mounted in the South West against work that has been commenced pursuant to the democratic decision taken in the Tasmanian Parliament. That blockade is a calculated attempt to defy the law and to confront the police in the hope that when arrests are made publicity will follow. Just to make doubly sure that this publicity will follow, the blockade organisers have arranged for light aircraft and helicopters to ferry journalists from one confrontation scene to another. When all the photographs have been taken, those involved in the blockade will claim that they have been provoked. Only gullible people will swallow that. </PARA>
<PARA> The organisers of the blockade know very well that they have lost the argument now both in Tasmania, in the Tasmanian Parliament, and in Canberra. In their book this is only a minor irritation. They have not accepted the democratic decision taken pursuant to the constitutional rights and responsibilities of the State and taken pursuant to the responsibilities of the Federal Government. The Tasmanian law which the blockade organisers hope to get their supporters to confront involves a penalty of $100. It becomes relevant only when a person has been arrested as a result of that person's refusal a request to leave a designated area. The consequent arrests will achieve the objective that they desire and when that occurs they will cry foul. Let us contrast the $100 penalty , if we can, against the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill which has been introduced into the Senate by the Australian Democrats, ostensibly to 'save ' South West Tasmania. That Bill could have people landed in gaol for an indefinite period at a judge's discretion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry; the blockade organisers who seek to break the Tasmanian law know what the penalty is. The penalty is a mere $100. They are after the publicity and they are wanting that to cry foul. The measure that the Australian Democrats have brought into this chamber is a draconian measure, with no penalty except the ultimate penalty of contempt of court which has, as the penalty, a period of imprisonment at the pleasure of a judge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not one to deny people their opportunities for civil disobedience. But civil disobedience within a democracy is warranted only when all reasonable or legal avenues have been exhausted and the matter involved remains such a grave issue that a person's formed conscience dictates non-compliance when he or she is forced to act or not to act. Calculated defiance in the form of the publicity -seeking blockade is many steps removed from this concept of civil disobedience.</PARA>
<PARA> Politically motivated confrontation fractures the democratic processes. What those who promote it are really saying is: 'Forget about ballot boxes, elections , parliamentary representatives. We will take time off from being citizens of this democracy. We will opt out on this occasion and propose to take our own solutions'. That is why these people are mounting the blockade on Tuesday of next week. Such people are very far removed from the necessity of balancing conflicting demands and the responsibility of providing for adequate economic growth and employment opportunities. That responsibility devolves upon us all, but in particular it devolves and devolved upon the elected Parliament of the State of Tasmania. This statement clearly indicates that the decision of the Tasmanian Premier received the backing of legislation. That is a very important point which should not be forgotten in this debate; that 51 out of Tasmania's 54 politicians of all political persuasions voted in favour of that proposition. In the ideal democratic system, decisions should be made by a legitimate authority standing in the closest proximity possible to the people, to those people who will be affected by those decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> What I have to say to the people of Tasmania and particularly to the people of the West Coast of Tasmania, about whom fears have been expressed, I consider they already know. Let the blockade be seen for what it is-a deliberate defiance of the democratic process. There is no need to assist organisers in seeking publicity. If I were them I would just make sure that those taking part are charged full price for meals, accommodation and travel. In that way, in the short terms at least, the blockade organisers may contribute something to the economy of Tasmania. When they have disappeared from the scene, Tasmanians and their elected representatives can get on with the real task of running Tasmania. I believe the statement made by the Minister today deserves commendation. It states, and I agree:</PARA>
<PARA> Confrontation between the Commonwealth and the States and between individuals in the community is not the road to prosperity, development or the conservation of our heritage. The Government believes, on balance, that its decision is the right one and seeks from the community support in its continuing discussions with the Tasmanian Government. Finally, Mr McVeigh joins with the Premier of Tasmania in exhorting those who oppose the construction of the dam not to physically interfere with construction works. Mr McVeigh makes the comment that he abhors violence as I am sure do all in this Senate. Nothing can be gained from violent confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA>I could not possibly conceive of a more apt or more timely statement at this time. Not only is it apt and timely having regard to the possibilities of next Tuesday, but also it is constitutionally proper recognising the existence of the Tasmanian Parliament, recognising the responsibility-as it does implicitly-of that Parliament in respect of the matter and recognising the true meaning of democracy within our Federal system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I strongly support the statement put down by the Government. I also support the Tasmanian senators in their fight to preserve Tasmania from excessive Federal interference. Indeed, the Government has recognised, quite clearly, what its responsibilities and its rights are. That is the reason for this statement today. Senator Button and Senator Ryan, and, to some extent, Senator Coates, have all been taken aback by the clear Government statement which recognised all of the realities that are inherent in the struggle between those in Tasmania who wish State rights and for the Tasmanian Government to control its own affairs and those from outside who wish to impose their will on the Government and people of Tasmania. If Senator Button had really believed his argument about power costs in Tasmania, if he was prepared to follow the logic of this argument to its conclusion, he would go all out for a small nuclear power station using Australian uranium right in the centre of Tasmania. But it is strange; Senator Button is not prepared to consider this logic or to carry it to its conclusion because the political consequences within his own party may be just a bit severe at the moment. It is easy for him to talk about national economic responsibility because we would have to say, if the result in Flinders is any indication and probably other results in time to come are any indication, that he will never have any personal responsibility for ever exercising any national economic responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> My friend Senator Missen, who sits alongside me, drew attention to the fact that I had laughed. I do not often giggle in this place. I am tempted to laugh more than I am to giggle about many things, most of which occur on the other side of the aisle. But Senator Missen told us that he was adopting a fairly high profile. I do not think it would be uncharitable to say that if I had laughed at that I was entitled to laugh because the high profile left me plenty to laugh at . </PARA>
<PARA> I listen to Tasmanian senators first on Tasmanian issues. I listened with interest to what Senator Coates had to say. I listened to him more attentively than I did to other honourable senators because he lives in Tasmania. I might disagree with his conclusions but I think that he has much more right to speak on these matters than I or anyone else who does not come from Tasmania. I think it is clear that I am interested in State rights. I have a very strong attachment to those rights, I do not want them minimised and I feel compelled to say something when these rights are threatened. I appeal to Tasmanians not to be upset by those outside Tasmania who have concocted what I describe as a greenie stew-a stew that is liberally sprinkled, has Labor vegetables and is heated over a Chipp fire. </PARA>
<PARA> I think what has happened, as a result of the Government's statement, is that this whole ghastly mess, which was boiled on the Chipp fire, is now overflowing the pot. I hope it puts the fire out, because it is a stupid and irresponsible fire. If that happens it will put out of the Parliament something that we will be glad to see put out. Senator Chipp submitted a hit list, if you like, of government members in various States who would be targets for the greenies in those States. All I can say to anyone who has been threatened by Senator Chipp is: 'Do not worry about it'. I have been threatened plenty of times and somehow or other it has not had a permanent effect. Who is to say-my time might come-but my advice to anybody who wants to stand up to these people is: 'Stand up to them and you will probably be a hero in your own electorate and have a far better chance of being returned than if you give in to this sort of pressure, engineered from outside the electorate'.</PARA>
<PARA> I am indebted once again to Senator Walters for speaking out so soundly and strongly for Tasmania. She made the important point that when Tasmania was controlled by a Labor Government the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made a decision not to interfere in Tasmanian affairs. Thus, the Government is being perfectly consistent in its attitude. It will not interfere now that Tasmania is controlled by a good government either. In my opinion, Premier Gray ought to be the toast of every State. He made a tough decision in the face of well organised but nonetheless illogical and in some ways dishonest opponents. Senator Harradine has alluded to the sort of dishonesty practised by this irresponsible mob. Premier Gray has spoken, as has the Commonwealth, with common sense and rationality for the real people of Tasmania, who know that the dam is essential to their future economic well-being. I support the Government's statement as representing basic principle and political common sense. </PARA>

I had hoped to speak in a cognate debate on this matter and on the Bill which is being brought forward by Senator Mason and the Australian Democrats. I wish first to contradict the statement by Senator Walters this afternoon that this matter was being debated now rather than with the legislation to which I have referred because the Opposition, and in particular the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats, wanted to take over the business of this place. In fact, both the Labor Party and the Democrats offered to debate this statement in conjunction with the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill brought down by Senator Mason. That offer was refused by the Government, whose spokesman stated: 'If you want to do that you can stay here till Christmas'. We are not debating the two matters cognately because the Government would not agree to that happening. It had nothing to do with the attitude of the Opposition. Indeed, it would have been sensible to debate the issues together. Instead, we are debating the statement put down today in the other place by Mr McVeigh, the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, and in this place by Senator Peter Baume, the Minister for Education.</PARA></TALK.START>

So I do not really take any notice of what Senator Martyr said because this is not a matter for jest; it is a matter of very serious concern for Tasmanians, as all Tasmanians know. It is a matter which has divided Tasmanians as few issues have in the past. Yet all we get is a brief three page document which says that the Government believes that these national parks are very important places-something that is not agreed with by Senator Walters, by the way-and therefore they are being nominated to go on the World Heritage List. At the same time, the Government is saying that we will flood this most crucial section of that wilderness area with the hydro-electric scheme because it believes it is a matter of States rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This issue has provoked emotional debate on both sides of this chamber for three or four years. I suggest to honourable senators that most of the emotion in the debate in this place has come from that very colourful speech by Senator Walters last Thursday night and that very colourful speech by Senator Harradine last night which were barely balanced by Senator Chipp's contribution today. I wish initially to take up a couple of the points raised by Senator Walters. Senator Walters said that the decision to nominate these areas for the World Heritage List was Doug Lowe's decision-nobody else's, just Doug Lowe's. The facts of the matter are that the proclamation of the Franklin Rivers-Lower Gordon Wild Rivers National Park was an Executive Council decision in Tasmania and the decision to put forward the Wild Rivers and the Lake St Clair national parks to the Commonwealth Government for nomination for the World Heritage List was initially made by the Tasmanian Cabinet. It was confirmed by the Tasmanian parliamentary party. </PARA>

It is important to remember that and it is important to remember that Senator Walters's claim-Senator Harradine also made this claim by interjection one night-that one person made this decision is nonsensical. Senator Walters went on at considerable length about what she saw as the danger of violence, about what she described as mob rule in the blockade which is allegedly going ahead next week in the area of the dam construction site. Mr Gray, the Premier of Tasmania, has frequently made reference to mob rule and has talked about having to spend $15,000 a week to prevent this blockade, about sending in helicopters, about gaoling people and continually about violence in the area.</PARA></TALK.START>

Has Senator Harradine ever got up here and complained about people who blockade clinics in Victoria which are conducted legally under the laws of the Victorian Government? Did Senator Harradine complain when a group of ladies-I agreed with their right to do so-blockaded the offices in Hobart of a member of this Parliament? They did so, as was their right, to demonstrate their disagreement with that parliamentarian's views. The people in Victoria who blockade Dr Wainer 's clinic, wherever it is, and abuse people who go in and out, are blockading an establishment which is set up legally under the laws of Victoria, and we hear no complaints from Senator Harradine.

Let us not hear all this piety and pompous nonsense that Senator Harradine goes on with in this place. I take up the point taken up by Senator Button, because this is a serious problem about national responsibility, national economic responsibility, and national responsibility for conservation and heritage. It is terribly important to Tasmania. I point out, as have others, that the Tasmanian senators in this place happen to be equally divided on this question. It is not, as Senator Martyr says, that all of the Tasmanian senators are on one side and every other honourable senator is on the other side. The Tasmanian senators happen to be equally divided. It is a very important issue. It is an important issue for Tasmania and an important issue for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take up the point made by Senator Walters earlier. It is a terribly important issue. What we are indulging in here is the construction, at a very large cost, of a dam in Tasmania to produce, I think, 183 megawatts of power. It will be a very small power station at a very high cost. Senator Walters and others have assured as here that we need this power to attract industries to the State and that those industries will employ people. I have asked Senator Walters, by interjection tonight, I have asked Mr Gray, the Premier of Tasmania, and I have asked many other people in Tasmania over the last five years: What are those industries and from where will they come? The answer is as deafening a silence as there is here now. Senator Walters claimed that Mr Lowe had said that he had had to deny industries access to Tasmania because there was no power. In fact the problem was that some industries already present in Tasmania wanted to increase their power consumption and at that time there was not enough because of the delay in the construction of the Pieman scheme. At that time there was no suggestion that a horde of industries was coming to Tasmania because they wanted our power. If there had been, we should not be building a power station of 183 megawatts; we should be building a reasonably sized power station of 400 or 500 megawatts-not fiddling around with a small station like this. </PARA>
<PARA> If what we need to progress in Tasmania is massive industrialisation, I would point out that I have never heard anyone on the other side say what that massive industrialisation would be. I have never heard anyone name one industry that would want to come to Tasmania. There are no such industries and yet the Government is asking us on faith to go ahead with this project. There are alternative hydro-electricity projects in Tasmania which will employ the work force of the Hydro-Electric Commission which I am concerned about and which every Tasmanian senator is concerned about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Martyr, who says that we all should listen to the Tasmanian senators on this issue and who comes from as far away from Tasmania as one can in this country, has more to say than anyone else on the grounds of States' rights. He says that we must let the States do what they like. As a Tasmanian senator, it is on this matter that I am concerned, and more concerned than anyone else. The problem which faces this country is that if we go ahead with six States and a couple of Territories competing for overseas markets and for industries the way we are over this, we will inevitably end up selling what we have at the lowest possible price and not at the highest possible price. In doing so we will end up doing the wrong thing by the citizens of each of those States. In any such war-be it a tax war or an industrial war-with competition between the States in this country and without the national interest being put first, Tasmania will lose out. Tasmania will lose out because of its small population. It will lose out because of the barrier that Bass Strait presents with respect to transport costs and everything else. Tasmania inevitably will lose out in such a battle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thought federation was about protecting the far-flung corners of our country. I thought it was about ensuring that places such as Tasmania with great disadvantages-disadvantages which until recently made Western Australia a claimant State-were protected and letting them overcome their disadvantages. But if we proceed with this States' rights nonsense that we have heard in this place in the last couple of weeks, the losers inevitably will be the smaller States such as Tasmania which have their disadvantages. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very easy in a small State like ours to take the populist view. It is very easy to get up like Senator Walters and others and say: 'My concern is for the people of Tasmania. That is what they have said. That is what the majority of them seem to be saying at the moment and I will go along with that, rightly or wrongly'. But a responsible representative of Tasmania in this Parliament should sit back, look at the facts, look at the long term prospects and forget the short term prospect of whether they will be re-elected. He should forget the threats that have been made to me through Senator Walters in recent days and look at what is best not only for Tasmania but also for Australia, because Tasmania's success and prosperity depend upon this country's prosperity. If we are to proceed the way we are in reproducing the shambles that the Ord River Scheme in Western Australia represents, if we are to cast the burden of this sort of scheme on to our children when at the moment we have no prospect of reasonable industries to pay for the power that will be produced by this scheme, we are not performing our duties as parliamentarians representing Tasmania and we are not performing our duties as representatives of the Australian nation in the Senate, in the House of Representatives or anywhere else. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine said that this statement is timely. It certainly is. It appears four days after a by-election in which the Liberal Party promoted its candidate as a 'No dams' candidate with central office funds. As someone said, there is no reason why this statement could not have come out last week or the week before. But it is a very timely statement organised around the Flinders by- election. It is also a timely statement, as Senator Harradine said, because it comes out just before the protests which will be conducted in Tasmania. Like the other statements which have been made by Mr Gray and others, it is a statement which feeds the sort of fire which Senator Harradine wants to see occur there. It also occurs just before the hypocritical nomination of these national parks for the World Heritage List. It is very timely. It is the most hypocritical timing of any statement which has ever come down in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that this is a terribly emotional issue as well as a terribly difficult one for Tasmanians. What we have to decide in Tasmania and in the rest of Australia is whether the construction of this dam at the extraordinary cost which will eventually fall on the Tasmanian community for years and years to come and the 180 megawatts of power that it will produce are justified, Senator Walters told us that industries will flood in to use this 180 megawatts, a tiny amount of power--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we are not building it for that reason, for what reason are we building it? Why are we not building a dam on the King River to produce 60 megawatts? That would supply the power which is needed for Tasmania in the foreseeable future and would employ those hydro-electric employees whom I am concerned about-whether the honourable senator believes it or not-as much as anyone else. If people are waiting to use these vast amounts of power, why are we not building, say, a much bigger thermal power station in the Fingal Valley, for less? Why are we not even considering it? We are not considering it because some very stubborn people over the last few years have managed to convince themselves and others in Tasmania that somehow the proposed dam will solve all our problems. Those problems include unemployment that will soon reach 14 per cent, and the honourable senator knows it. Our problems are labour shedding all over the State, not because of a lack of power but because of the other disadvantages that we have. We face these problems because our kids cannot get jobs and have to leave the State. Is Senator Walters seriously suggesting, as is being suggested in Tasmania, that the solution to that problem is to build this dam at a huge cost for a small amount of power?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report of the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania and the evidence of the Hydro-Electric Commission show that the projections for power needs in the future are very uncertain. At the highest projections they involve the industries that Senator Walters cannot tell us about, that Mr Gray cannot tell us about, that no one can tell us about. All the Senate Committee said was that we could wait three years and sort out the economic, ecological, conservationist and archaeological problems which face us in this area. But no; just after an election when the Liberal candidate said that he would save the Franklin and just before we nominate this area to a world body we get a statement which, amongst other things, says:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that whilst Fraser Cave and other caves of archaeological significance will be flooded by the dam, let me assure the House that every endeavour will be made to preserve this important part of our heritage. </PARA>
<PARA>No one on the other side has been able to explain that paragraph because it is nonsense, as are so many other paragraphs in the statement. We have guarantees that the Federal Government will consult with the State Government to make sure that only minimal damage is done to the area. What in heaven's name does that mean? We are talking about a massive expenditure. We are talking about the nomination of a very important area to the World Heritage List. We are talking about an economic problem which faces Tasmania and which potentially could land my children and your children, Senator Walters, with an interest burden for years and years to come. If they cannot pay it, the Federal Government will have to pay. All we get is three pages of cut and paste, as Senator Coates said. All we get is three pages of paragraphs which are confused and which, as Senator Button said, in many places are barely literate and give no justification for this decision at all, apart from the fact that the Federal Government believes that it is a matter of States rights. How the hell is it States rights if the Federal Government is nominating the area for inclusion on the World Heritage List? How is it only a State matter if the Federal Government is sending the Australian Federal Police to the area? How is it only a State matter if the Federal Government admits in this statement that in the past it was concerned about the area, was willing to fund the investigation of the area and is willing in the future to join with the Tasmanian Government to make sure that the area is not badly or seriously damaged?</PARA>
<PARA> I suggest, despite all that has gone on in this place in the last two weeks and all that has gone on in Tasmania and in this country in the last few years, we have not investigated this matter properly. I suggest that the import of the Senate Select Committee's report is that we do not really know what the power projections are. We do not really know what sorts of needs Tasmania will have in the future. We do not know what sorts of industries this dam will allegedly attract to Tasmania. But what is worse is what we are saying to the Hydro- Electric Commission workers in Tasmania, 700 of whom sent cuttings from a paper to me via Senator Walters, which I think is a very significant indication of who directed that little operation. We are saying to them: 'If you build this dam your jobs will be safe for life'. That is nonsense because we have no guarantee that the power that is produced from this dam will result in jobs for Tasmanians in the future. In fact, the indications of recent years are that it will not. We have no indication, based on long term planning, of what the Hydro-Electric Commission's plans are after the construction of this dam. Will we continue to build dams on the grounds that we will have to keep someone employed just building dams?</PARA>
<PARA> This is a serious question not only for Tasmanians, who are in dire economic straits at the moment, but also for the people who will follow us in Tasmania and who will have to bear the burden of this cost. All we got was a three-page statement which tells us nothing. The statement told us that before the Professor Slatyer left Australia this morning he was told that when he arrives in Paris he will have to tell the World Heritage Commission that despite the fact that we want the South West Tasmania area included in the World Heritage List we will build the dam anyway. This occurred on the day he left. We are not doing the right thing by Tasmanians, by Australia and certainly by the delegation which we have sent to Paris. I hope that in the future we can have a sensible debate on this issue. But we cannot do so when all we have to debate is a document such as this and while we refuse to debate the report brought down by a select committee of this Senate. I believe we will probably ignore the report this session and next session, as Senator Missen said, because the facts contained in it and the results of the inquiry are uncomfortable for the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button raised the question of why a number of honourable senators from Tasmania voted the way they did. I do not know to whom he was referring. In the unlikely event that he was referring to any Liberals I should think that they would have made their judgments on the basis of pragmatic , intelligent, in-depth, personal conscience decisions which they would have arrived at as a result of considering everything placed before them. There is a distinction between that and what honourable senators on the other side do; they simply put their hands up like one-armed puppets. If a member of the Australian Labor Party does not support the ALP, of course that member is expelled. It is axiomatic; it is automatic. That is the real distinction. The sad fact of life in respect of this matter is that, while I do not for a moment presume to make judgments as to why, how, when, where or whether ALP senators from Tasmania made their determinations in the Caucus, one thing I do know is that they are committed and compelled to support the point of view to which 51 per cent of the voters of the Caucus has agreed.</PARA></TALK.START>

If it was not, I suggest that he close his mouth next time he grunts. It is the people of the mainland who are directing the course of the future economic, social and environmental considerations of the people in Tasmania. The economy of Tasmania is in no brilliant state at present, thanks to a number of Australian Labor Party governments over a number of years. As I understand it, from the recent statistics that I have been able to observe, unemployment in Tasmania is running at something like 11.8 per cent. No doubt that will fall away with the implementation of the Liberal Government's policies into the community. In the meantime that is a fact of life and it has to be accepted.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect, I do not know how Senator Tate draws the distinction between the pro-dam and anti-dam lobbies. There are those of us who simply just look at this proposal on the basis of what will be the best thing for Tasmania and ultimately what will be the best thing for Australia. As I sit here and listen to those people from Victoria, the altruistic, clear-minded, clear-headed people who want no dams in Tasmania, I wonder where they would stand or how they would feel if suddenly all the coal were closed off for reasons which might be compatible with their short term philosophic views about what is good and what is bad for the environment of Australia. I wonder what would happen in South Australia if suddenly the Cooper Basin happened to fall within a certain environmental structure and no longer could they have the natural gas or what looks like being a very exciting oil prospect. If everything else I have said so far has been abstract I know one thing for sure: If in Western Australia anyone tried to stop our iron ore, our bauxite, our alumina, our uranium, our natural gas or our oil, there would be grave indignation. There would be protestations which could not be exceeded because they are the sorts of things which make us the powerful powerhouse of the economy of Australia. They are the sorts of things which cause us to be responsible for 20 per cent of Australia's exports, notwithstanding the fact that we have only 8.7 per cent of the total population of Australia. It is interesting how other people, sitting home very comfortably in their own environment, can make judgments about one State. It is almost as if the have-nots are competing with the haves. It is almost as if those in certain positions in certain areas of influence who do not have to risk their jobs, who do not have to worry about their future and their families' futures, can sit in whatever electorate it is on the mainland of Australia and suddenly decide that somebody else's job, somebody else's future, somebody else's children's future is not terribly important as long as they can row down that river that nobody ever goes to.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Tasmanian Government presumably has looked at all the options. Presumably it considered coal, a Bass Strait link, nuclear energy, solar energy, wind power and every other option. A good State government would want to be liked, respected and voted for. Presumably it gave all these matters consideration before it arrived at the ultimate determination. Having drawn the final conclusions together, the Tasmanian Government decided what it needed to do for the people of Tasmania. I think any State government that did not put its people first would be derelict in its duty and should not be supported. It is not without significance to note that in the Tasmanian Parliament, as I understand it, only three of the 54 members of the two Houses voted against the present proposals of the Tasmanian Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I understand it also, two successive governments of totally different persuasions-a Liberal Party government and a Labor Party government-have taken the same view. Both governments, in my view, showed impeccable judgment, courage , integrity and responsibility for their constituents. Nobody has argued against that except a monolithic group of giants on the opposite side of this chamber who seem to have the belief that all wisdom resides in this building, as I said before, and that everybody on that side knows more than anyone else in any State of Australia. Suddenly, everybody on the opposite side has decided that it is terribly important that decisions be made under the roof of this Parliament. It is my view that the judgment that has been made is one of compassion, understanding, wisdom, knowledge, perception and sensitivity for the voters. If the people who made that judgment are wrong they will be removed at the next election. Inasmuch as both parties have been courageous enough to make a determination, they have drawn the same conclusion-that this dam is in the best interests of Tasmanians.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did I hear a member of the ALP say: 'Not for long'? Let it be recorded. The mineral rights and the resources of each State are, as a result of the Constitution-by statute and by right-intrinsically in the hands of the State governments. Under the proposals that have been put forward by the ALP and Australian Democrats those rights would be removed very quickly. I can only assume that the former Labor Government in Tasmania and the present Liberal Government there very carefully considered what would be in the best interests of that State before they made their ultimate determinations. It is difficult enough for the people of Tasmania being isolated in terms of distance, environment and transportation. Whenever it suits members of certain unions to go on strike Tasmanians cannot export and they no longer have access to imports. It simply takes a short strike to paralyse the capacity of that community to continue to function. One of the few advantages that Tasmania and a small number of other countries, such as New Zealand, have is the capacity to produce hydro- electric power. Tasmania has a capacity to produce electricity. One of the fundamental capacities required these days by manufacturing industry, whether it be at the first phase or the last phase, is the ability to produce low unit cost power. With hydro-electric power Tasmania will be able to attract major, minor and middle industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is all very well for those on this side of the ocean to make determinations that do not affect them. But I put it to those people that if they were in the situation in which Tasmanians find themselves where families are without jobs, without hope, without ambition and without immediate prospects the thought of some new projects or prospects would be very appealing. Notwithstanding the fact that it has been put to me by the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labour Party that there are votes in this for them at the next Federal election, I would have thought that Tasmanians would be more concerned about their future in terms of jobs and the social consequences which would flow from the construction of the dam. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the proposal. I find it regrettable and sad, to say the least, that there are those who, for their own altruistic, divorced reasons which are quite unrelated to the reality, the necessity, the need and the purpose of the dam, decide that it is better in the long run that they should have the pleasure of motoring up and down the Franklin River once in a million years rather than see people have jobs, prospects, hopes, aspirations and a chance of succeeding in life. As I recall, 11.8 per cent of the people of Tasmania are, at present without employment. I just wonder how they feel when Opposition senators stand up and say: 'We do not need dams. We are doing very nicely over here in the blue ribbon seats on the East Coast of Australia'. I wonder how people who cannot find a job feel about the prospect of cheap power and cheap electricity that will give them the chance of jobs, security and hope for their future and the future of their families. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said from the outset, I support the concept of the statement. As I said I think a week ago, besides all the other considerations, the Federal Government's judgment in terms of this being a matter to be resolved by a State government as distinct from the Federal government is an impeccable judgment of States' rights. It goes back to the intrinsic principle which was expounded so often during the constitutional debates from 1893 right through to Federation when the division of powers was clearly and articulately drawn up between the States and the Commonwealth. At that time a decision was made as to who should have what powers. To use some surreptitious, insidious, external affairs power which has suddenly been found by accident in relation to some other matter as a reason to intervene in the way that is proposed by Senator Evans and others I think is an absolute prostitution of the Constitution. The use of such a power was never intended and should never be implemented. I admire the Federal Government for its courage, capacity and integrity for saying--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listeners to the parliamentary broadcast tonight may be unaware that, effectively, the Opposition-the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats-has taken the running of the business program of the Senate out of the hands of the Government, that it has brought on this debate despite the great deal of attention that has been given to this matter on previous occasions. I hope that as the Christmas recess draws near the Opposition will allow appropriate time for other matters that form part of the legislative program to be considered. They include many important matters and I hope that we begin to get all of our priorities right in regard to this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been doubt as to the propriety of the making of the initial application for consideration. Essentially, as far as we can make out, it was prompted very much by the decision of one man. There was no parliamentary debate concerning it. I believe that it has been difficult to find a cabinet minute which authorised the making of the application. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that if earlier there had been good will and consideration of this matter by the Commonwealth we may not have been considering it tonight. However, the Tasmanian Government had to make a decision. It could not put the matter off indefinitely. Given the available resources, after examining comparative costs and benefits, it decided that a dam should be built. That was the Tasmanian Government's decision. One of the problems of Tasmania is that for too long decisions have been put off, and have not been made. Premier Gray is to be applauded for being prepared to take hard decisions and hard knocks. Australia would be far better off if other State governments were prepared to take hard decisions in a difficult environment. </PARA>
<PARA> There are in the community, and in the Parliament too, many people who would like to see a lot of the big power users in Tasmania-Comalco, Temco, and EZ- wiped out of Tasmania. But I ask honourable senators to think of the employment implications of such actions. The tragedy is that when many of these organisations-for instance, Comalco-came to Tasmania no inducement was offered that they set up rolling mills, which are big employers of labour. One of the difficulties over the years for instance associated with the tremendous hike in power prices, has been that many industries, upon wishing to change to electric boilers have been offered power at Bell Bay thermal power station rates and have had to decide against the change. Up to two years additional blocks of power were being offered, again on the basis of Bell Bay thermal power rates. These were not attractive for or conducive to expansion. As a result, some of the expansion that could have taken place in Tasmania was diverted to the mainland. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the tragedies that we face is that the difficulties arise not from present decisions but from those of even 12 months or two years ago. Many of the job opportunities that could have been present are not present for that reason and I believe that Premier Gray is trying to improve the business climate so that industry will again see an opportunity to set up undertakings or expand in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that one of the tragedies of this debate is that some people have suggested-I mentioned this before-the siting of a thermal power station at Bell Bay. To put a thermal power station in the vicinity of Bell Bay would be a real tragedy because the Tamar has problems with fog. One has only to go to New South Wales or Queensland to see the disgusting sights of factories belching out polluting smoke. It would be a real tragedy if that were to take place in the pretty Tamar Valley in Tasmania. Tasmania certainly has the expertise in hydro- electric power generation. The civil engineers at the Hydro-Electric Commission are ranked, as far as hydro knowledge is concerned, second to none in the world. They have the expertise and it should be developed. There will be a continuing need for power and after this people will be asking: What next? Other rivers could be considered for future development. The point is that the power demand exists now. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that, under the circumstances, at this late stage the Commonwealth has made a very sensible compromise. Jobs are important. They are scarce in Tasmania and our Government in Tasmania has had to take a courageous decision. That decision was overwhelmingly backed by the parliamentarians of both the lower House and the upper House. It is a tragedy that there has been such a high level of interference from outside. People who are unaware of the terrain and the nature of the problems in Tasmania are trying to influence the situation, to the detriment of the people of Tasmania. I would like to see those people who are of a conservation bent do their utmost to try to make sure that we can blend the natural environment with the hydro-electric developmental plans. It is only a very small section of the Franklin River and, apart from a few caves, the majestic beauty of the river will be preserved. One of the tragedies of this whole debate has been the lack of honesty in the presentation of facts and I hope that over time the Tasmanian community will realise some of the falsity that has been spread on the mainland. It is a Tasmanian decision and Tasmanians will have to live with it. I support the Tasmanian Government in the hard decision it has had to make in very difficult times. </PARA>

<PARA> (2) That a Message be sent to the House of Representatives acquainting it of the terms of this resolution and seeking its concurrence. </PARA>
<PARA>In moving the motion, I briefly explain what it is about. It relates to a request for access by an academic researcher from Macquarie University of considerable reputation in the field of social policy who is writing on the history of social security legislation in Australia. She wants access to evidence that was taken in camera by a Joint Committee on Social Security in this Parliament in the period 1941-46. On the face of it, it is remarkably uncontroversial, since it was at least 36 years ago. The present Senate and House of Representatives Standing Orders, however, are such that no access to such material taken on a confidential basis at the time, however long ago, can be granted except by resolution of the Senate. In order to explain the procedures that relate to this matter, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard an exchange of correspondence between myself and the President of the Senate, together with an extract from Hansard of 22 May 1980, which will lay down for the record what the rules are currently understood to be so far as access to such material is concerned. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Mr President,</PARA>
<PARA> I have received correspondence from Dr Sheila Shaver in relation to her request for access to certain materials held by the Australian Archives arising from the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Social Security 1941-1946. I understand this matter has been under consideration by the Presiding Officers.</PARA>
<PARA> I would appreciate your advice as to any decision taken by the Presiding Officers in this matter. My own view is that all material of this kind should be in the public domain after the usual archival period of 30 years, subject, of course, to the usual exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular I would appreciate a response to the following questions:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Why did the resolution of the Senate of 22 May 1980, relating to the release of evidence and records of certain Senate and Joint Committees, specify no period of years after which evidence taken in camera by such a committee or submitted to it on a confidential or restricted basis might, with your permission, be examined by a person in accordance with the resolution?</PARA>
<PARA> 2. In practice, is a specific time period applied to such evidence and if so what is that period?</PARA>
<PARA> 3. If the period applied is greater than the usual archival period of 30 years, what is the reason for the difference?</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Will you now permit the release of documents relating to evidence in camera and confidential reports to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Social Security 1941-1946, being documents all of which are now more than 30 years old?</PARA>

<PARA>30 November 1982</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Evans,</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for your letter of 17 November 1982 in which you raise a number of questions concerning a request by Dr Sheila Shaver for access to in camera material held by the Australian Archives arising from the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Social Security 1941-46. </PARA>
<PARA> As a background to the questions you raise, I advise that the Australian Archives accepts material from the Senate and the House of Representatives on a ''for storage only'' basis and does not hold that material in a normal archival situation as it does for Executive Departments. </PARA>
<PARA> This arrangement exists because Senate Standing Order 308 and House of Representatives Standing Order 340 provide that evidence taken by any Select Committee of the Senate or the House of Representatives and documents presented to such Committee which have not been reported to the relevant House shall not, unless authorised by the relevant House or, in the case of the Senate, by the Committee, be disclosed or published by any member of such Committee or by any other person. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to your inquiry as to any decision taken by the Presiding Officers, I advise that an approach was made by Dr Shaver in November 1981 for access to material held by Archives from the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Social Security, 1941-46, and permission was granted. Dr Shaver recently made a further request to the Clerk of the House of Representatives for access to the in camera and confidential material held by the Australian Archives in respect of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Social Security and was advised that pursuant to the resolutions agreed to by the Senate and the House of Representatives on 22 May 1980, this in camera and confidential material was not available for purposes of research. </PARA>
<PARA> You asked four specific questions, the answers to which are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Question:</PARA>
<PARA> Why did the resolution of the Senate of 22 May 1980, relating to the release of evidence and records of certain Senate and Joint Committees, specify no period or years after which evidence taken in camera by such a committee or submitted to it on a confidential or restricted basis might, with your permission, be examined by a person in accordance with the resolution?</PARA>
<PARA> Answer:</PARA>
<PARA> The resolution agreed to by the Senate and the House of Representatives on 22 May 1980 has modified the operation of the two abovementioned Standing Orders to the extent that the President and/or the Speaker may authorise the release of evidence and records of Parliamentary Commitees which have been held for at least ten years under certain conditions. However, both Houses under the resolution specifically excluded evidence taken in camera or submitted on a confidential or restricted basis from this provision. As I understand it the resolution was considered by the Leaders and the Whips of both Houses and reflects the normal protection afforded to individual witnesses who appear before Parliamentary Committees. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Question:</PARA>
<PARA> In practice, is a specific time period applied to such evidence and if so what is that period?</PARA>
<PARA> Answer:</PARA>
<PARA> Unless the relevant House or Houses decide otherwise no in camera evidence may be released by the Presiding Officers, regardless of the passage of time. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Question:</PARA>
<PARA> If the period applied is greater than the usual archival period of thirty years , what is the reason for the difference?</PARA>
<PARA> Answer:</PARA>
<PARA> See answers to 1 and 2. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Question:</PARA>
<PARA> Will you now permit the release of documents relating to evidence in camera and confidential reports to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Social Security 1941-46 being documents all of which are now more than thirty years old?</PARA>
<PARA> Answer:</PARA>
<PARA> I am unable to permit the release of documents relating to evidence in camera and confidential reports to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Social Security 1941-46 unless the Senate and the House of Representatives agree to a resolution authorising the release of these documents. </PARA>

<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle)-by leave-proposed:</PARA>
<PARA> 1.(A) That the Senate authorises the President of the Senate to permit any person to examine and take extracts from evidence submitted to, or records of, committees which are in the custody of the Senate and which have been in its custody for at least 10 years, provided that such evidence was not taken in camera or submitted on a confidential or restricted basis and provided further that the President reports to the Senate the nature of the documents made available and the person or persons to whom they have been made available; and</PARA>
<PARA> (B) That the release of evidence and records of joint committees be authorised on the joint authority of the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives under the same conditions as provided in paragraph (A).</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That the foregoing resolutions have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the Standing Orders.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. That a message be sent to the House of Representatives transmitting these resolutions for its information and seeking concurrence in that part of the resolutions relating to the evidence and records of joint committees.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator EVANS" NAMEID="VD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The particular material here is described by Dr Shaver as relating to the Chifley Government's attempt to establish a salaried health care system, including abortive negotiations at the time with the British Medical Association. Dr Shaver says that the material appears to have been restricted through simply the mechanical application of the provisions of the House and Senate resolutions on this subject and not to reflect any particular sensitivities. She also says that she gathers from extrinsic evidence that it appears that only a very small proportion of this information contains material about particular individuals. The largest part of it appears to be documentation of a kind which would be released for research use after 30 years without demur under the usual archival practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply make the further point that questions as to the release of such material are clearly matters for Parliament rather than the Executive Government of the day because the Parliament is the custodian of material given in evidence to its committees. But I have agreed in discussions with the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), who has conduct of this crucially important matter for the Government, that it would not be inappropriate, in all the circumstances of the case, for us to have some vetting procedure just to ensure that there is no wildly defamatory material or something of that kind which might cause embarrassment, even after all this time, were it to gain release. So for the present, the agreed motion that I have read out is that the President be authorised to grant access, at his discretion, to this material. I foreshadow, however, that for the future there remains a procedural problem in this area. I shall be seeking leave shortly to move a motion to refer the relevant procedures in relation to these matters to the Standing Orders Committee so that we can have some better clarity about them in future. I hope that this will prove uncontroversial and be passed straight away by the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Evans that this is essentially a matter for the Parliament rather than the Executive Government. The position is that the Parliament has rules which maintain the confidentiality of in camera evidence. Odd as it may seem, there is no established procedure as to how such evidence ought to be released, if it ought to be released. I must say that I speak merely as a member of the Government who was asked to examine the matter; it has not been discussed in the Government party room, which would be, I suppose, the appropriate forum for a parliamentary matter. In my view it would be safe to rely upon the President's discretion in this matter. I make the point that the caution that I have shown in my dealings with Senator Evans on the matter does not reflect any concern on the part of the Government that it might be covering up some of the sins and omissions of its past, because the inquiry took place during a quite lengthy period, the only lengthy period, of Labor government in this country. It is a matter simply of trying to ensure that any interests that were brought before a parliamentary committee and given the benefit and protection of confidentiality should, even at this late stage, be treated in a reasonable way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On behalf of the Government, I indicate my agreement with the course of action set out in Senator Evans's amended motion. I agree with it in light of his foreshadowing of a reference to the Standing Orders Committee so that in a proper parliamentary way we can consider a sensible set of rules which will enable us to deal with a problem which I am sure will recur. Whilst I cannot in a sense deliver the Government vote because some of my colleagues may as senators take another view, I indicate that as far as the Government is concerned the motion is acceptable. I think it is a most reasonable way in which to tackle the problem. I find it very strange that it has not been tackled before and an answer defined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose this motion. Presumably this is a desire on the part of the Australian Democrats to spend yet more of the Senate's time on non-government business. I do not think I need to labour the point. I will not speak at length since I always think it rather odd to speak at length when one is concerned about the amount of time available for legislation or other purposes. But in opposing this motion I wish simply to indicate that we have spent a great deal of time on the matter of South West Tasmania. There has already been a very full debate in this place. A large amount of legislation is outstanding. Senator Evans has been desperately anxious to deal with the National Crimes Commission Bill, as I have, for about a week and a half. The failure of the Senate to come to grips with the legislation which is still to be dealt with is something which is of concern to many of us. I suggest that this is not the time to suspend Standing Orders and to try to rearrange business. Rather, I think we should get on with the program in accordance with the timetable.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -When the Senate adjourned last night I was speaking to the National Crimes Commission Bill. I had looked at the purpose of the Bill as stated in the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). I had indicated that I was not surprised, since the McCabe-Lafranchi report and the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, that the emphasis has now been upon organised crime. I had looked at the nature of organised crime , the types of criminals involved and the techniques and methods which they adopt. I had listed the large number of royal commissions which have indicated that not only is organised crime not being suppressed by conventional methods of law enforcement but also it appeared to be increasing. I had accepted the importance of finding an answer to organised crime and the assertions of Costigan that the unchecked operation of large scale criminal activity of the type described in his report can lead only to a breakdown in law and order and the eventual destruction of the society in which we live.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I then looked at the deficiencies of the current system in an effort to determine whether such deficiencies can be overcome by the provision of greater resources or whether twentieth century organised crime requires a new approach, a new methodology. I identified the deficiencies of jurisdictional limitations- that is, the restrictions in both geographical matters and in separate criminal codes. I identified the deficiency of a lack of powers. In the light of such deficiencies I then commenced to look at the advantages of the proposed National Crimes Commission, starting with the additional power born out of the experience of royal commissions-that of compelling evidence on oath at the time of investigation. That required a digression into whether the power was consistent with the protection of basic civil liberties. I stated that on the Bill which was presented to the Senate, as amended in the other place, I was reasonably satisfied on that aspect although there were several other matters which would be raised at the Committee stage. I had looked at the advantage of putting together interdisciplinary teams of experts to analyse information. </PARA>
<PARA> The third advantage to which I wish to refer is the potential for involving the eventual prosecuting counsel in the development of the case. This is, of course, possible within the existing system but demarcation as a result of practice and tradition has limited its use. In Australia we do not have the opportunity available in the United States of involving counsel at an earlier stage by virtue of its system of the use of grand juries. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth advantage that I wish to point out to the Senate is that the Commission has the potential to look at organised crime from a national viewpoint. That, I believe, is particularly critical because criminals do not respect State boundaries. There is the additional advantage promoted on behalf of the National Crimes Commission that it would utilise a computer-based data management system, something which is essential to the efficient analysis of information. I must confess that I do not place great weight on that advantage because there is no reason why it cannot be as efficiently used and operated by the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence. Therefore, I accept that the conventional law enforcement agencies are not adequately suppressing organised crime in Australia, that a new approach is necessary and that a National Crimes Commission has the potential to assist significantly in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The question then arises: How should it be structured and to whom should it be responsible? As most criminal law within Australia remains the province of the States it appears obvious to me that the full co-operation of the States is a pre-requisite to the success of a National Crimes Commission. Earlier this year we read of the Cabinet proposal. One of the media reports at that time said that the Cabinet proposal was to establish a 'Joint standing Commonwealth-State Crimes Commission with powers to police both Federal and State laws'. That appeared to me to make sense. What we have here, however, is a National Crimes Commission that is limited to breaches of Commonwealth law and corruption by Commonwealth officials. There are provisions for the States to come into the fold but they are meaningless unless the States are prepared to do so. It appears from various Press releases of the State police ministers that they are not prepared to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, it appears to me that the body that we are setting up does not overcome the geographical or jurisdictional boundaries that are a major difficulty and disadvantage of the current system and should have been a major advantage of the new Commission. Where the breakdown occurred, I do not know. I read that the States said that the Commonwealth announced this new structure whilst negotiations were still taking place. But the breakdown does no credit to either the Commonwealth or the States because the most desirable structure is not being implemented. The States do not have a good record in co-operation and co-ordination in the areas of organised crime. In information gathering they have improved the position so that from 1979 the majority have set up criminal intelligence units. One commentator, C. Williams of the criminology department of the University of Melbourne, said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is only limited interaction between the State CIUs. </PARA>
<PARA>However, to give credit where it is due, in the last two years things appear to have changed. The Police Ministers Council has achieved the development of a number of national co-operative initiatives. In the criminal intelligence area it has set up the body that I mentioned a moment ago, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence. The Commonwealth Government Directory, when referring to the functions of that Bureau, states:</PARA>
<PARA> Facilitate the collection, collation, analysis and dissemination of criminal intelligence. Provide such intelligence to the Police Forces of the Commonwealth , the States and the Northern Territory to enable them to combat organised crime in Australia, particularly illicit drug trafficking. </PARA>
<PARA>That body commenced operation only this year. From one Press report I read, it seems that it is expected to focus on organised crime, which is familiar because it is really the subject of this debate, drug trafficking, illegal gambling and international organised crime. It is true that it was set up to provide intelligence to the State police forces and to the Australian Federal Police and the Northern Territory police force but it could provide such similar intelligence information to a joint Commonwealth-State crimes commission. I understand also from some of the Press reports that at the time of the termination of the Commonwealth-State negotiations that proposal was in fact being promoted by at least one of the States. The police Ministers point also to other initiatives such as the National Police Research Unit, the National Institute of Forensic Science, the upgrading and relocation of the Australian Police College, which is, of course, relevant because of Costigan's criticisms of police capabilities. They are achievements which are pointed to as having occurred in only the last two years. </PARA>
<PARA> Whereas I support the setting up of a national crimes commission, I am disappointed that it is not being set up as a Commonwealth-State body within the spirit of co-operative federalism which is necessary for it to be effective. So even at this late stage I would urge the Government to hold over this Bill and make a last ditch effort to negotiate a co-operative scheme with the States. If it is the view of the Commonwealth that it cannot negotiate anything better than is presently before the Senate, I would support the Bill because, for the reasons that I have indicated, I support the principle of a national crimes commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I would then urge the States to join in the Commonwealth Commission. I think that it is probably better to refer to it as a Commonwealth commission rather than a national commission, but I fear, on the basis of what I have read, that the States will not be willing to join. But even if they can be persuaded to join, which would make a new body far more satisfactory from my observations, a number of questions remain. For instance, what is to be the role of the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence in relation to the Commission?</PARA>
<PARA> We have an obligation to avoid duplication and misdirection of resources. If we look at the proposed functions and charter of the new Crimes Commission and the functions of the ABCI, as I have just indicated to the Senate, already there is duplication. Why can the ABCI not act as the central bureau for criminal intelligence in a similar way to the body in Canada? Why can it not act as a repository for all criminal intelligence reports across the country, including those of the National Crimes Commission? We could then develop a national criminal information bank. </PARA>
<PARA> What is to be the role of the Australian Institute of Criminology? It is a joint venture of the Commonwealth and States in the systematic and co-ordinated organisation of criminology research. The National Crimes Commission is to have a function of making recommendations to government. But surely directions for government legislation and policy should be coming from the research of the AIC, yet it is in fact being downgraded. Its effective establishment is now only just over one-third of that approved in 1975. In my opinion, the proposed National Crimes Commission should concentrate itself as an investigative body of organised crime with a view to successful prosecutions. This would provide a deterrent and would be a worthwhile task for it, without it attempting to assume the responsibilities within the expertise of others. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that organised crime is facilitated by outdated criminal laws . Crime is political because we in fact define what is crime. Mr Justice Kirby, Chairman of the Australian Law Reform Commission, has stressed the need to relook at such sensitive and difficult issues as marihuana, prostitution, consenting homosexual conduct, gambling, liquor intake and indecent literature. I refer briefly to an article by Richard Hall which appeared in the Australian Financial Review in May 1982. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> As for SP betting, the next major corruption problem in New South Wales-</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to after-drinking hours-</PARA>
<PARA>and probably throughout Australia, by now it is surely clear that a lot of punters would always want the choice of odds. </PARA>
<PARA> In an age where computers take rockets to Mars it should be possible for the State totalisator agency boards to devise a parallel system that can give punters odds when they phone up. </PARA>
<PARA>He is, of course, indicating that it is in many ways easy to remove, simply by legislation, a lot of the minor criminal activities upon which serious organised crime fosters. We also must not use the National Crimes Commission as an excuse not to keep upgrading or updating State and Federal police forces. Where limited resources are involved, as is always the case, this temptation must be avoided. We must work towards a national criminal code. When negotiations with the Commonwealth broke down, a spokesman for the Queensland Government said that Queensland would not support any body which could initiate prosecutions under Queensland law in Queensland courts. I find that type of statement quite frightening. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, major organised crime must be identified and pursued on a national basis. There must be a body to determine priorities and to co-ordinate intelligence investigational activities. This must be the role of the new National Crimes Commission. It must not be that of a super sleuth force. Let us leave that to the existing law enforcement agencies and ensure that with proper resources they are lifted to that level. Let us find a way of making it a co- operative Commonwealth-State venture so that it has full opportunity to work effectively. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The main function of the National Crimes Commission Bill which we are discussing tonight, finally, is to establish a National Crimes Commission whose main function is to investigate organised crime and official corruption with a view to prosecution action where appropriate. It has a secondary function in that the Commission will be authorised to conduct investigations of a more general nature. To assist in both of those attributes the Bill gives the Commission important powers necessary to its function. The explanatory memorandum adds this rider to that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, these powers are made subject to appropriate safeguards to protect the rights of individuals. </PARA>
<PARA>Some concern has been expressed in reports from and by the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills that, in fact, the legislation does not go far enough to safeguard and to protect the rights of individuals in certain circumstances. I understand that most of the Australian Labor Party amendments set out to correct that as does the one amendment that the Australian Democrats have to the National Crimes Commission Bill. I will say more about that later. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been mentioned by previous speakers that there has been considerable concern in the community over the years that the traditional law enforcement agencies that we have in this country are, for one reason or another, not appropriate, not adequate, not sufficiently staffed or not sufficiently empowered to cope with the burgeoning criminal activities that are emerging in this country, particularly with regard to the sophistication and the organisation of these activites. I do not intend to list-they have been listed by others-the royal commissions and the reports from those commissions that have indicated this trend and have indicated that we need further, better or different investigatory bodies with wider powers than are presently available to the existing law enforcement agencies in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to those royal commission reports numerous newspaper articles have mentioned this fact. A couple of the most recent ones have appeared as late as July of this year and later. I would like to refer to an article in the Australian of 16 July which refers to a four-man deputation which advised the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that a proposed permanent National Crimes Commission should have access to tax records and so on. Included in the article was the comment from Mr Ballantine-Jones that the proposed Crimes Commission had to be established on a national basis and had to be permanent to have any impact . He is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> 'At the moment we feel unco-ordinated procedures between State and Federal agencies are working to the benefit of criminals, and are not giving the community the type of protection it needs'. </PARA>
<PARA>I would suggest that that comment, amongst a whole host of others, refutes the sorts of States rights arguments that have been put forward by people such as Senator Crichton-Browne who argues that this Bill infringes the constitutional rights of the States. I would suggest that that argument would be a perfectly valid one if the criminals only knew that was what they were supposed to be doing, that they remained within State boundaries and allowed the State police force to apprehend them there. The police would need to use their law enforcement powers within the States on criminals who remained within the States . As it is, we had a situation that arose recently in which a policeman had difficulty in crossing a border simply to chase an ordinary criminal. Complaints were raised at that stage that there may have been an infringement of the constitutional powers of the police of one State moving into another State. I suggest that the problem is much more difficult when we are trying to cope with the extremely organised crime that is involved in drug running and various other forms of racketeering. </PARA>
<PARA> The Age of 24 June reports a call by a senior Victorian policeman for the establishment of a Crimes Commission to monitor organised crime. The policeman concerned was the Deputy Chief Commissioner of Police, Mr Rod Hall, who told a royal commission that a Crimes Commission should initiate or recommend action against organised crime. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hall said that in 1978 the Victorian Criminal Intelligence Bureau had nominated more than 40 people suspected of being involved in organised crime in Victoria, who should be investigated. </PARA>
<PARA> But he said the force's resources allowed it to concentrate only on one or two of these people at a time. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hall said the Victorian Police's operational and other commitments did not enable investigators to devote much time to organised crime. </PARA>
<PARA>Earlier in the debate Senator Missen touched on the role played by the normal police agencies in this country and indicated, whether intentionally or not, a rather disparaging attitude to the police forces of this country. I cannot speak for the police forces of other States, but I know that most South Australians are proud of theirs. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator. It is pleasing to hear an endorsement of that from the other side of the chamber. The comments made by Senator Missen, which I understand related to the Williams Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs, seemed to give the police forces in this country a sort of dumb cop tag which I do not believe they deserve. He suggested that part of the problem was that they were not intelligent enough, that university graduates were not being engaged at the senior levels and so on. He spoke as if a university degree somehow confers greater wisdom and ability on a law enforcement officer. He argued that the criminals were smarter than the police although I am not aware of too many criminals who have university degrees. I could not quite follow his argument. I suspect that in fact it is less to do with the academic qualifications of members of the police forces in this country , which are not as adequate as perhaps some of us would like, than it is to do with their manpower and the powers that in fact they have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am certainly not advocating that the police be given more wide, sweeping powers than they have or the kinds of powers envisaged for the National Crimes Commission. However, I am saying that it is not fair to imply or to assert that the police of this country are inadequate because they have not sufficient university graduates among their number. Nor am I sure that corruption will end in police forces, where it does exist, simply because some policemen have degrees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), in his second reading speech , indicated support for these calls for a National Crimes Commission. The Minister said, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a fresh look must be had at existing arrangements and institutions for the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences of a serious kind, particularly offences in the nature of organised crime. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . existing Australian law enforcement efforts need to be supplemented by the establishment of a new standing body with the necessary expertise and powers to make an effective attack on organised crime . . . the National Crimes Commission which will be given the functions and powers necessary to deal with forms of crime with which existing law enforcement bodies now have difficulty in coping. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister went on to repeat that the intention was to supplement, not supplant, existing law enforcement agencies. On those grounds alone, the Australian Democrats are very much supportive of what the Government intends to do. This is not to say that we find the Bill perfect. Even the Government did not come up, first time around, with a perfect Bill. That is indicated by the fact that in the House of Representatives a number of Government amendments had to be introduced and the Government accepted a number of amendments from both a member of its own back bench and from the Australian Labor Party. They certainly improve the Bill in line with the comments of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee with regard to probable infringements of civil liberties and so on. Nevertheless , the amendments have not brought the Bill to the peak that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, as indicated by its latest report, would like to be reached. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that on 2 September 1982 the Australian quoted Senator Chipp as saying that the setting up of the Commission was one of the most commendable things done by Mr Fraser. I would like to endorse that here and now. It is for this reason that, provided a number of amendments proposed by the Labor Party and by the Democrats are passed by the Senate, the Democrats have no intention of supporting a call by anybody that this Bill be referred to a committee. We state that for a number of reasons, the most important of which is that clause 41 seems to proclude the necessity to send the Bill to a committee. In effect, it is a sunset clause which brings the Bill into operation for five years. Should any loopholes, abuses or infringements of civil liberties become apparent in that time it will certainly be possible for the Government to take amending action to mitigate them. If, at the end of five years, no such action has been taken it will be up to the Parliament to prevent the National Crimes Commission from continuing beyond that initial five year period. </PARA>
<PARA> The main complaints that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee had about the Bill related to such things as the ambiguity about the types of offences the Commission can investigate; the lack of specificity concerning what might be seized under a search warrant; the authority to seize passports for up to three months; the fact that there appeared to be insufficient protection for individual reputations in the Commission's public hearings procedure; the absence of limits on cross-examination; the power to summon persons to give evidence without adequate notice of the nature of the inquiry; the failure to incorporate a person's right to refuse to testify against his or her spouse; inadequate definition of what constitutes a reasonable excuse for failure to produce requested documents; the indeterminability of possible gaol sentences for contempt; inconsistent penalty provisions for false or misleading evidence; inappropriate, severe penalties for contempt of the Commission, including the inadequately defined offences of insulting or interrupting the Commission; and the absence of the requirment of secrecy for Commission staff.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, a number of the amendments introduced in the lower House satisfied some of those doubts raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and a number of other doubts are also attacked, we say, by the amendments proposed by the Australian Labor Party. The absence of a requirement of secrecy for Commission staff is the substance of the Australian Democrat amendment to clause 36, which will be moved in the Committee stage. It is interesting to note that the Labor Party moved an amendment in the lower House, one which it does not intend proceeding with in the Senate, relating to the rights of a person to refuse to testify against his or her spouse. Although I know that Senator Evans' s reasons for not continuing with this amendment is different from my objection to it, I commend him for his action since it seems to me that this is an anachronism. I am more than pleased to see it not included in the National Crimes Commission Bill and hope that eventually it sees its way out of all the other legislation in this country in which it presently has a place. There is absolutely no reason why a spouse should not testify. As I said before, it is an anachronism. It is a vestige of when wives were nothing more than chattels. They had no rights of their own and it was a protection for husbands rather than anything else. </PARA>

<PARA> There is indubitably a need for a National Crimes Commission. There is a need for some organisation with fairly sweeping powers to investigate national crime at a national level. It is interesting that of all the speakers on this Bill only one was not a member of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. I wonder whether that is because other senators are more concerned with States rights than individual rights or because they felt they did not have time to consider it. The Bill has been mooted, the problem of national crime has been mooted and the need for a National Crimes Commission has been mooted for long enough for other honourable senators to have had the opportunity to prepare some sort of attitude to the legislation, so perhaps the make-up of the speakers on this Bill indicates those who cherish more than others the concept of civil liberties. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats do support this legislation. We do intend to support a majority of the Australian Labor Party's amendments. We do commend the government for taking action to correct what is becoming an offensive intrusion of organised criminal activity in this country and we hope, in turn, to get the support of both the Government and the Australian Labor Party for our amendment to the National Crimes Commission Bill, which seeks to include secrecy provisions with relation to staff, members and counsel. I hope also to get support for our amendment to the Royal Commissions Amendment Bill which provides for compensation for witnesses appearing before a commission. I do not intend to say any more about that at the moment but will take the opportunity to speak on it during the Committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply -I thank all honourable senators who have spoken on the second reading in what has been a constructive debate. One feature of the debate has been widespread agreement among those speaking as to the need to take some new action to cope with organised crime in Australia. I do not wish to canvass the material set out very fully in other senators' speeches and set out in the second reading speech that was brought down setting out the Government's position at the beginning of this debate. But the acknowledgment of the reality of organised crime in Australia, the concern which has been evidenced about the inability of the existing instruments we have in the community to deal with it, and the common acceptance of the need for some fresh approach, were features of the debate. There are, of course, differences of opinion on some of the detail, and a couple of the contributors, in particular Senator Martyr and Senator Crichton-Browne expressed a concern about the interaction between the Commonwealth and the States with respect to the proposed National Crimes Commission. But I think that even in their speeches there is an acknowledgment of the reality of the problem with which the Government is attempting to come to grips.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this response I do not intend to spend time on the points of detail that have been raised in the debate. They will be recanvassed in the Committee debate , and the Government's position, which has already been stated on most of the amendments in the House of Representatives, can be restated then. But out of respect for the very considered views which have been put down by honourable senators, I wish to make some comment in response. Senator Evans's contribution, consistent with the contributions of Senator Missen, Senator Tate and Senator Hill, brought out the general support that exists for the National Crimes Commission Bill. As I say, there was a good deal of comment on the detail of the Bill with which Senator Evans was prepared to take issue, but I note at this stage the support for the second reading which was foreshadowed in his speech, and the fact that by deliberative processes-which are really similar to the deliberative processes which have led the Government to its conclusion-he led us through to the point of saying that this was the option which needed to be pursued. That reinforces the validity of the Government's stance in this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was Senator Evans and, indeed, Senator Tate gave a similar analysis which very much reflects the sort of material which is contained in the paper which was put before the States by the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, and to which I think a number of senators have had access. I do not wish to weary the Senate but the reality of the existence of organised crime, the fact that there are limited options that we can pursue to come to grips with the problem that we have not come to grips with successfully in the past and the fact that the logical processes lead us to have a specialist body with a high degree of technical expertise and a high degree of intellectual skill to undertake the very difficult task of the gathering together of material and its subsequent analysis, is a matter on which it seems there is largely common ground in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose the major issue which has been raised relates relly to the question of the desire which I think was expressed by all contributors that there should be a high degree of Commonwealth-State co-operation in this area. A number of senators stressed the concerns of the States in the administration of criminal law, of the courts and State responsibility for police activities. I wish therefore to respond in more detail on that aspect of the debate than on the other matters of detail which were raised because those matters are less squarely raised by the debate which we may have at the Committee stage of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> From the outset the Commonwealth has kept the States fully informed of its concerns about the growth of organised crime in Australia and of the difficulties encountered by regular police forces in dealing with the problem. The matter has not been raised with the States only very recently. It was first raised at a meeting of Police Ministers in May 1982. Indeed, at the Premiers Conference of June 1982 at which I was present the Prime Minsiter (Mr Malcolm Fraser) raised with the Premiers the possible need to establish a new body in the form of a crimes commission. The Premiers agreed that the proposal should be referred to in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and the Australian Police Ministers Council, to report back by 1 October 1982. At that stage there was some indication of the desire of the Commonwealth to deal with this matter in a prompt way. After all, with the sort of evidence which has come before the Government, both from the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and from other reports which have been referred to in the debate, that is an understandable concern of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> After the Premiers Conference there was a series of meetings of Attorneys- General and Police Ministers. At meetings of Attorneys-General and Police Ministers in August 1982 the Commonwealth circulated a paper making a specific proposal for the establishment of a crimes commission along the lines of the present Bill so that the Commonwealth proposition was squarely put before the States in August of this year. The meetings that were held then culminated in a joint meeting of Attorneys-General and Police Ministers on 24 September 1982. That meeting has been the subject of comment during the debate. As well as the Commonwealth proposal a number of State proposals were discussed and, while indicating that the Commonwealth position was based on the Commonwealth proposal previously circulated, Commonwealth Ministers indicated at that meeting that States' proposals merited further consideration and would be considered by the Commonwealth Cabinet on 28 September 1982. It needs to be made clear that at that same meeting Commonwealth Ministers made it clear that there was no commitment by the Commonwealth to hold action until the next proposed ministerial meeting on 5 November 1982. I am assured by Ministers present-I was not present-that this was an express matter, that there could be no guarantee that a decision would not be taken on 5 November. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequent to the meeting in September, there was Cabinet consideration of the matter and careful consideration was given to the States' proposal. The Government decided that, because of the need to take effective steps to combat organised crime, it would and indeed must adhere to the Commonwealth proposal. The States and the Northern Territory were then informed by telex on 13 October 1982 of that decision and that legislation for this purpose would be introduced in the present parliamentary sittings. The Commonwealth was willing to continue discussions with the States with a view to accommodating, if possible, particular suggestions that the States might wish to make. Subsequently, at the instigation of some of the States, the meeting of 5 November was cancelled on the grounds that since the Bill was to be introduced, no useful purpose would be served by having a meeting. That is not a matter with which the Commonwealth agreed, but that was the reason for the cancellation. That was a view put by the States, not by the Commonwealth which was prepared to proceed with the meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also the consideration that South Australia had an election the following day and Ministers from that State could not in any event attend. After that meeting, consultations still continued at officer level with at least some of the States. As a result of concerns expressed by those States, amendments were moved by the Government in the other chamber to the following effect: First , an amendment was made to ensure that where a State had conferred powers or functions on the Commission, agreement of that State would be obtained before any directions or guidelines were given to the Commission with respect to the performance of those functions. Secondly, an amendment was made to the clause dealing with the transmission of evidence to make it clear that any investigations the Commission referred to in that clause must be limited to the function of the Commission elsewhere specified in the Bill. Thirdly, a requirement was imposed on the Commission to inform the appropriate State Minister of its operations in respect of functions conferred by the law of that State. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from those changes the Bill made very careful provision for participation by the States and the Northern Territory in several possible ways. Under the first procedure the States could confer powers and functions on the Commission. Under the second, functions or powers could be conferred by a State on a member of the Commission to be performed in conjunction with his powers and functions under the proposed Act. These provisions, and the amendments moved by the Government in the other chamber, demonstrate that the Commonwealth has a continuing desire that the States participate in this national effort and that we are prepared to take appropriate steps to that end. Indeed, we are ready to continue discussions with the States as to possible forms of their participation . </PARA>
<PARA> We would share the view which has been expressed by honourable senators in this debate and we certainly would have preferred that satisfactory arrangements had been settled with the States before the introduction of the legislation, but the exigencies of the parliamentary timetable and our belief that there is a pressing need for action to stem the growth of organised crime in the Commonwealth's own area of concern precluded deferral of the introduction of the legislation. The position is that the way remains open for the States to join in this important effort and, indeed, the Commonwealth hopes that there will be substantial co-operation between us. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just go back over some of that ground to point out some of the matters which I think were overlooked in the speeches which addressed themselves to this point. The fact is that there were two different forums of consultation-both Attorneys-General and Police Ministers. I think Senator Critchton-Browne referred to a working party. That was a reference to a working party which operated in the police forum. As I have said, the joint meeting of Attorneys- General and Police Ministers on 24 September had not only proposals from the States in front of it but also the Commonwealth's own proposal. It is important that there was an indication at that meeting that that still was the Commonwealth's view although there was to be Government consideration of the view then being promoted by the States. In fact, we decided that the alternative State proposal was not feasible, largely on the ground that it involved fragmentation of effort. As I said, the States were advised of that on 13 October by telex. The Bills were distributed to the States at a further meeting on 21 October. At that stage State officers declined to proceed further with the meeting, but it was open to the States to make suggestions at that time. It would not be correct to say that the Commonwealth was drawing on information learned from a joint working party in the process of drafting that legislation. Senator Durack had indicated the lines of the Commonwealth legislation at the initial Commonwealth-State Ministers meeting on 23 July. The States have been invited to submit or to indicate their specific concerns. As I have already said , changes have been made to the Bill in light of some of the concerns which have been expressed by the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The suggestion that the solution to the problem lies in the upgrading of the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence was carefully considered by the Government. Of course, the fact that the Commonwealth is still agreeable to upgrading that unit is set out in the second reading speech. But the proposal as it was being developed would involve giving drastically different functions to the Bureau, which is now an intelligence gathering body. As has been generally agreed in speeches, as was recommended by Mr Costigan and as is the view of the Government, the key to the crimes commission proposal is the special powers which would be given to the Commission to require oral answers and the production of documents. It would be difficult to justify vesting such powers in a body such as the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence. In the same way the sort of people who are appropriate to lead and direct a body with the powers and role contemplated for the Crimes Commission would be different in capacity, background and experience from the persons who might be appropriate to head the Bureau of Criminal Intelligence. It is also incorrect to claim that the States saw-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that is correct. That is why I indicated that it is a matter that will require further discussion between the Commonwealth and the States. But it would be a very odd situation if the Bureau had useful information and it was not made available to a body which was investigating organised crime on behalf of the Commonwealth in areas of Commonwealth responsibility and competence. Before the questions were raised, to which I responded, I was dealing with the claim, that the States saw an upgraded Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence as the only solution. In fact, the solution preferred by the States on 24 September was a series of ad hoc royal commissions with some attempt at co-ordination by an office of special commissions, with an upgraded Bureau of Criminal Intelligence being a subsidiary part of that general proposal. The objection to this scheme in the Commonwealth' s view was that it was a fragmentation of effort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not wish again to canvass the sort of concerns which have been expressed by the Government, many honourable senators and Mr Costigan about the fact that the traditional royal commission is not the perfect model for the pursuit of organised crime leading through to prosecution. But the alternative proposal that there should be a series of royal commissions is one which I believe flies in the face of arguments which have been very broadly advanced in the debate on this Bill. I do not wish to prolong the Senate further. It would be useful if we at least advanced the Committee debate some way along the track this evening. I thank the honourable senators, as I said before, who have contributed to what I think has been a thoughtful and constructive debate. I commend the Bill to the Senate. I express the view on behalf of the Government that it is high time that organised crime was dealt with more effectively in Australia than it has been in the past. The Government puts forward this proposal for a crimes commission in the confident expectation that it will lead to a more effective attack on something which is of great concern to much of the community. </PARA>

<PARA> Page 4, clause 7, sub-clause (2), leave out the sub-clause, insert the following sub-clause:</PARA>
<PARA> '(2) In this section, 'offence' means an offence-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) relating to organised criminal activities, that is to say, activities that appear to involve a number of offences connected with one another, several offenders and substantial planning and organisation;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) involving the use of sophisticated methods, planning or techniques; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) relating to bribery or corruption involving officers of the Commonwealth or officers of a Territory.'. </PARA>
<PARA>This is probably the most important of all the Opposition's proposed amendments to this Bill. It goes to the jurisdiction of the National Crimes Commission and the matters in respect of which it is to have powers of investigation. The basic aim of the amendment, which I will explain in a little more detail in a moment, is to narrow the scope of the investigative jurisdiction of the Commission to something rather less than the enormous width that is encompassed by the present provision. The scope of the investigative jurisidiction of the Commission can best be appreciated by reading part of clause 7 (1) (a) as it presently stands. The clause states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the functions of the Commission are-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to investigate of its own motion or at the request of the Attorney-General-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) any circumstance suggesting that an offence may have been . . . committed against a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) any allegation that an offence has been, or is being, committed against a law of the Commonwealth or of a territory;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) any circumstance suggesting that a person has or may have, or any allegation that a person has, influenced or attempted to influence an officer of the Commonwealth . . . to do any . . . thing contrary to law or to his duty . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (iv) any activity that is, or appears to be, impeding the implementation or enforcement of a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory;</PARA>
<PARA>It will be appreciated that the Commission can, of its own motion if need be, without any reference from the Attorney-General, embark upon an investigation of any matter that occurs to it in relation to the possible breach of any law at all of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is this width or potential width of the jurisdiction of the Commission that has set so many nerve ends jangling among those who have been worried about the potential implications for this Commission should Australia move into a period of McCarthyist witch hunting of the kind, which, regrettably, has not been all that unfamiliar in our past and certainly not at all unfamiliar in the past of such countries as the United States of America which have been very keen on crimes commissions and similar bodies of this kind. To the extent that this body will retain something of an inquisitorial set of powers and to the extent that its jurisdiction will enable it to range as broadly as the present clause does, this is indeed a potentially dangerous institution. It must be appreciated that although there is in sub- clause (2) of clause 7 some attempt to restrict the scope of the investigative powers that the Commission may exercise, this is not mandatory in its effect and has no legal effect other than an exhortation to the Commission to confine itself to the particular matters here set out. To clarify what I am saying let me read sub-clause (2). It states:</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Commission shall, in the course of investigating circumstances, allegations and activities referred to in paragraph (1) (a), seek, so far as practicable, to direct its activities in relation to-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) organized criminal activities, that is to say, offences that appear to be connected with one another and involve several offenders and substantial planning and organization;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) offences involving the use of sophisticated methods, planning or techniques ;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) bribery or corruption involving officers of the Commonwealth or officers of a Territory; and</PARA>
<PARA>This is expressed much more widely-</PARA>
<PARA> (d) other offences of kinds that persons or bodies engaged in law enforcement are experiencing special difficulty in investigating. </PARA>
<PARA>Even if one takes this purported qualification of the otherwise very broad ambit of clause 7 liberally, it will still be appreciated by honourable senators that the width of the jurisdiction that is available to the Commission is enormous. Moreover, I repeat the point that I made that sub-clause (2) as it presently stands does not have any actual legal effect; it is merely exhortatory. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Opposition seeks to achieve by its amendment is to narrow very substantially the scope of clause 7 by using, but in different contexts, some of those concepts that appear in the present draft of sub-clause (2). For those who have the Bill in front of them, what we have done in essence is to pick up sub- paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of sub-clause (2) as they presently stand-that is, the reference to organised crime, offences involving the use of sophisticated methods, planning or techniques, and bribery or corruption of the Commonwealth or Territory officers. We have built that back into the basic statement of the jurisdiction of the Commission in clause 7 (1) (a) by saying that these are the sorts of offences and only the sorts of offences that can be investigated by the Commission. I think that is a very important amendment.</PARA>
<PARA> The need to keep the ambit of the Commission narrowly directed towards organised crime properly so called or definitions of offences that are limited in the way I have indicated becomes particularly acute if one starts to look about the statute books with perhaps a rather jaundiced or sceptical eye and thinking about the context in which, if this amendment does not go through, the Crimes Commission could spread its wings. For example, if one looks at the existing Commonwealth Crimes Act one finds the notoriously broad ranging set of essentially political offences which are contained in the early sections of that Act and which deal with crimes such as treachery, sabotage, seditious enterprise and so on which are capable of enormously wide political application should a government or a crimes commission investigating possible breaches of these provisions be minded to embark upon them. Let us take section 24D of the existing Crimes Act which makes an offence the writing, printing, uttering or publication of any seditious words. Seditious words are defined as words which bring the Sovereign into hatred or contempt and which can be described as exciting disaffection against the government of the Commonwealth or against either House of the Parliament or against the connection of the Queen's Dominions under the Crown. So much for what could be described as fairly routine expressions of republican sentiment. They are technically caught by the extraordinarily wide language and rather ancient language of section 24D. Someone who is engaged in promoting feelings of ill-will or hostility between different classes of subjects so as to endanger the peace, order and so on can also come within the scope of section 24D. The mere allegation that someone may be about to engage in this type of activity could, if clause 7 of this proposed Act stays unamended, be brought within the scope of a Crimes Commission investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, if one has regard to the provisions in the Crimes Act governing official secrecy one will see that section 70 deals with the prohibition of the disclosure of information by Commonwealth officers. Section 76 deals with the wilful obstruction of or resistance to Commonwealth officers in the discharge of their duties. That is very wide. More particularly, relating to official secrets , section 79 makes it an offence to communicate Commonwealth material to any unauthorised person. This again is the sort of thing that could come within the scope of a MacCarthyist operation should circumstances change and the Crimes Commission be minded to embark upon this. Section 30B, the absolutely extraordinary provision of the Crimes Act, relates to the membership of unlawful associations-unlawful associations being described elsewhere in the Act as bodies which advocate or encourage the overthrow of the Constitution by force or violence, the overthrow of the established government or the destruction or injury of property of the Commonwealth or property used in trade and commerce. An organisation affiliated with any organisation which advocates or encourages any of these doctrines or practices is caught by the scope of this provision, and so on and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there are provisions which have been the subject of debate in this chamber . They relate, for example, to uranium. Under the Atomic Energy Act it is an offence to communicate certain restricted information, to acquire or to remove information and to unlawfully communicate information with an intent to prejudice defence and so on. I simply make the point-I could go on making it ad nauseam were I to spend more time scouring the Commonwealth statute book-that there are an enormous array of crimes on the statute book, some of them ancient, some of them of more modern creation, which have the potential to be used as vehicles for political persecution by a crimes commission that happened to choose to embark upon a McCarthyist inquisitorial enterprise of this kind. I am not suggesting that that is within anyone's immediate contemplation at the moment but when we are legislating in this area we have to approach the matter with a jaundiced, sceptical eye and with a view to what words can mean rather than perhaps in the first instance what they are likely to be applied to mean. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for all these reasons that we argue that the scope of section 7 must be drastically restricted. It is argued by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) in response to this kind of concern, which was expressed by the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills, that to set even the rather wide-ranging definitions as to the jurisdiction of the Commission, to build these back into section 7 in the way that I am proposing, would be to create an opportunity for endless litigation by people the subject of investigation by the Commission who could then be in a position to argue that the particular investigation was beyond the Commission's statutory charter. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a point that has to be given some weight, but I make two answers in respect of it. The first answer is that I think that perhaps overstates the extent to which attacks could be launched on the jurisdiction of the Commission. Provided the Commission is acting in reasonable good faith, it would be very difficult to establish that the kinds of things with which, say, the Costigan Royal Commission, with its orientation, was concerned would not be covered by this language. That is to say, it was concerned with offences or possible offences relating to organised criminal activities involving the use of sophisticated methods or relating to bribery or corruption of Commonwealth officers. Those concepts are very large and would not give very much scope for any ordinary kind of crimes commission investigation of the kind that is no doubt being contemplated by the Commonwealth as being sabotaged by adventurous litigation of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA> The other answer I make is that even if there would remain some residual scope for destructive or obstructive litigation of the kind the Commonwealth is proposing, that is a price we ought to be prepared to pay for the guarantee that this legislation will not be able to be used in the way that so many people have feared that it might be used; that is as a vehicle for the political oppression of dissentients in this community. I believe the amendment the Opposition is proposing in this respect is a moderate one. It is an extremely important one. It goes to the heart of what this legislation is all about and to the heart of concerns that people have expressed about it. But it does not do so in a way that is destructive of the basic concepts and intentions lying behind the legislation. The Opposition's amendment in this respect is genuinely intended and I hope the chamber will respond accordingly to what is meant to be a constructive suggestion. </PARA>

It is a different matter altogether to suggest that they might be used for McCarthyist purposes. I have no doubt that some of the offences that have existed for years in lanes that have not been used are not going to be suddenly plucked out of the air by the National Crimes Commission in trying to mount some sort of McCarthyist investigation. Therefore, whilst I believe there is a need to review the Crimes Act-that certainly is an important point-at the same time it does not seem to me likely that the Act will be misused in the course of a National Crimes Commission action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 7 provides that the Commission, in the course of investigating, will seek as far as practicable to direct its activities to four major areas.

<PARA>It seems to me that this is an area in which there should be concentration on the part of the National Crimes Commission.

I cannot really see what the objection to that is. I know that the report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills raised some general objections to the vagueness of what might be examined. On reflection and seeing the replies and what is contained in this clause, I do not really feel that the functions as set out are unreasonable.

<PARA> (1) to (3) I am aware of inferences made during a television current affairs program earlier this year that Chang Chi-Fu visited Australia during 1975 and met with Michael Hand of the Nugan Hand Bank, to arrange for the importation of 500 pounds of heroin.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Acting Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) It is not possible to confirm the figure of 523 tonnes for north Queensland tin production in the September quarter of 1981 because quarterly tin production statistics for north Queensland are not available. The quotas available to north Queensland mines for the same period of 1982 totalled approximately 423 tonnes and, in addition, mines in this area would have used a large part of the collective small mine allocation of 116 tonnes for the September quarter.</PARA>
<PARA> It can be taken, however, that the total of the allocations to north Queensland mines in the September 1982 quarter was substantially less than production by these mines in the same period of 1981. While this reduction is causing hardship throughout the industry, it should be noted that many small mines are continuing to operate.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Statistics are not available of the number of persons engaged in the north Queensland tin industry at 30 June 1982 although the number was probably less than the quoted figure of 1600. The number of persons so engaged has certainly fallen since that date but it is not possible to indicate the extent of the reduction.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In 1981 the Department of Industry and Commerce commissioned the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled (ACROD), in association with the Australian Automobile Association (AAA), to survey Australian accommodation establishments with appropriate facilities for disabled travellers.

<PARA> (2) It was the Department's intention to publish an accommodation guide for the disabled in early 1982. However, there have been unavoidable delays in its publication. These delays included the need to correct some minor errors in the data, seeking advertising which might have provided additional information for disabled travellers, and in printing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) As many as 16,000 Australian servicemen and civilians may have been associated with the atomic tests. National mortality statistics show that from such a number considerably more than 57 can be expected to have died from cancer . A final estimate of the number of cancer deaths expected cannot be given until the group involved in the tests has been defined, and dates of birth determined.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) My Department is co-ordinating an intensive investigation into the involvement of Australians in the United Kingdom atomic weapons test program conducted in Australia during the 1950s and early 1960s. The investigation includes a study of all Australian personnel who may have been connected with the program and who have been traced.</PARA>
<PARA> The study aims to identify any connection between the atomic tests and the subsequent state of health of those who were associated with them and, in particular, to compare among the difficult work units involved, the prevalence of conditions, including cancer, which may be caused by exposure to radiation. A study of causes of death will also be carried out.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council has undertaken an investigation into the nature and distribution of fallout from the atomic tests to identify what possible harmful effects, if any, there may have been on the health of the Australian population. The results of this investigation will be tabled.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 November 1982 (Hansard, page 2033) Senator Colston asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a comment in Inside Canberra which states:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The Department of Industry and Commerce will settle the dispute between the Sydney brewer Tooth and Co. and the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights' Union'.</PARA>
<PARA> The dispute referred to centres on Tooth and Co. Ltd letting a contract to a United States manufacturer for $10m to $15m worth of stainless steel beer barrels. Will the Department of Industry and Commerce settle the dispute? If so , how will it do so?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industry and Commerce has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the article referred to by the honourable senator and of other recent media reports that a contract to supply beer barrels to Sydney firm Tooth and Co. has gone to an American firm.</PARA>
<PARA> The article suggests that the Department would refuse to grant by-law admission on the barrels thereby subjecting them to a duty of 15 per cent. The article goes on to suggest that faced with this duty it is unlikely that the order would go outside Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that no application for by-law has been made on the barrels, and I understand that the company has no intention of doing so.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Industry and Commerce has had discussions with Tooth and Co. and the local manufacturing industry on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> Apparently initial quotes from Australian suppliers were significantly above the duty paid prices quoted by a number of overseas manufacturers including one manufacturer in the United States of America. I understand a revised quote from local industry was not received until after Tooth and Co. had taken its commercial decision to place the order with the United States manufacturer.</PARA>
