Uphold the principle that the seeds and cuttings of plants are a public resource and a common heritage to all; that accordingly seeds should be freely available to all, freely multipliable, able to be sold, exchanged, exported and imported by anyone who wishes.

<PARA> 2. Recognise that plant breeding is a highly co-operative venture often involving private enterprise at the very last stages after basic seed collection , storage, and research has been publicly funded.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. In view of the aforementioned paragraphs, recognise that any system giving ' property' or ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises is inappropriate and unjust.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Recognise that legislation establishing plant patenting schemes overseas has had serious adverse effects namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) a slowing-down of scientific information exchange and exchanges in basic plant breeding materials, that is, germ plasm,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) subordination and/or curtailment of public breeding programmes,</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister representing the Treasurer noted an interview with Mr Laurie Carmichael of the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union on the Australian Broadcasting Commission program AM yesterday concerning the social wage concept that apparently has been adopted by the Australian Labor Party? Is she aware that in a package dealing with this subject Mr Carmichael advocated: First, cuts in personal income tax; secondly, tax indexation; thirdly , a universal health scheme paid out of government revenue or taxpayers' money; and, fourthly, reduced interest rates and increased social welfare and age pensions? They are all commendable objectives, I am sure, but can the Minister give an estimate of the likely cost of implementing this package? Does she recognise the implicit contradiction in the concept which on the one hand calls for less taxation and yet on the other hand demands greater and more costly government services? Will the Minister agree that this concept is not only impractical but also another example of irresponsible financial policies advocated by the Australian Labor Party and union leaders?</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Jessop, with his customary flair for doing that, has asked Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle to comment on the concept of the social wage which has been adopted by the Australian Labor Party. I hope the Minister will not be confused by that terminology because it is used, of course, in different circles and in different circumstances; the concept is used in different contexts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; A lot of assistance seems to be being given all around the chamber in regard to questions this morning. The question raised by Senator Jessop related to Mr Carmichael and his comments. I would not embark on a discussion about the social wage concept that the Australian Labor Party has in its mind, particularly after the statement of the Leader of the Opposition yesterday concerning $6,000m being available for tax cuts. Perhaps I should refer to the Treasurer's comments in relation to that matter. However, in response to Senator Jessop and the matters raised by Mr Carmichael, let me say that we all welcomed the most recent decision of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission with regard to wages at present. The Government will be pursuing policies appropriate to wage moderation and the reduction of inflation in the period that lies ahead. That of course will include the framework of the forthcoming Budget to be presented in August. I think it is accepted that there is responsibility on all parts of the Australian community for wage restraint. The sorts of things included in Mr Carmichael's concept involve an equation that just does not work. He refers on the one hand to tax cuts and on the other hand to increased wages and other elements such as health systems, increases in social security payments and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All these things may be desirable objectives if economic circumstances permitted. On the other hand, I think the outcry for reduction in personal and other income taxes and government charges leads me to say that what was sought by Mr Carmichael would not be welcomed by the Australian community in its present mood. However, as I have said, the Government is pursuing policies which will lead to wage moderation and co-operation from all sectors of the community and at the same time to the reduction of inflation and the management of the economy for growth and development. That will be the way in which we will proceed in the forthcoming Budget, and at an appropriate time we will probably be very happy to hear from Senator Button all about the social wage concept of his party.</PARA>

To put a price tag on it would be impossible; to put a cost on it in real terms, I think, would be something that we would not be prepared to do in any Budget that we are drawing up at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think, in general terms, what the honourable senator has said is a summary of them, although there is some question as to the specific application of that rule to a particular case. The honourable senator is probably referring to what occurred in the case of Murray Goulburn and the Minister. That matter was dealt with by the Prime Minister at the time and he gave his interpretation of the guidelines which, I think, the honourable senator does not accept. So there is some room for interpretation. I do not see why we should be expected to accept Senator Walsh's interpretation of them in respect of that case. The conditions under which money is made available to the Australian Dairy Corporation are a matter which will need to be given consideration in order to answer that aspect of the question.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Science and Technology to an Age report of 20 May relating to claims by Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation researchers that almost all of Victoria is threatened by eucalyptus dieback. Will the Minister comment on this report and, in particular, the claim by CSIRO entomologist, Dr Phillip Carne, that the problem is approaching what could almost be termed a national disaster? In view of the increasing threat posed by dieback to Australia's eucalypts, I ask the Minister: First, what action has been taken by the Government and Government agencies in an effort to contain and eradicate the pests attacking our native trees? Secondly, will a campaign be instituted by the Government to alert farmers to the possible ways of helping trees survive against pasture pests as one way of containing the threat?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The article that is referred to by Senator Missen has drawn some information from the Department of Science and Technology. The evidence strongly suggests that a connection exists between tree clearing for livestock grazing and dieback which affects the remaining trees. The processes involved are complex and will require long term study. The death of trees affected with dieback is usually hastened by leaf-eating insects. Evidently these insects lived in ecological balance with the trees prior to land clearing and the establishment of livestock properties. At present there is no sure method of reversing or controlling dieback that is economic and acceptable to graziers. One approach that has been suggested is to fence off parts of farms from grazing to encourage large wood lots either of local species or of insect resistant species brought in from other regions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At present the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is co-operating with the New South Wales Department of Agriculture at Armidale to determine the effects of various forms of grazing management on the control of eucalypt dieback by means of control of the soil-living stage of leaf-eating insects. The CSIRO has recently completed a review of its possible research role in this matter. The Executive has agreed that the Division of Entomology and the Division of Forest Research should hold discussions with other interested research bodies, particularly the University of New England because of its active dieback research, with a view to undertaking collaborative work which would make the best use of the skills in those divisions.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Missen asked what action will be taken and whether we will have some sort of campaign. I will need to draw on the Minister for Science and Technology and his decisions with regard to further action that could be taken, given that the CSIRO is working on the problem. Perhaps the specific steps mentioned by Senator Missen are not yet being undertaken.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Mason as the honourable senator in charge of the Australian Democrats' Constitution Alteration (Electors' Initiative) Bill 1982. Is it a fact that that Bill proposes, amongst other things, a procedure for constitutional change which would allow the representation in this Parliament of a smaller State to be altered without the consent of that State, as is presently required; that is, by an affirmative vote by a two-thirds majority of all electors throughout Australia? In other words, could Tasmania's representation in this place be reduced from 10 senators to six senators or even four senators without the assent of a majority of electors in Tasmania? The same fate awaits Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia if the Democrats' proposal is carried through. Have the Democrats any other proposals drastically to diminish or impair the role of the outlying States in this Federation? Will the Democrats come clean and unveil all their proposals to secure their policy objective to replace State governments with regional assemblies?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must allay to a considerable extent Senator Tate's fears on behalf of his State. Yes, indeed, I have had advice from constitutional lawyers that it may well be possible that my proposed citizens' initiative Bill could overrule the provisions in the Constitution for its own reform. I regard it as a very valuable instrument for progress in many directions with which I am sure Senator Tate would agree. The question he raises is purely hypothetical. He is saying, in effect, that if that power is granted power will be taken from the smaller States. I think this is a matter of the intent of the Australian population at large, rather than of any other intent. My answer is that all we are offering in the Bill is a power which would allow the people of this country to make law independent of Parliament and possibly-I stress that this is a matter that would have to be tested-to alter the Constitution of this country through the right of citizens' initiative. As to Senator Tate's second question, the Democrats certainly do not have any proposals that I am aware of-certainly I am not sponsoring any-which would diminish the rights of any State of this Commonwealth. In general the whole issue of representation and any future changes in the electoral system of this country or the Constitution is a matter for the people of this country. All the Australian Democrats are doing is trying to provide for them a right through which they can make their voice heard.</PARA></TALK.START>

However, the proposal that she has put before us with regard to increases in the spouse rebate and the sole parent rebate is perhaps only one way in which people would consider that assistance through the tax system might be addressed towards the family. For instance, as I understand it, about one-third of the spouse rebates goes to families where there are no dependent children. I am not aware of whether that was known to Senator Bjelke- Petersen when she put forward the proposal that she has outlined this morning. The assistance to families through the family allowance, the spouse rebate and other tax measures will be before the Government in the forthcoming Budget preparation. I am sure we will have many suggestions that will need consideration.

I refer to a report in today's Australian that Japan is seeking Soviet oil and gas off Sakhalin Island but that development cannot proceed because of the United States embargo on the export of drilling equipment. The article suggests that tapping of the nearby oil and liquefied natural gas would make Japan more confident in negotiating with Australia on prices for coal and North West Shelf liquefied petroleum gas. In view of that suggestion, what is the Government's current attitude to the embargo?</PARA></TALK.START>

Recognising that the Opposition has expressed concern that the role of the Central Intelligence Agency in Australia is not subject to the control of the Australian Government, irrespective of political persuasion, will the Minister advise whether the Government is satisfied that it has been fully briefed on the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency and the role of the United States bases in Australia, whether the Australian intelligence organisations have conducted any inquiry into foreign intelligence organisations in this country, and whether he considers that such serious allegations as those made on 60 Minutes require a thorough investigation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. In a recent report in the Examiner of 25 May the Launceston City Missioner said that 35 new families each month came to the Mission for help, in addition to those already on the books. He said that one of the real tragedies is that people are far more desperate than is realised. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there are nearly 380,000 children of people on various types of pensions in Australia, almost all living below the poverty line. Does the Minister not agree that this is a shameful situation? When will the social security benefits be raised to above the poverty line to allow people to live in dignity?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not familiar with the report mentioned by the honourable senator in her question. She referred to the difficulties of people who are on pensions and who have children. She asked when pensions and benefits would be raised. The setting of pensions and benefits is, of course, a matter for Budget consideration. I am in no position to anticipate what decisions might be taken by the Government over the coming months and announced in the Budget. With respect to the Government's approach to the question of those in the community who are on low incomes, I point to the major commitment the Government has made to the indexation of the great majority of benefits which ensures that on two occasions in each year there are adjustments to the bulk of benefits paid by my Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point to the fact that the 1976 change to the family allowance principally affected the sorts of families to which Senator Hearn referred-families which gain no assistance from the tax deductions, which until that time were a substantial part of the benefit provided for families and which provided a greater degree of assistance to the well-off than to those with low incomes. Since 1976 the same level of assistance has been provided to low income families as to all families, which puts us in an unusual position in the whole of the Western world. Over recent years there have been adjustments to pensions and to the additional allowances which are payable for children.</PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I accept that a proportion of those who receive pensions and benefits from my Department do have difficulty in meeting their requirements. We responded in the last Budget to some of the areas which we saw as being high areas of need. The adjustment to supplementary assistance was meant to be a step in the direction of assisting those who are identified as being likely to be in need, such as those paying high private rents. The adjustment in family allowances for larger families is an adjustment which affected a selection of families who are statistically shown to be more likely to be in difficulty. I think there is an obligation upon the Government to try to identify those sections of the community in which people are living at a standard which is below what we would regard as reasonable in Australia and to try to make the necessary adjustments.</PARA>
<PARA> Having said all that-Question Time is not the time to make a speech on these matters-and in endeavouring to respond to the honourable senator, I would simply point out that the Government's ability to respond to the many additional demands which are made on the welfare system is inhibited by the fact that over a period of 10 years we have gone from about one million people seeking income support from the Commonwealth to about 2.2 million to 2.3 million people. There has been a very substantial real increase in expenditure in this field, quite apart from those increased numbers, and the contribution which is required from taxpayers has increased to a very marked extent. Bearing in mind that the party which Senator Hearn is a part of is demanding tax cuts-Mr Willis is demanding very substantial income tax cuts in the coming Budget-and bearing in mind that her party has disavowed any question of new forms of taxation in its desperate attempt to get into government, I would throw the challenge back to them to indicate from what source additional payments ought to be made, because I think there is a very great difficulty in meeting the very extensive demands which are made on the welfare system in this country without very substantial increases in taxation.</PARA>

I recall that the National Health and Medical Research Council in one of the areas akin to transplantation- that is, the question of in vitro fertilisation-has recently taken some very positive steps to examine the ethical issues involved. I recall that some years ago some of the researchers in that area tried to get some of the churches to take on a consideration of the ethical issues.

If the Government does accept those guidelines, can the Minister tell the Senate whether the Minister for Primary Industry, in the terms of Bowen recommendation 8.6, informed the Prime Minister or the Acting Prime Minister last Wednesday that he was involved in an apparent conflict of interest? Did he tell either the Prime Minister or the Acting Prime Minister that he continued to hold shares in the Murray Goulburn Co-Op. Co.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I certainly can confirm on behalf of the Government its adherence to the guidelines recommended by the Bowen Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interest. The Bowen Inquiry was set up by the Government and when it reported the Government adopted its guidelines in regard to ministerial conduct. They have been in operation now for some years. I do not know the exact date on which they came into operation. There is no question as to the Government's adherence to the guidelines laid down. As I indicated earlier in answer to Senator Walsh, there is some dispute in relation to one aspect of the interpretation of the guidelines. This dispute arose, according to his version of them, in relation to a previous matter concerning Mr Nixon. Indeed, the second part of Senator Button's question possibly raises that same question again. As the Prime Minister said when this matter was raised previously, Mr Nixon had disclosed the shares that he holds in Murray Goulburn Co-Op. Co. Ltd. It was explained that he holds those shares as a producer of dairy products, it being a requirement that shares be held in the company in order to sell products through it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has continued to fund a large number of the marriage counselling organisations that are approved under the Family Law Act. The moneys that are made available to them by way of a grant each year have steadily increased over the years in which the Government has been in office, although the actual rate of increase has varied from year to year depending upon the circumstances of the organisations concerned and the total sum of money that the Government can find available in the Budget context and in the Budget strategy. The same approach is being followed by the Government in regard to the forthcoming Budget.

Mr Burston said on AM this morning and is reported in the Age as saying that no gain had been made by that company from the late repayment because it did not have the money and did not have the stock.

To which company was this credit extended? For how long was the credit extended?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have precise information on the matters raised. I will not add to any confusion which may be abroad on this question by endeavouring to give an answer based on supposition. However, on the question of whether a gain was made by any company which had not repaid an advance, that would depend on the general financial position of the company and on the use to which the money was put. That could vary considerably from case to case. The companies receiving the money were paying interest on that money. I think the rate was 15.75 per cent. They had a liability which was accruing to them while they had the money and that, of course, was a cost to them. It would only be if the retention of the money involved their getting a benefit over and above that cost of 15.75 per cent or if, for example, it prevented them from having to borrow at a higher interest rate that any gain would accrue. The position could vary from case to case. I mention that it would be difficult-I do not think it would be possible- to generalise on the level of gain which might have been made by any of those people, without examination of the particular facts and circumstances. As far as Mr Burston's statement is concerned, I do not know whether I am pleased or sorry that I was not able to listen to AM this morning; but I was not. I have not seen a transcript.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To return to matters which were touched upon in the previous question, a couple of questions were raised yesterday on which I have been provided with some additional information which I would like to put before the Senate. The position of Mr Peter Lever-Naylor was raised in a question yesterday. I am advised that he retired from the Nestle Company Australia Ltd on 30 June 1978 and that he occupied the position of manager of the production division prior to retirement. In June 1981 he acted as an adviser to the Minister of Rural and Industrial Development in Sri Lanka, as a result of the Minister's request to the Nestle company in Sri Lanka, on the administration of the dairy industry in that country. He has had no business association with the Nestle Company Australia Ltd since his retirement in June 1978. He was originally appointed as a representative of manufacturers on the board of the Australian Dairy Corporation on 1 July 1977 and following his retirement from the Nestle Company Australia Ltd was appointed as a member with special qualifications on 1 July 1978, and he still occupies that position. Therefore, it is clear that Mr Peter Lever-Naylor has had no association with the Nestle Company Australia Ltd since his retirement on 30 June 1978 and therefore has not been involved in any way in that company's business since that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Questions were also raised by Senator Button, indeed in Question Time earlier today, about the review of loans provided to manufacturers by the ADC. I have been provided with the following information. Four times in each financial year -in September, December, March and June-the Corporation requires manufacturers to certify the amount of product held in approved stores and on which loans have been made by the Corporation. These returns are then reconciled with Corporation records. Additionally, since the establishment of the Corporation's internal audit unit in 1978 periodic checks of stock levels on which loans have been made have been part of the unit's work program. These checks have ascertained several discrepancies of an insignificant nature which have been rectified. Prior to 1978 and since the scheme's inception in 1975, as indicated by Senator Button in his question, there has always been a requirement for quarterly certification by manufacturers detailing stocks held for which the loans have been made. The ADC advises that all the discrepancies of an insignificant nature which have been detected in the past and which have been rectified have been bookkeeping matters involving small quantities of stock and there is no indication of any intent on the part of the manufacturers to deceive. The entire system is available to the staff of the Commonwealth Auditor-General for scrutiny as part of the Corporation's total financial operations.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button also asked me when the ADC's current inquiry would be completed . The ADC has advised that it is hoped to have the inquiry completed by the end of next week. It will certainly be completed in time for the next board meeting of the ADC, which is scheduled to take place on 17 June.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Senator Teague raised an important matter about questions on notice and questions without notice being put to Ministers. Of course I agree with Senator Colston insofar as a hypocritical attitude has been taken by Senator Teague. Senator Teague well knows that on his side of this place at least half the questions asked are Dorothy Dixers; they are questions about which notice has been given to the Minister and answers are readily available. The answers are often so long winded that even the President from time to time has had to direct the Minister answering the question to keep his answer concise, precise and relevant. We have seen Ministers read from long- winded, prepared answers to questions of which notice clearly has been given by the senators on the Government side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is suggested that we have erred in this area. When Opposition senators are conscientiously seeking information in respect of government administration we invariably get a reply from Ministers that they will refer the matter to the relevant Minister in the other place. We do not get adequate information because the Minister of whom we have asked a question represents a Minister in another place and is not fully aware of the matters which we ask about. Therefore, nine times out of 10 we get inadequate answers to our question. That is particularly so of Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle and other senior Government Ministers. They do not provide us with the essential information. </PARA>
<PARA> On this occasion we are concerned about the shortness of the parliamentary sitting and about the fact that time is not available for us to debate matters which we regard as important. I refer to Senator Ryan's private member's Bill and to Senator Evans's Bill. The Government is not prepared to make time available to have these matters dealt with in the autumn session; they will languish for another three or four months before they are dealt with.

I find now that that matter has been put off. However, the matter has already been drawn to the attention of the people in Australia and to the Press. Obviously there is a snide implication that I asked a Dorothy Dix question, which I never do, and about which I have the strongest objection. I want to make it perfectly clear that I certainly give Ministers notice of questions when I want facts in regard to matters such as dieback in trees, which I raised this morning. I give notice of such questions so that I can get some information. I make it perfectly clear that no Minister suggests to me that I should ask a certain question. I want to say-I have said it many times-that it is proper for honourable senators to seek information. What is not proper, I think, is for honourable senators to ask questions about matters on which Ministers want to make a statement. Ministers ought to do that by way of statements. I have said that before and I say it again but I make it clear because this morning nobody on the other side of the chamber had the courtesy to tell me that a motion would be moved in regard to my question.

Senator Teague claimed that Senator Ryan requested me to use Standing Order 98 to ask her a question in relation to a Bill standing in her name on the Notice Paper.

I make it quite clear that at no stage did Senator Ryan approach me; I did not refuse any request from her. I remind Senator Teague that people who live in glass houses should not throw stones. On my files I have many documents which I asked to be tabled in this Parliament. They relate to questions to be asked by certain senators-I think I have a couple of such questions from Senator Walters-and the proposed answers. If honourable senators on this side have now indulged in that sort of operation the disease must be catching. It was started by honourable senators on the other side.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand the Senate will adjourn this week so perhaps it is a good opportunity for honourable senators to leave this place with something to think about. That is why this matter of public importance has been submitted. Essentially it relates to the failure of the Government to provide leadership in relation to some very important problems facing this country. I think in all fairness it can be said that when the Fraser Government was elected in 1975 and again in 1977 it promised an alternative view of Australian society. It promised new leadership, better government, better economic management and a whole range of things. Indeed, the rhetoric of those heady days is familiar to all honourable senators in this chamber and should particularly be familiar to members of the Liberal Party. It was said that, if the Fraser Government were elected, inflation would be drastically reduced, interest rates would fall by 2 per cent, anyone who wanted to work in Australia would get a job, Medibank would be maintained, the Prices Justification Tribunal would be retained, taxes would be reduced and the tax rip-off would be ended. It was said there would be no more tourists as Prime Minister and that there would be new standards of propriety in government and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The average Australian listening to those claims in 1975 and 1977 would, I think, be quite entitled to say: 'Well, that sounds pretty good. Those things will probably make this a better place to live in'. But the question which we address to the Senate now is: What does Mr or Mrs Average Australian say now? What do they understand now both about those matters and about current problems in terms of response to those problems from this Government? Let me just remind honourable senators about the current situation. Inflation is running at 10 1/2 per cent, which is one per cent above the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average. We have the highest interest rates ever. We have the highest unemployment since the Great Depression. We have an enormously increased tax burden on lower income earners and tax avoidance estimated by Professor Russell Mathews to represent a 20 per cent loss in personal income tax revenue to the Government because of tax avoidance schemes. We have no universal health insurance scheme; we have a decline in the level of home ownership in Australia; we have a Prime Minister who is continually gyrating around the world advocating grandiose schemes for curing world problems and ignoring the problems which this country faces. We have a scandal-ridden Ministry. Twenty-one Ministers have been replaced since the Fraser Government came to power. Thirteen former Ministers have been appointed to jobs for the boys, which were going to be abolished, and we have a situation of economic management which can be summarised only as the classic example of all these defects of the Government. As Professor Russell Mathews put it in an important paper earlier this year:</PARA>
<PARA> It--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Commonwealth-</PARA>
<PARA>has used its centralised financing powers to return to the thoroughly discredited policies of the Great Depression involving acceptance of high levels of unemployment at the same time as urgent capital works are deferred for lack of funds. </PARA>
<PARA>All of these things which go to the living standards of ordinary Australians can be summed up in a sense, though, in one quite dramatic figure. In 1976, when the Fraser Government came to power, in terms of per capita income Australia was No. 8 on a list of OECD countries. In 1981 it had dropped from No. 8 to No. 15-a fair drop down the hit parade in six short years. Only recently we were passed by Japan. So what became of Fraser's new society which was promised in 1975 and 1977? What is the situation of the society in which we now live, with chronic problems of unemployment, poor economic management, continuing inflation, declining home ownership and growing poverty? Where are the promises and where is the vision for the future as to how long this sort of society will continue under this Government? Are people not entitled to ask, on the record of this Government: Will unemployment still be around at the present level in the year 2000 if this Government remains in power? Will inflation still be running at current levels? Will we still be without universal health insurance schemes, with a declining value in pensions and with a decline in government services such as is continually apparent if one looks at the major government instrumentalities designed to provide services to the Australian people? What strategies does the Government have to deal with this current crisis in social and economic policy created by government policies? Let us look at the decline in government services to which I have referred. Although I cannot go into detail in a short speech, let me make just a few points. Hospitals in Australia are now starved for funds. The Australian Broadcasting Commission, a once great national broadcasting service, has been deliberately run down by this Government to the point where it has become something of a joke. Telecom Australia is another great public instrumentality. But because of Government policies in relation to capital loan raising it is unable to provide the sorts of services which a national telecommunications network should provide, which the national public-owned telecommunications networks in most countries provide. </PARA>
<PARA> In six years under this Government there has been declining access to education , declining retention rates in schools and declining access to post-secondary education. In terms of this Government's commitments to the rural sector of the Australian community, there have been: A series of scandals in relation to subsidy schemes; the abolition by the Government of the Decentralisation Advisory Board which, to the credit of the Government-it was a Fraser Government initiative-was successfully encouraging industry development in provincial cities in Australia; and the complete abdication of any responsibility the Commonwealth Government has towards land degradation in the vast rural areas of Australia. All of those areas of government service are declining at the same time as standards of living for the Australian people are declining. The taxation system which, in a sense, is a linchpin-if I can use that unfortunate expression in the context of this Parliament-is in a mess. I again use Professor Mathews's words:</PARA>
<PARA> If governments were to set out deliberately to design a taxation system which would redistribute income from the poor to the rich, which would substantially relieve the rich of the cost of financing social welfare transfers and public services; which would consciously discriminate against wage and salary incomes in favour of other incomes and capital gains, which would distort the pattern of consumption and production, and which would provide a major stimulus to wage inflation and industrial conflict, it would be difficult for them to develop a set of tax arrangements that would be more successful in meeting such perverse objectives than the existing Australian system. </PARA>
<PARA>No doubt if Senator Sir John Carrick were here he would say that it was all the fault of the Whitlam Government. This Government has been in office for seven years. When it came to office it accepted responsibility for these things. That is what one does when one is in government. It is no good blaming it on the trade unions, on what is happening overseas, on various interest groups in the community, on the Opposition, or on anybody else who might be mentioned, because it is a government's responsibility to provide leadership. Instead of doing that this Government has become a scapegoat government. Everybody is to blame except the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and his Ministers. Instead of leadership we have had government by inquiry and government by experiment. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the inquiries commissioned by this Government at great cost, in respect of which no action has been taken. I mention just a sample. What has happened to the report of the Crawford Study Group on Structural Adjustment in the hands of this Government, with continuing conflict between the dries and the wets in the Fraser Government? We had the report of the Myers Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia which was central in a sense to continued industrial development in this country. It was central to social equity and the issues of income redistribution and sharing of burdens. Perhaps it was not a good report but it was a very important report in terms of the concept involved. We have the report of the Dix Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission which has been languishing for 18 months without a government decision. We have the report of the Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education, Training and Employment-the Fraser Government's document which was to provide a blueprint for education to the year 2000. What has happened to the blueprint? It is grey with dust now. But nothing has been done in any sense about its recommendations. There has been no response from this Government. Instead, the Government has engaged in a few little ideological experiments with the Australian people. The sorts of social experiments in which this Government engages remind me of those horror movies in which some unfortunate corpse is placed on a table and operated on by Dr Crippen or somebody such as that. </PARA>
<PARA> First, it has flirted with monetarism, which Shirley Williams has accurately described as a convenient philosophy arriving at the right time to fill the vacuum in conservative thought. Secondly, it has flirted with a commitment to deregulation. As a result, numerous inquiries all over the place are working out how things can be deregulated. The results of most of those inquiries will only lead to a different system of regulation, perhaps more comprehensive than the present system. There is a conservative case for continuity of development in relation to public institutions; a case which this Government seems to ignore. Thirdly, there was the extraordinary experiment of the razor gang. It was heralded as something which would save the Australian taxpayer $560m. That, of course, is a joke. People know that as a result of the razor gang's activities taxpayers will have to pay more. One sample of the razor gang's activities in Sydney concerns the servicing of Commonwealth cars by private enterprise. It now costs four times as much as it cost to have it done in a Commonwealth garage. That is just one example, but it is a graphic one. It is typical of the razor gang's activities. The cosmetic changes to the Australian Wool Testing Authority 's constitutional basis is another example of its absurd activities. After 12 months Sir Phillip Lynch abandoned the notion that the razor gang would save $ 560m. On 18 February of this year he said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it was not a review of expenditure levels or public service staffing, rather, it was an attempt to chart a realistic role for Australia's Federal Government in the special circumstance of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to hear from him what he thinks about the special circumstances of 1982 in terms of social and economic equality and the Government's economic management. He said that it was not a cost cutting exercise at all; that people had made a mistake about that. I suppose he thought that it was just a little bit of pre-election propaganda. Afterwards, Professor Mathews, to whom I referred earlier, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of the Review of Commonwealth Functions seemed to be concerned not with improving efficiency in government--</PARA>
<PARA>Contrary to Sir Phillip Lynch's view-</PARA>
<PARA>but rather with reducing the Commonwealth Budget deficit by shifting expenditure responsibilities to the States or by disposing of Commonwealth property and activities to private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA>I say again that there is a case for continuity in relation to these matters. The fourth great ideological experiment of this Government was the so-called new federalism policy. It is a shambles in terms of its failure upon implementation. I do not want to quote Professor Mathews again but, as this Government's leading expert on federalism, the words that he has chosen to use to describe the system are less than charitable. I put it to the Government that there is a case for avoiding ideological experiments of either extreme in the tragic situation in which this country finds itself. Politicians such as Sir Robert Menzies understood the value of continuity in politics. In Australia we have a mixed economy. There is value in continuity in the development of such an economy with the public sector being well developed and looked after and the private sector being encouraged by an impartial government-not a government which hands out favours all over the place to particular friends, but one which is impartial in its encouragement of the development of the private sector. With such a government we can develop a much more balanced society without all the disturbances which come from ideological commitments, most of them imported, to the sorts of bizarre views I have mentioned, the bizarre experiments in deregulation, razor gangs, monetarism, new federalism-all the slogans of the Fraser Government which would clutter a large sized ballot box if they were all put in there together.</PARA>
<PARA> Instead of that, of course, we have had scapegoat government, government by inquiry, government which avoids responsibilities by blaming other sections of the community, governments in which the Prime Minister makes speeches written by Owen Harries and in which the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) reads speeches for the Prime Minister in Adelaide and governments which talk about the importance of the philosophy underlying the Government's actions. What is the philosophy underlying the Government's actions now which will lead Australia out of the present mess? Instead, the Government, for example, promises export led recovery at one election and a resource boom led recovery at the next. Take Treasurer Howard, for example, that pea green incorruptible of the Liberal Government and a latter-day Robespierre. On 10 October 1980- conveniently a week or two before an election-he said that the expected resources boom would create tens of thousands of jobs. On 11 November 1981 he changed his tune and referred to the so-called resources boom as a term which he tried to avoid using. In the same month the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) said:</PARA>
<PARA> I therefore back away from calling the current developments a boom. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the thing that was going to create tens of thousands of jobs, something which all Australians are legitimately concerned about when they look to the future. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, we have had a situation which entitles people now to ask: 'Where are the answers from this Government for next year? But more importantly where are the answers for 10 years hence about where this society is going? Where is the equivalent vision that we were offered in 1975 and 1977? Can it all be achieved by a few tax bribes at the next election or is there some overall economic strategy which tax cuts would be a part of, or is it just a few throw-away bribes, the old pattern of conservative government? Where is the leadership out of current social and economic difficulties? When are we going to have a prices policy and an incomes policy?'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is an extraordinary note for the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button) to finish his speech on. He more or less had to be sat down. He did abide by the consensus , and I give him credit for that. Perhaps it was a fitting end to a speech which showed quite a deal of promise in the title that he chose for it, but which failed dismally to deliver the sort of attack which I think he intended. The Leader of the Opposition introduced for debate in the Senate today a matter of public importance which he called:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Fraser Government to provide leadership at a time of great social and economic difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA>I thought that this was to be some sort of mid-term debate on economic and social policies in relation to which the views of the Government may conflict with those of the Opposition. Instead of Senator Button concentrating his fire on one or two major issues, he sprayed that fire in all directions and in, I thought, a very inconsequential and disconnected way tried to rely on a number of throw-away lines and trigger words which were designed to create some sense of unease about the present situation. He did not firmly put a coherent alternative policy, something which one would have expected from the Leader of the Opposition; nor indeed did he concentrate a major attack on the policies of the Government. He ended by asking: 'Where are the answers?' I propose to address my remarks to that question. It is interesting that the Leader of the Opposition has to ask that question and does not provide, or even wait for, an answer. I notice that he is leaving the chamber. He does not seek to provide any answer at all to the major questions which are facing us. (Quorum formed). The Leader of the Opposition, having asked where the answers are without having provided them, proceeded to depart, although I see that he had to remain for the quorum. Obviously very few Opposition senators are interested in the answers because very few of them answered the bells for the quorum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps they were following their leader in that regard. The Opposition has introduced a matter of public importance. I think its response to it, the attitude it has expressed and the quorum that was called are indications of how much faith it has in its own proposition. Of course, we have to go back to see the problems that the Government has faced. Senator Button said that the Government has been in office now for 6 1/2 years. He said that the Government now has to take responsibility for the problems that are facing the nation. Of course, the Government has to take that responsibility, and has shouldered it for 6 1/2 years. But it is important to note that the Government accepted that responsibility after the debacle of the Labor years of 1972 to 1975. Certainly we are accepting the responsibility now, but we accepted it in 1975. It is just as well that we accepted responsibility in 1975 because of the debacle that faced Australia at that time as a result of those years of an Australian Labor Party government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the economic indicators. By 1975 inflation was running at the rate of 16 per cent to 17 per cent. That had a most devastating impact on the Australian economy. I think that apart from the Depression that was probably the most devastating blow the Australian economy has ever suffered. This situation was brought about by the totally irresponsible economic policies of the Labor Government of those years. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to dwell on that because quite clearly we are now dealing with circumstances seven years on from that period. We are debating the question of which party is better suited to cope with the problems that Australia is facing and may face in the future. I think it is important to note the record of the Labor Party in the years it was in government and to compare the record of the present Government which shows a steady improvement in Australia's position over the years it has been in office. This Government tackled effectively the problem of inflation. The level of inflation which was created by Labor policies is well and truly down. But the serious and devastating truth is that the Labor Party does not tell us about policies which will maintain the growth and stability which has been achieved or which will encourage the level of investment which has been achieved in the years of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, inflation was a major problem and we had to pursue very tough restraints on government expenditure and take unpopular stands in regard to wage and salary restraint in order to cope with that very serious problem. But those policies, as sound and as important to maintain as they are, of course are policies which are unpopular. I think it is a measure of the leadership of the Fraser Government and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that we have been able to keep our nerve and our heads and maintain those policies which are vital if this country is to be able to maintain levels of inflation which are not out of proportion with those of the rest of our trading partners, which are not devastating to the confidence of the people and which are not destructive of people's savings to which inflation is such a threat. These policies must continue to be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button asks where are the answers. The first and foremost answer is that the Government will maintain those responsible policies of economic management which we have pursued for the last six and a half years. But the most difficult problem of all that we had to face in those early years that we were in government was to restore a sense of confidence in Australia, to restore a confidence by Australians in their own economy and in their own future, to restore the confidence of overseas investors in Australia as a sound place for investment. That was the problem we had to face in 1975. I believe that one of the most important achievements of the Fraser Government over the last six and a half years has been the great success it has had in restoring the confidence of which I speak. Confidence was utterly destroyed by three years of Labor. If Labor were given the chance to govern again I have no doubt that it would destroy that confidence because its policies--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In such little time as is now left to me as a result of the constant interventions and quorum calling by the Opposition, I just want to sum up the major problems that the Government has faced and the success that the Government has had in doing so. It took some time, after assuming the responsibility for Labor's debacle, to get inflation rates down to levels where Australia could compete effectively in world trade, which is a most vital matter for us, and it took some years to restore the confidence of overseas investors in Australia and of Australian investors and Australians in Australia's future. This has been achieved in recent years. We have seen some very impressive figures on growth in Australia. The non-farm product growth in the last year or so has gone up to something like 4 per cent which is a very impressive figure. The private capital investment in Australia in the current year is in accordance with the Budget estimates of 10 per cent to 15 per cent real growth. The levels of overseas investment, of course, are back to the historically high levels which applied in the early 1970s before the Labor Government frightened away foreign investment. So there has been growth. There has been the creation of jobs. The Labor Party, of course, has been wanting to persuade the Government to adopt irresponsible policies involving particular forms of artificial job creation. But this Government's policies have created real jobs. Over the last two years more than 200,000 new jobs have been created in Australia. The Government's policy works and the Government will continue to pursue it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Instead of the name calling in which the Labor Party indulges all the time in this chamber and instead of asking questions I think the Labor Party should tell us how it would be able to achieve a better performance than the Fraser Government. All we have heard from honourable senators opposite, of course, are examples of great increases in expenditure coupled with reductions in taxation. One cannot have the sort of increase in expenditure that Labor wants and reduced taxation at the same time without creating huge deficits-of course, that is what Labor's record shows it has done in the past-and fuelling inflation more and more for the future. That is the only answer I have heard from the Labor Party although today we did not hear any answers from the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is facing a difficult period in the world economy. Improvements in world trade and the economies of our trading partners are slow. We have to face those problems but they can be faced only by continuing the policies of responsible management which the Fraser Government has followed. All would be put at risk by a government losing its nerve and trying to spend its way out of problems. The problems have to be tackled at the international level. The Prime Minister has given a very real indication of leadership in the initiatives that he has taken recently with regard to easing the restrictions on world trade. I believe that that is the only recipe. We have to tackle the problem at home. We have to tackle the problem abroad. Australia can have every confidence in the continuing leadership of the Fraser Government in the years ahead. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Western Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.12)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian malaise of the late 1970s and early 1980s incorporates sluggish growth, rising unemployment, a growing incidence of poverty, falling real standard of living for a great proportion of the population, a mood of despair and cynicism and, most serious of all, the potential for social discord and even violence. It has been marked by Australia's progressive descent down the international ladder of economic growth and real incomes. This Government has failed. The evidence can no longer be denied. Contrary to its oft repeated assertions, the record of this Government in respect of critical economic indicators, such as real gross domestic product growth and levels of unemployment, has been dismal when compared with the other countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Compared with the leaders of the OECD-countries such as Austria , West Germany and Japan-this Government's record has been wretched. In the five calendar years 1976 to 1980-all the figures for 1981 are not available and that is the reason I have excluded them; I know there is a temporarily high Australian growth figure for 1981 which will be revised downwards because it incorporates a massive statistical discrepancy-real GDP growth in Australia averaged 2.5 per cent. In the OECD as a whole it was almost 3.5 per cent. Who would have imagined that? Of those who have been listening to the propaganda of this Government who would have imagined that throughout that five-year period- the first five years of the Fraser Government-real GDP growth in Australia was well below the OECD average as a whole?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has suggested that the Labor Government's record was very poor by international standards. Again, the reverse is the case. For the calendar years 1974 and 1975, which were years of world depression, aggregate growth in the OECD countries as a whole was 0.5 per cent. There was actually a negative growth in 1975. The Australian figure though not brilliant was comparatively high. It was comparatively extremely good. The aggregate figure was 4.7 per cent and in 1975 it was 2.2 per cent. Throughout that period Australia had a growth rate eight times as high as OECD countries as a whole. Since that period we have had growth rates below the OECD as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Likewise, the same situation applies to unemployment. In the period 1976 to 1980 Australia consistently had a higher rate of unemployment than the OECD average. It has had a rate of unemployment three times higher than the best of the OECD countries which, in this case, is Austria. In only one of the five years from 1976 to 1980 that this Government has been in office-the 1981 figures should not be counted because they will be revised-did the Australian economy achieve a growth rate high enough to maintain pre-existing levels of unemployment, a growth rate high enough to prevent unemployment from actually rising. To prevent unemployment from actually rising a real GDP growth rate of about 4 per cent is required because productivity grows by 2 per cent a year and the work force grows by about 2 per cent a year. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to those dismal growth figures-they are dismal by international standards-what is the snapshot picture of the Australian economy? We have record post-war interest rates, rising unemployment, record taxes which are unjustly distributed and an inflation rate of 10.5 per cent and rising. We heard something about inflation from Senator Durack. We will probably hear more about it from the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). Certainly inflation was high in the mid-1970s. When the Labor Government left office, depending on whether one chooses the September or December quarter of 1975 as being the appropriate quarter, inflation was, however, 12 per cent and 13.5 per cent, and it was going down. The trend was downwards. It is now marginally lower, at 10.5 per cent, and the trend is upwards. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has provided no leadership and, indeed, no policies other than an ongoing commitment to redistribute the taxation burden in a regressive way, that is, in a way that has the greatest impact on the lower income groups. It has no coherent or consistent policy. Instead of policy we have seen a succession of stunts. It is not an exhaustive list but a few of the stunts we have seen are new federalism, the prices freeze, the talking up of the resource boom, the razor gang and the latest stunt, the master plan of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) for world economic recovery which was unveiled to a completely disinterested United States public and media about two weeks ago. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One would no more disagree with the basic principles of the plan than one would dispute the multiplication table. It is completely in conflict with the record of this Government in what is actually applied in the specifics of policies. It is even more inappropriate that it should have come from one of the dunces of the OECD class who has the audacity to promote himself to the position of lecturer. If Senator Chaney wants to deal with the specifics of the Prime Minister's proposal perhaps when he speaks after me he might answer this question: If the Prime Minister's proposal is to be taken seriously and is not to be regarded as a cheap stunt for domestic political consumption and ego- boosting abroad, has the Government repudiated the undertaking that it gave to the textiles, clothing and footwear industry that the levels of protection would not be reduced for seven years? The two are incompatible if the Prime Minister's so-called plan is to be taken seriously and not taken as a stunt and if the Government is willing to consider reducing-indeed, if it will reduce-levels of protection to that industry and to all other industries. This cannot be reconciled with the unequivocal commitment that the Government gave to those industries 18 months ago. Perhaps Senator Chaney would care to address himself to that question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tragedy of the record of the last six years and of our present situation is that it need not have happened; and it need not continue. The common denominator in all of those countries which have maintained acceptable rates of economic growth and low rates of unemployment is an effective prices and incomes policy- whether it is called that or not. Some countries-South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan-have achieved a prices and incomes policy by authoritarian means. Others- Japan and the democracies of northern and central Europe-have achieved it by consensual means. Obviously, that authoritarian option is not one which will be seriously considered in Australia or which should be seriously considered in Australia. Only social consensus is acceptable. A social consensus is a prerequisite to an effective prices and incomes policy which in turn is a prerequisite to maintaining macroeconomic policies which are sufficiently expansionary to restore growth and full employment while simultaneously containing inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> A social consensus will not be achieved unless a government has moral authority -and moral authority this Government has not. Whatever goodwill it may have had at the time it was elected was recklessly dissipated and has now been completely exhausted. The Government promised growth and jobs; it gave us stagnation. It promised low taxes; it gave us record taxes unjustly distributed. It promised lower interest rates; it gave us record interest rates. It promised no tourist as a Prime Minister; the Prime Minister gave himself two Boeings at the taxpayers' expense to facilitate his international junketeering. The Government promised no jobs for the boys; we have seen 17 failed politicians appointed to government sinecures. It promised stability; it gave us 21 ministerial sackings, resignations or sideway shifts-sideways shifts right out of Cabinet, I emphasise , as distinct from shifts within the Cabinet. The Government promised ministerial integrity; it gave us Nixon and Sinclair. </PARA>
<PARA> How can a government with such a record expect to have-let alone actually command-any moral authority with a Deputy Prime Minister with a soft government loan on which he pays 4.75 per cent interest for his second house in Canberra while people on a fraction of his income pay four times the interest rate? We have a Deputy National Country Party Leader, presently the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair), colloquially known as the 'defendant' being the most experienced defendant in the Fraser Cabinet, although this is a title for which his National Country Party ministerial colleague the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) is currently throwing out a serious challenge. The Minister for Defence is the defendant of the funeral parlour scandal and the defendant of the Senate committee condemnation which said that it preferred the evidence of Mr Webster to the evidence of Mr Sinclair. </PARA>
<PARA> We have Mr Nixon who applied National Country Party standards to the personnel of the Australian Dairy Corporation. When Mr Pyle was caught by the Senate committee with his fist in dairy farmers' pockets he was allowed by Mr Nixon to remain on the Corporation. He paid back some of the money that he should not have got in the first place. He was demoted from Deputy Chairman to ordinary board member. I repeat: He was caught with his fist in dairy farmers' pockets and he was allowed to remain on the board. Is it surprising under those circumstances that dairy companies have recently been shown to have misused Reserve Bank of Australia funds following the example of behaviour set by Mr Pyle and accepted by Mr Nixon?</PARA>
<PARA> A social consensus is a prerequisite for a prices and incomes policy and an aid to growth-in that sense an end in itself. A social consensus cannot be achieved unless a government has moral authority. The prerequisite of moral authority and such a happier social state being achieved is the removal from office of this dogma-bound government which has no remaining credibility and can never gain any moral authority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a matter of public importance brought before it by the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button) in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Fraser Government to provide leadership at a time of great social and economic difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA>I would be prepared to agree that the early 1980s is a period of social and economic difficulty. I think the debate could be conducted with some degree of common ground on that. The social difficulties, are, of course, very much mixed up with the economic difficulties which can be identified in this country and, indeed, in most of the Western world and, I think, in the non-Western world. The economic difficulties which we face are reflected in a declining world trade, in extremely high levels of unemployment around the world with an expected total of some 30 million people unemployed in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Countries and in a situation where inflation is giving rise to very real difficulties and where economic growth is not as high as is required to maintain high levels of employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulties that we and other countries face in the economic field in turn produce social difficulties. Recent studies on poverty in Australia clearly indicate that a substantial component of the group in Australia which is in poverty or which can be measured as being in poverty is drawn from the unemployed. Yes, we live in a time where there are some social and economic difficulties. I should mention that some of the social difficulties are related also to the fact that we live in a period of social change. It is well known to honourable senators and I think it is now well known to the public that at least some of the increased social difficulites are caused by marriage breakdown and by a changing sense of responsibilities of spouses to each other and of parents to children. They are matters about which we should all be concerned and which require the attention of Government. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the debate as put forward by Senator Button, however, I must say that he adopted a scattergun approach to the matter as my colleague the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) said. He referred to a whole list of difficulties some of which touched on the social difficulties to which I intend to address myself in this debate. For example, he referred to declining home ownership. The statistics which we have continue to show that Australia has a remarkable record in the field of home ownership. They show some decline from 1978 to 1980; the regular surveys appear only to be available from 1978 onwards. But we can say that the home ownership rate grew from 52 per cent in 1947 to 63 per cent in 1954. By 1978 it had risen to I think an all-time high of 73.4 per cent and in the latest survey it stands at about 72 per cent. So, yes, there is a small decline and that decline may relate to the problem of interest rates which, again, is a world wide problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button referred to growing poverty. The most recent measures suggest not so much that poverty in Australia has grown in substantial terms but rather that poverty has shifted, with the group in poverty, while remaining fairly constant in number, changing in composition. It is a fact that the number of aged persons living in poverty appears to have declined substantially thanks to the policies of the last 10 years which have increased substantially assistance to that sector. It is quite clear that that has been replaced by a rising number of single parents and by a rising number of long term unemployed people. The problems are different and therefore require fresh solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button also referred to the declining value of pensions. He knows that the Government has protected the value of pensions-not their value relative to wages but their absolute value compared with the cost of living-by ensuring twice yearly adjustment on an automatic basis. Senator Button asked that we avoid ideology. It seems to me that ideology is not something of which this Government can be accused. He accused us of being monetarists. I defy him to produce an economic commentator who would suggest that this Government has followed strict monetarist policies in its Budget strategies over the last six years. Rather, I would have thought that it would be easy to produce critics who would say that we have not paid a strict regard to monetary theory. I doubt that Senator Button is advocating a disregard of monetary policy and of setting some limits to monetary growth. I think the last Labor person to do that was Dr Cairns when he was Treasurer. He showed a certain disregard for the money supply and he was very swiftly replaced by the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) . I doubt that one would find an economist in Australia who would say that we had strictly adhered to, say, the principle of free trade. Indeed, we had criticism from the second speaker for the Opposition, Senator Walsh, who suggested that we were less than pure in that regard. I suggest that the Government has shown a proper concern for the realities in the selection of its policies. I would not wish to repeat the arguments put forward by Senator Durack which set out the approaches we adopted to some of the basic problems faced by this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh drew attention to Australia's good growth record for the years 1974 and 1975 under Labor, campared with the general growth record of the OECD countries. In response to that, I say only that what was quite clear from the published statements of the Labor Party by the end of 1975 was that it had accepted that its economic strategies of that time were mistaken and had led to a very great increase in unemployment and to a decrease in economic stability. If honourable senators want a sensible criticism of the policies which had been followed, they cannot do better than to read Mr Hayden's Budget Speech of 1975, in which he set about trying to rectify some of the problems of the past. Whilst one can point to high growth figures in 1974 and 1975, one can point also to the fundamental disequilibrium that was introduced by the policies of those years-a fundamental disequilibrium which it has been extremely difficult for us to overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> I was delighted to note that Senator Walsh agreed with the basic logic of the approach of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to the international sector when he sought international agreement that there should be an end to new protective devices and, further, a step towards reducing protection with a view to restoring world trade and world economic health. It is easy for Senator Walsh to concede the logic and to say: 'But, ha, this Government has not lived up to that logic in its domestic policies'. I point out that, in a world in which we face the restrictive practices of other countries and in which our rural industries, for example, are challenged by the practices of the European Economic Community, it is quite impossible for Australia alone to take a doctrinaire approach to protection. One need do no more than to go back to the words of Senator Button to be reminded of why that is so. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the speeches which have been made by members of the Opposition, I agree with one substantial point. I agree with the basic point by Senator Walsh that to manage the economy successfully we probably have to achieve a high degree of social consensus. It remains true that whilst all sectors of the community are demanding more than the community can provide- be it the trade unions, the government with its demands for resources, the welfare sector or business-and expect the system to produce more than it can, we cannot totally overcome our economic problems. I believe that is important. The Government has an important role in ensuring that there is community understanding of the limitations which we face and which provide the parameters within which any economic policy can be put to work. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic accusation in this matter of public importance is that we have failed to provide a lead at a time of social difficulty. The time for these debates is very limited. I have time only to touch upon a few of the points which I think clearly show that the Government has established a lead and has shown the Australian people the direction in which it wishes to go. I touch on them lightly because time will permit nothing more. </PARA>
<PARA> I touch upon the area for which I was formerly responsible-that of Aboriginal Affairs. I point to the first enactment by this Government of land rights legislation, to the establishment of the Aboriginal Development Commission which has put into Aboriginal hands programs with an annual value of nearly $50m and to the establishment of a representative Aboriginal organisation, the National Aboriginal Conference. It is an area which one might say is of little economic importance, but an area which has been one of great social difficulty in Australia for generations and in which this Government has given a clear and unmistakable lead. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the important area of ethnic affairs. In a country which is so heavily populated by migrants who have been invited to this country and who now make up such an important part of our population, we have had the implementation of the recommendations of the Galbally Review of Post-arrival Programs and Services to Migrants Committee. No government has addressed itself with more concern to the post-arrival needs of migrants. A host of recommendations have received the attention of the Government and now provide assistance to migrants to Australia in their very often quite difficult transition to living in a new country. </PARA>
<PARA> In the field of education it is so easy to overlook the achievement of the standards laid down by the Karmel Interim Committee for the Australian Schools Commission-standards which were initially established under the previous Government and which have been met in all States under this Government. It is easy to overlook the new emphasis which has been given to technical and further education. Again, I do not have time to go into the statistics but it is well known in this chamber and outside it that technical and further education has received very great impetus under this Government because we understand the need for training for work and we believe that that part of education has in the past been under- emphasised. I point to our emphasis on transition from school to work as another example of programmed development which is aimed at the reality of Australia in the early 1980s and at the difficult social and economic problems which we face. </PARA>
<PARA> I point to the programs of what was the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs. We made substantial investment, and continue to make substantial investment, in programs which will assist young Australians to achieve job skills. We have had a very substantial increase in expenditure on these programs , from $165m in 1980-81 to $206m in 1981-82. This year 235,000 young Australians will be assisted by these programs- 23,000 more than last year. In the past two years we have had a record intake of apprentices. I point to the various programs introduced by my colleage, Ian Viner, under the general heading of commitment to youth which provide for school-to-work transition allowances and things of that nature. In that field the clearest possible leadership has been given by the Government to the community. We expect the difficulties of the present to give rise to new programs and a new effort by the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn very quickly to my own Department, the Department of Social Security, and to my own responsibilities, which are intimately concerned with the social difficulties which exist in our community. I point to the fact that in 1976 we made a series of major changes which have been of great benefit to the Australian community. I point to the establishment of family allowances and I remind the Senate that the major effect of the introduction of family allowances was not to help the well-off who lost their tax allowances and gained a family allowance in its place but to help the poorest families to which tax allowances were irrelevant. It is this Government which has ensured that poorer families receive at least the same assistance as better off families. </PARA>
<PARA> I point to the introduction of the income test which has facilitated access to the pension by many aged Australians and, most importantly, I point to the twice -yearly indexation of the basic rates of benefits as the fundamental protection given to most Australians who are dependent upon my Department for income support. I point to the introduction of the supporting parents benefit, which extended to supporting fathers the benefits which previously had been available only to supporting mothers. I point to the extension of health benefits to sickness beneficiaries, to the unemployed and to low income earners. These are the sorts of steps which the Government has taken to face up to the realities of a changing Australia, an Australia in which some of our people do not have the benefits that the great mass of Australians in employment enjoy. I can say only that the Government remains intent on meeting problems as they emerge, on removing the problems which exist and promoting a healthy economy, employment and the way of life in Australia which makes Australia probably the best country in the world in which to life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am always pleased to follow Senator Chaney in a debate. He can always be relied upon to make a thoughtful contribution to a debate of this kind. My remarks will centre on him because I understand that Senator Chaney, whom I believe to be one of the true liberals in this Parliament, will be used by the Liberal Party as an instrument of new Government policy throughout the next Budget. The policy that seems to be coming out of Government circles, particularly Liberal circles, as a cure for the economic and social ills affecting our community is the policy of implementing massive cuts in welfare as a feature of the next Budget. I will deal with that matter in a little detail as I continue my speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all, if anyone listening to this debate believes that I am making cheap political capital out of the dilemma in which the Government finds itself today, he has every right to criticise me. But I have great sympathy for the problems that this Government faces and I would have enormous sympathy for the Australian Labor Party, if it assumes office within the next year or two, in trying to solve the sorts of problems that face Australia at the moment. Let us not minimise them and say that they are easy to be solved or that by one sweep of the pen we can fix all of Australia's problems. Let us realise that the problems of Australia are part of a world problem which will affect all of us in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> As we debate this matter of public importance put forward by Senator Button concerning the failure of the Fraser Government to provide leadership at a time of great social and economic difficulty, let us look at the situation in Australia. The world economy is in some form of recession. Some economists believe that that recession will deepen. The Australian currency at the moment, in my view, is between 12 per cent and 15 per cent over-valued. The world is becoming more and more protectionist. Australia is one of the few areas in the world in which massive walls of protection have not yet been erected. I look at the world scene today with not too much optimism not only for the future of the economy of Australia and other parts of the world but also for the narrower and narrower fields in which to manoeuvre which are being left to countries such as Australia. The rest of the world is becoming more protectionist. Let us not kid ourselves about that. Very few other countries still have tariff barriers over which the main exporters in the world can jump. Yet, altruistically, we are trying to say to the world: 'If we want to make a better and less troubled world we have to reduce trade barriers'. How Australia can do that in a world in which trade barriers are going up and up confounds me. In entering this debate today I do not want to give the impression that the Australian Democrats will show people how to fix everything and thereby make cheap political points because I do not think that they are there to be made. But I do wish to be critical-I hope constructively-of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button is generous to a fault in the wording of his matter of public importance. He charges the Fraser Government with the failure to provide leadership at a time of great social and economic difficulty. The implication is that the Government has been incompetent, indecisive and ineffective. I suppose one can be excused for thinking that that is the case. In Australia at the moment interest rates are as high as they have ever been. The level of real unemployment is at 12 per cent to 13 per cent and rising. Inflation is high. The number of bankruptcies is up and rising. Queues for welfare housing are growing- something like 100,000 families. An increasing number of people have to ask for charity just to survive. That figure is now about 250,000 Australia-wide, and that is a conservative estimate. A recent survey showed that 15,000 young people are homeless in Victoria alone. The unemployment rate among young people is three times as high as the adult rate. Are we surprised to find that the youth delinquency rate is rising?</PARA>
<PARA> One could say that the Fraser Government is responsible for all these things. These things are facts, and I do not think they can be contradicted. All that the Democrats and I are saying is: Using the same sort of conventional wisdom, under a Labor government would things have been essentially different or are new concepts necessary? We have heard Senator Chaney quite properly point to the problems we will have with welfare in the future and the enormous number of aged people who will need to be supported in Australia in the next decade because our population is growing older. He also mentioned the growth of the welfare bill, which will reach astronomic proportions. There is no question about that, and he does a proper job of warning us of it. But there is an underlying assumption on the part of Senator Chaney and others that it is in fact the taxpayers' responsibility to support all aged people. In a humane society, of course, those of us who pay taxes must claim responsibility for the down and outs and for the aged who have no one to fall back on. </PARA>
<PARA> But how about re-introducing the concept of the extended family? Is there anything basically wrong with the concept of the orientals and the mid-Europeans who come to Australia to whom it is an inalienable responsibility? We in this country are very fond of talking about inalienable rights but there is inalienable responsibility to look after our mothers and fathers when they get old. That has gone out of fashion in this country in something like 10 to 15 years. Every young couple now assumes that the State will look after mum and dad when they are old and that those couples have no responsibilities. It is remarkable how quickly that change has come about. It has been assisted by governments of both Liberal and Labor persuasions with the best possible intentions of being compassionate and caring for the aged in our community. Of course I am commending government involvement as a concept, but I am wondering whether it is not time for governments to give a lead to people and say: 'It is just not good enough. Our economy cannot afford the concept that when a person reaches the age of 60 he or she is totally dependent on the state, on the taxpayer. You-the daughter, the son-have a responsibility to your aging parents, and a financial responsibility at that'. This is not a new concept; it is a concept that is being pursued, as I said, by most middle Europeans, including those who have migrated to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> During my visit to China a year or two ago I learned that it was unthinkable that any aged person in China be left to the mercy of the state. Such people are primarily, basically and totally the responsibility of their children, particularly when they become too frail or too old to look after themselves. I give that as one example in expressing a belief that the difficulties that Senator Chaney and the Government are now envisaging can be solved. But they cannot be solved by conventional methods such as getting more money through higher taxation. One of the things that bother me is that that 'more money' will not be available. There is not a bottomless pit from which to draw unlimited amounts to spend on education, social welfare and other matters on which everybody in this chamber and in this Parliament wants to spend money. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats do not walk away from a capital gains tax or a wealth tax. We unashamedly say that it ought to be levied. Levelled at 2 per cent of the total revenue it would give $800m a year additional revenue to the Government. In saying 'a capital gains tax or a wealth tax' let my words not be distorted by our political opponents as the Liberals distorted the words of Mr Hayden at the last election. We should exempt private homes-of course, they would have to be exempted-up to, say, a limit of $200,000. Tax on private possessions would be limited. A capital gains tax or a wealth tax should not hit ordinary people whose wealth increases on paper just because of inflation or some other measure. Why should people who have enormous amounts of money, or who by manipulating stock markets or some other means make massive profits of millions of dollars, be allowed, because of good accountants' advice or tax avoiders' advice, to get away scot-free? The Democrats believe a resources tax at the pithead is essential. It would bring in $500m additional revenue mainly from multinationals . We believe that sections such as section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act could be strengthened to such an extent as to allow the $5,000m to $10,000m tax which is being avoided at the moment to be reaped.</PARA>
<PARA> Although we say that the money that governments can spend does not come from a bottomless pit, there are sources of revenue which have not yet been tapped by this Government. The trends that I have mentioned are not necessarily the result of government bungling. If they were there could be some hope because another government could fix them up. The measures needed are obviously simple and well documented. Certain action can be taken in the short term. Interest rates for housing and small business could be subsidised. Selective increases in government spending could be used to stimulate economic activity. A range of relatively minor reforms to the income security system could be made to eliminate the most glaringly obvious poverty traps. However these are band-aids.</PARA>
<PARA> What bothers me is that certain signals are being given out by the Liberal Party as to its future policies. I fear that its response to the problems that I have outlined is to resort to a jungle society. There is no less an authority on that than the Federal Council of the Liberal Party of Australia. I commend Mr Geoffrey Barker's magnificent article in the Age on 22 May this year. The rhetoric employed by the Federal Council of the Liberal Party is seductive. It states that future economic growth should be 'based on individual initiative and enterprise within a competitive market with minimum government interference'. The words point to a strong and significant shift to a new social Darwinism. As a matter of government policy it is the survival of the fittest. The notion of government intervention to create and preserve equality of opportunity is gone. This could 'limit individual initiative, achievement or reward'. Instead, according to the Federal Council of the Liberal Party people will be encouraged to 'provide for themselves'. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course there is a fatal flaw in this philosophy. In our society those who can provide for themselves are the strong, the ruthless and the wealthy. In a remarkably frank way the Government is signalling a determined policy to preserve the advantages of the privileged. We say that there must be new concepts, a new look. We must acknowledge that the silicon chip is here and have a long term indicative plan against it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the luncheon recess we were debating a matter of public importance raised by the Opposition in which it has alleged that the Fraser Government has failed to provide leadership at a time of great social and economic difficulty. On behalf of the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, I confidently reassure Senator Chipp, who spoke immediately before lunch, that the fears he expressed of massive cuts in welfare, as he put it, in the next Budget are highly unlikely. Apart from that I do not intend to say very much at all about Senator Chipp's speech. It sounded rather like a policy speech, an interesting one, that may be delivered on another occasion in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the matter of public importance which concerned the question of the leadership of Australia was raised by the Australian Labor Party. I will concentrate on the Labor Party's vision of Australia and its views of the leadership and vision shown by the Fraser Government. One cannot, as Senator Button, the Leader of the Opposition sought to do, just sweep aside the fact that Australia is a country very much influenced by what happens elsewhere in the world. Leadership has to be viewed in two ways. One view is in relation to the way in which a country is led in terms of its international position. The second view is in relation to how it is led in terms of its national difficulties and problems. Those two aspects go together. As I said, one just cannot sweep aside the fact that Australia as a nation in many ways is dependent on what happens in a world context because some of the sources of problems that we freely admit are faced by the country at the moment are related to that area. Therefore, the question of leadership and the leadership that the Fraser Government is giving to Australia must be directed in that area as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is a major trading nation. Our effectiveness as a trading nation will determine our future living standards and expectations. The social and economic difficulties that the Labor Party referred to are, of course, bound up with our living standards and expectations, present and future. Leadership is best demonstrated by a willingness to follow. I suggest to the Labor Party that over the years Liberal governments have been vindicated by a clear and overwhelming willingness to follow on many occasions on behalf of the Australian public. Undoubtedly the reason for that is that Australian citizens, when they have voted in so many elections and endorsed so many Liberal governments, have accepted that the approach of a Liberal government to problems is the approach that they prefer. That acceptance of policies is an endorsement of that approach . </PARA>
<PARA> To demonstrate or to give leadership a government must understand the issues that a country faces. I reiterate that this is in both an international and national context. Liberal governments accept that there is an interdependence of all citizens. They accept that governments set the rules and the framework and that it is within those rules and the framework set by the rules that the country will operate. We prefer that there not be over-much government interference in matters between citizens. But we accept that on occasions government action is necessary to provide that leadership that we are debating here today. We consider that there is interdependence between unions and employers. We try to point out that there is an interdependence between the taxpayer and the welfare recipient. One cannot, as the Labor Party has sought in the debate today, take each one of those issues individually without relating them to the other. The acceptance that there is an interdependence of all citizens and that governments set the framework will lead to sound policies if that framework is correct. Those sound policies will lead to confidence in many ways. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button during his speech suggested that perhaps we should not look at the record of the Whitlam Government. He said that the Fraser Government has been in power for nearly seven years now and that it should be judged by its own record. We stand on our own record. We say that the record that this Government has achieved in its time in government shows that it is providing the right policies and therefore the leadership that Australians expect. One should not entirely ignore the experience of Australia under a Labor government. The debate today essentially is about the Fraser Government. Since it is the Labor Party that is criticising the policies of the Fraser Government, the Labor Party's own policies are relevant to the debate. By implication the Labor Party indicates that it would provide better and preferred leadership for Australians. One should not forget that the verdict not only of Australian citizens but also of people elsewhere who scrutinise Australia for various reasons was negative under a Labor government. For example, in 1975 the number of people leaving Australia for the first time exceeded the number of people coming to this country to live. That showed people voting with their feet and was an indication of the effect of the Labor Party's policies not only within Australia but also as they were perceived elsewhere. This party has the same basic approach and philosophy in Opposition as it had when it was in government. Therefore, we could expect more of the same. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button did not spend much time enumerating specific areas in which he thought different policies would provide better leadership. He did not spend much time stating what leadership Labor would give through its policies. We ought to remember that the basis of those policies is divisive. In 1974 nearly 6 .3 million working days were lost under a Labor government. That is an indication of divisive industrial policies and an approach to an area which, as I said a couple of minutes ago, requires a mutual understanding on both sides. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the comments made recently by the new Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Macphee, when he pointed out very effectively that industrial relations is very much a matter of relations between people, that taking issues on their merit and understanding what people want and how they interact with one another is important. It is reflected in policies that indicate that excessive wage rises are not good for other people; they might be good for workers who get them, at least temporarily. To give without criticism any sort of endorsement of moves in that area without regard to Australia's overall economic situation, to what effect those policies will have on Australia 's position as a trading nation and, in the end, that means without regard to how many jobs there will be left in Australia, our ability to maintain our living standards and our ability to meet higher future expectations, is indeed highly irresponsible and not what one would expect from a party that has aspirations to lead this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Politics of discontent and envy, of looking at what somebody else has and saying, 'I ought to have that too', just because somebody else has it, is not a basis for sound leadership of this country. Of course, the Labor Party likes citizens to be dependent on government because dependence on government means that it is easer for governments to control the details of the lives of citizens . The recognition of the basic factors for a harmonious and progressive country is demonstrated in confidence as I indicated earlier. There are many indications of confidence in Australia both within this country and outside. I contrast the situation as it is today in regard to the desire of people from other countries to come and live in Australia with the indication I gave a minute ago of the situation of the last year of the Whitlam Government when more people left Australia than wanted to come here. </PARA>
<PARA> Briefly I instance the matter of foreign investment in Australia and the fact that investment of money in this country remains high and strong. That is an assessment by others who are looking at the situation in this country in a world context. If they did not believe the Government's policies were strong and sound and that the leadership this country has taken is in the right direction, then those investors would not be putting their money and their financial future in this country. I say also very briefly something which I think was not said before. Another good instance of that fact, frankly, is in relation to what has happened with foreign investment as it relates to interest rates. Interest rates are lamentably high. I will accept that. Nobody in the Government says anything else. It is interesting, however, that, when the prime interest rate in the United States of America was so very much higher than here in Australia, that did not lead to the flood of money out of the country that one might have expected and which has been the case on occasions in the past. That was an indication of the long term confidence that investors had in this country and continuing high levels of investment in Australia are an indication of a continuing high confidence in the leadership the Fraser Government is giving Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect and measure of a government's capacity to lead are the clear directions that it gives to a country through its policies. Our economic policies have been clear. They have been policies geared to growth, to investment and to individual development of our citizens. Senator Chaney, the Minister for Social Security, when he spoke detailed a number of areas in which the Fraser Government has shown its concern for the economic security of its citizens. I would like to refer just very briefly to one other area, since time in this debate is so limited, and that is the area of education. We have a bulge in our population at the moment which has put pressure on both our education facilities and capacities and on our employment situation. We hope it will be temporary. We are not sitting back and waiting for that situation to take care of itself. We have pursued vigorous policies, particularly in the area of directing the interface between school to work transition. We have provided much money for development of educational programs which make more easy the transition from school to work so that our young people are more attractive employment prospects for employers. We have also given attention to areas of particular need which might have discriminated against groups in the past, areas such as multicultural education and migrant education. Finally, the Fraser Government has had the courage to implement those policies which have shown an understanding of the country and which also show an indication of what the Fraser Government's expectations are for Australia in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I return very briefly to what Senator Button said during his speech. He said that it is no good blaming Australia's problems on trade unions, the world economy, and so on. He wanted to sweep away the factors that influence our country and which have some bearing on government policy. In other words, he was encouraging an attitude that I deplore, an attitude that one hears all the time, that 'they should do something about it'. He would seek to encourage Australians to think that governments are omnipotent, all powerful, and when faced with the problem do have the solutions entirely within their own hands. The sensible role for any government and a measure of true leadership is that it recognises those problems, recognises what solutions are available to it and operates in what it thinks is the best possible way for the benefit of all citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we have had a useful and constructive debate today in which many areas and issues have been aired. I believe that in the long run the Fraser Government 's leadership in these areas of social and economic difficulty raised by the Opposition will be vindicated by the electorate. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Albury-Wodonga Development ( Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill seeks to vary the existing conditions under which certain financial arrangements are provided for under the 1973 Albury- Wodonga (Financial Assistance) Act. Specifically, it will give assistance to the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation and relieve it of its debt burden to the Commonwealth. To that extent and for this basic reason alone the Opposition supports the Bill. However, the Opposition wants to take advantage of debating this matter because it is concerned with the policies being pursued by the Government and views with great regret the approach that the Government has taken generally to the Albury-Wodonga decentralisation proposals and specifically its approach to regional development and decentralisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If ever there was an issue that needs a national input, and is a national responsibility, it is decentralisation. It is an issue to which all political parties pay a degree of lip service and one which all parties supposedly support . However, it has to be said that since the Fraser Government has come to power there has been a general reluctance to follow the initiatives that were taken by the Whitlam Administration during the years 1972 to 1975. Those initiatives were taken because the Australian Labor Party recognised that there was a problem of urbanisation in Australia-the country with the highest rate of urbanisation-and that it required an input by the national government to redress the inevitable drift that was taking place from rural centres to the cities. We subsequently set about establishing a number of regional centres and concepts with a view of at least influencing that trend in the other direction, that is, of establishing satellite cities and other large centres in rural areas to relieve the pressures that were clearly building up in the capital cities, principally Sydney and Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking now at that initiative, one has to regret very much the failure of this Government to continue those policies that were begun in those important areas. Referring specifically to Albury-Wodonga, the first report of the Development Corporation in 1974 stated the aims of that particular project. The report stated that the Corporation sought to build a new and vigorous city in which there would be a high level of physical and social planning. That concept would be supported by any person who understands the need for a proper policy at the national level. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that social planning is an essential prerequisite in any decentralisation policy. The social planning that was prepared for Albury -Wodonga was tailored to meet the particular needs of different social categories-age, income and so on-so that where possible the lifestyle of the existing population would be capable of being continued with a minimal amount of intrusion. In other words, we were learning from our experience in Canberra-a city that was planned and has certain objectives which, to some extent, have been largely realised. That planning would proceed from a full understanding of the historical, social, ecological and geographical uniqueness of a development region. We believe that all citizens would have the opportunity to be informed about and share in the shaping and planning of that new community. </PARA>
<PARA> During the several visits that I have made to that region in the years that I have been a member of this Parliament and since the Corporation was established I have seen in practice how the Corporation has sought to fulfil those early objectives and principles of involving citizens in the planning of a decentralisation project. That planning of course would ensure that the advantages of the growth would be shared by existing residents and newcomers; that there would be adequate compensation to those who owned land where land acquisitions for development purposes were undertaken by the Corporation; that every possible care would be taken in the protection of the local ecology; that places of historical interest and importance would be preserved; that future trends and possibilities would be adequately prepared for; and that there would be an allowance for maximum flexibility, both physical and social, to adjust easily to changes of need and desire. That planning would respond to all of these requirements with as new and as fresh an approach as possible. In other words we should have learnt from the great problems of congestion which is such a feature of modern Western civilisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The initiative taken in Albury-Wodonga was most importantly a significant new development in the whole area of government co-operation. Many initiatives were taken by the Commonwealth Government. There was co-operation with the States and , in particular, with local government as the planning authority. It was very pleasing to see that that co-operation has extended over a period of years. Of course the reasons for this are paramount and manifold. I know from my own experience that when the State Government provided for what was known as the Sydney region outline plan back in the 1960s it recognised that, as a result of Commonwealth and State initiatives, there would be a population increase approximately double that of the city of Sydney and that this would require an understanding on the part of the authorities to provide at least double the existing public facilities if they were to carry out their function as planning organisations. In other words, there would have to be double the number of roads , ports, wharves, airports, housing-public and private-hospitals, schools and all of the other facilities which are clearly the responsibility of both the Federal and State governments. Because of the failure of adequate policies of decentralisation that outline plan, which we have seen now in its stages of implementation, put tremendous pressures on local councils, local authorities and local citizen's groups. The weight of the increase in population required a replanning of many of the existing suburban areas to accommodate the population pressures and an introduction of forms of high density development. I think we are all aware of the reaction that citizens have to that sort of problem in existing major cities. </PARA>
<PARA> It became clear to the Labor administration that there needed to be a very strong acceptance of its responsibilities in the area of decentralisation. We regret very much that the present Government has retreated on the initiatives that were taken by Mr Whitlam and Mr Uren, who was the Labor Party's Minister and spokesman on these matters, during the years 1972 to 1975. Much to the detriment of Albury-Wodonga and other regional centres the future of city dwellers and those who support decentralisation has been affected. Current Government spokesmen claim that the Labor approach during the Whitlam period was a free spending one. They claim furthermore that Labor's approach was over- centralised-quite the opposite of course to the strategy of the Whitlam Government in that period. As an alternative this Government posits its new federalism and a faith in the free market as the answer to these sorts of problems. The Albury-Wodonga project was aimed at combating the sprawl and the growth of our major cities which have lessened the quality of life and increased the cost of living, in particular the cost of buying land. It was a project that was aimed at co-ordinating and distributing growth in a planned and proper way. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all right for this Government to talk about controlling the rate of inflation. This Government has an index that seeks to suggest that somehow or other the rate of inflation has been maintained. But that index ignores the basic problem of accommodation-that area which affects every family and every person in one way or another. Of course what has happened in Sydney and I am sure to a lesser extent in other capital cities since the Fraser Government came to office has been another spiral in the cost of accommodation and land. In the post-war years we have seen an increase in the price of land and accommodation of something like 500 times what it was at the end of World War I. This has occurred as the result of the buildup of pressures that have taken place in our urban regions and particularly in our capital cities. Surely this matter has to be taken into consideration when we talk about containing or restraining the rate of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> The biggest single expenditure item that any family has to meet is the provision of shelter. This has proceeded at an alarming rate in the post-war years as a direct result of a lack of national planning by conservative governments. After all, governments at the national level have policies, for example, about migration. We are aware that this Government is bringing into Australia more than 100,000 people every year through its migration programs. We do not quarrel with that figure but the cumulative effect is that in 10 years more than a million people will have been brought into an urban scene. Those people do not come and live in rural Australia; in a substantive sense they come and live in the major cities. The figures that are available show that there is no doubt that most of those people settle in the major States and in the major cities. This puts pressures on the costs of providing not only accommodation but also public facilities. We are now confronted with the latest estimate by the former Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Macphee, who, in his statement of last year, projected that there would be a population of approximately 19.5 million by the year 2000. If we talk about it in round figures the Commonwealth projects that, by the year 2000, we will have about 20 million people in this country. That projection has been made mainly because in the last few years there has been, as I have said, a rapid increase in the rate of inflation. There has also been an upturn in the number of Australian-born persons. </PARA>
<PARA> The program that the Australian Labor Party proposed for decentralisation during its years in office, specifically in respect of this legislation dealing with Albury-Wodonga, was based on a projected population of 17.5 million. The projected population increase of 2 million represents about an 11 per cent increase over the previous projection. What, then, are the prospects for the future? This Government takes the view that it should not intervene, it should not have an interest in planning for that increase in population by providing land, accommodation, jobs and growth in regions other than the capital cities. Clearly, there will be population growth, as I have indicated, and unless something is done about it nationally our major cities will take, as they are taking at the moment, all this growth. The social problems caused thereby will be disastrous. One has only to talk about the airport problem in Sydney to indicate this. The longer the governments concerned fail to agree on this matter , the greater the problem will be. It was talked about when I was in local government 20 years ago and here we are in 1982 and the matter still has not been resolved. The longer it is delayed the greater the problem will be. There is not a capital city anywhere in the world that does not now have a second airport that can cater for the growth of traffic, particularly international traffic. </PARA>
<PARA> A government with foresight and compassion would take this into account and prepare a plan for the future. This Government does not believe in planning for these matters. It believes in leaving all such matters to the private sector. This is an indictment of the Government, but a suitable plan will be an important part of the next Labor government's program. We will re-establish a plan that will take into consideration all the processes of change that are taking place in our country, whether they be in population, industry or whatever . Our approach certainly will not be that of the current bunch of people who masquerade as a government in this country. This Government, which claims to have come to office to legislate and operate in the interests of all people, ignores the basic problems facing a great number of the Australian people. If we look closely at the Government's current approach, we discover that for the first time in history we have a Federal Government that has no regional development policies at all. It will be recalled that several years ago the Fraser Government decided to abolish the Department of Urban and Regional Development. In its recent rearrangement and reshuffle of Ministers it even took the next step of abolishing the Department of Housing and Construction. The Opposition finds it inconceivable and unbelievable that a government claiming to represent the Australian people has abolished such important departments having such very important national functions. </PARA>
<PARA> We therefore have a government that has no regional development policies at all . Federal funds for urban and regional development, which were a feature of the Whitlam period, have been cut by 90 per cent since this Government came to office in 1975. So it has a very deplorable and sorry record to show the Australian people. The small allocation made in the 1981-82 Budget was made for the winding up of former programs. That means that in the next Budget, which we will be discussing when we come back to Canberra in August, we can be almost certain that there will be no funds at all for regional centre growth programs because such programs are clearly defunct and unnecessary in the mind of this Government. In April 1981 the Federal Government terminated the decentralisation assistance program and abolished the Decentralisation Advisory Board. That was one of the famous or infamous decisions of the razor gang, or the committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions, headed by Sir Phillip Lynch. The Government has dismantled former regional development programs and has pursued policies which have had a dislocating effect on the lives of many people and a disruptive effect on the viability of regional economies. It has put the responsibility for this back on to the States. The Government has failed to bring any co-ordination into the process of industrial restructuring that has occurred over the last six years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has completely opted out of regional development. It has , according to its own policies of new federalism, left the problems to the States. We all know that the States are incapable of providing funds and leadership in these areas, but they could do so in co-operation with a government that has a national concept. The States, of course, recognise that they have been sold a pup. They have no funds to service the regions adequately. That is apparent in all the relationships between the Commonwealth and the States whether they be in regard to education or hospitals. We are aware that this Government has placed a tremendous responsibility on the States, one to which they were unable, because of funding difficulties, to respond adequately. Albury-Wodonga has been left now to develop on its own. It was given a good start in 1974 when we were in office, and since then the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation itself has soldiered on very well. One can only compliment the Corporation on the way in which it has carried out the brief given to it in the original legislation. It is interesting to note, however, that the public sector-that sector which the Government can push ahead-has stagnated in recent times. Public sector employment has hardly increased compared with private employment. I have a table of employment figures from the 1981 annual report of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation which shows that public sector employment is languishing far behind private sector employment activitity in the region. I seek leave to have the table incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is not pulling its weight. Those on the other side of the chamber may claim that this is a case of the free market and the private sector doing its job. In the last century and the early part of this century it was the public sector which helped to develop our rural areas. It was Federal government and, particularly in the last century, State government initiatives, incentives and specific programs which brought about the establishment of so many of those country centres which have been able to maintain themselves in the succeeding years. We believe that as a result of the policies being pursued by the Government it is a case of government neglecting its role in a mixed economy and neglecting its role in decentralisation. Whilst we support the concept of a mixed economy we believe there is a need for greater public input which is so crucial in the effort to better the lives of the Australian people whether they live at Broken Hill, Albury-Wodonga, Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne or anywhere else. This 'let it all slide' attitude and its effect elsewhere have a debilitating effect upon the average citizen. In the booming mining towns such as Gladstone or those in the Latrobe and Hunter valleys, the lack of urban and regional planning and the failure to provide local authorities and State governments with funds for infrastructure have resulted in chaos, a lack of social facilities and basic services, dreadful accommodation shortages and social problems galore. One does not need to visit those areas to understand and appreciate the depth of the problem. Those problems need the assistance of Federal Government initiatives. This is another side of the Government's total reliance on the concept of a free market philosophy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the Australian Labor Party sees the initiatives of Albury-Wodonga as a beginning to the sort of approach it will take when it comes back into office. It is a part of what the Labor Party sees as an overall plan to develop and diversify city, regional and country living in Australia. The current Government ignores that approach and, naturally, the people and towns of Australia suffer. We congratulate the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation on its work so far and we look forward to the time when it can be assured of receiving from the Commonwealth the co-operation and help it deserves, not only with respect to Albury-Wodonga but also with respect to at least another dozen regional centres in Australia that can prosper and develop only with the assistance of a government that has a concept of recognising its responsibilities in decentralisation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Albury-Wodonga Development (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 1982 is to enact an agreement between New South Wales, Victoria and the Commonwealth by which New South Wales and Victoria will be relieved of their obligations to repay loans and to pay interest on loans provided by the Commonwealth in relation to Albury-Wodonga. In lieu of repayments the Commonwealth will have access to funds generated by development activities. The Australian Democrats do not oppose this Bill but it does give the opportunity to take pause and consider the whole question of decentralisation in Australia. Indeed, our dismal failure to decentralise is one of the important submerged issues of our society. It is very far from being academic. It is unhealthy socially for a nation our size to have a larger proportion of its people living in a few large coastal cities than any comparable nation on earth. It shows a degree of lack of concern, a lack of appreciation of the great natural assets we control and a sort of contempt for the fact that we do not use or apparently want to use most parts of this whole continent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our rate of major urbanisation is very unhealthy socially but from the point of view of defence strategy the scenario is even more alarming. A majority of our citizens in this country are concentrated in a small number of large coastal cities, each of which is indeed a sitting duck for submarine missile attack in time of war. I have seen calculations showing how two submarines using their missiles-two submarines only-could do the job of destroying the bulk of the population in all of our major cities. Of course, we have nothing in the way of defensive apparatus that would prevent those missiles arriving. In addition, by far the largest part of our industry is also among the eggs in those few baskets . We have also thoughtfully provided major targets in time of war, possibly even nuclear targets, smack in the middle of our biggest cities-just in the way we have placed Garden Island, one of our naval bases, as strategically in the centre of Sydney as it would be possible to put it-thereby guaranteeing that in the case of war enormous casualties would occur in our major cities. That seems madness to me and to the Australian Democrats. We should be trying to strengthen the viability of other areas of population, especially to try to make them as self-sufficient as possible, with small localised supplies of electric power, their own health services and balanced industry. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill relates to Albury-Wodonga. I think a lesson has been taught there, and possibly even more so in the Orange-Bathurst region, which might indicate that a broader view is necessary than was taken when those areas were proposed as growth areas. I am speaking here with the benefit of hindsight. It is easy to be wise after the event. Nevertheless, I think it is important to learn the history and the lessons these things may give. The problem of Albury-Wodonga, and perhaps even more for the Orange-Bathurst area, has been that once they were categorised as growth areas the price of land there skyrocketed and we got in fact an opposite kind of effect, where those areas did not go ahead and develop at all because other places near them were more competitive. So, instead of Albury-Wodonga and Bathurst-Orange going ahead as far as was hoped, Wagga and Dubbo, the neighbouring city in each case, were the cities to grow most as a result of this ironic situation. What is needed is an overall understanding for the need of growth outside the cities generally, a uniform growth of the areas outside the major cities-not specialised in certain districts-although I feel that the Albury-Wodonga experiment, well-intentioned though it was, did have grave flaws in that kind of direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of decentralisation and urban and regional development in general has suffered badly since the advent of the Fraser Government in 1975. Expenditure on decentralisation and growth centres under the Australian Labor Party in 1974-75 was $64.7m. This fell by 1977-78 to $25.6m under the Fraser Government. It has barely been adjusted to inflation over the last four years when the estimated figure for 1981-82 is $32.4m. In 1981-82 funding for urban and regional development and environment related issues has declined by 28.3 per cent on 1980-81 figures. Senator Gietzelt said that the Whitlam Government established a separate Department of Urban and Regional Development but this was abolished by the Fraser Government. The Australian Democrats also regret that. It is another way in which a major underlying problem of the country, like so many others, has been allowed to slide, apparently in the pious hope that in some way or other the future would remedy itself. That will not of course happen . Problems of that sort which are allowed to go on deteriorating, like several others in this country, have a tendency to accelerate. Their effects become greater as time goes on. Also, there is the problem that what might be relatively easy to remedy now will be very much harder to remedy in the distant future. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is imperative that the Federal Government be responsible for taking the lead in the area of decentralisation for a number of reasons. It is the practice of State governments and local government bodies to deter an overall approach to the problem because it is bigger than they can cope with individually. I think that is a reasonable and respectable point of view, that local government and State governments have to deal with many more detailed problems. The big problem is basically too much for them and is also one, I think, which demands some kind of national co-ordination. Of course, the Federal Government provides for or controls most of the funds which are available to the other levels of government and, to a great extent, what is done in those kinds of areas can be encouraged from Canberra. The Federal Government decides on and is properly responsible for national economic policy and protection issues. Certainly I would have thought the defence implication which I mentioned earlier should be a matter of considerable concern to the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats, as a matter of policy, are committed to the active promotion of decentralisation. We are very interested in the devolution of power . We believe that the smaller the group of people, the smaller the community, the better it can control its own affairs. This makes a much more human, more civilised and better method of government than having big government in one place which attempts to do things for an entire set of communities with very diverse views, very diverse interests-and properly so. They have every right to diversity. It is one of the things that makes the country interesting and, incidentally, which make it strong. To try to make our society completely homogenous would be a mistake. </PARA>
<PARA> We should encourage new population centres away from the major cities. These figures are quite alarming. Eighty per cent of Australians-eight out of ten-live in urban centres of 5,000 people or more. Sixty per cent live in capital cities. Of that number, 40 per cent live in Sydney and Melbourne. That, I think, is a social malaise. I was in the western suburbs of Sydney looking at the problems in big dormitory suburbs such as Blacktown and thereabouts the other day. I am convinced that the problems there-I spent several days there talking with people -are not the result of the people there. The people are not to blame for some of the appalling things that happen in those very inhuman environments. It is a fact that those environments exist when they ought not to exist, where people should not have to live in that kind of way. </PARA>
<PARA> I think any Western country has to look reasonably at what is happening in the People's Republic of China, where there is a very conscious effort to decentralise. Indeed, the people's communes, I think, represent a very effective decentralisation of the largest population in the world, now over 1,000 million people. During my last visit to China I met with the Responsible Member of the Revolutionary Committee governing Shanghai. One might say that at that time it was its council. The Responsible Member was the equivalent of its mayor. He said that there had been encouragement of huge movements of people and industry out of Shanghai in order that it should avoid the disgrace of becoming the largest city in the world. Those were his precise words. </PARA>
<PARA> We should realise that in the event of major catastrophe, nuclear war or whatever, even of an acute economic downturn in the world, our people, or the people of any country as highly urbanised as we are, are far more vulnerable to anything that might happen, either military or economic, than a society that has taken trouble to decentralise its people in the way I have described in China. I think we should give those people credit for that, whatever else we might think of their society. </PARA>
<PARA> The only way to encourage a greater population in rural areas-and here I am quoting the Australian Democrats' policy-is to make sure that the conditions of life are balanced so that people are encouraged to live in country rather than city areas. Telephone calls should be on a time rather than a distance basis and the new satellite technology makes this very simple. There is no reason in the world why people in country areas should have to pay more for their telephone calls than people in the city. I think we should try to remove extra freight costs because of distance and make some compensation to people so that it is not an automatic fact that if one goes and lives far from the central cities everything will cost one more. It should be a legitimate purpose of government to see that things cost people less in country areas so that they will be encouraged to live in those places. The other discrepancies of rural areas have to be compensated for over a time. While the failure to decentralise continues those discrepancies become worse. I am speaking now of poor health and education facilities. These things can be enhanced and improved rationally and reasonably only when cities and areas outside the major metropolises of Australia can grow and can have the prospect of a continued period of growth, which is even more important. There must be that kind of compensation. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that there are a number of activities that the Federal Government should consider soon. They are basically philosophical; they basically require action or review from the Federal Government to change its present performance. The Federal Government must take the lead and it must maintain, if possible, a continuity of policy. The Democrats have asked for indicative planning a number of times, and I have given a notice of motion proposing that there should be a basic understanding and basic areas of agreement between all political parties on matters of this kind so that there is no discontinuity of policy when there is a change of government. This is very important. Periods of 10 years, 20 years or perhaps even longer are necessary for communities to develop in the way I have described, even for businesses to consider moving in and to think that they have a viable future. Businesses which go into these areas might reasonably look at a number of years during which they will not make money, but they may well look forward to a growing society and say: 'In seven, eight or 10 years this will be a goer and it is worth our while putting money in'. It is not worth while if they feel that, when the Australian Labor Party replaces the Liberal Party or Liberal replaces Labor, all will be thrown away and will change. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Democrats I plead again for more consideration of this ideal of a basic conference on the economy at which all political parties, unions and employers-as many groups as are interested-come together. I am aware of the immensity of that task. Honourable senators may recall that the Democrats have allowed a period of two years simply for planning such a conference so that its terms of reference will be right, it will know exactly what it is doing and everybody concerned will know what is going on. The Australian Democrats believe that the most eligible areas for development lie with small businesses and the private sector. Of course, it is the small businesses which will go to the smaller towns and develop themselves. A good object lesson for us can be found during the 1970s in the United States, where 80 per cent of new jobs were in the area of small business. We can do that in Australia too, but it will not happen by itself. It will not happen unless the Government of this country takes an honest and reasonable look at the problem of decentralisation, instead of paying lip service to it, and lays down a series of active, pragmatic proposals which will make it easier, better and cheaper for people to live in the country. This will encourage people to go to the country, with small business and, perhaps later on, industry to follow them. Decentralisation is not just about different locations or a different scale. It relates to the overall socio-economic structure-the power sharing and resource allocation within our society. It is as deep and as fundamental as that. The Democrats support the dispersal of power and resources so that they are closer to the people. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude with an example of the classic problem of this kind in Australia. I refer to the north Queensland city of Townsville, which is now a city of over 100,000 people. It should properly have an international airport. The Burdekin scheme should go ahead. The whole of the region around it should be developed into an important new area. Indeed, it should be the capital of a new State. The Democrats have proposed that the new State of Capricornia should be located in north Queensland and that Townsville should be its capital. We believe that until that happens the area will not develop to the extent that it should. Is not that more important than the petty political jealousies that are preventing it now? I think that an initiative by the Federal Government to study the whole question of which new areas need a regional approach is perhaps another part of the problem. There is evidence that the Murray Valley could be a completely new State. I find that I am greeted very pleasantly by mayors in the Murray towns when I go there and suggest it. It is madness that a river such as the Murray should be the boundary between two States. It is an anachronism that is causing immense problems for the river and for the environment around it. It is something that should be corrected. I hope that will shed a little light on this matter. The Federal Government apparently does not have any ideas on the subject . If it had, one would expect it to be doing something or to have some lines of approach which it might take in this important matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a Bill to vary the conditions of certain financial assistance provided pursuant to the Albury-Wodonga Development (Financial Assistance) Act 1973. I mention that because, as is often the case with legislation which has the general support of the chamber, the debate has been used as a vehicle for honourable senators to raise matters in related areas which they feel are of concern. I note the views which have been expressed by Senator Gietzelt on behalf of the Opposition and by Senator Mason on behalf of the Australian Democrats. In light of the heavy program we have for the remainder of the sitting, a general perambulation by me through the wide fields that they have canvassed would not be in order, but I thank them for their support of the Bill.

<PARA> It was said during the second reading debate that lessons had been given in the Albury-Wodonga situation. I thought that was an interesting twist on 'lessons having been learnt'. Perhaps Senator Mason was being very subtle by suggesting a lesson was available but had not been learnt. Perhaps one of the lessons is that the need for this agreement and the relieving of the States of these very heavy capital and interest obligations teach us something about the way in which decentralisation needs to be approached if we are to avoid public burdens which are quite insupportable. The need to forgive those debts is a concession to the fact that, in the way this agreement was organised, it gave rise to public commitments, that is, commitments on the part of taxpayers which were thought to be repayable but which, in the event, have proved not to be so. In fact, the taxpayer has borne this burden. We should not lose sight of that. I wish to make no further comment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that the speakers list for this debate contains at the moment the names of a further six senators, all of whom come from the larger States where the major problems with roads and hence with road funding are. I will be interested to hear what my fellow South Australians have to say about the Roads Grants Amendment Bill 1982 and what honourable senators from Western Australia and Queensland have to say about the problems that they are facing in their States. I imagine that, to a certain extent at least, there will be certain similarities in the problems that we are facing and the comments that we have to make. This Bill enables grants of $734m to be allocated in 1982-83, $778m in 1983-84 and a further $825m in 1984-85, all of which money is to be available for road funding in Australia. These amounts represent increases of 7 per cent, 6 per cent and 6 per cent respectively for the three financial years that are mentioned. Whilst this may seem commendable at first glance, a closer look at the figures will show that in fact over the past few years road grants by the Commonwealth Government have not kept pace with road maintenance and construction costs, a fact which is placing an increasing burden on those other levels of government, and in particular local councils, which have to make up the shortfall. I think this was realised, at least partially, by the Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt) in the other place on 27 October 1981 when in part of an answer to a question of that day he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of representations and complaints have been received from local government that the estimated increases for which we have allowed in the program will not cover the actual cost of road construction. Last year I asked the Bureau of Transport Economics to undertake a survey of the road construction index. I expect to receive a report from the BTE at the end of the year. When it has received that report the Government will be in a better position to make a real assessment of the road funding program that was announced last year. </PARA>
<PARA>I would also like to remind the Senate that on page 17 of the fifth annual report of the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations a number of recommendations are proposed including an expanded role for the BTE and that local government be given an opportunity to obtain equity in the Australian Road Research Board. I would suggest that the sooner the Government directs its attention to these recommendations the better. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau of Transport Economics report '1981 Road Construction Input-Price Indexes' shows that there has already been a 15.3 per cent increase in construction costs due to substantial increases in the cost of materials such as bitumen, aggregate, pipes, steel and so on. One does not, therefore, have to be a financial or mathematical genius to work out that a grant increase of 6 per cent or 7 per cent will not go anywhere near maintaining funding needs of this area. When we add to these price increases, the cost of meeting wage rises as well as demonstrable increases in road use in both rural and urban areas, something which particularly affects the larger States such as South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia, it can be seen that some more drastic action than that proposed by this Bill must be taken. It has been estimated, for example, that in Victoria, one of the smaller States, road travel has increased by 66 per cent in the last 10 years while funding has fallen in real terms by 22 per cent. Furthermore, it is expected that travel on metropolitan roads in that State will have increased by another 40 per cent by the year 2000, and that, I remind the Senate, is less than two decades away. </PARA>
<PARA> I am somewhat appalled at a number of statements made by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) in his second reading speech earlier this year. He made the comment that the allocations would be firm and final amounts. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government was not willing to encourage inflationary pressures by building into its expenditure programs open-ended commitments to meet unlimited future cost increases. </PARA>
<PARA>He also made this point:</PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be recognised that the Government's deliberations on road funding have to be undertaken in the light of the need for continued overall restraint on the Budget and, within that, the competing funding demands of other Commonwealth programs. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that if the Government is to place restraints on road funds required for increased road maintenance it is only sensible that it place some restraint on road use. The Minister also made the point:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Commonwealth is not committed to maintaining the existing funding relativities indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA>However, he made no attempt to say where the shortfall is likely to be picked up . </PARA>
<PARA> It is patently apparent that this particular form of penny-pinching by the present Government to road funding is going to produce some rather disastrous results in both the long and short term. Increased travel time and delays, especially in urban areas, leading to increased fuel consumption and increased vehicle operating costs are just one. We can go on to refer to things such as increased traffic on urban residential streets because people are going to divert themselves from the use of major arterial roads, for instance, which are going to become increasingly congested. That is already becoming patently apparent in Adelaide, where I take a rather circuitous route to get my two children to school in the mornings when I am home. I do this rather than take a shorter and more direct route because the longer route, at the moment at least, is less congested and less cluttered up with traffic lights and therefore the trip is smoother. But I can see that this sort of situation is not going to continue. A few more people are going to work out that it is easier to get to some part of the Greenhill Road by going up West Beach Road than down Anzac Highway. The two roads will become equally congested. In addition, of course, increased freight costs will result from the increased traffic costs which I mentioned earlier and hence higher prices will have to be paid for goods, particularly in country areas. Again, I must stress that this is a particularly invidious sort of end result for States such as South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Serious and universally resented problems are already occurring in rural areas because of the Government's dismal record on road funding and the problems are proving enormously expensive to local councils in country areas. The States that I have already mentioned-I now include the Northern Territory-have large numbers of isolated areas and consequently there is a very great need for long stretches of road connecting small as well as larger towns. I can assure honourable senators from my visits to areas particularly in the mid-north of South Australia that the people are becoming heartily tired of being treated as second class citizens. Most of those smaller towns, and hence most of those local government areas, are situated in what can be or have been in the past known as blue ribbon Liberal seats. The people of those areas are beginning to wonder whether their adherence to right of centre politics is not doing them any good at all; that they are in fact being seen merely as electoral fodder for a Liberal-National Country Party government and allowed to go their own way in between elections. It seems unfortunate that those people, who already suffer from isolation and to a certain extent lesser facilities than people in urban areas get, should also suffer from worse and increasingly bad road conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that South Australia is particularly hard done by. The Local Government Association of South Australia Incorporated has issued a page of information entitled 'Local Government and Trends in Road Finance'. At the bottom of the page it points out:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . South Australian Local Government is now spending an increasingly higher proportion of its total revenue on roads. For example, in 1979-80 16.8 per cent of Local Government revenue was expended on roads. In 1981-82 (the latest figures available) this proportion has risen to 21.2 per cent-a significant increase. </PARA>
<PARA>That was an increase of about one-quarter or 25 per cent in two years. That, I suspect, is not going to do the Government any good come the next election. As I said earlier, I spent some time this year travelling to see local government authorities in areas such as the mid-north, the Barossa Valley, the River Murray regions, the west coast and the south-east of South Australia. Everywhere I go the comments are the same. There is major frustration, anger and resentment at the invidious position that country local government authorities are finding themselves in because of cuts to road funding. Furthermore, they point out with monotonous regularity that this problem is exacerbated by the Government's double standards with regard to Australian National. </PARA>
<PARA> Country people have, of course, two main forms of transport available to them- or at least they do in South Australia, where air services are limited to the major regional centres. Country people in South Australia and, I suggest, also in the other larger States are almost entirely restricted to getting themselves and their goods from point A to point B by using road or rail. These two forms of transport run through the same areas and offer the same services to the same people. A major complaint from the people who have to use these services is that they operate under two completely different sets of financial and management rules. Australian National is expected to operate as a business and, hence, expects the users of the service to pay accordingly for the provision and upkeep of that service. Australia's road system is not geared to having the user pay according to the use made of the facilities nor are the users expected to contribute directly to the maintenance of the service. In some areas this is beginning to show a considerable amount of damage to roads. </PARA>
<PARA> South Australia and the industries in South Australia are commendably working towards decentralisation. Some fairly heavy industries are being established in some country towns in South Australia. For example, a cement works is being set up in Angaston. Honourable senators can imagine the weight and the number of trucks that use the road system around Angaston. They are tearing the roads to shreds. The onus is not on the user to contribute to any large degree towards the maintenance of the roads that are being torn up in that way but on local government authorities and, hence, ultimately on the local residents who contribute by paying rates which seem to be going up with monotonous regularity.</PARA>
<PARA> We have two systems of transport available to country people which affect each other's costing and which operate under completely separate sorts of rules and regulations. As freight and other costs of using Australian National rise, so more use is made of the road system in the same area. As a result, Australian National further increases its prices and generally further limits its services. Hence, more people are forced to use the road system with the inevitable and, I would have thought, rather obvious result that additional maintenance is required to mend the additional damage done to road surfaces. This point is made particularly well in a telex that I received recently. It contained extracts from a report of the half-yearly meeting of the Mid North Regional Organisation in South Australia which was held on 26 March 1982. It was titled 'Impact of Grain Traffic on Roads'. In part, it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The increasing trend in the use of road transport to cart grain out of the silos in lieu of rail transport is of concern because of the implications to local government. Increased road haulage is having a significant impact on local roads in some areas through deteriorating surfaces and need for consequent repair and maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA> Is this trend purely a matter of economics? It seems obvious that cost differentials and levies between road carriers and Australia National are a factor. Road carriers, in tendering for the transport of bulk grain, do not need to allow for a road factor as they use a public investment, the road system, which is repaired and maintained by the public at large, namely local government which picks up the cost for this. Councils, via 'in-house' maintenance, effectively subsidize the road carrier. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, Australia National is totally responsible for the upkeep of its own right-of-way and infrastructure, and must therefore include such costs in its tendering. It is somewhat disturbing that the rail system, although sitting side-by-side with the road system, is not being fully utilized. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate here to say that to make matters worse the revenue gathered from the petrol excise is only in a very limited way returned directly to local government or to State governments for use for road maintenance and development. Yet this is one of the few taxes-it may not be the only tax-which applies to a specific group of people using a specific commodity. This is a long telex and I will not take up the time of the Senate in going through all of it. It concludes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . one obvious statement can be drawn-it is a further example of the policies of other bodies (government, semi-government and private) putting more strain on the existing road system, through greater and heavier traffic, although funds to roads are being withdrawn in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA>Figures supplied by the Australian Council of Local Government Associations from Canberra relating to Commonwealth roads grants indicate that the percentage of total Commonwealth outlay on road grants has dropped from 2.1 per cent in 1974- 75 to 1.6 per cent in 1981-82-a drop in percentage which is even greater when compared with 1972-73 and 1973-74 figures which were 2.9 per cent and 2.7 per cent respectively. Inevitably, as Commonwealth allocation decreases in real terms the amount which local government must contribute to road maintenance and development must increase with a commensurate diminution of the amount of money it can spend on other local government services and needs. In South Australia, for example, as I have already pointed out, local government spending has increased by 25 per cent from 16.8 per cent to 21.2 per cent between 1979 and 1981. Again, the resentment that this is causing is best expressed in the motion that was passed at a regional government meeting in Snowtown in South Australia last August. The motion which was carried unanimously at the regions annual meeting stated:</PARA>
<PARA> That, as it is unreasonable to expect local government with its limited revenue raising capacity to take up vital shortfalls in road funding, the unsatisfactory consequences of the Federal Government's policies must be pursued to secure a more equitable and realistic treatment for local government. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In moving this, one of our delegates stated that this issue had gone beyond the point where the authorities cannot take it seriously. They must face up to and answer the facts-the figures as presented tell the story. The region has a road problem, as has local government generally, and this needs to be rectified. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition has made some attempt to face the problem in its amendment which, in part, states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Senate is of the opinion that a substantial supplementary allocation of road grants should be made available to the States, the Northern Territory and local government without delay to-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) reduce the backlog of established roads needs;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) accelerate the rate of road construction and maintenance works;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) improve the efficiency of road transport services;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) reduce the incidence of road deaths and injuries; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) assist local government bodies to meet road funding difficulties'. </PARA>
<PARA>All it does is make some attempt to face the problem. It sets out the problem areas but it does not go on to give any indication of how the Opposition would see that supplementary allocation being provided. I would have thought that any party putting itself forward as an alternative government could have come up with a better way of achieving the aims that we certainly support than simply by suggesting vaguely that there ought to be a substantial supplementary allocation . To that end the Australian Democrats propose to move an amendment which I believe rectifies this omission. After considerable consultation with local government authorities in South Australia we propose to add at the end of the Opposition's amendment the words:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that that allocation should reflect the increase in road construction costs revealed by the Bureau of Transport Economics' road construction price index, and that allocations in future years should be determined in accordance with that index. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that only when such adequate funding action is taken will Australia's national highways and roadways-whether local, arterial or whatever-become, as one manufacturing organisation described them, assets rather than liabilities. I am enormously proud of what South Australian rural local government authorities have done with very inadequate funds. What I have seen of road development in South Australia indicates that they have gone to incredible lengths to make sure that local residents are not as seriously hampered by the problem as they could well have been. But this has been achieved at the expense of other services and community needs. It has been at the expense also of having to increase local government rates. These authorities will not, however, be able to continue that sort of situation for ever. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that whether we like it or not Australia is highly dependent on road transport for the movement of people, for the movement of primary and manufactured products and for defence. We must ensure the safety of drivers and passengers in cars and truck drivers who use the roads as their means of livelihood. They are all dependent on the quality of roads that are provided in this country. Responsibility for this, it seems to me, lies primarily with the Federal government. I believe that it is only good sense to develop sensible policies with regard to roads since they provide, unarguably, an essential service for Australia and must hence receive the adequate, substantial increases in funding that they deserve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Roads Grants Amendment Bill which is designed to amend the Roads Grants Act 1981. In supporting this Bill I acknowledge that if the Federal Government is to rein in inflation it has to act with prudence in the allocation of its resources. There is very little real prospect of inflation, interest rates or unemployment declining if governments spend more than they raise. However, it is incumbent, in my view, upon governments to distribute properly their resources not only towards social needs and demands but also towards those areas that are likely, due to sensible investment, to produce wealth and growth for all people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I address myself at the moment to the concept of investment as it applies to transport and in particular to roads. I refer at the moment to two aspects-to the investment initiative and the reactive investment. In referring to the investment initiative that must be considered in allocating funds for roads, I remind honourable senators of the enormous wealth that has been created and generated by the opening up of Western Australia through the construction of the road system. Today Western Australia enjoys 164,000 kilometres of public roads or 19.6 per cent of the total Australian road network. There was an urgent need in the early 1960s to develop the north-west of Western Australia particularly in respect of the beef export industry. During the Western Australian beef roads program of 1962 to 1974, $40m was invested in beef roads. That was partly responsible for an ultimate export sale of beef in excess of $200m over the same period. It was that sort of investment that created economic and social development. The roads are still there, still functioning, still adequate and still ensuring that there is an ever-increasing return on that initial investment. It was in that instance that the missing link was accurately identified. Because that program was of national significance the Federal Government made a contribution. That contribution, of course, was more than matched by the State Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The State Government's great land settlement programs in the 1960s, for instance, could not have been achieved without the new techniques for building cheap, serviceable access roads in the new farming areas. The consequent development, employment and export earnings were largely attributable to the road and bridge construction work generally that was carried out during that period. The lifting of the export embargo on the iron ore industry in the 1960s heralded a dramatic period in the development of Western Australia. The mineral wealth of the Pilbara region was to be tapped, new towns were to be born and old towns, such as Port Hedland and Roebourne, sprang to new life and a new era of road construction was to commence in preparation for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> A great deal more development can and will take place in Western Australia. But the potential for resource development, whatever its nature-whether it be farming or mining-cannot be fully realised while so much remains to be done in road construction generally. In my view it is only after we have the initial investment that there should be follow-up or reactive investment, as I described it. I believe the Federal Government must resist pressure to adopt reactive investment to the detriment of road funding and the future economic and social development of Australia. We all know that hospitals, schools and social welfare are vital, visible and popular but it must never be forgotten that the provision of those services which are demanded by the community can be provided only for as long as there is strong, virile and active economic development in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The road construction industry ranks highly in comparison with most industries in its ability to create jobs. It is indeed one of the best mediums for creating employment in the economy. In my view providing a job is an excellent welfare service. Despite Australia's great need for economic development and the job creating opportunities it brings, I see the temptation for governments from time to time to place a disproportionate priority on soft expenditure-on welfare- rather than on hard decisions and hard expenditure on roads. The benefits of increasing road funds as they apply to economic development are self-evident. Roads stimulate development. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, of course, we have the enormous influence that social factors can have upon economic development. For example, in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, in part due in my view to the very unfavourable environment and the harsh conditions, there is a very poor record of industrial relations. One has to wonder how much of that industrial relations record is due to the living standards and the working conditions. Isolation between towns, isolation between towns and the recreational coastline and isolation between towns and the capital cities certainly cause problems. I believe many of those problems could be alleviated if there were very effective and proper road communications. </PARA>
<PARA> If Western Australia is to succeed in attracting foreign capital and the development of remote resource wealth then it needs significant Commonwealth grants to finance its road infrastructure in these areas. Because in recent years emphasis has already been given, particulary by the Western Australian Government, to improving roads in the northern part of the State and in the northern goldfields areas because of urgent development requirements, urgent improvements to many important arterial roads in the south-west of Western Australia have been deferred. Significant increases in funds are required to upgrade such roads and to prevent deterioration in service as well as safety. A recent joint Commonwealth-State study of national roads in Australia-the second report of the Members of the Committee of Senior Representatives of Commonwealth and State Road Authorities-has shown that at present funding levels it will take 27 years to achieve interim standards and 37 years to achieve ultimate standards throughout Australia. In Western Australia the position is considerably worse. Because of the great length of national roads in Western Australia-Western Australia has 29 per cent of national roads-it will take 44 years to achieve interim standards compared with the Australian average, as I said, of 27 years. This means that Western Australia will not have a dust-free, almost flood-free, national road system built to interim standards until the year 2026. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular projects which require urgent consideration in my State are: The widening of the Great Northern Highway from Wubin to Meekatharra at a cost of $ 15m; the construction and sealing of the road between Fitzroy Crossing and Halls Creek at a cost of $57m; the construction and sealing of the road between Newman and Port Hedland at a cost of $115m; the widening of the Eyre Highway at a cost of $46m and work on the Great Eastern Highway-construction between Perth and Northam at a cost of $34m and reconstruction east of Northam at a cost of $10m. Work has already started, as I understand it, on the Fitzroy Crossing-Halls Creek project and is expected to commence on the Newman-Hedland road in the 1982 -83 period. However, urgent improvements have to be deferred on the Great Eastern Highway and there is little likelihood that the work will start on widening the Eyre Highway for many years even though the present width is totally inadequate, safety is diminishing and maintenance costs are rising rapidly. The six projects mentioned above will probably not be completed for about 20 years at present funding levels. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the second reading speech of the Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt) suggests that the most pressing problems are in Queensland and New South Wales. With respect, this is contrary to the findings of the Commonwealth-State study to which I have just referred and which found that New South Wales could complete the national highway system to interim standards in 24 years, Queensland in 33 years and Western Australia in 44 years. The study further found that a 25 per cent increase in national road funding is required to complete the national highway system to interim standards by the year 2000. In my view, this seems an unreasonably long period by any criteria. I would not want it thought for a moment that Western Australian people are not prepared to carry their part of the burden and their part of the tax responsibility for road construction and maintenance. To accommodate steadily decreasing Commonwealth funding in real terms, State charges have increased at a rapid rate. From 1975-76 to 1981-82 Western Australian funds have increased by 118 per cent while Commonwealth funds have increased by 43 per cent in current figures. Perhaps more important and more relative are the constant or real figures. In the five year period from June 1976 to June 1981 Western Australia increased its efforts by 26.4 per cent whereas the Commonwealth efforts actually decreased by minus 8.8 per cent. I remind honourable senators that in the period 1981-82 Western Australians are paying $62.46 per head in State charges for roads. That represents an increase of approxi- mately 11 per cent over the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, I suspect that the 1980-81 to 1984-85 Federal allocations which were determined in 1980 were based on calculations of a steadily declining level of inflation. An increase of 11.1 per cent was provided for 1980-81, an increase of 9.1 per cent was provided for 1981-82, an increase of 7.1 per cent was provided for 1982-83 and an increase of 6 per cent was provided thereafter. On current inflation levels, these figures appear to me to be decidedly inadequate and I refer honourable senators to the recent report of the Bureau of Transport Economics covering increases in the road index for Australia. Of course, the road index is a measure of the increasing cost of construction of roads. In 1979 -80 the index was 15.9 per cent and in 1980-81 it was 15.3 per cent. With respect, I will refer back to the increase in Commonwealth funds. In 1978-79 the Commonwealth increased its expenditure by 7.5 per cent while the increase in the road index was 15.9 per cent. In 1979-80 the Commonwealth increase was 11.2 per cent while the increase in the road index was 15.3 per cent. In 1981-82 the Commonwealth increase was 9.1 per cent while the increase in the road index was 16 per cent. In 1982-83 the Commonwealth increase is 7.1 per cent while the increase in the road index is 16 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> To conclude my comments on Federal funding, I remind the Senate that the Commonwealth at present collects $3,107m from its petroleum parity pricing policy and expects to collect $3,357m in 1981-82. Of course, it naturally receives very considerable additional revenue through taxes on petroleum production. This revenue collected by the Federal Government has increased from $250m in 1976 to over $3,000m in 1981-an increase of 1,200 per cent. It ought to be remembered that while the Commonwealth action in the area of oil parity pricing has achieved the conservation objectives, desirable as they are, it has had a detrimental effect on State revenues. High oil prices have reduced fuel consumption and encouraged smaller cars and had a depressing effect on both the State fuel levy and vehicle licence fee collections. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my plea for greater Commonwealth expenditure on road grants, and more particularly my plea for greater expenditure in Western Australia where it is well deserved, by making the following simple observations. Western Australia has 29 per cent of the national highway system. It has 19.6 per cent of the Australian road network. It occupies 33 per cent of the Australian land mass and , due to the fact that it has only 8.6 per cent of the Australian population, it has a very limited base from which to extract revenue for the purpose of road funding. Of course, Western Australia does provide 20 per cent of Australia's export earnings and yet it receives only 12.67 per cent of Federal road grants. Western Australia's export earnings and hence associated balance of payments contributions, as well as exchange rate stability and growth, are matters of public record. I conclude by saying that I hope that the proposals for the next period are reviewed by the Federal Government to make them more realistic and more in line with the levels of cost and levels of indexation as described already in my previous comments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Road Grants Amendment Bill 1982. I was very interested to hear the first Government speaker on this Bill, Senator Crichton-Browne, who commenced his opening remarks by saying that he fully supported the Bill and then went on to tell us about all the problems being experienced in Western Australia because of lack of finance to build and maintain roads. We have a person who, whilst he is prepared to support the Government, is also prepared to criticise it and make a lot of remarks about the needs of Western Australia. I want to dwell upon that because what Senator Crichton-Browne has said here today highlights the article which appeared on the front page of the Australian of 18 March. We have to go back that far because it is just five weeks today since this Bill was introduced into the Senate. It has been waiting around for five weeks to be debated. The front page of the Australian of 18 March carried the headline 'Backbench fights cutbacks to State road funds program'. I will quote from that article. It is by Russell Schneider who used to work for Senator Withers when, I think, Senator Withers was Leader of the Opposition in this place from 1972 to 1975. The article commences:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Federal Government yesterday dismissed bitter backbench complaints against plans for a reduction in road funds to the States. </PARA>
<PARA>Our spokesman in the other place made mention of this in the debate on the Bill and nobody from the Government side stood up in the debate and denied that the story by Mr Russell Schneider was anything but fact. I will not quote all of the article because I will not have enough time, but the article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> But Government backbenchers pointed out that the proposed funding was less than the inflation rate and far less than the 15 per cent actual increase in road building costs over the previous year. </PARA>

<PARA> The decision to cut back road funding in real terms is expected to lead to major clashes between the Federal Government and the States and local government . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, what is said there is absolutely true, as I am well aware because of what has happened in South Australia. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The NCP rose en masse to attack its own minister's proposals-a move deliberately aimed at forcing Federal Cabinet to reconsider money for highways and local roads. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Premier's wife,-</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased that she is in the chamber now-</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Flo Bjelke-Petersen, said the principal complaint from Queensland local government was on the lack of Federal finance for roads. </PARA>
<PARA>I will be interested to see how Senator Flo Bjelke-Petersen casts her vote on the amendments before us today. The article further states:</PARA>
<PARA> The NCP MPs were joined by Liberals Mr Gordon Dean (Qld) and Mr Murray Sainsbury (NSW) who said the Commonwealth had to provide increased funds for road building in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course I looked at the voting details on the House of Representatives Hansard of 20 April and I saw that both of those people who are quoted as being highly critical in the party room voted for the Bill, as will Senator Crichton-Browne today. The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> NCP sources said after the meeting they were totally dissatisfied with the proposed roads allocation. </PARA>
<PARA>This article goes on to quote what some of the State Ministers have said. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Queensland's Minister for Main Roads, Mr Hinze, said the cutbacks were ' disastrous' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The South Australian Minister for Transport, Mr Wilson, said the Federal Government was reducing spending on the nation's highways without regard to the needs of the States. </PARA>
<PARA>I can verify that quote attributed to Mr Wilson because I will refer to a meeting of the Mid-North Regional Organisation which I attended last year and at which Mr Wilson was the guest speaker. When certain motions were moved he blamed the Federal Government for the problems which were being experienced by South Australia. The article goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Consumer Affairs and Roads, Mr Wheelan, claimed the situation in NSW was quickly nearing crisis point. </PARA>
<PARA>These are the criticisms that have been levelled at this Government because of the penny-pinching it has engaged in in providing funds to all the States for their road programs. We can see, when we look at this Bill, that for the seventh successive year real Commonwealth grants to the States will be cut in 1982-83, 1983-84 and again in 1984-85 unless this Government is removed from office, a fate it justly deserves. The only effect that blowup in the party room had on the Minister for Transport and Construction, Mr Hunt, was that he cut down his second reading speech to one-third of last year's effort when introducing the Bill in the other place and when Senator Messner introduced it in this place on his behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> Later today National Country Party and Liberal Party senators will have an opportunity to bring their principles out of the Government party room, to voice them in this chamber and to back them with their vote for the Opposition amendment. I learned just a few moments ago that there is a further amendment to the Opposition amendment moved by Senator Gietzelt when this Bill was last debated. I am particularly interested, as I said earlier, to note that Senator Bjelke-Petersen's husband's Minister for Main Roads, Mr Hinze, has described the cutbacks as disastrous. I will be interested to see how she casts her vote. </PARA>
<PARA> Last November the Minister, Mr Hunt, admitted that Commonwealth road grants were not keeping pace with increases in road construction costs. He is well aware of that; he admitted it. He said that the Government would address the problems of declining road grants on the release of the report of the Bureau of Transport Economics on a road construction price index in early 1982. Of course we already have that report. It is very critical and highlights the problems faced by the States. That report was tabled by the Minister quite a few weeks ago now. It is five weeks since this Bill came into this place and, I think, five weeks and a few days since it was debated in the other place, so it is well over two months since that report was tabled by the Minister. His response to the problem was again to defer its consideration until after the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of honourable senators to the South Australian Royal Automobile Association journal, the Motor, which ran an editorial in this month' s issue. I suppose the majority of people who drive vehicles in South Australia are members of that organisation which speaks on their behalf. The editorial in the May issue of the paper, headed 'Govt. Sees Problem', states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Minister for Transport, Mr Hunt has at long last publicly acknowledged that inflation is having 'adverse consequences' on road building and maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's 'adverse consequences' sounds like a polite way of describing a disastrous situation . . . because that is what it is. </PARA>
<PARA>We all recognise that. Even Senator Crichton-Browne recognises it, although he will support the Bill. The editorial further states:</PARA>
<PARA> Numerous representations by State and Local Government Authorities prompted the Minister to 'hurry along' a study by the Bureau of Transport Economics into road building costs. </PARA>
<PARA> To nobody's surprise, the report, released in March, revealed that there had been a significant acceleration in road building costs since 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> This increase was between 15-16 per cent per year. </PARA>
<PARA> And what action has Canberra taken to halt the deterioration of the road system ?</PARA>
<PARA> Road grants have been increased by 7.2 per cent for 1982/83, less than half of the annual increase in road building costs, and astoundingly this pitiful handout will be dropped to levels representing only 6 per cent increases for 1983/84 and 1984/85. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Is the Minister for Transport championing the cause of Australian road users in the face of this damning indictment?</PARA>
<PARA> Well, he has issued a press statement informing us in well-worn political phrases that he is 'concerned' about the continuation of inflation and that the Commonwealth Government 'is determined to do all it can to reduce inflation in the road sector and the economy as a whole'. </PARA>
<PARA>It all sounds drearily familiar. The editorial goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister admits that adequate roads are essential to meet the increasing demands imposed by industrial expansion and economic growth in the coming years.</PARA>
<PARA> But what about here and now? Road programmes by State and local authorities are being slashed and necessary road projects are being put into pigeonholes for a decade ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the problem we face and which has been recognised by the Royal Automobile Association in South Australia to such an extent that it saw fit to run an editorial in its paper on that score. I hope that when funds are being allocated for road funding perhaps in the next Budget and when we are discussing a Bill of this nature after the Budget, the Minister will take some cognisance of what reputable authorities such as the RAA and local government authorities have had to say. I will mention these later. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's reference in his second reading speech to State relations constitutes a superficial attempt to encourage dissension among the States in a battle for declining road funds; that is, to put it simply, to set one State against the other in a very bitter dogfight. That is what is happening. One State will be competing against the other at Loan Council meetings and Premiers Conferences-wherever they meet-because they have local government bodies on their backs about funding for local roads. As was mentioned here by a previous speaker, because of curtailment and the closure of country rail services-that is another argument-greater use is being made of country roads. It will not be long -I have said this in this place before when talking about railway cutbacks- before the States and the local government authorities have to come to the Federal Government and seek more and more money to build better roads in country areas where the rail services have been curtailed. In my view that cuts out not only employment but also services to farmers. It will also create a greater debt for the taxpayer for the construction of these roads so that these massive transports can use them to cart farm produce. </PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of this Bill is to provide financial assistance to the States and the Northern Territory for road construction and maintenance purposes. The Opposition does not oppose that. The schedules attached to the Bill detail allocations of $734m in 1982-83, $778m in 1983-84 and $825m in 1984-85. These amounts respectively represent increases of 7 per cent, 6 per cent and 6 per cent over the previous years allocation. The new road construction price index report tabled by the Minister recently objectively reveals the sharp and irresponsible cutback in real Federal road grants. This has been mentioned here today by the Government senator, Senator Crichton-Browne. The report highlights the increases in fuel and bitumen prices as the two fastest rising components of the index. Both increases are the direct result of this Government's oil pricing and economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA> As my colleague Senator Walsh has repeatedly pointed out, that pricing policy of the Government was not a conservation one; it was a tax raising gimmick. We now find that its argument has been knocked into a cocked hat because there is a surplus of petroleum all over the world. We now have countries vying with one another to sell petroleum. The Australian Government is sitting pretty because it is reaping the harvest of increased petrol tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1979-80 Budget Speech the Government undertook at least to maintain the level of road grants over the three years 1977-78 to 1979-80. Even using the old inappropriate indices we find that over that period Federal grants were reduced by 3.3 per cent. The new index reveals that the real cutback was 8 per cent, despite the promise made in the 1979-80 Budget Speech. It also exposes a massive 21 per cent cutback in real terms in road grants to Victoria between 1975-76- that was the end of the reign of the Whitlam Government, when we were providing adequate road funds and doing the best we could despite frustrations in this place-and 1980-81. More telling still is the cumulative fall in road grants to Victoria compared with what they would have been if the Commonwealth had maintained the 1975-76 level for five years to 1980-81. No doubt now the Liberals in Victoria-probably as time goes by even those in this place-will try to blame the Cain Labor Government for the deterioration of roads in Victoria. If they do they will join their Liberal and National Country Party counterparts in other States who already are blaming the Federal Government for the state of their roads because of these cutbacks. </PARA>
<PARA> Expressed in 1980-81 prices, using the latest Bureau of Transport Economics index, the total cumulative fall in road funding is $112m over five years. Other States also have to contend with cutbacks in Federal road funds. I have a table showing the figures State by State, but I will indicate only how these cutbacks affect South Australia. Total road grants to South Australia in 1980-81 were approximately 28 per cent less in real terms than they were in 1975-76. The cumulative real fall in funding to South Australia for expenditure on South Australia's roads from 1975-76 to 1980-81-five years-was $77m in real terms. I recall that Mr Tonkin, the now Liberal Premier of South Australia, when he was the Leader of the Opposition and putting forward the State Liberal Party's policy in 1979, said that he fully supported the policies of the Fraser Liberal Government. Now we find his Minister of Transport, Mr Wilson, criticising the Fraser Government because of the lack of road funding. I said at the time that Mr Tonkin was very foolish during that election campaign in saying that he fully supported the policies of the Fraser Government because they were bringing the whole of the Commonwealth into economic ruin. That has come home very vividly to Mr Tonkin in recent months. He is now trying to dissociate himself from Mr Fraser because within the next 10 months we will have an election. The Government cannot go any longer than that. Mr Tonkin is now trying to scuttle away from Mr Fraser and what he is doing to the economy of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> At a meeting in Adelaide on 13 April this year between local government representatives and Australian Labor Party members of parliament we were told of the financial difficulties being experienced by local government bodies in South Australia due to this Government's cutback in road funding. It was a very representative meeting. At that meeting were Mr Jim Hullick, Secretary of the Local Government Association, Mr Des Ross, Senior Vice-President, Mr Mike Lennon , Resource Director, and Mr Bob Hart, Secretary for the northern region. The members of parliament who attended that meeting were: Mr Peter Morris, the Federal Labor Party shadow Minister for Transport, Mr Terry Hemmings, State shadow Minister for Local Government, Mr Chris Hurford, the honourable member for Adelaide, Dr Neal Blewett, the honourable member for Bonython, Mr Ralph Jacobi, the honourable member for Hawker, Senator Bolkus, Senator Dominic Foreman, and me. It was a very interesting meeting and we were able to learn a lot. </PARA>
<PARA> Arising out of that meeting is an agreement that, irrespective of whether the Labor Party is in Government or in opposition in future years, meetings of this nature should take place at least once a year, if not twice a year, so that each side can be fully informed about the problems-particularly local government problems-and local government people can be informed about the thoughts and policies of the Labor Party. We were given certain documents at that meeting. I will quote from one of the documents that was given to us because it puts the whole problem into a nutshell. It is dated 13 April, and headed: 'Local Government and Trends in Road Funding'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth contributions to Road Funds have been falling steadily since the mid-seventies. </PARA>
<PARA>That is borne out in Appendix 1 to the document. I showed the table to the Minister for Finance, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, when she was at the table and to a Hansard officer and there will be no problems in having it incorporated in Hansard. I will seek leave later to have it incorporated in Hansard after I have quoted from this page of the document. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The projected budget allocation for 1982/83 will continue this trend. Furthermore, the Government's proposal for a 7 per cent increase next year is offered at the same time that the Bureau of Transport Economics has published its long awaited road Construction Price Index. The index demonstrates a road construction price escalation of 15.3 per cent in 1981 following a 15.9 per cent increase in the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. South Australia is disadvantaged in relation to its part of the road funding cake. For example, South Australia has-</PARA>
<PARA> 9.7 per cent vehicle population</PARA>
<PARA> 9.7 per cent kilometres travelled</PARA>
<PARA> 12.2 per cent length of roads</PARA>
<PARA> 15.5 per cent land area</PARA>
<PARA> 9.3 per cent total population</PARA>
<PARA>yet only receives 8.2 per cent of Commonwealth Road Funds. </PARA>
<PARA>Is it any wonder that the local government authorities are complaining? The document continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the transfer of the South Australian Railways to the Commonwealth has placed further demands upon our road system. Australian National have continually reduced country rail services in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA>I mentioned that earlier. I have continually complained about this matter. The document further states:</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Local Government will continue to make its contribution to the road system. Local Roads Grants are now based on a total formula approach whereby an 'effort' component will, in part, determine funds received. Moreover, longer-term roads planning is now becoming evident in many areas of the State, demonstrating our commitment vide the Mid-North Region of Councils. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, South Australian Local Government is now spending an increasingly higher proportion of its total revenue on roads. For example, in 1979-80 16.8 per cent of Local Government revenue was expended on roads. In 1981 -82 (the latest figures available) this proportion has risen to 21.2 per cent-a significant increase. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I came away from that meeting with the local government authorities with the view that the notice of motion which I had given was fully reinforced. The notice of motion which I gave in the Senate on 19 August was a result of a meeting held by the Mid-North Regional Organisation for region 8 at Lyndoch on 14 August 1981. Three resolutions were carried at that meeting. I outlined them in a notice of motion hoping that they would come up for debate long before this Bill was introduced in the Parliament and hoping that the Government might take some notice of them. However that was not to be. We are now faced with this legislation and, of course, the resolutions passed at that meeting will be of no event now. The resolutions, which I outlined in my notice of motion, were:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) That the Region in conjunction with the Local Government Association bring to the attention of State and Federal parliamentarians, the considerable concern felt by Local Government at the impact of their funding and other policies which disadvantages Councils particularly:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the shift of responsibilities transferred to Local Government which has not been accompanied by a corresponding allocation of Federal and State financial resources to the levels necessary for maintaining the system; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the absence of any positive moves by the State Government to carry out its election policies in easing the financial plight of Local Government by contributing its own resources through the Grants Commission in the form of untied grants to Local Government. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That the Region contact all Federal and State parliamentarians representing South Australia and inform them of the state's unjust treatment in comparison to the other States in the allocation of road funds by the Federal Government which has declined to an unacceptable level in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA>I was present at that meeting. As I said earlier, Mr Wilson, the South Australian Minister of Transport, was the guest speaker at that meeting. When that motion was carried, Mr Wilson sought leave to make a comment during which he blamed the Federal Government for the problems being experienced by local government in South Australia, particularly in relation to road funding. There are probably many other areas in which the Minister would now take a different tack to that which Mr Tonkin took in 1979 and seek to blame the Federal Government for all the ills that South Australia faces. </PARA>
<PARA> Most motorists in South Australia are members of the Royal Automobile Association of South Australia Incorporated. I ask them to take another look at the article in the Motor magazine on the funding sought for their roads. There is a quite extensive article in that magazine. I will not quote it because I am sure that any South Australians listening will reach for their copy of Motor to see what the RAA has to say about the problems it sees facing the motorists in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of the Fraser Government's contemptuous disregard of the financial plight it has created for the State governments and local government authorities , it bulldozed legislation through Parliament last May abolishing the long- standing discretionary power of State road authorities to decide which national road construction works they should build or put out to tender. We have discussed this matter in this Parliament at some length. We now find that State government instrumentalities, such as the Highways Department of South Australia , which draw up the specifications for any road works have to tender against private road contractors for the very job which they were carrying out most successfully under the administration of the Labor Government. Under the Tonkin Government, much of the work is now being farmed out to private enterprise. A lot of the plant and equipment is being sold at bargain basement rates or leased out at peppercorn rentals so that when the Labor Party gets back into government at the next election it will be faced with the grave problem of finding finance to buy back very expensive road equipment to carry out the road program. </PARA>
<PARA> This unwarranted legislation-a political pay-off to the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors-was opposed by all the States irrespective of their political persuasion. It constitutes blatant feather-bedding of wealthy private construction companies. A colleague in the other place, Mr Wallis, the member for Grey, spoke about this happening in his own electorate. He instanced some cases where private contractors had gone broke in years gone by because they had cut their tenders to the bone and the South Australian Government had to come along with its own equipment to finish it. Of course, that delayed the work to some extent. Mr Wallis is conversant with the problems experienced on the Eyre Highway and on the road between Whyalla and Port Augusta. Mr Wallis's speech is in the House of Representatives Hansard of 20 April for anyone who might like to look at what he had to say. </PARA>
<PARA> There is absolutely no proof that private contractors build roads better or cheaper than State road authorities or local bodies. That has since been admitted by the Minister for Transport and Construction. The Government acted without regard for the damaging and destabilising effect its decision would have on public road authorities and local government bodies in country towns. Already there is evidence to show that taxpayers' money is being wasted as a result of the blind determination of the Minister for Transport and Construction to ensure that more national road construction works are carried out by private contractors in preference to public road authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor in government will restore to the States their former discretionary power over national road construction and end this Government's feather-bedding of wealthy private construction firms. The Government may claim that increased road expenditure does not create employment. However, research of the Bureau of Transport Economics has shown that 64 per cent of direct and indirect expenditure on roads goes to the employment of labour. My time has nearly expired. In opening this debate for the Opposition, Senator Gietzelt moved an amendment that has the full support of honourable senators on this side of the chamber. I have been advised by the Australian Democrats that they have moved a further amendment. I will read the amendment moved by Senator Gietzelt on behalf of the Opposition. He moved:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that a substantial supplementary allocation of road grants should be made available to the States, the Northern Territory and local government without delay to-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) reduce the backlog of established roads needs;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) accelerate the rate of road construction and maintenance works;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) improve the efficiency of road transport services;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) reduce the incidence of road deaths and injuries; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) assist local government bodies to meet road funding difficulties'. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope this amendment has the support of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have always regarded roads as a subject of importance to Australia. The need to provide adequate finance for roads is concurrent with that view. I regard roads as national assets that need to be cared for properly and maintained to the highest possible standard. As well as that, I believe our road network has to be extended to cater for the continued development of our natural resources and to provide for an efficient interstate trading program. Apart from these two important factors, I think it is quite significant in respect of our growing domestic tourism industry. I think that by the year 2000 tourism will become one of the most important economic activities in the world. The cost of the construction and maintenance of roads has become a financial monster that provides State governments and local government bodies with tremendous difficulties. That is the reason the Commonwalth Government has to assist in providing finance for this important construction and maintenance activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a matter of fact that local government authorities, because of their financial inability to maintain or reconstruct roads, have been forced to rip up some bitumen surfaces and revert to a metal surface, which I believe is regrettable. Some examples of that have been provided to me recently by the Australian Council of Local Government Associations. For example, in the Mildura shire 2 1/2 years ago 40 kilometres of road were ripped up as the seal was in too dangerous a state to remain. Now the shire has to put in $2.50 of council funds for each $1 grant to avoid a continuation of this practice. There are other examples. The Morwell and Warragul shires each recently returned two kilometres of road to an unsealed surface. I have been given to understand that the tearing up of bitumen in the Urana shire is under active consideration. I think it is quite important for the Government to recognise that unless it provides adequate finance at a time when the cost is manageable, or relatively so, the Government will have to face considerable additional expenditure in the future. This was illustrated quite clearly by an article in the Local Government Bulletin of April 1982. It referred to an address given to a previous conference of local government authorities by John Taplin, Professor of Transport Economics at the University of Tasmania. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> At the symposium on the Australian roads system held in Canberra under the auspices of the Australian Automobile Association two years ago, he told listeners that even if the budget for roads was only 15 per cent deficient according to the BTE's warranted program, the net discounted benefits lost would amount to $484m. To put it another way, for a total investment over a numer of years of $1,301m (discounted) the total benefits would be worth $1,785m ( discounted). These figures are discounted totals to allow for the fact that investing a dollar this year costs more than it would next year-and getting a dollar in return is also worth more now than in the future! Whichever way you look at it, it's a lot of benefits to miss out on-and it isn't hard to work out how much more Australians are missing out on considering that funding for 1981- 82 has fallen a massive 40 per cent short of the warranted program. </PARA>
<PARA>I think those points ought to be noted by the Government. The next three-year allocation of funds for the five-year road grants program which was announced in 1980-that is, $734m for 1982-83, an increase of 7 per cent; $778m for 1983-84, an increase of 6 per cent; and $825m for 1984-85, an increase of 6 per cent- seems to me to be rather short of what it ought to be, having regard to the fact that the costs of construction have gone up by an amount in excess of 15 per cent in the year. </PARA>
<PARA> Take 1974-75 as a base year. In that year road grants to the States amounted to $362.8m. In 1982-83 at current prices the amount is $709.3m; and at constant prices it is $258.5m. For 1983-84 the current price figure is $751.8m, and the constant price figure is $238.3m, which is a quite significant figure. Those figures indicate that the real terms decline in the decade to 1982-83 will be 36 .4 per cent. In the decade to 1984-85 it will be 39.4 per cent, unless the funding levels announced are reviewed and some notice is taken of that problem in the forthcoming Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> As secretary of the Government members committee on local government I have met with the Federal executive of the Australian Council of Local Government Associations. As South Australian representative, I also organised a meeting with the local government sub-committee on roads in South Australia, together with my colleagues Senators Teague, Hill, Young and Messner, Mr Porter, Mr Giles and Mr Chapman to discuss this matter. As a result of our discussions and as a result of the local government committee's consultation with the Automobile Association of Australia, the tourist industry and other interested people, we have provided the Government with a submission making certain recommendations that we hope will be taken notice of and will be reflected in some way in the forthcoming Budget. I believe that the Government does recognise the problem. I think that is illustrated quite clearly in the reference in the second reading speech of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) to the report of the Bureau of Transport Economics. The Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau of Transport Economics has recently completed a report on the development of a national road construction price index. The report, which the Minister for Transport tabled on 17 March 1982, indicates that in recent years increases in Commonwealth road grants have not kept up with movements in road building costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the Government will be examining in the Budget context the scope for the provision of additional road funds. </PARA>
<PARA>I look forward with some optimism to that event. I hope that the Federal Government will provide adequate topping up funds for road construction and maintenance purposes throughout Australia. I am particularly interested, of course, in the national highway leading from South Australia to the Northern Territory. Construction work on that project is going ahead and we are looking forward to its completion by the promised date, which I understand is 1987. Other roads in South Australia, particularly in the northern part of the State, need to be given some priority as well. We look forward with some optimism. We hope that the South Australian Opposition will change its head in the sand, non- development attitude to the mineral potential of the Roxby Downs area. Roads will be required as infrastructure to service important areas such as that. This , of course, will benefit the South Australian economy. I stress to the Minister the importance of the Government paying adequate attention to providing further funding to top up the funds necessary for road construction in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing the Roads Grants Amendment Bill 1982 which apportions certain moneys to the States for road construction. I think it must be said that if the total Australian Government Budget were used for roads it would not be adequate to provide for our road needs. Therefore it is essential that the money that is allocated be spent wisely and, more importantly, that it be divided fairly. I will discuss the matter of funds being divided fairly later. The Federal Government has taken it upon itself to try to spend Federal funds for roads wisely. We have insisted that all construction of roads in the national highway network be let out to tender. It is obvious that that is necessary if we are to have any idea of how our road construction costs are going and if we are to make any attempt to get best value for the dollar being spent. The mechanism for that is in place and I understand that it is working quite well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This amendment to the Roads Grants Act will provide grants of $734m to be allocated between the States according to certain categories, namely, national roads, arterial roads and local roads. I think it should be said at the outset that the Commonwealth is really responsible wholly and solely for national highways only. A lot of flack is sent in our direction about many other roads which really are not our responsibility. Arterial roads and local roads are the sole preserves of the States and local government. We provide funds to them but they are mainly funds of a topping-up nature. I know that, when I move around the country, and I dare say the same thing applies to all other senators, I meet deputations and have brought to my attention the need for more funding for roads . Much of the funding sought is for roads over which the Commonwealth has no jurisdiction whatsoever. I think it should be understood that we are responsible for national highways and that other roads are the responsibility of the States and local government. </PARA>
<PARA> One way in which we have helped local government is through income tax sharing. Everybody knows that the local government share has now risen to 2 per cent. That, of course, is not enough. I would be very interested in a survey of the percentage of local government moneys spent on roads now as against what was spent 20 or 30 years ago. I rather suspect that many other priorities have been inserted in the local government system and that the priority for roads has fallen a bit behind. I suspect that even the extra money that is now available is not being spent on roads. Nonetheless I think that overall all governments should take road funding far more seriously. Last year a defence statement was brought down in which we were told that we are to buy a tactical fighter force replacement aircraft, the FA18. I find it inconceivable that we have given permission for an open-ended purchase. We do not know yet what that aircraft will cost but this Government has said: 'Yes, we will buy that aircraft'. I am not denigrating the aircraft; it is a superb aircraft. But I think we could certainly get our act together a bit better when it comes to such purchases. We have an open-ended arrangement for the purchase of this aircraft, the ultimate cost of which is not yet known to us, yet we cannot look at roads in the same manner. We have open-ended defence contracts but I look upon roads as being as important as any of our defence procurements. In addition, roads have a developmental role to play. I think the Government should be looking far more seriously at a developmental and defence role for our road networks. Even before I went to school and when I was allowed to wait for the mail truck at the front of my farm I can well remember seeing convoys going to the north during World War II. Sometimes those convoys would use our front paddocks as overnight bivouacs. Although our road system has advanced since that time I still do not think we take it seriously enough from a defence point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have just said, if we have open-ended contracts for defence procurements we certainly can look at our road networks far more seriously when it comes to apportioning Commonwealth moneys. When it comes to getting those moneys for roads there is vast competition for funds in Canberra. Many good causes are put up by various bodies-various echelons of government. That competition is never ending. That is how it should be. But I think it is essential that good cases be put up when we are after money for roads. With all the ragings of the various State governments through the Press the only documentation that I have seen that presents a solid case is that which has been provided by the Commonwealth through its own Bureau of Transport Economics reports. I find that a pretty sorry state of affairs. We as senators, and our colleagues in the State parliaments, can say what we like in our own States through the Press. That counts for nought in Canberra. What we need in order to put up a case in Canberra is good documentation. As I said, the only documentation we have is that which has been provided by our own BTE reports. </PARA>
<PARA> One does not have to be a Rhodes scholar to know that road funding has not kept up with consumer price index increases. Those facts are there for everybody to see. I think the Government has been neglectful in that area. As has been mentioned already the BTE road construction price indexes for 1969-70 to 1980-81 show that road construction costs have increased at a greater rate than the CPI. That was not told to us by any other road authority. It was told to us by our own BTE in its report. I welcome that report. At least it has now given the Commonwealth something on which to hang its hat. It can now look seriously at the increases in road funding which are so necessary for the development and defence of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We have before us two amendments, one which has been moved by the Opposition and one which has been moved by the Australian Democrats to that moved by the Opposition. Frankly, I find such amendments rather hypocritical when we have seen the stand taken by the Opposition on other issues. The chickens are really coming home to roost. A combination of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats took some of the revenue from the Commonwealth Government when they rejected the sales tax legislation. That happened only a few weeks ago , yet here they are asking for more money. It should be on the record that that action took $130m away from us this year and will take $330m in the next financial year-moneys that could well have been spent on the road system of Australia. We have this hypocrisy of taking away and then expecting the Commonwealth Government to give. As far as that hypocrisy goes the chickens have really come home to roost. </PARA>
<PARA> A further matter at which we should look is the question of dividing funds fairly. As I said earlier, the Commonwealth is responsible only for the funding of national highways. Once again, the only documentation that I have seen which puts a case is the BTE publication 'An Assessment of the Australian Road System 1979'. The BTE, which is an instrumentality of the Commonwealth, not of the States or of any other authority, provides this documentation which shows that Queensland has been badly treated. It is ironic that our own Commonwealth figures-we are being belted over the head by the States with our own Commonwealth figures-in this instance show quite rightly that Queensland is being badly treated in the apportionment of those funds. Table 6.19, to be found on page 151 of the BTE report, shows actual and economically efficient road expenditures. As I have indicated, a breakup of those funds shows that Queensland is the only State to be disadvantaged. It also shows that Queensland is the only State found wanting in its own expenditures. I rather hope that this is being taken on board when the Queensland Minister for Local Government, Main Roads and Police seeks to obtain more funds from his Cabinet colleagues, not just from us in Canberra where we have to wear those decisions. The Queensland Government has to come to grips with that table in the BTE report. It has to allow the Queensland Minister for Local Government, Main Roads and Police more funds. </PARA>
<PARA> While there is never enough money, as I have said, it is essential that the money which is available be divided fairly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. If we look at the percentage of national highways in each State as against the percentage of funds allocated to each State we see once again that Queensland is disadvantaged. For instance Queensland has 25 per cent of the national highways, yet it receives only 19.79 per cent of the funds allocated. That is the allocation about which I am concerned. Until we alter that figure to make up the difference year after year Queensland will receive only 19.79 per cent of the funds allocated, whereas it has 25.03 per cent of the national highways. I indicate that Victoria has 4.26 per cent of the national highways, yet it receives 17.46 per cent of the funds allocated. So there is a basic unfairness there. I hope that when the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) reports back to the Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt) and when this matter is discussed in Cabinet in light of future Budget discussions, we can once again look at roads more seriously and Queensland can get a far better and more rightful share of those funds. We are not asking for something to which we are not entitled. We are only asking for that which the Commonwealth's figures show Queensland should be receiving.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to have the opportunity, in this debate on the Roads Grants Amendment Bill 1982, to say a little bit about the need for more funds for Queensland. We have just heard Senator Collard from Queensland put a very good case as to why Queensland should have more funds for roads. Inadequate funding for road maintenance and construction in our State of Queensland certainly is a problem. It is also a very real problem as far as local authorities in our State are concerned. Earlier I listened to Senator McLaren talking about honourable senators who might criticise the Bill and yet vote for it. All I want to know is how many times in the 11 years that Senator McLaren has been in the Senate has he actually voted against his party?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator thinks he is never wrong. I am working on the basis this evening that, if one draws the Government's attention to particular problems, it is possible that it will take some action. The second reading speech of the Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt) stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government will be examining in the Budget context the scope for the provision of additional road funds. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hinze, the Queensland Minister for Local Government, Main Roads and Police, has been very outspoken about this matter and I certainly hope that the Commonwealth Government will take notice of the comments made about the need for more funds for roads in Queensland when the next Budget is brought down. Senator Collard gave us some very good statistics on this matter. The amounts provided in the Bill for the next three years involve annual increases of 7 per cent in 1982-83, 6 per cent in 1983-84 and 6 per cent in 1984-85. We have been told that road costs have gone up 15 per cent in the last year or so; it is obvious that the amounts which will be made available by the Federal Government will not be adequate to cover the costs of road construction and maintenance for the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland road network is enormous. There are 192,000 kilometres of roads, including 40,200 kilometres of declared roads which are the direct responsibility of the Department of Main Roads. If we consider that Queensland covers an area larger than Great Britain, France, East and West Germany and Italy combined, then we will realise that there is a need for a capable and efficient road system. That can be clearly understood. I also remind honourable senators of the population growth in Queensland. It is growing by approximately 50,000 people a year. They are not just tourists; people are coming to Queensland to settle. This growth can be connected with the great deal of private enterprise required to develop our resource potential. This is good not only for Queensland but also for Australia as a whole because many of these resource industries are export based. This needs to be taken into account. Of course, these developments have increased considerably the need for good roads and good road communications in our State. If one were to look at this problem in purely unemotional economic terms, it would be just as advantageous to the Federal coffers as it would be to Queenslanders themselves to ensure that Queensland had an efficient road system. </PARA>
<PARA> Queensland is a very highly decentralised State, having more than 10 cities with populations of 30,000 people. It has vast mining areas and more towns are being developed each year. That is why I feel that Queensland does need an efficient road system. The Commonwealth Bureau of Roads stated in its final report that Queensland should have received $228m in road funds for the 1979-80 year. However, the actual allocation was only $117m. One does not have to be a mathematical genius to work out that that is a $111m shortfall. In the 10 years from 1967-68 to 1977-78 the following changes in Budget allocations took place: Social security and welfare rose from 16 per cent to 27 per cent of Budget outlays; education rose from 3 per cent to 9 per cent; health rose from 6 per cent to 11 per cent; and, unfortunately, road grants fell from 2.6 per cent to 1 .8 per cent in that 10-year period. In 1981-82 road funds fell to 1.68 per cent of the total Budget outlay. As a result of this, the State and local authorities have had to do something about trying to provide further moneys themselves. Queensland has imposed a very big increase in registration fees. I understand that the Federal Government allocates money on the basis of a formula that takes into consideration the size of the State plus the population. I am afraid that when it allocates the money it must forget about our extra population. I often hear talk in this chamber about gerrymanders. I sometimes wonder whether these figures might not have been gerrymandered to favour the smaller, more populated States. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know who did it. We would have looked after ourselves a little better if we had done it. I am sure about that. I have here a newspaper report of a submission made by the Australian Automobile Association to the joint government parties transport committee. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia's road system would fail completely without substantial extra funding . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The AAA made the submission on behalf of more than 3,500,000 members of the RACQ and its sister clubs. </PARA>
<PARA>The article further states:</PARA>
<PARA> Federal allocations to the States for roads, as a proportion of total Commonwealth outlays, had dropped from an average of 2.73 per cent between 1955 and 1973 to 1.73 per cent in 1980-81, with a further drop to 1.68 per cent estimated in the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, this decline in road funding has occurred during a period when Federal revenues from fuel taxes have increased. Although the State Government and local authorities have been trying to do their bit, as the AAA said, unless funds available to the States are increased substantially, and having regard to the increased cost of maintainance, the inevitable result will be a rapid deterioration in the road network. The AAA made this following very effective statement:</PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, expenditure on roads was a sound investment which would return economic benefits many times the cost of the road works. </PARA>
<PARA> These included: fewer deaths and serious injuries on the roads, and consequent savings in medical and social service costs; energy savings; lower vehicle operating costs; reduced private and commercial travel times; lower transport costs, and less unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> 'A high standard road system and a high level of mobility are essential for the development of Australia's agricultural, industrial, commercial, energy and natural resources and to cater for people's social, cultural, educational and other needs,' the AAA claimed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bureau of Transport Economics has recently completed a report on the development of a national road construction price index. That report, which the Minister for Transport and Construction tabled in the House of Representatives on 17 March, indicated that in recent years increases in Commonwealth road grants have not kept up with the movements in road building costs. The Minister also indicated that as a consequence of that finding the Government would be examining, as I mentioned earlier, the scope for the provision of additional road funds. Of course, I would welcome that decision, as would all honourable senators. I realise that the Government's deliberations on road fundings have to be undertaken in the light of the need for continued overall restraint in the Budget and the competing funding demands of other Commonwealth programs. However , in view of the fact that the Minister has admitted that there are major deficiencies in our national highways in all States, and furthermore that most problems are in Queensland and New South Wales, I am ever hopeful that the Commonwealth may realise its allocation inefficiencies and act accordingly. I know that the Minister recently had the opportunity to examine at first hand the state of the Bruce Highway between Rockhampton and Townsville. As a result of that rather eye-opening journey he has agreed to an examination by the Commonwealth and Queensland officials of the feasibility of a jointly funded project to bring the Bruce Highway to an acceptable standard within 10 years. That is a rather long time. </PARA>

I also agree with Senator Collard's statement about good roads being very important from a defence point of view. I am quite sure that I have made myself clear on the matter and my concern about the raw deal that I feel Queensland has had in regard to road funds. I know that the Minister is aware of the deficiencies in the fund allocations to Queensland and I hope that he and his Department will be able to rectify the anomalies and make a more realistic approach to the problem. I am optimistic that now the real cost of road construction has been brought to the Government's attention it will take action as soon as possible to make increased funds available for road construction not only in Queensland but also throughout Australia. I certainly hope that if the Government does not do it before the Budget is brought down it will certainly do something in the Budget about making further funds available for the construction of roads.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the Senate proposes to support the Roads Grants Amendment Bill 1982. The provision of funds for roads is an important part of the Government's annual expenditure. This Bill will implement a program over the next three years which is part of the five-year road funding program which the Government announced two years ago. We are now towards the end of the second year of the program. It is an important part of the road funding program in Australia that there should be- as there still is-over a period an indication of future funding so that planning can be done not only by the Commonwealth but also by the States and local authorities. However, as we have progressed in this plan it has emerged that the actual percentage increases for the next three years-7 per cent, 6 per cent and 6 per cent respectively-are in fact less than the index of the road construction costs that is prepared by the Bureau of Transport Economics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This problem has been highlighted in this debate. Although honourable senators drew the Government's attention to the problems this is causing, the Government has been aware of them for some time. Indeed, in his second reading speech the Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt) acknowledged that there was such a problem and that the Government proposed to examine the matter in the context of the forthcoming Budget. Government senators have recognised that this is a matter for Budget consideration and that this legislation is not the appropriate vehicle to engage in any major changes to a program which is simply implementing the five-year program that had been announced by the Government at an earlier stage. Whether anything more can be done or provided-as I said, the Government will be very alert to the concerns that have been expressed-must be looked at in the whole Budget context, and that is when it will be done. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats have moved amendments which in broad terms demand that there should be increased allocations both in the present legislation and in any future legislation. Indeed the Labor Opposition amendment seeks larger expenditure, not simply to bring it up in accordance with the current BTE index of road costs but also to reduce backlogs and accelerate the rate of construction and maintenance. Of course, as always happens in these debates in the Senate, the Opposition and, in this case, the Democrats have joined in general terms and said that there ought to be increases in government expenditure here and now and in the future, but they do not put any estimate on what those expenses should be or give any indication of what ceiling they suggest there should be on increased expenditure on roads. We could expend hundreds of millions of dollars more on roads to meet the sorts of matters that have been raised by Senator Crichton-Browne from Western Australia and Senator Collard and Senator Bjelke-Petersen from Queensland. Those huge States have great development works taking place in remote parts. Of course the demand for road construction, including the completion of the national road program and so on, in those areas is enormous. </PARA>
<PARA> Government senators recognise as well as the Government that a judgment has to be made about priorities and about the total economic strategy that is required for the nation. These are very difficult decisions that can be made only in the Budget context. Let me simply give the Senate some idea of the costs involved. The provisions this year for an increase in the road grants to meet the BTE index will involve an additional amount of something over $40m. In the coming year that figure will be higher. So we are looking at very large sums of money indeed and ones which have, as I said, to be given very careful consideration in the overall economic strategy of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Opposition, which came in here today with a pious matter of public importance about lack of Government leadership and so on, does not provide any indication of what it would do, how much money it would spend or where it would get the money from. That is the very party which twice this year has deprived the Government of funds. I refer to more than $300m for the next financial year and to over $100m for the current year. The Opposition has the effrontery to come in and ask the Government to spend large sums of money on a specific program which it does not even cost or indicate what ceiling it wants to place upon it. I hope that the Senate will not pass the amendment to the motion which has been moved by the Opposition and that it will give the Bill, with its beneficial provisions of funds for the coming years, a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one matter that I wish to raise and to clarify, that is, the interjection by Senator Bjelke-Petersen criticising members of the Australian Labor Party who were not prepared to cross the floor on issues such as this. I remind Senator Bjelke-Petersen that members of the Labor Party are elected on the policy of the party. We are duty bound, and not afraid, to support that policy. We do not run around the country making pious promises that, if we are elected, we will do other things and saying that we are free agents. It has been proven here today that Senator Bjelke-Petersen, although she was very critical of the Roads Grants Amendment Bill 1982 because there was not enough money allocated to Queensland, is not a free agent. She is trapped in the policies of her party. I have no objection to that, but I object to people such as Senator Bjelke-Petersen saying that they are free agents and can do as they like with regard to legislation. We have had conclusive proof today that this is not so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During a debate in this chamber some time ago on road finance many statements were made by Senator Jessop and Senator Kilgariff that they would support the promise made by Mr Sinclair in Alice Springs during the 1977 election that a Federal Liberal-National Country Party Government would set up a special fund to construct the Stuart Highway. That promise was broken. Senator Bjelke-Petersen made mention of the fact, when I chided her about this legislation, that promises made by Mr Hunt would be honoured in the Budget. I remind her of the promises made by Mr Sinclair. They were never honoured. At that time former Senator Bishop moved an amendment to the Appropriation Bill with regard to the Department of Transport to set up that special fund in conformity with Mr Sinclair's promises. When it was put to the vote Senator Kilgariff, who was a great advocator of this proposal, and Senator Jessop, who was most vocal, walked out of the chamber and refused to vote. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bjelke-Petersen has accused me of not being prepared to cross the floor . In the time that I have been in this chamber, no Government senator or, to my recollection, no Government member of the other place, has ever been prepared to cross the floor and vote with the Opposition if it meant bringing down the Government. They will cross the floor on things that do not matter, but never when the opportunity of bringing down the Government, to back up something that they have said in the electorate. The honourable senator should not in the future make pious promises and accuse the Government of not providing money for roads and then come into the chamber and vote for the very thing for which she has stood on the public platform in her State and criticised the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Governor-General Amendment Bill 1982 is a small and relatively unimportant Bill which proposes that the annual salary of the Governor-General, which is now $37,000, should be increased to $70,000 a year tax free. It is not a very important Bill. It is a very simple proposal. It will provide a salary increase for the Governor-General . I just want to make some comments, however, about the enormity of the increase and to indicate that the Opposition opposes the proposal contained in the Bill. I think a few things can be said about the size of the increase compared with the hardship that many ordinary Australians are facing as a result of government economic policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make it quite clear that in pointing these things out the Opposition is not reflecting in any way upon the personality or appropriateness of the new appointee to the office of Governor-General. I might say that personally I regard the new Governor-General as a great and distinguished Australian. My personal sadness stems from the fact that the High Court of Australia has lost a great judicial mind. I am sorry that that great judicial mind will now be serving this country in the capacity of what I would regard as a dead-end job. We do not in any sense make any qualifications about the appropriateness of Sir Ninian Stephen as a distinguished Australian for this appointment. But the salary which is fixed by this legislation involves questions of principle and of practice on behalf of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The size of the increase is a demonstration of the Government's lack of sensitivity to the problems faced by ordinary Australians and the lack of consistency shown by the Government in relation to wages policy and incomes policy, or the total absence of incomes policy. Day after day the Government expresses concern about the demands of wage earners who are trying to support their families. It calls for wage restraint and blames many of this country's problems on the move by ordinary wage earners to maintain their living standards . This proposed huge increase in the Governor-General's salary is an extraordinary example of inconsistency and double standards. </PARA>
<PARA> I think a number of points should be made. While ordinary Australians experience a decline in living standards, a decline in government services, rising interest rates, rising costs for consumer finance and a rising inflation rate, calculations show that an increase of $27 would have been required, for example, in the average income of an Australian family to restore real spending power to what it was when the Fraser Government came to power. This conclusion is not only advanced by the Opposition but also supported by the Australian Taxpayers Association. So the Government should not be hectoring ordinary Australians about their response to declining living standards and calling for restraint only in the wage sector at the same time as it is dispensing largesse to the office of Governor-General or any other office of a similar kind. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply make the point that there is to be a 90 per cent increase in salary. When one takes into account the fact that the Governor-General's expenses are largely covered by separate appropriations for accommodation, transport, living expenses, et cetera, one sees that the salary is very much in the pocket money category and is largely available for the Governor-General to dispose of as he wishes. A $70,000 tax free income is the equivalent of $150,000 in annual taxable income. I do not want to say much about the way in which the increase was calculated. I recognise that the salary is not to be altered during the term of the present Governor-General and a calculation of projected increase has to be made in that regard. But the rate of increase is enormous. It represents in real terms an increase of 50 per cent over the rate of remuneration paid to the present distinguished Governor-General during his period of incumbency of that position. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition takes the view that no rational explanation has been given as to why there should be an increase of this size and objects to it. It objects not so much to the actual salary as to the method of calculation, the absence of any explanation as to why it has been calculated in this way and the absence of any understanding of increased duties which will be required of the new Governor- General which might justify such a salary increase. The Opposition is concerned about the symbolism of an increase of this size in a society where there is very considerable dissention about the levels of remuneration. It is concerned about the fact that some positions such as those of Governor-General and some of the State Governors involve the incumbency of positions which are very lavishly endowed in terms of factors other than salary and these factors have to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> I just make the point that the expenditure on the office of Governor-General is indeed very high. It is of the order of $1m in 1981-82, excluding salary factors . So we see there is no justification for handing out this particular largess. It is undesirable, as I said, in circumstances of the symbolism involved. But I do not want to pursue this matter with any recriminations about the actual worth of the man himself, who we regard as a distinguished Australian and who we are confident will provide great service to this country in the office of Governor- General. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators opposite are very lucky people. Madam Acting Deputy President, we should sell tickets; we might be able to pay off the deficit. The speech we have just heard from the Leader of the Opposition ( Senator Button) rather showed that he is in somewhat of a dilemma. Like all Australians he welcomes the proposed incumbent at Yarralumla, yet somehow or other he had to put up an opposition argument as to why the proposed incumbent should not have the salary increase. I think it is fair to say, without being rude to my friend Senator Button, that he really did not have his heart in what he was saying.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Careful, careful. As I understand whatever one can understand about the Australian Labor Party's proposed ideas of altering the Constitution, the Labor Party has not put forward the sort of proposition that we should amalgamate the two positions of head of state and head of government. Therefore, even if the Labor Party were to get the sort of Constitution it wants it would still most likely have a head of state separate from a head of government. Irrespective of whether we like it, the part of the Constitution involving the powers and the functions of the Governor-General is not likely to be altered for quite a long time. Therefore, the office of the Governor-General is not a dead- end job. It may be that only once in every 75 years a Governor-General will have to make a momentous decision, but I would have thought that we should always have occupying that position a person who has the capacity to make the ultimate decision should he think it fit to do so. He is perhaps the only man in the country who cannot pass the buck upwards. He and he alone must make the ultimate decision. For that reason, whether he ever makes that decision is an irrelevance . One ought to have in that office a person of such quality that he has the capacity to withstand the loneliness of decision making-a man who will make the right decision when it is made.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I am glad that there is a discerning person from the Opposition in the chair. We ought not to be afraid to pay top salaries to top people. As far as I am concerned, that goes for the majority of the community in Australia. All honourable senators know that this Bill is necessary because of section 3 of the Constitution. I hope that those who wish to amend the Constitution will pay some attention to section 3 of it. I think it has some defects. One defect, of course, is that the Governor-General is still appointed at pleasure. I think it is high time the Governor-General was appointed for a fixed term. From debates in the nineteenth century it is clear there were some quaint ideas then about the relationship between the proposed Governor-General and the monarchy. Australia has moved a long way down the track since the debates of the 1890s. I think it is high time that the Governor-General was appointed for a fixed term. I also think it is time that we provided that the Governor-General can be removed from office only in the same way as judges, that is, on an address from both Houses on proven incapacity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we are to have a head of State and to pay him this sort of money he ought to have security of tenure and not occupy that position at the whim of the head of Government for the time being. Judges, of course, have had such tenure almost since 1688. As most honourable senators know, before that date judges, as is the present Governor-General, were appointed only at pleasure. We ought not to overlook the reasons why the terms of judges were altered some 300 years ago from 'at pleasure' to 'good behaviour'. The terms were altered to stop undue influence being exerted on the judiciary. From that date, judges not only had tenure of office but also were paid high salaries to place them beyond temptation. It was never the litigant who would be tempted to bribe the judge. If anybody was going to corrupt the judges then-this possibly applies even now- it was the Executive. Back in the days of the Stuarts it was the King who attempted to influence improperly and corrupt the judges. In those days it was the Crown which attempted to corrupt and improperly influence the decisions of the parliament. The idea was to remove the judges from this area where the Executive could get at them. I think it is unfortunate that the Governor-General does not have the tenure of office that judges presently enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the proposition that the Governor-General's salary should not be altered during his term in office. I believe that should be the case because if a head of state's salary cannot be altered during his term of office it is impossible for a government to entice the head of state to do something on the promise of an increase in pay. I know it is an old-fashioned attitude to argue, but I can remember Sir Reginald Wright and the late Ivor Greenwood arguing very strongly in this chamber that once a person accepted a judicial office he should never again have any expectations of promotion, reward or anything else. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DV4">Senator WITHERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I think that is an excellent proposition. For many centuries puisne judges were not appointed Chief Justices-Chief Justices tended to come from outside-because, having accepted judicial offices, they had no expectation of promotion or reward. For that reason, judges normally are not promoted from one court to another. They are not promoted, for example, from a District Court to a Supreme Court. There are very good reasons why judges should not be promoted from a Supreme Court to the High Court.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DV4">Senator WITHERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. There is most probably an argument that they never should. Having accepted an office, such a person should never again expect anything from the Crown. He should never be available to be influenced by the Crown. I must say that one of the better things this Government does is to knight immediately those it appoints to the High Court. I think it is wrong to knight people while they are on the Bench or when they retire from it. If they do not have total independence they can be accused of relying on some reward or expecting some reward from government. For that reason, I believe the Governor-General ought not to have any increase in salary during his term of office. For that reason, due to the modern curse of inflation, at the commencement of his term the Governor-General ought to be paid a very high salary. I go along with the idea that the Governor-General's term should not be renewable. He should be appointed for a fixed term. I do not care whether that term is three years or seven years, but I do not think it should be renewable. The Governor-General ought to be totally free from any attempt by the Executive to influence him. I think the same ought to apply to judges. They should not be in positions where the Executive can influence them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This brings me to what I consider to be a defect in the legislation, that is, that all the terms and conditions applying to the Governor-General during his term of office and after he ceases to be in office are not spelled out in legislation and too many of those terms and conditions are at the whim of government. Honourable senators will recall that recently Senate Estimates Committee A put down a report in which it criticised the fact that a former Chief Justice was given certain privileges by Executive fiat. I agree with that criticism. If anybody is to receive anything it ought to be done in a legislative form and it ought to be done before that person accepts office. I think it is wrong to offer incumbents, either a head of state or someone in the judicial sphere, something after retirement by Executive fiat. At no time should these people be put in a position where it could be said of them-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I can go on for a week. It was because of the views that I hold that, as Minister for Administrative Services, I put a case to the Remuneration Tribunal concerning the conditions of senators and members. Those honourable senators who were here in 1975 will remember that the Executive interfered and attempted to interfere further with the rights of senators and members. We now have the position in which, apart from disapproval situations, the Executive must accept or reject but cannot interfere with conditions granted to senators and members. It is important that senators and members be free from undue influence or persuasion-call it what one likes. One could even use that old fashioned word 'corruption'. It is because of that that I regret that this Bill does not spell out in full detail all the rights and privileges of the Governor-General during his term of office and during his retirement. He ought not to be in the position of receiving something from this Parliament by way of Executive favour after he retires. Such a situation takes away the independence of the Head of State. I believe it takes away the independence of judges. It ought not to exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Remuneration Tribunal now sets almost all the facilities and conditions of honourable senators and honourable members while they are in Parliament and after they go. All persons who ought to be independent of Executive influence ought to be placed in the same position. I regret that all this is not spelt out in this Bill. I urge those who are interested in constitutional reform to pursue this matter. How does one protect people from the undue influence-I put it no higher than that-of Executive government in our time? I refer, of course, to a range of people. There is the Head of State; there is the judiciary; there are members of this Parliament. Honourable senators who read the reports of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations will know that that Committee has addressed itself to the actions of members and particularly chairmen of statutory authorities. One does not allege that corruption has taken place. Almost 300 years ago the people who drafted the so-called Bill of Rights were well aware of this matter. Therefore, they took steps to give judges tenure and proper pay and proper pensions to remove them from the influence of the Executive. I hope that as time goes by some of my remarks will be picked up. I welcome the person who will be incumbent in the position of Governor-General. I think he and his wife are very great Australians. They will do the job magnificently. They are well worth every cent of the $70,000 that will be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> My final remark is that if this Government believes that the head of state ought to be paid a proper sum-I agree with it-and that judges ought to be properly paid so that we can get the best calibre people to go on to the Bench and if it is believed that public servants in the upper echelons ought to be properly paid so that the Government can get the best advice it is high time that the Government took the same attitude to the Parliament. Unless we get better feedstock in this Parliament we will not get better Ministers. Those in the media who are so critical of what is paid to Ministers and other members of parliament and who continue to deride, degrade and sneer at their capacities and boast about their incapacities ought to remember that this problem most probably lies at their door. If people are not prepared to pay the proper money to those who come into this place then they should not complain if there are apes and monkeys running it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate Senator Withers on his emergence from semi-retirement and on making a splendid speech. I agree certainly with the thrust of what he had to say and generally with the detail. The Australian Democrats will support the Governor- General Amendment Bill 1982. I commend the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button) on his speech too. The Australian Labor Party is opposing this Bill because, as I understand it, it believes that the tax free salary of $70,000 to be given to the incoming Governor-General is too high. The Labor Party has a right to say that. It has said that. I think Senator Button said it with dignity , without embellishment and without sensationalism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a fine line decision how much is set as the salary of a person who will be in a position for at least five years and possibly eight years-the term is capable of being extended by another three years. The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia forbids any increase or any variation of the Governor- General's salary once the appointee has taken office. Therefore, whilst in 1982 values the $70,000 per annum tax free does seem, to say the least, to be a fairly healthy sort of remuneration it will not be subject to any increase, any adjustment, for at least five years. If Sir Ninian Stephen is re-appointed at the end of five years to serve a total of eight years, then certainly, even at today's rate of inflation, eight years from now Sir Ninian's salary will not compare favourably at all with that of, say, a judge of the High Court of Australia. As I understand it, the factor that influenced the Cabinet in determining this figure was that Sir Ninian retired from the High Court Bench to take this appointment before he attained the age of 60 years. Therefore, he forsook any of the superannuation rights that would have pertained to him had he remained in that office beyond the age of 60 years. Section 3 of the Constitution states:</PARA>
<PARA> The salary of a Governor-General shall not be altered during his continuance in office. </PARA>
<PARA>About whom are we talking? We are talking about the Head of State in Australia, a person with enormous powers. This person has the power to refuse to sign a Bill that has been passed by the two democratically elected Houses of this Parliament. I vigorously disagree with that provision in the Constitution. I think it is monstrous that an appointed person, a person not subject to election , not subject to any form of removal by the people themselves, should have the power to refuse to sign a Bill that has been passed by the House of Representatives, whose members are all democratically elected, and by the Senate , whose members are all democratically elected also. Be that as it may, that is part of this person's powers. I believe that that is a terrifying power. Certainly, I think that any person fit to occupy that position needs to be remunerated in the way which Senator Withers has described. </PARA>
<PARA> As we know, the Governor-General has the power to grant a double dissolution, a dissolution of both Houses of Parliament. There is, as all of us know, a very large grey area about when a head of state or a Queen's representative should or should not grant a double dissolution. We remember the speech in India of the former incumbent, Sir John Kerr, in which he said that a Governor-General was not obliged to follow the advice or request of the Prime Minister of the day and grant a premature election or a double dissolution simply because the Prime Minister of the day asked for it. He felt that there had to be in the Governor- General's mind a view that there was some instability in the country. I am not canvassing the view put by Sir John Kerr in India in 1975. But it is a respectable view and one which has to be thought of when a new person is to be appointed to this position and when his remuneration is to be contemplated by the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did direct my remarks to the Chair, Mr Acting Deputy President. I took specific care to do so. The intention of the level of this office as seen by our founding fathers can be demonstrated by the salary that was fixed in 1900 . Then the salary of the Governor-General was fixed at #10,000. It is interesting to note that three years later the Judiciary Act fixed for the first time the annual salary of the Chief Justice of Australia at only #3,500 per annum. As I understand it, the #10,000 then awarded to the first Governor- General was tax free so it was more than three times the salary of the then Chief Justice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that constitutional reform is urgent in this country. We have been and are continuing to be in the forefront of bipartisan efforts towards constitutional reforms. I am very pleased to be a member of several groups with Senator Missen and Senator Gareth Evans to encourage this bipartisan debate throughout the country. Urgent though these reforms may be, we believe that such reforms can be achieved only after careful examination of the consequences of the changes proposed and after considerable consultation at all levels of the community. If these changes result in a substantially different role for the Governor-General-I for one hope that they will-it may become possible to review the administrative and financial arrangements of the office. But until that time it seems abundantly clear to the Democrats that the principle of effective and visible independence, espoused so wisely by our founding fathers and repeated today by Senator Withers, must be preserved now more than ever. Our decision to support the Government rests mainly on this principle. However, it would be less than courteous-indeed it would be unjust-to ignore the requirement for extremely exacting standards of judicial expertise as well as the deep sensitivity for the values of a vital, diverse and changing community needed in Australia today. It must be a matter of some regret that this capacity is to be lost to the High Court. While this regret is strengthened by some recent decisions of that court, it is outweighed by the sense of relief that this capacity will now be available, if called upon, to deal with matters of great complexity and overriding constitutional importance. I remind the Senate that almost daily, unhappily, there is speculation in the media, inflamed and encouraged by Mr Fraser and Ministers, that there will be an early election; that there may well be a double dissolution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to have the benefit of Senator Townley's advice. I am sure that opinion makes a significant contribution to this debate. I am sure that every honourable senator has been breathless waiting to hear what Senator Townley felt about the possibility of a double dissolution. Be that as it may, there is speculation in the community daily about this particular matter. It is not a matter that can be taken lightly. The man who would have to make that decision is the person whose salary we are debating this afternoon. I am certain that the same force of mind and spirit would have been brought to bear on any constitutional crisis should this have been encountered during the term of the present Governor-General, Sir Zelman Cowen. Bearing in mind the present state of representation in the two Houses, this is not a remote possibility and the consideration lends urgency to the reforms now in progress. In the event, this did not become necessary and His Excellency has been able to engage in a healing process and to gain new dignity and respect for the office and a measure of community consensus on the value of stable government. It is a considerable achievement on the part of Sir Zelman Cowen and the Democrats acknowledge it with gratitude.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The previous contributors to this debate have made much of a comparison of the salaries of other high officers of the Commonwealth with the current Governor- General's salary of $37,000. We rest our support for this Bill mainly on the principle that economic independence is the essential element for this office, as referred to by Senator Withers. Nevertheless, I notice that if the proposed amount of $70,000 per annum tax free is transposed into a figure that would be taxable, the salary would be something of the order of $149,000 per annum. In reality if the Governor-General had to pay tax on his salary, he would be receiving something like $149,000. That figure is in excess of the salary of $87 ,000 of the present Chief Justice, on which he has to pay tax, but I repeat that the Governor-General's salary will have to remain constant for at least the next five years and possibly the next eight years whereas that of the Chief Justice and other Justices of the High Court will probably be reviewed and increased each year. The initial term of appointment is for five years and clearly it is the Government's intention to compensate the recipient of a fixed salary for its diminishing real value. My calculations are subject to correction but, if the Government's calculations are correct in equating this particular fixed salary with that of former brother Justices of the High Court, inflation would have to run at the rate of 13.6 per cent for each of the next five years. I say that just as a matter of passing interest. It seems to be the figure arrived at by the Government as to what the real inflation rate might be during the next five years when it has tried to bring justice to the salary to be paid to the incoming Governor-General when he assumes this most important office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Labor Party does not oppose the principle of an increase in salary for the Governor-General of our country. However, it does take issue with the degree of emolument which this legislation proposes should be paid to the new Governor-General when he takes office later this year. Of course, an argument will always be put forward that we should pay a salary commensurate with the responsibility of office. We do not quarrel with that but we certainly quarrel with the concept that increases the salary of the new Governor-General some 89 per cent as from the date of the retirement of the present Governor-General and the accession to office of the new Governor-General. This is an exorbitant increase in anyone's language, particularly from a Government that says that it has inflation under control and that all Australians should make some sacrifice in terms of their wages and salaries. Of course, we know that this Government can readily be described as a government of double standards. It has one law for the privileged and one law for the rest of the citizens of this country. We must have regard to the fact that this is the Government that has just recently persuaded the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission that there should be no increase in salary for one- quarter of our work force which is not in an economic position to get the sorts of wage increases that have already been won at the bargaining table for a vast section of the Australian work force. That Commission has been persuaded by this Government that financially everybody in Australia should tighten their belts. I think it is worth recalling the point made by Senator Chipp a moment ago that the tax free emolument to be paid to the Governor-General by virtue of this legislation in fact means that he will receive an income of $150,000 a year. That will make him, I am sure, the highest paid public official in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We quarrel with the extent of that increase. We believe that if there is to be belt tightening in this country-that is the philosophy of the Fraser Government- everybody should be placed in the same position as the largest section of the Australian people, including those sections that Senator Withers referred to. I remind the Senate of the wage increase awarded through the Remuneration Tribunal in July last year to those eminent gentlemen who constitute the Federal Arbitration Commission. They were given an increase in salary of $8,000 as a result of the decision by the Remuneration Tribunal. That represented a 12 per cent increase. They had their daily allowances increased from $72 to $90 a day, an increase of 25 per cent. Of course, that put the judges who sit in judgment upon the wage claims of the great bulk of the Australian people in a position in which they profited as a result of decisions of this Government. At the same time this Government decided in respect of the $6,000 allocated to members of the national Parliament that they should have their salaries reduced by $3,000 as from 1 July last year and that the second $3,000 awarded by the same Remuneration Tribunal should take effect as at 1 July 1982. Honourable senators will see the sort of double standards that this Government pursues. </PARA>
<PARA> Judges of the Arbitration Commission will have a 12 per cent increase in salary and a 25 per cent increase in allowances. Members of parliament will have their salaries decreased by 50 per cent. At the same time, we are asked to provide an increase of some $33,000 which represents, according to my mathematics, an increase of 89 per cent in respect of the emolument to be paid to the Governor- General. Of course, what has not been referred to in the debate is that not only is the emolument tax free but also the taxpayers of this country provide the accommodation for the Governor-General in the capital city, in Sydney and in other places throughout Australia. The Governor-General also gets free meals, a plentiful staff, motor cars and all the other fringe benefits that go with the office of Governor-General provided by the taxpayers of this country. There is no argument about staff, and the staff's wages and salaries as is applied to the members of the national Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst all this is happening we find that the bulk of the Australian people have seen their interest rates rise by 4 per cent in the last two years alone. Payments on an average home loan have increased by something like $88 a month. The average pay-as-you-earn taxpayer now pays $1 in taxes to the Commonwealth Government for every $3 that he earns, whereas seven years ago when the Fraser Administration came to office he paid $1 for every $4 earned. The average family now pays $10 a week for health care because of the Frasers Government's latest health scheme and because of the increase in sales tax which is costing the average home owner approximately $6.50 a week. In fact the average skilled worker in this country is some $24.50 worse off. Judges sit in judgment and decide that the citizens of this country should have their belts tightened and should not have an increase in salary. We take issue with the hypocrisy, the humbug and the deception that this Government practises in respect of the salaries and emoluments that it wants to pay to those occupying high positions in the administration of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course we do not disagree that the salaries of the Governor-General, judges, public servants, wage earners and members of parliament ought to be indexed. There ought to be a principle applying across the board that is fair and equitable to every citizen. But that is not the attitude of this Government and it is not the attitude of Government senators when, time and time again, they support the philosophy of this government which is that the average citizen of this country should be economically disadvantaged week by week and not be able to meet the increased costs which are so much part now of the way in which the average citizen in this country operates. I remind the Senate that that $70,000 provided for in this legislation will be paid tax free. If we look at the degree to which the average taxpayer is contributing towards Federal income-that is, for every $3 he earns he gives $1 to the Commonwealth Government-we will see a very interesting comparison in that we should be giving to the Governor-General a salary of the nature of $70,000 a year to do what? Everything is provided for him; accommodation, meals, travel and staff. The $70,000 is pocket money because everything else is provided by the taxpayers of the country. Of course, the judges in the Arbitration Commission say piously that they do not believe that the wage earners of this country are entitled to an increase in salary because of the prevailing economic conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is the yardstick to be applied, it ought to be applied across the board starting from the top: The Governor-General, the judges in the High Court and the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission, right through to the senior permanent positions in the First and Second Divisions of the Public Service. All of these office holders have been awarded substantial increases in salary since the last time the Remuneration Tribunal dealt with these matters. Of course, the same yardstick is not applied because the Government assists in every way possible those in high places to the disadvantage of those in the lower income scale. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I am gratified by the debate on this measure, the Governor-General Amendment Bill 1982, although a little disappointed that the Labor Opposition has decided to oppose the salary increase, although not the principle of a substantial salary increase for the Governor-General. However, the views expressed in this debate have only commended very warmly the choice of the new Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen, who has now retired from the High Court of Australia in order to take up his new position in the near future. But it is very important that there should be, as has been expressed in this Parliament, very strong bipartisan support for that appointment and for the role that the Governor-General is called upon to play.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was a little unfortunate, I think, as Senator Withers said, that Senator Button, leading in the debate for the Opposition, should have spoken about the job as a dead-end one because, quite clearly, it is not. Senator Chipp also emphasised that point. I should have thought that members of the Australian Labor Party would, in view of their complaints about what the Governor-General did in 1975, have been the last people to regard the position in that light. The most important job in Australia is the head of state. It involves the representation of the Australian people. The incumbent of the office has performed that role in a very distinguished way. I am sure that Sir Ninian Stephen will also do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate has centred on the size of the increase of the salary but, as has been recognised, the Constitution provides that the salary cannot be altered during the period in which the Governor-General is in office. That is commonly taken to be a period of about five years. The unfortunate rates of inflation that we have come to live with and which we must project for the near future indicate that at the end of a period of five years the salary of $70,000 will not have the same purchasing value. That is one of the major factors which has led to the figure being fixed at $70,000. I think it has been recognised by Senator Chipp that a convention, and in one sense a statutory provision, has been established in fixing a relativity between the salary of the Governor- General and that of the Chief Justice of the High Court. The legislation provides for the pension of the Governor-General to be geared to the retirement pension of a chief justice. </PARA>
<PARA> When these provisions were introduced in 1974 by the then Labor Government a salary of $30,000 a year was fixed for the Governor-General. At that time that salary was considerably in excess of the net salary of the Chief Justice of the High Court. Indeed over the last couple of years the existing salary of the Governor-General has fallen below that of the after tax salary of the Chief Justice of the High Court. So relativity has fallen. If a salary increase of the order of that proposed were not given over the next few years that relativity would again be displaced and it would be highly probable that the Governor- General's salary would fall quite significantly below the salary of the Chief Justice. As I think Senator Chipp recognised in his speech that is one of the important bases on which the salary has been fixed. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, although I am pleased that there has been strong support for the new holder of the office, it is a pity that there has not been complete bipartisan support for this measure. However I am pleased that there has been sufficient support for it and I hope that the Senate will give it a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For some time now-for several months in fact-the general public, the Senate and the Government in particular have had available to them information concerning a particular use being made of section 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. I refer to the use being made of the taxation Act by a film production company-United American and Australasian Film Productions Pty Ltd-which gathers investment from Australian investors on the basis that an investment of $1 yields a 375 per cent tax deduction. Those investment moneys are invested not in Australian films, generally speaking, but in overseas films. As I said this matter came to public attention some months ago but I am particularly concerned that the Government has refused to make clear its attitude to this use of section 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This scheme was described in some detail in an article by Maximilian Walsh on 4 February this year in a weekly journal called Australian Business. Subsequently it has been critically discussed in all of the responsible newspapers in this country. On 13 May the Age had an editorial which was highly critical of this use of section 51 of the tax Act. It concluded by stating:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the diversion of Australian funds into foreign films at the expense of Australian taxpayers is contrary to the national interest, even if some of these films have some tenuous Australian link. This exploitation of the tax law should be stopped. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite the fact that the matter has been raised in the Parliament, by way of questions and some debate, the Government has refused to make its position clear . This is a particularly irresponsible failure on behalf of the Government because apparently it went to great pains over the last couple of years to develop and introduce a particular provision in the tax Act to attract investment in Australian films and to provide some necessary economic stimulus to the Australian film industry. That provision is controversial and its implementation uneven but by and large its justification is that it has assisted local industry. On the other hand we have the operation of another scheme, the legality of which is considered to be dubious by many experts in the area, which offers a much more generous tax deduction to people who participate in it and the investment from which does not go into the Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important that the Government make some specific response on this issue. Is it the intention of the Government that section 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act be used in this way? Does this scheme, which provides a tax deduction of 3.75 times the actual investment made by the individual and which has been operating in this country without challenge by the Australian Taxation Office, represent Government policy on attracting investment into the film industry? Public comment on this scheme by Treasurer John Howard as reported in the Australian Business on 4 February was equivocal, and this is not good enough . The Minister for Finance, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, has been questioned about this matter by Senator Hamer but her reply in Hansard of 18 May was inadequate. All it did was confirm that section 51 was being used in this way. The other matter which Senator Hamer raised in his question as to the effect of this practice on the Australian film industry was not addressed by the Minister in her reply. Maximilian Walsh, in the Australian Business article, pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA> The continued success of the scheme depends on the Tax Department continuing to regard the scheme as being ''an ordinary business dealing''. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask: Is it the Government's intention that the Australian Taxation Office continue to regard this use of the tax Act as an ordinary business dealing? It must also be asked why the Government is tolerating two film investment schemes running parallel-one obviously much more generous than the other and able to be used in an unjustifiably liberal way-whereas the specific film tax concessions available to investors under Division 10BA and section 23H of the Income Tax Assessment Act offer a much less favourable, even though in absolute terms still very favourable, deal to the investor. Division 10BA of the Income Tax Assessment Act offers a 150 per cent deduction and a 50 per cent exemption but those concessions are available only to films certified as Australian by the Minister for Home Affairs and the Environment. The 375 per cent deduction scheme being used by UAA under section 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act is available for any film investment. There is no need for the film involved to be an Australian film. Indeed UAA's films have had in general little or no Australian content. Clearly, if this use of section 51 is allowed to continue it will divert Australian investment money away from the Australian film industry into multinational projects such as The Earthling and Arthur-both UAA productions- which do little for the Australian industry and nothing at all for the reputation of Australian films. </PARA>
<PARA> The current operation of section 51 raises the question as to why the Government bothered to introduce the Division 10BA provisions. It also raises some other very serious questions which I believe the Government must answer. For example, how many other overseas producer-financiers are approaching the Commissioner of Taxation for a similar approval of a tax haven? How much revenue has been forgone by the use of section 51 in this matter? The Treasurer (Mr Howard) is quoted as stating that the film incentives introduced last year may cost revenue an estimated $24m. The UAA literature being issued for this year seeks over $28m mainly for overseas productions and offers a deduction of 3.7 times that amount-say a deduction of $106.6m. Mr Picton-Warlow of UAA has announced that substantially more funds will be sought and other films planned. Does this mean that the loss to revenue is a loss of $64m at a tax rate of 60c in the dollar? I think these questions have to be addressed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The announcement by UAA that it intended to invest $35m in a studio complex in the Australian Capital Territory ought to be assessed in the light of the cost to the Australian public of tax revenue forgone through UAAs use of section 51. There is abroad a general legal view that the Income Tax Assessment Act provides the Commissioner with several grounds to challenge the UAA partnership deductions. Why is the Commissioner continuing to allow them? If this general legal view is wrong and in fact the Commissioner is powerless to challenge the UAA exercise will the Treasurer move to change the Act retrospectively to the date of his recent announcement on such unintended abuses?</PARA>
<PARA> Unlike the special incentives provided for the film industry it is very easy to raise money for such schemes in the last few months of the financial year-that is the period we are in now. What steps will the Treasurer take with regard to deductions and payments made in the current year of income if the scheme is outlawed? It would seem too that UAA is in the business of promoting partnerships and if any offer is made to the public it would then be necessary to register a prospectus with the Corporate Affairs Commission. Is UAA complying with these requirements? Is it the case, for example, that UAA has agents in several States in Australia? Is the Government taking any steps at all to investigate the possibility of a breach of the Companies Act by the UAA partnerships?</PARA>
<PARA> I raise this matter because as I said it has been brought to my attention and to that of the general public not only by very critical articles throughout the financial Press but also by many people working in the Australian film industry. It is widely believed in the industry that the operation of UAA in respect of section 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act will have a seriously detrimental effect on investment in the Australian film industry. The Government must also be aware, because of the series of controversies surrounding tax concessions for the film industry, that the operation of a scheme such as this and the attention it is getting in the financial Press must bring the whole question of concessions for the film industry into disrepute. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely the Government, as it has gone to some lengths to provide tax concessions to help the Australian film industry, ought to be prepared to defend the credibility of those concessions. At the moment the situation is that it appears, and it is widely believed, that a massive rip-off is occurring-that a totally unjustifiable level of tax deduction is being made available via this use of section 51 of the Act and that the benefits of that, the investments attracted by this operation, are not going into the Australian film industry but generally going into the production of films which have nothing to do with our local industry and by this diversion of funds into investment into foreign films it is providing a serious threat to our own industry. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the second last day, we believe-I suppose some of us hope-of this session of the Parliament. I think it is important that the questions I have raised go on the record. I think it is absolutely important that the Minister for Finance, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, and the Treasurer, Mr Howard, no longer retain a silence on these matters and no longer refuse to address the very serious issues that are raised but make quite clear what the Government's policy is. If the Government endorses the operation of the use of section 51 in this case will it drop Division 10BA and section 23H? If it does not endorse this use will it follow the advice of the editorial in the Melbourne Age recently and close the tax loopholes? I think the Senate, the Australian public and the Australian film industry are entitled to an immediate clarification of the Government's intentions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A prominent Western Australian Liberal lamented recently the moral decay of the Liberal Party in Western Australia. He said the Western Australian branch had been taken over by corporate criminals who hide their real objectives behind a smoke screen of States' rights. Those who have heard Senator Crichton-Browne's passionate objections to the proposed Federal crimes commission might understand what he meant as would perhaps those who have followed the progress of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) through the courts of Western Australia and the Shire of Carnarvon. People who attended the Federal Liberal Party conference the weekend before last will also have gained some insight. One Liberal delegate, from another State, was reported as describing the Western Australian proposition and the Western Australian delegates, by implication as a whole, as bigoted and offensive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, today I want to deal with a more fundamental question than that of the sordid commercial activities of some people in and around the Liberal Party of Western Australia. For more than five years the dominant faction in that party has pursued a policy aimed at disenfranchising the citizens of the State. It started in February 1977 when there was a conspiracy to deprive Aborigines in the Kimberleys of the right to vote. In December 1977 it was followed by an attempt to amend the State electoral Act in a way intended to deprive Aborigines and other illiterate people from voting. That attempt failed because to their credit, two or three Liberal members of the State Parliament, along with the Labor Party and the National Party, voted against it. In 1979 other impediments to enrolment were inserted into the electoral Act aimed at minimising the enrolment and therefore the exercise of the franchise particularly of Aborigines , young people and migrants-those groups which no doubt are perceived to have a higher than normal propensity to vote Labor. I regret to say that the attempt has been highly successful. At the time that that amendment to the Western Australian electoral Act was passed there was a difference of 5,000 in Western Australia between the total enrolment on the Federal roll and the total enrolment on the State roll. The figures as at 4 May this year show that that 5, 000 has grown to 41,000, an extraordinarily high proportion of which are concentrated in the Federal division of Kalgoorlie. No less than 24.6 per cent of the people enrolled on the Federal roll of Kalgoorlie are not enrolled for State electorates within the Kalgoorlie division. Almost one-quarter of the people enrolled on the Federal roll in Kalgoorlie do not have the right to vote in State elections because they are not enrolled on the State roll. Many of them think they are on the roll because they have completed cards. But those cards are cards which, following the 1979 amendments to the State Electoral Act, are not accepted as enrolment applications because they are not witnessed by a justice of the peace, a policeman, a clerk of courts or an electoral officer, as the electoral Act of Western Australia now requires. I do not think I need say any more about that, other than to say that no other government in Australia, State or Federal, has ever found it necessary to impose that sort of impediment to enrolment, to restrict to that degree the people who may sign enrolment applications. If people send in a Federal card and a State card, the Federal one is accepted and they think the State one is accepted also, but in fact it is not . I might add that of those 17,000 people enrolled on the Federal roll in Kalgoorlie who are not enrolled on the State roll, some 5,365 are in the State division, Legislative Council, North Province. That is significant. I might add also that according to the 1981 census some 44,000 people who live in the Federal division of Kalgoorlie are not enrolled on the Federal roll. That figure would have to be increased to something over 60,000 for those who are not enrolled on the State roll. </PARA>
<PARA> I have stated the impediments to enrolment on the Western Australian roll and I have pointed out that because people have filled in two cards they believe they are accepted on the State roll. A great number of people-I heard this stated in the town of Newman only a couple of weeks ago-believe that they are enrolled on the State roll when in fact they are not. Last Friday we received the latest instalment of this continuing campaign to disfranchise citizens of Western Australia. The President of the Legislative Council received a letter of resignation from one of the then sitting members for North Province, Mr Bill Withers-I understand he is no relation to Senator Withers. He immediately, last Friday, issued a writ for an election to be held 71 days after the issue of the writ. In the last 10 years no more than 30 days has elapsed between the issue of the writ for any general election and the polling day. For by-elections the time has sometimes been longer but it has never been as long as 71 days. One may ask: Why was the writ issued so hastily when the election is not to be held until 31 July? The answer, I believe, is that the electoral roll closes 14 days prior to the issue of the writ and that the Western Australian Liberal Party and the President of the Legislative Council knew very well that approximately 1,000 people had submitted their names for inclusion on the roll in that 14 day period . But because of the precipitate action taken by the President of the Legislative Council those people will not be allowed to vote in the by-election for North Province on 31 July. </PARA>
<PARA> In all of this electoral and other chicanery the Federal Liberal Party to date has meekly complied with the actions of the Western Australian branch, although I know very well that many of its members disapprove of them. Their acceptance of the actions of the Western Australian branch has, however, not always been passive. For example, a Bill which I introduced in the Senate nearly three years ago and which was finally voted on last December-if passed it would have required that all persons of Aboriginal descent in Western Australia who are on the Federal roll would as a matter of law be placed on the State roll-was defeated by the combined votes of the Liberal Party and Senator Harradine. </PARA>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had almost finished what I had to say when the sitting of the Senate was suspended. I was saying that the Federal Liberal Party had complied, among other things, with the consistent attempt by the Western Australian Liberal Party and the Western Australia Government to disenfranchise 40,000-odd of its citizens and that that compliance had not always been passive, that when a Bill to end that disen- franchisement-at least as far as Aborigines were concerned-was put to the Senate last December that Bill was defeated by the combined votes of Liberal-Country Party senators and Senator Harradine. I intend to resubmit that Bill to give those people another chance. That fixes the position only for Aborigines. The great majority of the 40,000-odd people presently on the Commonwealth electrol roll but not on the State electoral roll of Western Australia are non-Aborigines. That number of 40,000 appears to be growing. For that reason, I intend to propose to the Australian Labor Party that I be allowed to submit a Bill for a referendum for constitutional alteration which would ensure that the Commonwealth electoral roll would become the State roll in Western Australia and Queensland, which are the only two States that still maintain separate State rolls. All other States have found that the Commonwealth roll is adequate as the basis for the State roll. There would obviously be a considerable cost saving, which I have not yet been able to quantify, to both of those States. It would also ensure that the 40,000-odd Western Australians currently disenfranchised at a State level by the deliberate actions of the Western Australian Government would then be enfranchised for State elections as well as Commonwealth elections. It would also provide an opportunity for the Federal Liberal Party to dissociate itself from the chicanery which has been the hallmark of the Liberal Party of Western Australia over a long period.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has been debating the motion for the first reading of the Excise Tariff ( Petroleum) Amendment Bill 1982. In such debates, honourable senators are entitled to raise any matters they wish to raise, no matter how irrelevant they are to the legislation. It is not common for the Government to respond to those debates but, in view of the remarks which have been made by Senator Ryan and Senator Walsh, I thought I should briefly detain the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Ryan expressed concern about the use of certain tax concessions which have been introduced by the Government to encourage the film industry. She suggested that the concessions are being used for purposes which go beyond the original intent, certainly to ease the burden of taxation without necessarily assisting the Australian film industry. It is not an area with which I am closely familiar. I will ensure that her remarks are drawn to the attention of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle). The attitude of the Government towards tax avoidance and evasion is well known. The Bills which have been introduced in this Parliament to prevent the improper use of technical loopholes in the law are many. I am sure that her remarks will be considered closely. In making those remarks, I cannot adopt what she says and I do not do so. I simply say that it will be brought to the attention of the relevant Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh followed in the debate by making an attack on a number of things. He made an attack on the members of the Liberal Party of Western Australia. He made that attack on a number of bases and he made an attack on the Western Australian Government's actions with respect to the closing of the rolls for the North Province for a State election. With respect to the people in the Liberal Party of Western Australia whom he characterised as corporate crooks-or he so alleged by way of the words of somebody else-I can only say that, having been in the party for some 24 or 25 years, I believe that his remarks would be regarded as both absurd and offensive by the vast number of the members of that party. They would know how ludicrous what he has said is. The membership of that party is drawn very widely from round the State. It is drawn from primary producers, employees, employers, small businesses and the professions. I think that, if there is a sector under-represented in the Liberal Party, it would probably be what might be categorised as the corporate sector. From my experience, which is close, I believe that its membership indicates that it is not a party of big business. It is a party which is made up of the citizenry of Western Australia and a very broad and representative cross-section. I suppose on most Saturdays at this time of the year I am thrown into contact with a large group of those people, and I can only say that to describe them as other than decent, hard working and loyal people would be an absurdity. On their behalf, I reject the comments which the honourable senator has made. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh hung some weight on the concern which has been expressed by Senator Crichton-Browne about the formation of a national crimes commission, a concern which was echoed by the Minister for Police and Traffic in Western Australia, the Honourable Bill Hassell, a concern which was rooted in the well- known federalist views of the Western Australian Government and, indeed, of the Western Australian Liberal Party. It would be well known to honourable senators that on a range of issues it has been the concern of the Western Australian Government and of the Western Australian Liberal Party to maintain a strongly federalist stance. It is a matter of some pride to me and, I think, to many Western Australian Liberals, that the Western Australian senator who is the Attorney-General in this Government has been instrumental in seeing federalist solutions to such vexed questions as the off-shore settlement and the arrangement of a single line of environmental inquiry instead of the duplicate inquiries which applied when we were re- turned to government in 1975. The concern expressed about the crimes commission is one which, as I have said, is rooted in federalist principles. I think those principles were reflected in the Government's concern to indicate, at the time that it publicly said so, that it was considering the formation of a commission given the results of the royal commissions which were running. It was pointed out that this would not entail the adoption of an additional policing function by the Federal Government but rather that the crimes commission would work through existing law enforcement agencies, both Commonwealth and State. </PARA>
<PARA> So, again, I reject the argument which has been put by Senator Walsh. I say to him with great seriousness that if he is so concerned with corruption he might devote some of his considerable forensic talents to investigating the affairs of his own party in States such as New South Wales. I say with some confidence that it is unlikely that any member of my party will be found beaten up by factions of his own party-a recent and well-documented happening in the Australian Labor Party in the State of New South Wales. If there is to be concern it would be very good if the ALP members showed concern about their own backyard. I will back my party against theirs in any circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the question of disfranchisement is concerned, I believe that there is a very deep concern in Western Australia about the attitude of the ALP towards the Aboriginal vote. I think it would be less than honest of me if I did not say that that was a reality. That concern is rooted in an approach of the Labor Party which is pretty ruthless in this area. It reflects a similiar ruthlessness in the Northern Territory, a ruthlessness which has led to an absolutely absurd approach by the ALP which is dividing the community in those areas where black and white Australians need to live together. I would suggest that if there were a little more moderation and concern to ensure absolute fair play on the part of the ALP in these areas we might find that these things were a little more relaxed and there were less difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the requirement that the Commonwealth roll should apply, I would again say that on federalist principles I would support any suggestion that there is no reason why there should not be different qualifications for voting in State and Federal elections. I would like to make the point that the voting age in this country used to be 21. Some governments chose to reduce that age to 18. I do not believe that there is a fundamental democratic principle involved in whether a person gets the vote at 18 or 21 years of age. There is no reason why the Commonwealth, by its Act, should impose, for example, a voting age on a State electoral system. I think that example could be multiplied many times. I do not believe that we are entitled in this Government or in this Parliament to override State electoral laws simply because we believe that we have a view which is superior to that held in some State. On the basis of the federalist principles I mentioned before I would support the maintenance of State freedom in that area. The matters which have been raised before the Senate tonight are matters which are, as I said, irrelevant to this legislation but which raise important issues. I speak in defence of the membership of the party to which I have belonged for 24 years and I speak in defence of the rights of the States to maintain differences from the laws of the Commonwealth. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to enact the excise tariff alterations made by Excise Tariff Proposals No. 3 (1981) and No. 1 (1982). </PARA>
<PARA> Excise Tariff Proposals No. 3 (1981) were moved in the other place on 25 August 1981. These proposals, which operate from 1 July 1981, increased the excise duty on stabilised crude petroleum oil from $174.08 to $177.53 per kilolitre and on naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas from $36.67 to $37.07 per kilolitre.</PARA>
<PARA> Excise Tariff Proposals No. 1 (1982) were moved in the other place on 17 February 1982. These proposals, which operate from 1 January 1982, further increase the excise duty on stabilised crude petroleum oil from $177.53 to $186. 26 per kilolitre but reduce the excise duty on naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas from $37.07 to $20.46 per kilolitre. </PARA>
<PARA> The alterations accord with the Government's policy of adjusting the price of indigenous crude oil to world parity as determined by the Minister for National Development and Energy, on 1 January and 1 July each year. </PARA>
<PARA> This policy is well established and widely understood by the Australian community. It is based upon sound economic and conservation principles. </PARA>
<PARA> The crude oil levy is an important aspect of the policy. It ensures that a fair share of the income from import parity price adjustments goes to public revenue.</PARA>
<PARA> Without the levy, taxation would need to be significantly higher in order to finance the services demanded of Government and the gains from import parity pricing would go to the oil producers as a windfall profit. </PARA>
<PARA> The success of the Government's crude oil pricing policy has been based upon its openness, predictability and equitable sharing of income gains. That policy requires that in the interests of conservation and responsible management of scarce liquid fuel resources prices of petroleum products be set at realistic levels. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill, the Excise Tariff (Petroleum ) Amendment Bill 1982, provides legislative backing for Excise Tariff Proposal No. 3 (1981), which was operative from 1 July 1981, and for Excise Tariff Proposal No. 1 (1982), which was operative from 1 January 1982. Those proposals actually increase the levy on crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas produced in Australia. In round figures the effect of the two Bills is to increase the price paid by Australian oil refiners by just over $2 a barrel, which in a full year I estimate would produce something like $300m extra revenue. The increases are part of the Government's crude-oil policy of some four years standing, which the Australian Labor Party has consistently opposed on the grounds that it is inflationary and that it is not an energy policy, but that it is an excuse to increase taxes in a moderately regressive way, disguised as an energy conservation policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since the Senate this afternoon has been debating Bills relating to road funding, I think it is pertinent to note the irony of these two Bills coming up today, largely as a result of the Government's crude-oil pricing policy. Road making costs have increased at a much faster rate than prices in general. In spite of that Commonwealth Government induced phenomenon it has failed to maintain the real value of road funding expressed as prices generally. In other words, while road making costs have been increasing at around 16 per cent a year largely because of the Government's crude oil pricing policy, Commonwealth funds to the States for road making purposes have been increasing at around 8 per cent a year. Although the Australian Labor party has been consistently opposed to the policy given expression in this Bill, we will not be opposing it because, as my colleague Paul Keating said in the House of Representatives, it is absurd that the tax has been collected for almost 12 months before the Parliament has had an opportunity to pass judgment on it. I estimate that by now the additional tax collected as a result of the two Bills would be somewhere between $160m and $ 180m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There might even be a bit of petty cash left over after it has paid for the latest trip of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). As I understand the legal position, were this Bill to be rejected by the Senate, the tax which has been collected for almost 11 months in the case of Customs Tariff Proposals No. 3 (1981) would be declared illegal and the Government would be legally obliged to return the money-something between $160m and $180m. Of course , the money would be returned principally to the major Australian producer, Esso -BHP. The Labor Party can see no reason why that should happen. As the least undesirable option we will not oppose the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> According to the Australian Democrats' spokesman, Senator Mason, in a Press release issued on 4 May-I do not know whether this remains the Democrats' policy -the Democrats will oppose the Bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am about to quote the honourable senator. He should not complain. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It should not be beyond the wit of the Government to devise a means of returning the money to consolidated revenue in some form. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether it is beyond the wit of the Government to devise such a means, but it is apparently beyond the wit of the Australian Democrats because no such mechanism was suggested in that Press release or, to my knowledge, in any subsequent statement. Senator Mason continued:</PARA>
<PARA> But if this proves impossible, the oil companies could very well reduce the price of petrol for a sufficient period to return the additional money to the Australian motorist. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, it remains a matter for wide-eyed conjecture how a Commonwealth government could ensure that that could happen, even if it were the best of options. In short, the Government has any aware and responsible member of the Senate over a barrel on this question. We really have no realistic option but to allow the Bill to pass. However, as a protest against government duplicity I now move the following amendment to the motion that the Bill be read a second time:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of the motion, add:</PARA>
<PARA> ', but the Senate notes that any defeat of the measure would require the Commonwealth to forgo approximately $160m this financial year to the Australian oil producers, and-</PARA>
<PARA>This is the more important part of the motion-</PARA>
<PARA>condemns the Prime Minister for not honouring his election undertaking to commit any additional oil levy revenue to tax cuts and family allowances'. </PARA>
<PARA>The latter part of the second reading amendment that I have moved arises from commitments given by the Prime Minister in the heady atmosphere which preceded the 1980 election. The Prime Minister, with regard to this government policy of adjusting the price of Australian produced oil in accordance with movements in Saudi Arabian prices and exchange rates, said, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA> If there are any further significant increases (in petrol prices and tax from them) then the first priority of the Government will be to return that to the Australian family through the taxation mechanism or through family allowances. While we don't at the moment expect dramatic increases, the revenue will be returned to Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement was reported by, among other newspapers, the Australian of 16 October 1980 with strake headlines-I think that is the professional jargon-'OPEC increases will fund tax cuts'. Other headlines included 'Fraser pledges to give back petrol price rises as rebates or family allowances', 'Prime Minister says priority to return money to the people' and so on and so on. That, of course, is yet another example of the Fraserian disposable promise issued when there is a perceived electoral need for issuing a promise and disposed of as soon as that need passes. There has, of course, been no attempt by the Government to honour that promise. Indeed, the Bill before the Senate tonight implicitly repudiates that unqualified guarantee which the Prime Minister gave and which was so widely reported just a few days before the last Federal election. So although, as I said earlier, a responsible senator has no realistic option but to allow the Bill to pass, we would be remiss if we failed to move and carry some censure of the Prime Minister for his failure to honour his pre-election promises, a failure which is given legislative effect in the Bill before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will oppose the Excise Tariff (Petroleum) Amendment Bill 1982 to authorise crude oil levy increases because it is our clear duty to do so. It is our clear duty to the electorate to honour an undertaking we made to it that we would not allow Bills to pass here which were in breach of the Government's own promises made during the 1980 election campaign. This Bill is clearly and blatantly in that category. It is a matter of fact, as Senator Walsh said, that in October 1980, while addressing an election rally in Launceston, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made the following promise:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If there are significant increases in the price of oil, and therefore in the revenue from the levy, it will be returned to Australian families through taxation reductions or through family allowances. </PARA>
<PARA>There have been no increases in family allowances or reductions in tax to meet that promise and none is forecast by the Government. Therefore we must oppose this Bill to keep the Australian Democrats promise to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill seeks to validate increases in the crude oil levy and hence in the cost of petrol at the pump to Australian motorists by 0.35c a litre as from 1 July 1981 and a further 0.8c a litre from 2 February 1982. Those increases have already taken well over $100m from the pockets of all Australians and will continue to take more millions of dollars with every week that passes. The Government has in the past tried to claim that there has not been a significant increase in revenue from the levy. That claim must be nailed as evasive and deceitful whenever it is raised. Beyond doubt the Government has the money. This is money which in terms of the Prime Minister's own promise at Launceston should be going back to the Australian people in the form of tax cuts or increased family allowances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been canvassing a further red herring which it may well bring forward in this debate, although I doubt it would have the gall to do so. This is something at which Senator Walsh and the Australian Labor Party also connive. It is that if the money that has already been collected from motorists as a result of higher petrol prices imposed in July and February last is not levied by this Bill the additional funds estimated by the Australian Democrats of at least $136m and by the Australian Labor Party at $160m would remain as a sort of bonanza in the hands of the oil companies. This is complete nonsense. If indeed we have members of parliament who merely suggest to us and to the Australian people that a situation like that is beyond the collective wisdom of the Liberal Party, the National Country Party and the Labor Party, what do they think they are doing here? What are they doing here if they cannot do something about it? I will give Senator Walsh his answer. It is something that he knows perfectly well could be done if, indeed, he had taken this debate with any degree of sincerity. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many ways in which this money could be retrieved by Consolidated Revenue. Indeed, it could be done by a reduction of the crude oil levy through the introduction of a Bill very similar to this Bill or, indeed, by agreement for a sufficient period in which to return to the community those moneys which we think have been falsely derived in view of the promise of the Prime Minister. In other words, until that money was repaid, Australian motorists would pay substantially less for petrol, as indeed they should. The money should be returned to them in all honesty. When the money already collected had been repaid to Australian motorists because they would be paying less for petrol, they would continue to pay less because this deceitful Bill we are now considering would not have been passed by the Senate. That would have been an option open to the Australian Labor Party, and members of that party know that as well as I do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Chipp says, it is a light tap on the wrist. If the Australian Labor Party persists with its so far declared intention to vote for this Bill it will be supporting and conniving at a Government breach of an important election promise to the people of Australia. It also will be selling out disgracefully the very people the Australian Labor Party pretends to represent-the workers, the battlers, the ordinary people of this nation. I would like to quote from an editorial which appeared in the Canberra Times of 20 November 1981 in relation to this matter because it is very much to the point. I stress the date-20 November 1981. That was some time ago and this matter, of course, was at issue even then. The editorial refers to the Senate situation and then goes on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next important battle is to be on the Government's intention to increase the oil levy (and so the price of petrol) from January. There is some justice on the Government's side in some of these imposts-but only if they are accompanied by an appropriate alleviation for lower-income families who are already paying a far higher proportion of their incomes in taxes than the rich, particularly the rich who are outside the clutches of the PAYE taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA>I say 'Hear, hear' to that. The editorial continues:</PARA>
<PARA> That, of course, is the argument the Democrats have been hammering, and rightly so. The Treasurer, Mr Howard, himself said earlier this year-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, earlier in 1981-</PARA>
<PARA>that any increase in indirect taxes would be matched with some reduction in direct taxation-but the Government has not made good his assurance. </PARA>
<PARA>Now, of course, six or seven months later, it still has not made good its assurance. The editorial goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> A year ago, in the last week of the election campaign, the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, stated that future substantial rises in oil prices would create a top priority for tax cuts or increases in family allowances-and again the Government has not stood by his word. </PARA>
<PARA> Considerations of political advantage aside, Labor could agree wholeheartedly with the Democrats on the sales-tax issue, not because they oppose indirect taxes or more tax revenue, but because of the shabby treatment of the poor. Equally, Labor can easily agree on the oil levy, for those same reasons and also because it has a long-standing commitment to a more equitable and nationally beneficial source of revenue from oil, in its proposed resource-rent tax. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is a fact. The editorial continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Resistance to the oil levy will gain wide support, even from committed conservationists, in view of the Government's disregard for its promise, and the additional burden it is putting on many who are already having a difficult time financially. </PARA>
<PARA>We agree with that. Indeed, the Australian Labor Party has decided to sell out the Australian worker and his family, who are not able to write off high petrol costs through tax deductions, as businessmen can. It has decided also, for its own mysterious reasons-which we would dearly like to know and on which we can only speculate at this stage-to condone the absolute and cynical breach of an important election promise by this Government. As I said in the Press release which was quoted in brief by Senator Walsh:</PARA>
<PARA> In the words of George Orwell's 'Animal Farm', 'It is now not possible to distinguish between the pigs and the men'. The Labor Party and the Government now seem united in their intent to perpetuate measures in which the Government has broken its word and in effect it is no longer possible to distinguish the Labor view from the Government one. </PARA>
<PARA>This is so not only in this matter but also, I might say, in others in which the Labor Party sees possibly a sense of victory in expediency and thinks that it will with expediency buy support which will assist it in the next election.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats view with contempt the Labor Party's useless amendment to this Bill, which is a mere gush of hot air, and its subsequent failure to honour its commitments to the Australian people. It would seem that, although the Government has renounced its election promise to pass on crude oil levy increases to the people in the form of tax cuts or by increasing the family allowance and has failed to use the levy to guarantee motor spirit alternative research and development, better roads or any other useful purpose that that money could well have been spent on, ironically enough, it has the support of the Australian Labor Party. To put it briefly and to hammer the point well home- I think it is an important one that has to be made again and again-the Labor Party now supports a flat tax on all people using motor transport regardless of their ability to pay, a tax which bears most heavily of all on those people whom the Australian Labor Party pretends to represent and to protect. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Government's attitude in this matter. The Government has not a leg to stand on in this matter. It has had a significant revenue increase; it has not passed this on to the people as it promised. It, too, has used the levy as a flat tax on all Australians regardless of their ability to pay. It has not used the levy for much needed research and development of motor spirit substitutes, such as the conversion of methanol from natural gas, which is already being adopted by the New Zealand Government in its great Mauri natural gas field off the coast of the North Island at Taranaki. This process is possible. I raised in this place three years ago the fact that there was established technology at a cost, then, of $258m and a lead time of five years. We could have established two plants to get 10 per cent of our motor fuel from natural gas as a methanol additive to petrol. This works very well indeed with only minor modifications and adjustments to a car. It can be done by a mechanic in 20 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> If something had been done about it then, if the Government had decided to use some of the crude oil levy-only a tiny fraction of it-for a useful purpose like that that would be of some future assistance to the Australian people those plants would have been coming on stream in about 18 months time. They would have been a permanent and valuable local source to meet the now rapidly falling production from the Bass Strait fields. The Government has failed the Australian people dismally in that regard. The cost of that methanol, on the best figures I can get, would have been less than the landed cost of Middle East crude. This is not an airy fairy, futuristic sort of thing; it uses well established, known technology. We have enormous quantities of natural gas. There is no reason in the world why we should not provide an important bolster to our motor spirit reserves by using it in that way. Indeed, it is quite possible, as has been the case in Brazil, for cars to be designed and built which will run completely on the fuel alcohols. Although there is at present in the world an apparent glut of motor spirit and fuel oil, that is not increasing by one litre the amount of oil in the world. The crunch will come, perhaps sooner than we think. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Government may well bring forward its most respectable argument for the crude oil levy in this debate. That is the conservation argument, which the Australian Democrats respect very much, all other things being equal. I stress that-all other things being equal. We would like to see things such as methanol plants established, more fuel efficient cars encouraged and electric cars developed. Electric car technology is quite adequate for commuting in cities. There are no problems with that. Hybrid electric cars which use both petrol and electricity are being developed in a number of countries and they can be used on longer journeys as well as for city commuting. They function as an electric car for commuting in the city and can travel longer distances by the use of another engine. These things can be done in Australia. They are being done elsewhere. They are being done in Japan and in America. Of course, some work on this is going on against great odds in South Australia. We should look towards having more railways. Again, this is possibly an answer to our problem, as I will mention later. We should be improving our roads considerably. </PARA>
<PARA> All these things should have stemmed from the great opportunity given to Australia by the crude oil levy. But now the chance has been virtually lost. Every day that passes puts us further and further behind in an eventual race that we will lose if the Government goes on placing all its faith in the prospect that another major oil field may be discovered in Australia. The Australian Democrats would think that was marvellous. We would like to see it. But inquiries we have made so far indicate that the prospects are not good. Off- shore fields have a very minor oil slick on the surface that can be distinguished clearly from the computer enhanced pictures of the Landsat satellite. I have seen these pictures for the Bass Strait field. There is no indication from them of any other major off-shore fields in Australia. That is not to say that we may not find oil. Let us hope that we do. But for a government to pin all its faith on that is not only imprudent but also stupid. Even now if the Government used the levy properly much could be achieved. It could be of vital importance to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government could get to work now and see that some of the natural gas in this country is converted to methanol and that plants are commenced as soon as possible. The money is available in the crude oil levy dues. If the Government did that kind of thing, the Australian Democrats would probably take a different view of this whole situation. But we would still not forgive the Government for the breach of its election promise; that is our prime motivation. A few shots fired in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, today, next week, next month or next year could put Australia in chaos. We would be without the means to run our motor vehicles. That is the hard truth. We are more dependent on motor spirit than any other developed Western country because of the vast distances on this continent and our relative lack of railways, canal systems or other waterways of commercial importance. The Australian Democrats have put this forward time and again in this place over the years. For three years we have been urging that action on the Government. What do we have? The Government says that it is a great idea and other pious platitudes and then says that it is looking at it. This Government is one that never does anything. It looks at things all the time , contemplates its image and problems and never does anything for the Australian people. We need only to look back over the last few years. We cannot see a single achievement. Not a single thought for the future has the Government given , especially in the vital area of energy. We indict the Government for that and we implore it at this stage not to place this country in further jeopardy by its criminal lack of activity in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the truth of the conservation argument. I stress that the Democrats are very interested in the conservation of fuel. How well is it working out? The Australian Financial Review of 14 May, quite recently, states:</PARA>
<PARA> Petrol sales during the first seven months of the financial year were 2.4 per cent higher--</PARA>
<PARA>The word is higher--</PARA>
<PARA>than for the same period of the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> Figures released yesterday by the Department of National Development and Energy show the increased petrol sales, but an overall fall in consumption of petroleum products of 1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The products which recorded significant decreases were industrial and marine diesel fuel (down 25.4 per cent) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at that a little more closely. I suggest that it is not something for which the Government can praise itself; rather it is another symptom of the chronic and desperate malady which the Government's economic policies have forced Australian industry to suffer. That 25.4 per cent drop in industrial and marine diesel fuel is due to that, not to any conservational effort on the part of the Government, which is purely incidental. The article refers to fuel oil being down 13.6 per cent, and much the same thing applies there. The next item listed is heating oil, which is down 17.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been the consequence of the Government bunging up the price and reducing the demand for heating oil? It increased the demand for electricity this winter in our large cities. That increased demand is largely causing blackouts and will cause further blackouts in New South Wales and Victoria. This ill-judged price increase at a time when our other energy resources need it is causing many people to give up oil heaters and to place their reliance suddenly on electric power, and the electric power resources are not adequate to meet the demand. That, I think, is a classic example of the Government's inability to plan or even to think clearly about the energy issues in this country to which it ought to be giving some thought. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats consider that the crude oil levy and high petrol prices do not reduce demand but merely make things difficult for the ordinary people of Australia. This difficulty is not only that families have to pay more for fuel for the transport necessary to their daily lives. That is an important element that is badly affecting people who are not very well off. It is a serious matter. A young family-a man with a wife and a number of young children- has to use the car. Our society is organised that way. A wife cannot get to shopping centres and buy things unless she uses the car. Perhaps the Government feels she should trot several miles and carry bags home on foot. If that is the sort of life that the Government is planning for Australia, I think it ought to think more about that. Of course it is necessary for people to have that kind of transport. Everything has been done-the Government has connived at this and encouraged it in the past-to make a motor car orientated society, and people cannot evade that fact. Public transport systems in our society are not good enough to be an adequate replacement. But the extra fuel cost becomes more than that; it becomes a part of the extra costs of almost everything that families need and buy, and as a result it has been a powerful fuel to inflation in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats are opposing this Bill because we believe it is important that we should do so and that we should raise the issues about it which we think are so important and so basic. We think it is time the Government came clean with the Australian people about the crude oil levy. For years it has imposed this massive confidence trick on the people as an enormous flat tax. It has given lip service to energy replacement programs, motor spirit replacement and other things necessary to this country but it has done nothing effective about them. I must mention again the flipness of the arguments put forward by Senator Walsh for the Australian Labor Party. I am not blaming Senator Walsh; I know he is only doing what his masters have decreed and told him to say. Because the House of Representatives voted against it, the Labor Party in the Senate must also vote against it. The Labor Party in the Senate apparently does not have any rights of its own to think about what might be right and what might be wrong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support my friend and colleague Senator Mason very strongly in his criticism of both the Government and the Australian Labor Party in their attitudes towards the Excise Tariff (Petroleum) Amendment Bill. This legislation validates two increases in the price of petrol paid by consumers because of the Government's policy of keeping Australian oil prices in line with those of Saudi Arabia. It is commonly known as world import parity policy, under a variety of names, but it is a policy that is generally accepted by the Australian people for two reasons. One of the reasons it is accepted is that motorists-as Senator Mason said, that includes all motorists whether they are workers, pensioners, young people or wealthy people-have seen the price of petrol escalate over the past several years. One reason given, among others, is because of the Government's world import parity pricing policy. The rationale of that is something with which the Australian Democrats do not disagree; at least they do not disagree in part.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government quite properly argues that unless oil companies are forced to sell oil or petrol in Australia at world parity prices or unless oil companies can be guaranteed prices at world parity for their product, what overseas company in its right mind would come to Australia to explore for more oil? Of course none of the companies would come. They would go elsewhere where they would know that, if they discovered oil, because of the very heavy expenditure in exploration they could get a higher price for their product. The logic behind that decision is unassailable and the Democrats do not disagree with it. We agree with world import parity as far as new oil is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument to impose world import parity pricing for old oil is not quite as clear. However, there is a rationale behind it. One of the theories is that it increases the price of petrol-a scarce commodity, a disappearing resource-and the higher the price the more of a deterrent that represents to the motorist meaning that less of this precious resource he or she will use. Therefore he or she will drive a motor car more carefully or more sparingly, substitute some other fuel for petrol or buy a smaller car. Again that logic is quite reasonable although the statistics of savings, because of this device, are not terribly impressive as I understand it. There have been some savings. I would not have thought that the curve down was too steep but it is a respectable argument. </PARA>
<PARA> However there is another argument that it would be almost impossible for the Department of the Treasury or the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to resist and that is that there is a windfall revenue to government every time the price of petrol goes up because of world import parity. Money quietly, secretly and painlessly is going into Government revenue every time a motorist pulls up his or her car at a service station to fill it with petrol. That is the significance of world import parity. In light of the Bill, which represents the most flagrant breaking of a promise by a government in my time in this place, one could well ask: What is going to happen if world import parity pricing comes down or brings the price of Australian petrol down? Clearly, it is based on world import parity or in line with the price of Saudi Arabian oil. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like the Minister at the table, Senator Chaney, whom I respect in these matters, to give the House a categoric statement of Government policy on this matter because to be fair there have been confusing statements from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), from Senator Sir John Carrick and from the Treasurer, Mr Howard, on this question. It is pertinent, in arguing a Bill such as this, to ask the Government Minister at the table whether, if world import parity prices for oil come down, Australian motorists can expect a reduction in the price they will pay for petrol at the bowser in the same way they have been told by the Government that they can anticipate an increase in the price of petrol if the world import parity price goes up. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I will return to the precise subject of the Bill. On 1 July 1981 the price of oil rose from $30.23 a barrel to $30.79 a barrel. In January this year the price rose from $30.79 a barrel to $32.25 a barrel. I apologise to listeners because figures like those are very boring and meaningless, but I want to have them on the record to show that there have been significant increases in the price of oil. The word 'significant' is one to which I will return in a moment. We intend to oppose this legislation because it legitimises the breaking of a categoric election promise. It passes my comprehension why members of the Labor Party-every jack one of them-will go over to that side of the chamber to vote with the Liberal and National Country parties to support the breaking of this promise by Mr Fraser and his Government. On the eve of the 1980 Federal election , the Prime Minister said at a rally in Launceston that any significant-that word again-increases in the oil levy would be returned to the taxpayer through income tax cuts or family allowance payments. I will repeat the Prime Minister's exact words. As I understand it, they were made on 15 October, three days before the last election. At that stage the gallup polls were still showing the Labor Pary in with a chance-a good chance. I think even Senator Button, a man modest in these matters, fancied himself as being a Minister within four days-a distinguished Minister he would have made, indeed. As one of the several, desperate last minute efforts to save the Government at the election the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>If there are further significant increases--</PARA>
<PARA>There is the word 'significant' again-</PARA>
<PARA>then the first priority of the Government will be to return that to the Australian family through the taxation mechanism or through family allowances.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask people listening to the debate whether there is any explanation or translation of those words of the English language other than to assume that if there were significant increases in the price of petrol as a result of world import parity price increases those increases would be returned to the Australian family through the taxation mechanism or through family allowances. When I made a Press statement to the effect that we would hold the Government to that promise, that we would keep it honest, Mr Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA> The promise by the Prime Minister . . . last year to return all price increases to families through tax cuts or higher family allowances, was a once only offer, Mr Howard claimed yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Howard was responding to a call from the Australian Democrats Leader, Senator Chipp, for the Government to honour Mr Fraser's 1980 pre-election promise or risk Senate rejection of the new price rise. </PARA>
<PARA>This was an article in the Sydney Morning Herald. It was written by Russell Barton, one of the most honourable journalists in the place, reporting accurately what Mr Howard said and what Mr Fraser had said beforehand. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Speaking to reporters outside Parliament House yesterday, Mr Howard, said: 'I think I ought to say the comments the Prime Minister made before the last election were related to an increase due to occur in January this year, and they were not made to the generality of future (oil) levy increases.'</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Barton continued:</PARA>
<PARA> A check of Mr Fraser's comments on October 15 last year at a Launceston, Tasmania, public meeting do not show that he was limiting his remarks to the January 1980 increase. </PARA>

<PARA> . . . and condemns the Prime Minister for not honouring his election undertaking to commit any additional oil levy revenue to tax cuts and family allowances. </PARA>
<PARA>This revenue now represents a significant amount of money each year. The Treasurer and other Government speakers have tried to write down the amount collected by saying that the Government cannot really return this amount in tax cuts or increased family allowances because of strikes in Bass Strait or because production is down. I believe that that is totally irrelevant. As far as the motorist, the worker, and the pensioner who drives a motor car are concerned, it is a significant increase to have to pay 1 1/2c to 2c more a litre every time they fill their petrol tank at a service station. That is where the rub is. Those are the people to whom the promise was made. The promise was not made to oil companies. In 1981-82 the total levy raised was $3.1 billion. So we are talking about a significant amount of money that is going into government revenue. As my colleague Senator Mason said this is a perfect example of a flat tax-one that hits everybody. It hits those people who cannot afford it. In 1980- 81 that $3.1 billion represented an amazing increase of 37 per cent on the previous year. In 1981-82 the oil levy was estimated to have raised $3.4 billion -$3,400m. If that does not affect people who are driving motor cars and who do not have the discretionary dollars that wealthy people have, I would like the Australian Labor Party to tell me what does. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been invited by several interjectors to say why the Australian Labor Party has gone cold on this. I believe the answer is simple. Every public opinion poll in the country says that the Australian Labor Party will be in government within 18 months, or less if there is to be a double dissolution. The dogs are barking it. Almost every Liberal to whom I speak concedes this. No doubt able, clever people such as Mr Keating-most people in this Parliament have a high regard for his ability-see an opportunity for $3.4 billion to come into the Treasury each year painlessly, without too many Acts of Parliament required to facilitate that sort of income. This is a golden goose. It is a fantastic way for a political party contemplating government to have $3,400m coming into its coffers each year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That matter is not under discussion. This, I think, is the key to why the Australian Labor Party had suddenly gone to water. The important aspect of this matter is that this tax affects everyone. It is impossible for low income earners to escape this tax. The person who is trapped in the pay-as-you- earn system is hit the hardest. The oil levy takes up 40 per cent of the price of petrol at the retail pump. I point out to anybody listening to the broadcast of this debate who intends to fill up his or her car tomorrow, that if the price of petrol is 36c a litre, 14c of that amount goes direct to the Government. Let us look at one of these price rises. The price rise in January this year demonstrates the effect on the consumer. The increase in the levy was $1.46 a barrel, which in turn represents a retail price increase of between 1c and 2c a litre. This means that the Government will reap an extra $100m this financial year between 1 January 1982 and 30 June 1982.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has mounted an irrelevant defence to try to justify the breaking of its election promise. To say that there has been a revenue shortfall this year and thus no money is available to compensate for the hardship imposed on low income earners is nonsense. The levy has increased. People are paying more and the Government is getting more money than it would otherwise have got. Mr Howard has tried desperately to avoid this issue by saying that the Prime Minister's promise was a once only proposition applying only to January 1981. That is absurd. In no way can the Prime Minister's promise be construed to mean that. The Canberra Times, one of the nation's most objective newspapers, in an editorial on the oil levy pledge of 20 November 1981, used an apt phrase for the contortions of the Government over this issue.

He was leaving in the air the imputing of quite improper motives to the Labor Party. Let me say quite clearly--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are not improper. I say quite clearly that the only reason why the Labor Party finds itself compelled to support the Government on this matter is that it is not prepared to see $160m paid into the coffers of Esso-BHP , the Moonie oil producers-into the treasuries of private companies-rather than in those of the Treasury of Australia where it can be disposed of according to the vote of the elected representatives of the Australian people. The members of the Labor Party prefer to see this form of revenue that is paid by Australian motorists at the petrol pump every time they go to fill their tanks-whether it be for social motoring or for that necessary getting to and from work-going to the Government. As is now the case, the Australian motorists pay this money through the petrol pump attendants to the treasuries of the oil producers. We say that the Government ought to have available to it a mechanism to obtain its fair share of the revenue raised from the Australian motorist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is no use Senator Mason or Senator Chipp saying that the amendment moved by the Labor Party to the second reading motion is merely, I think he said, a wrist tapping measure. It condemns in the strongest possible terms the failure of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) yet again to keep a promise which was essential, as Senator Chipp conceded and with which we all agree, to his electoral success; namely, the promise to make available any significant increases in oil revenue for the further sustenance of Australian families either by way of increased family allowances or tax relief measures. That has not occurred. The Labor Party unreservedly condemns the fraudulent misleading of the Australian public by the Prime Minister in that regard. </PARA>

It is a flagrant breach of promise by the Prime Minister. That is not denied by the Labor Party. In fact, it is insisted upon as one of the reasons for our utter condemnation of the moral depravity politically of this Government . But, as I say, to adopt the stand of the Australian Democrats is to assist materially Esso-BHP and the other oil producers. That is the specific impact of the stand taken by the Democrats tonight. If we were to agree to vote with the Democrats tonight we would be benefiting the oil producers and not the Australian Treasury. We would be filling the coffers of company treasuries rather than those of the nation. I am quite sure that if any honourable senator were to stand at the petrol pumps as motorists came to fill their motor vehicles , having to pay the prices which they have to pay and which are not easily acceptable to them, and ask those motorists whether they would prefer to fill the coffers of Esso-BHP or to fill the coffers of the Australian Government, they would unreservedly answer unanimously: 'We would prefer to fill the coffers of the Australian Parliament'.</PARA></TALK.START>

We would like to feel that we were able to continue this debate-a most interesting one-on whether the Labor Party and the Liberal Party are justified in passing this Bill to rip off this money unjustly from the Australian people. Any red herrings, I suggest, are irrelevant to that extent. I think Senator Tate's comment was the most blatantly irrelevant comment that I have ever heard made in this place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, I am entirely in your hands as to the parameters within which I conduct myself during the second reading debate. I will, of course, observe any directions you may give me. I was trying to make the point that it is my belief that if this Bill is defeated, as the Democrats intend, $160m will remain or be available to the shareholders and employees of the oil producing companies for disposal according to their wishes. However, if the proposal put forward by the Government and supported by the Labor Party is carried the $160m will be available to the Commonwealth, to the Federal Treasury , for disposal according to the votes of the elected representatives of the Australian people. The point I was trying to make was that included amongst those objectives and matters to which the elected representatives of the Australian people can direct some or all of that $160m, is the sustenance of the States. In fact it may well be that the Prime Minister having breached his promise-we condemn him for it-to make those moneys available for the sustenance of families by way of family allowances or tax relief, having refused to earmark the money in the way he promised, this $160m will nevertheless be available for the vote of the elected representatives of the Australian people for various programs, whether they be programs of social expenditure under the control of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), or whether perhaps by way of general revenue grants to help the States discharge their programs of social expenditure and concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was making the point that when one looks at the way in which the Democrats are inviting us to vote tonight and recalls the answer given during Question Time today, one can see very plainly that the Democrats certainly have no interest in any of that $160m being devoted to the States because it is the long term objective of the Democrats that the States be abolished and be replaced, as Senator Mason said at Question Time, by something he called French departments. I would suggest that if that proposition were ever put to the Australian people by the Democrats it would be utterly rejected with a resounding-to use a French word which the English speaking Hansard reporter may take up-non. We will not allow ourselves to be diverted into the French system of government by the Australian Democrats. I do not want to labour that point. </PARA>
<PARA> My point is that this Bill, if defeated, will leave $160m in the hands of the oil producers and that shows the sort of future that the Democrats are trying to create for us. That shows the masters they ultimately serve. The Democrats ultimately serve the interests of the oil producers-those who are manipulating and using our natural resources and our wonderful Australian talents for their profits. That is the aim of the Australian Democrats in the defeat of this legislation. For Senator Chipp to express astonishment that the Labor Party should take the view that these moneys should be available for the Australian people according to our vote rather than for the shareholders and employees of the oil producing companies, to my mind shows that he has understood nothing in Australia's political life since the inception of the Labor Party. Of course that is our bias and our preference and in that respect we support the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, I could go further into the vision of Australia that the Democrats have for us. However, in view of your ruling perhaps I should not do so. However, I feel that I should take up a quotation made by Alexander Pope about the tangled web we weave which, at least, is refreshing because only on Wednesday Senator Mason was quoting a Sir Barton Pope. Another element of the future that the Democrats want for us is to condemn the urban unemployed to digging water wells in the outback. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to confine my remarks to the amendment. In doing so, I want to congratulate Senator Tate for the very able manner in which he has exploded the arguments put forward by both Senator Mason and Senator Chipp. Senator Tate hit the nail right on the head with his remarks. That was quite obvious to people listening tonight by the way that both of those honourable senators took points of order and tried to silence him. Senator Mason claimed, in speaking to the amendment that was moved by Senator Walsh, that Senator Walsh moved the amendment at his master's direction. Nothing could be further from the truth. There are no masters in the Federal parliamentary Labor Party. Every decision is arrived at either by consensus or by a majority vote. Senator Walsh is a member of the Federal parliamentary Labor Party caucus resources committee of which I happen to be a member too. Senator Tate is the secretary of that committee. This Bill was discussed in minute detail by that committee. It made a decision in relation to the attitude we would adopt in framing this amendment. The amendment was moved in the other place by Mr Keating who was ridiculed here tonight by the two Australian Democrat senators. I think that at one stage they gave him credit for being a man of great ability. They will learn that in years to come when he is the Minister for Minerals and Energy in an incoming Labor Government. Further to the Caucus resources committee discussing this Bill and proposing this amendment, as is our policy in the Labor Party, the matter went to the full Caucus where it was debated and agreed to by a unanimous vote.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It ill becomes those two Australian Democrat senators who spoke tonight to accuse Senator Walsh of doing his master's bidding and carrying out a task in this chamber which he did not want to carry out. What Senator Walsh was doing in this chamber tonight was voicing the unanimous opinion of the Federal parliamentary Labor Party. I give him credit for that. Once the Labor Party makes a decision on any legislation which comes before this Parliament it does not change its mind every five minute which is what we find the Australian Democrats doing on many occasions. This has been quite evident at our Caucus meetings when we are discussing legislation. Messages have come in from the Australian Democrats which indicate what they will be doing in relation to particular legislation. We in the Australian Labor Party have a discussion as to whether we will support the position of the Australian Democrats. We find that within five minutes another note is passed under the door which indicates that the Australian Democrats have changed their minds. This has happened on as many as four occasions in relation to one particular matter being discussed by Caucus . That is the way in which the Australian Democrats operate. The amendment moved by Senator Walsh on behalf of the Opposition stated:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate notes that any defeat of the measure would require the Commonwealth to forgo approximately $160 million this financial year to the Australian oil producers, and condemns the Prime Minister for not honouring his election undertaking to commit any additional oil levy revenue to tax cuts and family allowances'. </PARA>
<PARA>What could be more clear than that? How could it be more clearly explained than it was by Senator Tate just a few moments ago? Senator Tate pointed out what the Democrats would achieve if we were to join with them and oppose this legislation ; we would be giving to the oil companies on a plate an amount of $160m. Of course, Senator Chipp tried to circumvent the whole debate by bringing forward a specious argument and saying how nice it would look on television if we saw the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in front of the cameras presenting a cheque for $160m to the oil companies. Nothing like that was said. It is only a figment of Senator Chipp's imagination. </PARA>
<PARA> If this legislation were defeated tonight the oil companies would be let off the hook for approximately $160m. The Labor Party has been consistent since the promises made by the Prime Minister (Mr Fraser)-the amendment spells out his promise to do certain things-in arguing for a reduction in income tax. If we were to join with the Democrats to defeat this Bill tonight we could imagine what the Government would say tomorrow. It would say that the Labor Party was not consistent in its argument for a reduction in income tax because it prevented the Government from raising $160m which it might use-I emphasise the word 'might'-to reduce income tax. I do not think the Government will reduce income tax. But it would use that argument against the Labor Party. Members of the Labor Party are not fools. We sit down and deliberate on all the legislation which comes before this Parliament. We do not make up our minds one minute about what we will do and, because we get some pressures from outside-as apparently the Democrats do-then change our minds and try to run with the hare and hunt with the hound. We do not do that. We have a policy and we are proud to stick by it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats might be fooling some of the people who are listening in tonight by getting up here, as Senator Mason and Senator Chipp have done, and saying: ' Family allowances will not be increased and taxation will not be reduced because the Labor Party is going to support this Bill'. We are quite convinced that we are doing the right thing on this occasion. Senator Chipp then went on to say that he would introduce a Bill tomorrow to do certain things. But, of course, he did not stop to think before he made the statement. The Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button) quickly reminded him that he would not be here to introduce the Bill. Of course, if he is not here to introduce the Bill it will not be passed because the Democrats will not have the numbers. Quite obviously, Senator Chipp does not have the Bill printed and ready to introduce. Otherwise, he would have sought leave of the Senate today to introduce the Bill tomorrow. Of course, that is just a red herring thrown across the trail. It is a throw-away. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could not understand the contribution by Senator McLaren to the debate on the Excise Tariff (Petroleum) Amendment Bill 1982. The only thing that has emerged from his contribution is that at least there is one honourable senator in this chamber who does not have a guernsey for the new Ministry in the forthcoming Australian Labor Party government as is being stated by the Opposition. That person is Senator Walsh. Apparently there is some good news after all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are debating the Excise Tariff (Petroleum) Amendment Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921, to enact excise tariff alterations made by Excise Tariff Proposals No. 3 of 1981 and No. 1 of 1982. These measures in effect validate increases in the oil levy. It is necessary to understand the procedure so that one can then determine whether one votes for the proposition or whether one votes against it. The oil levy is imposed and increased by excise tariff Acts. These Acts, of course, impose taxation and are therefore not subject to alteration or amendment by the Senate. Before any increase in the levy comes into effect, an excise tariff proposal is presented to the House of Representatives. This proposal may be debated. Under the provisions of the Excise Act, the collection of the levy cannot be called into question within one year of the commencement of the increase in the levy. Before the period of one year has elapsed after the commencement of the increase in the levy, an excise tariff Bill, such as we are discussing here tonight, to validate the collection of the levy is introduced. If such a Bill is not passed within the period of one year after the commencement of the increase in the levy, the levy would have been illegally collected. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the situation with which we are faced tonight. Faced with this situation, it has been put by the Opposition that, if we do not adopt this legislation this evening or tomorrow before we rise for the winter recess, the levy will have been illegally collected. The Opposition states that legally the money collected would have to be handed back to the oil producers. A question has arisen as to how this would be done. Quite obviously, the oil producers would not let it lie there. They are quite competent in getting their hands on money and there are ways and means of doing this, including court action. I see no reason to support the abandonment of this legislation. That would open the way for the oil producers to get their hands on money that is now in the hands of the Treasury and which could be used for disbursements at the will of the elected representatives of the people. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a great deal of sympathy for much of what Senator Mason had to say in leading for the Australian Democrats on this matter. He and others have referred to the promise made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in Launceston two days before the 1980 general election. Let me remind the Senate that I am very well aware of the atmosphere in which this election promise was given in Launceston, in Tasmania. Of course, the atmosphere in that State had been engendered with an expectation that something would be promised by the Government for families. Indeed, 22,000 electors in Tasmania signed a petition seeking increases in family allowances and increased support for the family. The Prime Minister was very well aware of that. He was also aware of a continuing campaign on the mainland which coincided with the collection of those signatures . Immediately after the election I was one of the first to start belting the Government over the head with that election promise. But never did I tie what ought to be done with the family allowance or taxation to what might be in the barrel or in the pool of increased oil levies because to do so would be to tread a path in history which had been found to be wanting. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate of the fact that the old child endowment scheme was in fact tied to payroll tax. This system was used in New South Wales when it had its own child endowment scheme. When the Commonwealth Government introduced the child endowment scheme in 1941 it was linked to payroll tax. The Commonwealth scheme involved two-thirds of the cost of the scheme being borne by employers. However, in 1945 constitutional problems were overcome by making child endowment a charge upon the national welfare fund, which in turn was credited with the payroll tax receipts. The nexus existed between 1941 and 1952 but the rate of increase in child endowment for that period was very slow. For example, the rate was 5s to 7s 6d a week in 1945, 7s 6d to 10s a week in 1948 and 5s a week for the first child in 1950. Furthermore, in the period while the nexus existed the desired two-thirds from the employers exceeded that figure in five of the seven years. For example, in 1948-49 receipts from employers represented 81.4 per cent of the total child endowment payments. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought I should mention that point to the Senate as a matter of historical record. That is the reason I deliberately eschewed adopting a policy of tying increases in family allowance payments or decreases in taxes to whatever happens to come out of the barrel. The problem which we face here tonight is this: Do we allow the validation of the increases in the oil levy or do we deny the Treasury that amount of money that it has already collected? My view is that we should adopt the proposition put forward by the Opposition, which condemns the Government for not passing on the increases as promised but enables the Senate to do what it did last week; that is, to adopt the stance that we ought to restore the family allowance to its 1976 value and to index it. </PARA>
<PARA> If we tie such increases to increased oil levies there will not be sufficient money in the extra oil levy to make the increases. Tying our policy of increasing the family allowance or reducing taxes to whatever comes out of the oil levy will not in fact satisfy the requirement of the motion I moved last week in the Senate, which was adopted by a majority of the Senate; that is that the family allowance should be restored to its 1976 value and that it should be indexed. That would require and should obtain not only increases in the oil levy but also extra money, as a matter of justice. In my view it is not a wise move to tie a matter of right to what might happen to be in a particular pool which might be affected from time to time by weather, industrial problems and prices of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the amendment moved by the Opposition and ask the Senate to do the same. I clearly understand the situation of the Australian Democrats. I hope that they also understand my position on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak very briefly. I wish to raise only one salient point. If the Excise Tariff (Petroleum) Amendment Bill 1982 is passed by the Senate tonight it will validate an increase of 1.15c a litre in the price of petrol. That is not a small amount of money. It represents conservatively $1m a week in revenue to the Government. This Bill validates an increase in a tax on the Australian motorist of $1m a week. We say that the Government is doing this in blatant disregard of an election promise that any increase in the oil price levy would be returned to the people. Clearly the Government has not done that. We have record taxes, there is no suggestion of lowering taxes, and the money is not going back to the people. Therefore, we say that this validating legislation should not be passed by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Tate, for whom I have the utmost admiration, raised a complete irrelevancy when he said that $1m a week will be returned to the oil companies- this is essentially what he was saying-if this legislation is not passed by the Senate. It is hot air; I can think of no other expression. There are many simple ways that the Government has open to it to ensure that that money does not finish up in the hands of the oil companies. Senator Tate raised an irrelevancy. The essential point before us tonight is whether we are going to allow the Government to take from the Australian motorist an additional $1m a week in blatant disregard of an election promise. That is the issue, and the only issue, before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to my feet almost in disbelief as the protraction of the debate has been so considerable. I have listened with great interest to an extremely discursive debate on a Bill which, I understand, has the support of the majority of honourable senators, although the qualified support of the members of the official Opposition. There has been an air of unreality floating over part of the debate. I think that unreality is best typified by referring to a sentence from Senator Siddons. He put the proposition that money is being collected by the oil levy but is not going back to the people. I would like to know whom it is going to. The fact of the matter is that this Government is still raising less in taxation than it is spending. The Government is still in deficit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My Department, which is the largest spending department of state, will this year spend more than $10 billion not of its money but of the taxpayers' money. That will be drawn from the amalgam of taxes, be they indirect taxes such as the oil levy, and from the considerable income taxes which are imposed on the Australian people. All of that money is dispersed by the government to the Australian people. There may be differences between us about the emphasis of some of that spending. Some honourable senators opposite would tell us that we should be spending more. It is totally unreal to suggest that the oil revenue money is going elsewhere than to the Australian people. A large proportion of our expenditure goes to the people via the States. A large proportion goes directly in the form of pensions, benefits and so on. Of course, it is absurd to suggest that any of the money raised by government is other than money expended for the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot comment in detail-I do not think the Senate would want me to comment in full detail-on all the speeches made by honourable senators on the subject. I must touch on some. I thank Senator Harradine, for example, for what was a very accurate, or very close to accurate, explanation of how this whole system works. I will not repeat that. He recently put it before us. He explained why this Bill is needed and the techniques that followed. I have to say his speech was a little churlish. For example, he thought Senator McLaren said nothing. I thought there were three significant revelations in Senator McLaren's speech. For example, Senator McLaren confessed that he is a member of the Australian Labor Party, which is something some of us have never been quite sure about. He also explained the working of the Caucus system. Some of us have not understood that when honourable senators opposite go into that Caucus room they all come out singing the same song. I am always pleased to note that the public is being enlightened on these mysteries about the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLaren also most amazingly expressed the view that members of the Australian Labor Party are not fools. Mr Deputy President, I was pleased to hear that as I am sure you are too. I hope a significant minority of the Australian people will accept Senator McLaren as being truthful on that score. On the other hand, I thought Senator McLaren fell into a hole. He suggested that if the Australian Labor Party did not defend this Bill the Opposition would be accused of not being consistent. I suggest that consistency has not been a curse that has afflicted the Labor Party particularly in these matters. The Australian Labor Party has cheerfully knocked off some indirect taxes in conjunction with the Australian Democrats. It has cheerfully reduced the revenue raising capacity of the Government through indirect taxes; it cheerfully advocates that we should reduce income taxes and it cheerfully advocates that we should increase expenditure. It makes no mention of the level of the deficit or the effect of this on interest rates. I do not regard consistency as a particular malady in this chamber or a particular virtue embraced by many. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to mention other matters raised in the debate. Senator Chipp addressed a serious inquiry. I will say something else about Senator Chipp's speech in a moment but he addressed a serious request to me and demanded an answer. He asked: 'What if the price drops?' I am not the Minister for National Development and Energy but I can quote a statement of the Minister which I think covers the point quite satisfactorily. In the Senate Hansard of 11 March 1982 Senator Sir John Carrick is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> I have said repeatedly that we have an import parity pricing device, that we are geared to the benchmark price of Saudi Arabian light market crude and that our practice has been on 1 July and 1 January to look at what has happened to that benchmark and to make adjustments in terms of the price and the exchange rate. That in fact has been the pattern, and we have in the past moved downwards as well as upwards. That remains our policy. </PARA>
<PARA>On 22 March the Treasurer (Mr Howard) issued a statement which was in similar terms. In fact it referred to that statement by Senator Sir John Carrick. The statement finished with the sentence:</PARA>
<PARA> That in fact has been the pattern, and the Australian price has in the past moved downwards as well as upwards. </PARA>
<PARA>I quote those statements as reflecting the attitude of senior Government Ministers to policy in this area. I thought the most revealing part of this debate came in the remarks of Senator Chipp. I like to think of Senator Chipp really as the emperor of the Australian Democrats. He stood in his place, pointed the accusing finger and said to the Australian Labor Party: 'I know why you are supporting this. You think you might be in government'. I think that was a very interesting statement, not so much about the Australian Labor Party, which indeed might think it might be in government; but about the Australian Democrats, who know they never will be. It reflects a freedom to adopt positions which are unreal. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that as the emperor lifted his finger and accused the Australian Labor Party his toga fell off and he stood before us exposed. The feature of the Democrats' position on this Bill and in particular the speech of Senator Mason was their unreality-the total lack of concern about where the money would come from, the usual freedom to say that we should spend on things and the lack of concern about where the money would be raised. Quite frankly, I am glad that we have had this debate, long as it has been, because I do not believe that we can consistently expect the Australian people to tolerate a situation in which a political party so happily embraces every easy option and yet holds itself out seriously as a candidate for office. I think that the debate has exposed a very weak position on the part of the Democrats and for that reason I welcome their contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted the concern that Senator Chipp expressed about import parity pricing. I would have thought that there was the broadest acceptance in the Australian community that that was a policy which had served this country well. I am surprised that Senator Chipp is unaware of the effects that that policy has contributed to the usage of petroleum products. It is a well known fact that the usage of petroleum products for fixed applications has dropped very sharply. The available competitive fuels are such that there has been a very significant decline of the use of the heavier oil products. That is a very significant plus for Australia and it is something which I think we can attribute in part to the import parity pricing policy. </PARA>

I was not talking about petrol. I think honourable senators opposite would confirm what I was talking about.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am trying to speak plainly, using the language that I understand we all use in this place. I said that the use of petrol products has either stabilised or, in some cases, declined slightly. I think the sort of percentage figures which are raised by interjection are correct, but that is as against the situation which applied in earlier years where there was a consistent increase year by year in the use of those products. So there has been a significant impact. I thought it was interesting that Senator Chipp conceded that, with respect to new oil, there were good reasons for adopting a policy of world pricing. One reason was that it would attract exploration. There were various reasons why he said he supported it. I would ask the Democrats to ponder upon the extraordinarily complex marketing situation one would have to have if one were trying to impose a situation where Australian producers were expected to sell old oil at some reduced, artificially held down, rate while they were permitted to sell new oil at a world rate. My advisers suggest that it is possible. My reaction was that it would be impossible. But it would certainly require a most complex system of regulation to achieve that result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one could not achieve that result, if in fact we were permitting part of our oil, our imports and our new oil to be sold at the world price, there would be huge market pressures for the producers to be able to sell all oil at that price . If we did away with the policy we have of collecting that additional price by excise we would be giving all that new money to the oil producers instead of to the Australian people who, at the moment, get it through that tax system. I do not as part of this debate make any apology for what I think has been one of the premier successes of this Government, that is, its oil parity pricing policy. I believe that Senator Sir John Carrick has served this country well in his promotion of this policy and gaining the wide acceptance for it which has been gained. </PARA>
<PARA> I really suggest that the opposition to this Bill and the terms in which it has been expressed have been insufficiently thought through and have represented an easy and potentially popular option for those who have sought to embrace it. A serious question has been raised as to whether there has been a breach of faith in the measure which is before us and in the fact that certain statements were made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcom Fraser) in Launceston in October 1980. There have been slight differences between the quotations which have been read tonight and the quotations which are available to me because all of us are relying upon transcripts or media reports. The media report which I have in front of me is illustrative of the point that I basically would want to make about what was said in October 1980. The report is from the Herald in Melbourne and is headed: 'PM: Tax cut if oil jumps'. It reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government would return any oil levy revenue from big rises in petrol prices next year to taxpayers through tax cuts or increased family allowances, the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, said today. </PARA>
<PARA> 'If there is significant increase in revenue from the levy, this will be returned to Australian families through taxation reductions or family allowances ', he said. </PARA>
<PARA>Then there are quotes from Mr Hayden who said it was all blah. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fraser, speaking in Launceston said: 'The price rises that would be likely from January 1 following the recent OPEC rises would be less than 1 cent a litre , so the additional revenue for that is pretty minimal'. </PARA>
<PARA>His contemporaneous description, according to the Herald is: 'That is pretty minimal'. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> 'But if there were significantly greater increases in the OPEC price we will act as we did last year . . . </PARA>
<PARA> 'When the Treasurer, John Howard, announced we would give priority to personal tax cuts if there were additional oil revenues, and that is what we did.'</PARA>
<PARA>Since that time there has been controversy about what was meant. I think during the debate statements made both by Mr Howard and by the Prime Minister have been quoted. I have a transcript from an interview dated 11 November 1981 where Mr Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA> I think I ought to say that the comments the Prime Minister made before the last election were related to an increase that was due to occur in January of this year and was not a statement made as to the generality of future levy increases. </PARA>
<PARA>To my mind that is quite consistent with what is reported in the Herald in October 1980. In November 1981, at about the same time, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The remarks that John Howard and I were using were directed specifically at the allegations at the time that there would be very significant increases in January of this particular year-the January that has passed.'</PARA>
<PARA>One can argue about the words used, the semantics and so on. The Government has been on the record now for a considerable period as saying that it was referring to the very real figures which were around in 1980, that there would be continuing, rapid escalation of oil prices on the international sphere. It is history that that has not occurred. Oil prices have substantially stabilised and the price rises to which we have been subjected over the last year and a half are in no way in the same order as the price rises to which we were subjected in previous years. But let us look anyway at the record. Supposing we accepted the argument of the Australian Democrats, which is supported by the Australian Labor Party in its opposition, that there has been a promise which indicates that the Commonwealth should be delivering on tax cuts and the family allowance? Let us look at the position since October 1980. Since that time there has been half indexation of tax rate scale at a cost of $495m to June 1982. In other words, we had another step towards half indexation. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Mason" NAMEID="YJ7">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Another promise.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have said previously that I like people who listen with their mouths and not their ears because it means that they do not bother to try to understand what is being said. The point which I am trying to make is that there have been tax reductions since that promise was made. I simply wish to list those reductions. There has been half tax indexation, which has represented a saving of $495m to June 1982. Last year we announced that there would be a rebate for health insurance at an annual cost of $600m each year. Those announcements have been made. There have been tax reductions which of course are very much in excess of any benefit from the additional oil revenue. The family allowance changes represent a cost to revenue of $60m. The Australian Democrats have said that there have been no changes to the family allowance. Of course there were adjustments to the family allowance in the last Budget which cost $ 60m in the current financial year. The full year cost will be $120m. Two lots of tax cuts and one family allowance adjustment can be pointed to since October 1980. The estimate of additional revenue, given to me by my advisers and which is accounted for by increases in the rate of levy since October 1980 is $318m. So if we were in the equity lawyer's business of trying to say exactly what was meant and were asking whether there had been increases in the oil levy, tax cuts and increases in family allowances, I would say to honourable senators that the balance sheet is in favour of the Government. There have been substantially greater tax reductions and payments of family allowances in total than there have been increases accruing to the Government from the crude oil levy because of increases in rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Needless to say, the Government rejects the amendment which was moved by Senator Walsh and it asks the Senate to support this legislation. I believe that any fair thinking Australian looking at the operation of oil parity pricing in this country would say that it has been a benign policy for this country; it has served us well. This annual step in regularising the arrangement which has been in place for so many years is a step which such fair thinking Australians would expect us to take, I think, with a little less fuss and bother than has in fact been displayed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Fertilizers (Subsidy) Amendment Bill seeks to extend for three years a subsidy of $12 a tonne on phosphatic fertilisers-that is, $12 on phosphorous pentoxide-and $20 a tonne on nitrogenous fertilisers with the nitrogen expressed as n. The Bill originally introduced into the House of Representatives was a Bill to pay a bounty to Australian producers. But, as amended in the House of Representatives, the Bill now seeks to pay a subsidy-that is, a payment which will be available to domestic producers and to importers of fertiliser. The significance of that change will become apparent later in my speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This whole question of fertiliser subsidies and bounties, especially the superphosphate bounty, has been a sacred cow in Australian agriculture for some time. It has preoccupied the thoughts of many people associated with agriculture and, unfortunately, diverted their attention from more constructive thinking. It is apparent that the Government, recognising the sacred cow status of this measure, is not willing to terminate it but is quite happy to let inflation erode its value. The rate of subsidy for phosphatic fertiliser has not been changed since 1969 and therefore two-thirds of its value has been eroded. The rate of subsidy for nitrogenous fertiliser has been progressively reduced over the same period, even in money terms, from $80 to $20 and therefore its real value now stands at one-twelfth of what it was in 1969. So, regardless of all the rhetoric we heard from particularly the National Country Party in the mid- 1970s, it is quite clear that the Government is happy to see the real value and significance of both of these subsidies or bounties eroded by inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the National Country Party, Mr Sinclair, recently lamented what he claimed to be a deficiency with the Australian communications system- that is, that the Government did not get the opportunity properly to explain its policies. I invite Mr Sinclair or any other member of the Government to explain why the Government has proceeded with this measure. According to evidence given before an Industries Assistance Commission inquiry by the Department of Agriculture of Western Australia, which is the heaviest fertiliser using State, the Department of Agriculture of Victoria and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, consumption of phosphatic fertiliser, which is the main measure we are talking about, will not be affected by price changes within a limit of about $20 a tonne above or below its existing level.</PARA>
<PARA> In economists' jargon, consumption is totally price inelastic, according to the submissions put forward by these bodies. If that is so, and I leave aside the very limited possible income effect on consumption, this measure will have no effect on the consumption of phosphatic fertiliser. Therefore, inevitably it will have no effect on resource allocation or efficiency. Its effect will be simply to transfer income from taxpayers to overwhelmingly the largest and highest income farmers. The question I put to the Government, and I invite Mr Sinclair or anyone else to explain, is whether the Government rejects that technical and economic assessment by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and by two State departments of agriculture which was not contradicted by any other public body. If the Government does not rejects that assessment, will it explain why it supports the type of income transfer which I have outlined? There is no alternative. Either the Government is rejecting the technical economic assessment of those bodies or it is proposing to the Parliament that it should pass a measure, the only effect of which is to transfer about $50m from taxpayers to farmers far more than proportionately to the highest income farmers . </PARA>
<PARA> The measure also demonstrates another serious inconsistency carried to the point of absurdity in the Government's policies even within the agricultural sector. Whilst it is willing to transfer $50m for such fragile reasons as have been advanced, it has refused-it has jacked up on, I might say-requests from the wheat industry to match a higher contribution from grain growers for industry research. The grain growers have offered to lift the levy which they themselves now pay in the expectation that that levy will be matched, as it has been in the past, dollar for dollar from public revenue. The Government has resisted the wheat growers attempts to increase both their levy and the matching government contributions in order to make more funds available for grain industry research. Whilst it is impossible to prove, there would be little dispute in informed quarters that increased expenditure on research in the grain industry would be likely to yield high dividends. On the evidence available there is no reason to believe that the $50m expended in these fertiliser bounties would yield any dividends at all. The increase involved for the Government for wheat research is about $1m. </PARA>
<PARA> The difference between a bounty, which these measures have traditionally paid, and a subsidy is this: A subsidy affects prices paid by consumers for both domestic production and imports whereas a bounty paid to local producers affects only the prices paid for local production. In other words, a bounty affects the relative prices of both imports and local production. It has the potential, since it affects the relative prices of imports and domestic production, to be a protective device. The degree to which it would be a protective device is limited, first by the relative smallness of the proposed bounty or subsidy and, secondly, because imports and local production are not directly substitutable for a variety of both cost and technical reasons. The present bounty is now being used to some extent as a protective device, but that has not always been the case. It becomes, to some extent, a protective device when market prices for domestic production are above market prices for imports. That is the situation that prevails now. World prices, however, are notoriously unstable. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a table which the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) has agreed may be incorporated in Hansard. Perhaps I should add that the price of fertiliser in different parts of Australia varies to some extent and therefore these figures will not be accurate in all circumstances. The degree to which they deviate from complete accuracy will not be significant. This table shows that the free on board cost of imports of a triple superphosphate in 1975 was $ 214 a tonne and the price of the local production was $134 a tonne. The f.o.b. price of single superphosphate was $118 a tonne and the price of local production was $56 a tonne-less than half. I might add that a single superphosphate is unlikely to be imported in significant quantities. On the other hand in 1982 to the f.o.b. price of triple superphosphate of about $135 a tonne should be added a freight handling charge of about $28 a tonne giving a total price somewhat in excess of $160 a tonne landed in Australia as against a price of $253 a tonne for domestic production. In other words, domestic production is some 50 per cent above import parity price right now. I seek leave to incorporate the table in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The table shows more comprehensively than I have done orally that over the long term Australian prices have been competitive with import prices-in both cases unsubsidised market prices. This industry should not be regarded as analgous to the textiles, clothing and footwear industry or the motor vehicle industry which have required over the long term very high levels of protection to remain competitive with imports. I apologise for not having a comparable table available for nitrogenous or compound fertilisers, that is, fertilisers which include more than one active constituent. The price variations which are shown in that phosphatic fertiliser table are shown to a substantial degree in the prices for nitrogenous and compound fertilisers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If domestic production and imports were perfect substitutes, which they are not , at a time when imports are cheaper-given that Australian is a residual market, changes in the quantity imported into Australia would not have a significant effect on world prices-then the local industry would close down completely. If that should happen, when import prices subsequently increase, Australian farmers would then pay the higher world prices. Over the last 20 years, if that situation had applied, if Australian farmers had been paying world prices, they would have paid on average about the same as they have, in fact, paid. There may be some merit in the argument that over the long term Australian market prices, even without bounty or subsidy, have been below import parity prices. Even if that is equal it could still be rationally argued that there is some justification for devices which maintain Australia's productive capacity because prices which are stable but equal on average are to be preferred to prices which are equal but unstable. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, a situation of perfect substitution does not apply. Even if it did, there would still be some validity in protecting in some form the local industry , even possibly from the farmers viewpoint because of the relative stability of prices which the local industry can maintain and because protection of an industry through a period of depressed world prices maintains its capacity to supply the domestic market for that period. If history is any guide-there are other reasons for believing this-that period will recur when world prices are substantially above domestic prices. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the position from the farmers' viewpoint. From a general viewpoint, even if at all times the industry fully utilised the potential for protection provided by a bounty of this magnitude, the level of protection would still be light by standards of Australian manufacturing industries. In the case of phosphatic fertilisers it would be of the order of 10 per cent and for nitrogenous fertilisers of the order of 5 per cent. Apart from the effect on the mainland based manufacturers, any significant decline in Australian fertiliser manufacture would have serious implications for the mining operation on Christmas Island, an Australian territory mined by a publicly owned company. If that operation were to close down, there is no serious doubt that at some time in the future the phosphate ore which is available there-at least 8 million tonnes of it-would again be price competitive. But if it were closed down now, it would be very much more expensive to re-open the mining operation and to get a population back on the island at the time when the ore became price competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> It is correct that there may be better protective devices other than a bounty- such as anti-dumping duties-to provide whatever degree of protection is decided may be justified for domestic industry. But some people might say that this Government could not be trusted to act promptly or sensibly if that tool were relied upon. I turn to the lobbying in the debate over the last couple of weeks on this issue. It is a long time since so much humbug and ignorance have been displayed by people who have been lobbying members of the Senate. This has come especially from the lobbyists who have been presenting or misrepresenting the case for a bounty, particularly on behalf of local manufacturers. I will say more about that later. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other side, the National Farmers Federation claims to be presenting a pure economic rationalist line. This raises the question: At what point does it start to be rational? The NFF starts being rational after the decision to interfere in fertiliser prices has been made and then says that those funds should always go to consumers by way of a subsidy instead of the possibility of their being distributed between consumer and producers by way of a bounty. The NFF has presented very few valid arguments to support that assertion. But it has effectively demolished much of the nonsense which has been presented by the other side. The NFF completely ignores the rationality of the original decision to interfere in market prices. It applies pure economic rationality at a point which is convenient to the case which it chooses to present whereas if pure economic rationality were applied at one stage further back, such questions as I posed earlier would have to be answered. Is the technical advice of the two departments responsible for agriculture and the BAE rejected by the Government? If that technical advice is not rejected by the Government and is accepted as correct, this proposed subsidy will transfer $50m from taxpayers to farmers, and mostly high income farmers. So we are out of the area of pure economic rationality and into the area of value judgments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, you would do that only if you were applying the same pure economic rationality to other fields, would you not? If you want to take a pure economic rationalist approach you would want to do that across the board and not merely with respect to this--</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point is that according to the technical evidence price changes of the magnitude which this Bill makes possible will have no effect on consumption and, therefore, no effect on resource allocation other than a limited income effect which I do not have time to explain. In other words, economic rationality is a selective tool. The true economic rationalist, however -I think this is the point Senator Chaney was trying to make by way of interjection earlier-especially given that certain realities already exist, might say that there is a case for protecting local manufacturers, whereas the case for transferring $50m from taxpayers disproportionately to higher income farmers, apart from moving out of the realm of economic rationality into the area of value judgment is, I suggest, weak to non-existent on either ground. In other words, the case for the bounty, on grounds of economic rationality or on income distribution, provided one leans towards progressive income distribution, is stronger than the case for the original price intervention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We will therefore move amendments in the Committee stage the effect of which will be to restore the Bill to what it was when first introduced in the House of Representatives and analogous to those which have preceded it. An additional reason-I do not make too much of this point- for favouring a bounty over a subsidy is that it is administratively simpler. In case it is argued that the present generally depressed level of farm incomes is a case for paying a subsidy , I think it should be said that it would be difficult to conceive-it is a fact that farm incomes are low at the moment-a more inefficient means of coping with a farm welfare problem than the payment of a subsidy on this or, probably, any other input. </PARA>
<PARA> The NFF case presented to me and, I think, to all other senators, made valid criticisms of the case presented for the fertiliser manufacturers and particularly of the case presented on behalf of the fertiliser manufacturers by Eric White Associates Pty Ltd. Indeed it would be hard not to make valid criticisms of that case. The submission from Whites incorporates so much sloppy thinking and ignorance that it insults the intelligence of the honourable senators to whom it was addressed-regrettably an insult perhaps justified to some degree by previous senatorial decisions. Whites say that a subsidy-I use that word advisedly in the context in which it is used here as distinct from a bounty-would transfer money from Australian taxpayers to foreign producers of fertilisers and destroy the local industry. If, as Whites suggest, the subsidy were completely appropriated by foreigners, it would have no effect on the relative prices of imports and domestic production. It would therefore have no effect on the relative market shares or on the output of the Australian industry . </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, we cannot have it both ways. It is possible, although I suggest highly unlikely, that the subsidy would be appropriated by foreign manufacturers . But if it is to be appropriated by foreign manufacturers it will not have any effect on the output of the local industry. Of course, under any circumstances it is absurd to suggest that price differentials-even of the present quite considerable level-would destroy the local industry in the way that Eric White's submission suggests because products in the domestic industry imports are not perfectly substitutable, for a variety of technical and economical reasons which again I do not have time to explain. It is true that the degree to which a subsidy is not appropriated by foreign suppliers will affect relative prices and will cause some shift towards imports and, therefore, some reduction in the output of local industry and ultimately of its capacity to produce. That would be in the short term good for farmers or other consumers. For the reasons stated , in the long term it would be highly questionable whether phasing out of any part of the local industry's productive capacity would be good for farmers. The White submission hit a nadir of credibility on page 20 when under the emotive heading 'Australia could become Subject to Foreign Cartels' it asserted:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . devaluation of the Australian dollar, has made imports of fertilizers from the United States more competitive . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The truth, of course, is the reverse. It is sad that gullible clients have paid good money to lobbyists to produce such palpable nonsense. Apparently some people believe that if the amendments to change the Fertilizers (Subsidy) Amendment Bill 1982 back to a bounty Bill, as distinct from a subsidy Bill, are not carried local suppliers would be better off if the third reading motion were defeated-in other words, if the legislation lapsed entirely. They are mistaken. If the third reading is defeated local suppliers will face world prices just as they would if the Bill is carried in the form in which the Government has presented it, albeit prices to consumers would be at slightly higher levels than if the Bill in its present form is carried. The competitive position of the Australian manufacturer vis-a-vis the foreign supplier will be identical if the Bill is defeated or if it is carried in the form in which the Government has introduced it to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one more fallacy that I need to demolish and which I have just got time to deal with. Some people believe that if the amendments are carried, and given that the House of Representatives is not sitting, no bounty would be paid after the end of June. In a sense that is correct because under the existing legislation, which authorises the payment of the bounty, no bounty or subsidy would be payable after the end of June. It is partially correct then that the existing legislation does expire at the end of June but the situation can be remedied if the Government wishes. All that would be required if the Senate accepts the amendments which I will move-it looks as though it will be tomorrow and not today-is a simple statement from the Government that it will accept the amendments carried by the Senate when the House of Representatives next sits in August and that the bounty will be paid retrospectively from 1 July this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Fertilizers ( Subsidy) Amendment Bill 1982 which will extend the bounty on phosphate nitrogenous fertilisers from 30 June this year to 30 June 1985. It will also extend the subsidy to imported fertilisers at the same rate as the subsidy on the local product. However, in supporting this legislation I should not like to be cast in the role of an advocate of protectionism but rather as a pragmatist who recognises that this is a short term solution to a problem which will eventually require much more drastic measures. In 1979-80 the Industries Assistance Commission noted that the respective values of the phosphate nitrogenous fertiliser bounties were $51m and $7m or a total of $58m in that year. It is worth noting that in the previous two financial years the values of the same subsidies were $56m and $55m respectively. In other words, while we are considering whether to extend the life of these two bounties or subsidies-as they now should properly be termed-with the inclusion of imported fertilisers it should be remembered that the real value of these subsidies has been decreased in real terms to a rate approximating the level of inflation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1968-69, when the price of bulk superphosphate was $26.62 a tonne, the superphosphate bounty was paid at $7.87 a tonne, or about 30 per cent of the value of the product. In 1980-81, when the price of superphosphate was $97.30 a tonne, the level of assistance was only $12 a tonne, or about 12 per cent of the value of the product. Over the same period the value of the bounty on nitrogenous fertilisers diminished even more dramatically, from 30 per cent to approximately 6 per cent from the beginning of the period to the end of that period. Again, over the same period the value of exports from the primary sector rose from $1.9 billion to approximately $8.5 billion in current dollar terms. Indeed, in 1979-80 the revenue from primary exports was only $134m less than the combined export value of the manufacturing and mining sectors. Primary industry exports accounted for something like 46 per cent of the total export revenue of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> While we are measuring the contribution of the primary sector to Australian exports I hardly need to remind honourable senators that it was only 25 years ago that the primary industry sector was contributing in excess of 85 per cent of all our export earnings. Having said that, I do not suggest that the fertiliser subsidies which are the subject of this debate are simply some sort of repayment of a debt of gratitude or appreciation by the taxpayers for the contribution that the primary sector has made in the past. Frankly, under the present economic circumstances the subsidy is a form of assistance which is vital to the agricultural community. The important factor to consider is the proportion of overall costs which the cost of fertiliser represents to the farmer. According to the Western Australian Department of Agriculture, on all Australian farms fertiliser accounted for, on average, between 7 and 9 per cent of overall costs between 1972-73 and 1977-78. For all Australian vegetable producers the cost of fertiliser fell in the range of, on average, between 8 and 12 per cent of overall costs; for cereal producers the average cost represented 12 per cent and for dairy farmers it represented between 6 and 12 per cent of the overall costs. </PARA>
<PARA> In my State of Western Australia the situation is even more significant. In Western Australia the use of fertiliser for each hectare is the highest in Australia. Moreover, is it worth noting at this point that virtually all the fertiliser is used in the south-west land division of Western Australia. This is an area in which almost all the wheat of Western Australia is grown. The area accounts for 99.8 per cent of all dairy cattle, 51.8 per cent of cattle for meat production and 93.3 per cent of sheep in Western Australia. The use of fertiliser in the south-west land division follows some very interesting trends but the most important is the gradual substitution of superphosphate for crops. Between 38 and 48 per cent of superphosphate was used for crops in the period 1973 and 1979, while between 66 and 86 per cent of other artificial fertilisers were used for cereal production. That trend is a reflection of rural economics, where transport and labour costs encourage the most efficient use of resources in applying fertiliser. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I meant crops as distinct from pasture. Perhaps that trend is not strictly relevant to the issue of a phosphate and nitrogenous fertilisers subsidy because honourable senators will be aware that the subsidy is paid on the contained phosphorous or contained nitrogen as designated by the manufacturers' specifications, but I believe it reflects a general rural concern about the rising costs of fertilisers and their application. Over the period from 1970-71 to the present, fertiliser costs represent the second fastest growing farm cost input, second only to fuel prices and then only marginally. As a cost factor, fertiliser prices have risen about 410 per cent since 1970-71. This is only a few percentage points less than fuel prices, while over the same period wages have increased by something like 235 per cent. That is why it is so important to Western Australian farmers to have this bounty in the present economic climate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because of the soil types found in Western Australia it has been necessary to use a disproportionately high amount of fertiliser to maintain crop yields. Overall, 30 per cent of Australia's fertiliser is used and consumed in Western Australia, but Western Australia has only 9 per cent of Australia's farms in terms of numbers as distinct from acreages and they account for 16 per cent of the total value of agricultural production. If we examine further the fertiliser intensive agriculture production in Western Australia, we find that 29 per cent of Western Australia's crop land consumes 31 per cent of the fertiliser used for crops to produce only 15 per cent of Australia's crop output on a value basis. Similarly, Western Australia has 27 per cent of Australia's pasture land and uses 30 per cent of the fertiliser applied to pastures in Australia, but, on a value basis, produces only 13 per cent of the livestock production. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a reflection of the natural infertility of Western Australian soils compared with those of other parts of Australia and it is indicative of the special soil husbandry which must be practised in my State of Western Australia. In other words, in my view it is a compelling argument in support of the retention of the phosphorous and nitrogenous fertiliser subsidies in the present circumstances. But I do stress the point that the subsidy is necessary in the present circumstances only. Those circumstances, of course, relate very often to the very high artificial costs imposed upon the agricultural producers by tariff levels and quotas granted in favour of certain favoured and often inefficient secondary industries in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If I may return briefly to the point at which I commenced, the real value of this subsidy is diminishing as the costs of fertilisers rise. If the underlying rationale of this legislation is to assist the agricultural producers in this country-I presume that is the reason for this legislation-as an historic trend it should be noted that the value of that assistance is diminishing under the twin pressures of inflation and the static level of the subsidy itself. A simple answer to the dilemma would be to increase the level of the subsidy. But if the level of the assistance were to be increased once again to 30 per cent of the price of the product, the cost to the Australian taxpayer of the superphosphate subsidy would be in the order of $130m and the nitrogenous fertiliser subsidy would account for a further $35m, based on the 1979-80 costs of these subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA> In Australia today there are just so many people who are so quick and keen to fall back on governments for assistance. I would not for a moment suggest that that is the course that ought ultimately to be taken to resolve this question. I am sure that is not the solution that the average farmer in this community would seek. It is within the power and capacity of this Government to take a very positive step to alleviate the problems faced by farmers and, for that matter, other producers and other service industries in Australia. I shall quote from a booklet entitled Farm Focus: The 80s which was produced last year by the National Farmers Federation. It states, quite intelligently and quite properly:</PARA>
<PARA> There is an urgent need to achieve a significant reduction in the costs from tariffs on farm inputs. In a situation where farmers are largely unable to pass on these costs but must absorb them, major distortions and inequities are introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>On chemical herbicides and pesticides, for example, there is an import tariff of up to 30 per cent plus support duties in some cases. The tariff for tyres for cars and light trucks ranges up to 25 per cent; for harvesting and haymaking machinery, 15 per cent; for fencing and insulators, 37.5 per cent; for working boots and overalls in excess of 40 per cent and 50 per cent respectively; and for rotary and cultivating machinery, 15 per cent. Completely built up motor vehicles attract a 57.5 per cent general tariff. With other forms of assistance, the effective rate of protection has been estimated at closer to 90 per cent. The protection on motor vehicles and such other items as footwear and clothing is obviously excessive, but there are certainly further inequities which also do not bear up to closer examination. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to detain the Senate very long. I wish to raise two matters. I was hoping that the Leader of the Government (Senator Sir John Carrick) might have been here but the remarks which I wish to make I suppose really should be directed to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) and the Federal Minister for Health (Mr Carlton). The first matter to which I wish to refer reads a little like a comic opera. It is a short story which relates how some people have used others. In this case it happens to be the Premier of Queensland and a gentleman who, in order to protect his identity, shall be called the Batman. In the second case to which I wish to refer a document has been issued by the Queensland Minister for Health in which he points out certain quite erroneous things about high toxicity weed killers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some months ago during the Christmas-New Year period there were a number of disputes in Queensland which led to the abandonment of maintenance work by some members of the Electrical Trades Union of Australia. By technical manipulative actions a partly trained electrical apprentice, known for the purposes of this exercise as the Batman, was able to restore power in some areas. I wish to make two major points. The first is that a partly qualified person should not be handling this sort of thing at all. The second point is that the Premier of a State-even if it is a rather backward State politically, as Queensland is-should not be enticing people who are partly trained in this area to scab, which is the normal word used in the trade union area, and to endanger people's lives further . I know that there are certain offences in relation to tape recordings of telephone conversations. But in this case it appears that both people concerned were involved in taping each other's conversations. I understand that many copies of the transcription of one of those tapes are now circulating. The transcript is 99 per cent accurate. I do not know who transcribed the tape and made the transcript available; nevertheless it is available. John Walsh, a member of the Premier's staff in Queensland, apparently was the go-between for the young fellow known as the Batman and the leading man of the State. The transcript commences with the young apprentice saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Well, put it this way . . . you know I just feel the unions were doing the wrong thing at the Christmas time. You could have agreed by the way I put it forward to the Courier-Mail. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> PREMIER: That was splendid, Batman, I, truly will. Sometime you have got to come in and say hello . . . and have perhaps a cup of tea with me or something. </PARA>
<PARA> BATMAN: Well, I would like to but . . . you know, I have got to look to the future. Where do I stand as far as you know a lot of people in SEQEB--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the South-East Queensland Electricity Board-</PARA>
<PARA> I made enemies with by doing. </PARA>
<PARA> PREMIER: Oh, well I know that Batman, but don't you ever worry. We'll, you know , don't you ever worry. You, we need people like you, pity there weren't more a few more like you Batman. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> PREMIER: . . . will you keep in touch?</PARA>
<PARA> BATMAN: I definitely will because I think in the near future around about the mid-May, end of May the unions are going to step up their campaign . . . </PARA>
<PARA> PREMIER: What's the reason for it?</PARA>
<PARA> BATMAN: 35 hour week. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> BATMAN: The usual procedure, more money or something they're never happy in their job now. </PARA>
<PARA> PREMIER: No. </PARA>
<PARA> BATMAN: . . . a lot of them you know on fairly good conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> PREMIER: Yeh, yeh, yeh. </PARA>
<PARA> BATMAN: And you know give them more and they will want more . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This transcript reads very much like a comic opera. But one has to read in these statements in order to ensure that the matter is taken in its proper context. The transcript continues:</PARA>
<PARA> BATMAN: . . . I make a lot of trips out Roma-</PARA>
<PARA>Roma has a power station which feeds into a local grid. According to what I have heard from the tape recordings of both of these people it is unlikely that that power station will be interfered with. The transcript continues:</PARA>
<PARA> PREMIER: No I didn't. </PARA>
<PARA> BATMAN: No, well I've been studying the operation of the power station there and how to operate, now every power station has their own set way</PARA>
<PARA> PREMIER: Yeh. </PARA>
<PARA> BATMAN: But basically</PARA>
<PARA> PREMIER: Could you keep that-</PARA>
<PARA> BATMAN: The synchronising procedure is the same. </PARA>
<PARA> PREMIER: Is it really, could you, Batman, could you organise a few fellows to, that would be hard to do wouldn't it, that could step in to do-</PARA>
<PARA> BATMAN: I've been trying. </PARA>
<PARA> PREMIER: Gee, good on ya. </PARA>
<PARA> BATMAN: Now I am trying uphill . . . </PARA>
<PARA> PREMIER: My goodness me . . . I'll, I'll make sure you go up the ladder well quick smart if you can do that. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we have a leading personage in the community, a political figure , convincing a half-trained third year apprentice that he should go in and take over power stations. Crossed lines, et cetera, could have burnt out 100 houses in a suburb. The lad himself could have been killed, and yet we hear somebody who holds a responsible position persuading him to continue to do it. The transcript continues:</PARA>
<PARA> PREMIER: Now you'll go up the ladder I'll promise you that, if you can get some fellows that can operate the powerhouse, you can do the one at Roma or any of them . . . well Batman if you can, if you can get some of our, - operate some of our powerhouses or get a few fellows together that could . . . gee, you could do that . . . then I--</PARA>
<PARA>It was a very disjointed conversation but it was correctly transcribed. The conversation goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> BATMAN: It's teamwork effort but ah, where do I go for security I know one bloke's our stumbling block, Keith Zuch in the Q.E.G.B. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Queensland Electricity Generating Board. The response was:</PARA>
<PARA> PREMIER: Who's that?</PARA>
<PARA> BATMAN: Keith Zuch, Tennyson system control centre. </PARA>
<PARA>Tennyson is one of the very big centres. The transcript continues:</PARA>
<PARA> BATMAN: Now if I went into Swanbank for example and tried to start it, got a few people on the coal gang to get the conveyors going 'yes' managed to get a couple of sets synchronised and operating 'yes' he could very easily at the control centre drop us off. That's our only problem. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, they could be dropped out of the grid. The transcript goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> PREMIER: And when you say drop off?</PARA>
<PARA> BATMAN: Well he'd switch us out of the grid so all the power that we generate wouldn't do any good. That's the only problem we've got. </PARA>
<PARA> PREMIER: And how can you overcome that?</PARA>
<PARA> BATMAN: That's a bit of a difficulty. Have someone at Tennyson system control making sure he doesn't isolate Swanbank</PARA>
<PARA> PREMIER: Now . . . is, is that something that we could do by having somebody there or . . . some supervision yes. It can be done. You know a lot of people . . . could for example could say the State Electricity Commissioner be there if he knew you were going to do the rest?</PARA>
<PARA>It is positively dishonest to have the chief of the electricity organisation in Queensland standing by to make sure that that station is not dropped out of the grid while a couple of scabs operate it. The transcript continues further:</PARA>
<PARA> BATMAN: Yes. </PARA>
<PARA> PREMIER: Could he be there and make sure that he didn't do it?</PARA>
<PARA> BATMAN: Well that is possible, I would, you know I wouldn't like to attempt to run the power station on my own that would be ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA> PREMIER: Yeh . . . well, Batman, you do your best MMMMMmmm and see what you can put together to have ready for an emergency will you?</PARA>
<PARA>Batman is getting rather cautious by this time, which the transcript indicates as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> BATMAN: Tell us one thing. What protection do I have, ah police wise if the union try to get at me?</PARA>
<PARA> PREMIER: They give you all the police protection you want. </PARA>
<PARA>Apparently following this the line was left open and the following passage was recorded:</PARA>
<PARA> BATMAN: Um, you little beauty, you little beauty. I've been talking to Joh, he says if you can organise to run the power stations, you'll go up the ladder- right up the ladder. You little ripper!</PARA>
<PARA>I think this is a case in which the Federal Minister ought to be prepared at least to have some sort of inquiry because if this sort of thing can go on in Queensland it can go on anywhere. We have one of the most responsible people in Australia, certainly in Queensland, persuading a half-trained electrician not only to scab, but also to go in under police protection and run some of the major power stations. That sort of thing should not happen. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer briefly to my second point. In Queensland, a leaflet is put out by the State Minister for Health listing a number of herbicides. I have spoken on this subject many times in this chamber. The danger guide is worded as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> All pesticides are dangerous when swallowed in the concentrate form. However, in the following list, the pesticides in more common use have been graded according to toxicity when used under normal conditions of spraying and mixing. </PARA>
<PARA>Then there is listed as having nil toxicity the hormone weed killers 2,4-D and 2 ,4,5-T the brand names of which are Tordon, Five-T, et cetera. It goes on to list a number of others, many of which are almost as dangerous. I think the Premier of Victoria set the pace for trying to overcome the possible problems, and sometimes the parent and positive problems, that are associated with the use of these herbicides. The herbicide 2,4,5-T, with dioxin, is the very basis on which agent orange and some of the other herbicides used in Vietnam were compounded. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask that the Minister refer these two matters to the relevant Ministers. In particular, I hope that Mr Macphee will look at the encouragement given to a half trained electrician in Queensland. I have not used his name because I know the company he works for and he will certainly be sacked if this matter comes to the attention of his employer. I think it is unfair that a youngster should be put in this situation by the first citizen of the State. I hope that the matter will be handled with tact and that this sort of practice will cease. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It used to be Saturday night. When the Senate was discussing the report of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources entitled 'The Development of the Bauxite, Alumina and Aluminium Industries' on 25 February I stated, in the context of explaining the position, why the Committee was totally opposed to the use by Western Australian conservation interests of overseas courts. I was nevertheless explaining what had led to their frustration with the procedures available to put their concerns in a constructive way before major resource projects were undertaken. I stated that we had had some evidence from the Commonwealth Department of Home Affairs and Environment arising out of its assessment reports of proposed bauxite and alumina projects in Western Australia and that in many cases the project developers, whilst full of good intentions, were really at such an early stage of their proposals at the time of seeking the concurrence of the Commonwealth or State departments of environment in their projected development that they could do no more than express pious hopes that their projects would not have a detrimental environmental impact. In fact, some of their strategies for overcoming certain adverse environmental impacts would not be fully tested and one could not be absolutely confident about their utility. In my remarks I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the Darling Ranges there is grave doubt-I certainly have grave doubts after hearing some of the evidence, particularly from the proposals of the Worsley joint venturers-about the impact of the bauxite mining in those ranges on the salinity of Perth's water supply. Those projects are going ahead without those fears being allayed and without the full and complete scientific studies having been completed. </PARA>
<PARA>Since I made those remarks it has been drawn to my attention that the Worsley alumina project is being conducted in an area of the Darling Ranges which is not a catchment area for the Perth water supply. I have taken out of the library a booklet entitled 'Forest Focus', published in Western Australia, that shows the various catchment areas on the western seaboard of Australia. As I say, it is quite clear that the Worsley joint venturers' projected operations would be outside the metropolitan catchment area in the northern jarrah forest area. To that extent I wish to correct any impression in the minds of honourable senators , and particularly fellow Committee members, that I do believe that the Worsley joint venturers are in their operations imperilling Perth's water supply by contributing to the salinity of the waters in the catchment area of that water supply. </PARA>

I simply want to put that matter on record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matters I wish to raise by way of protest are to do with what I believe is an ignoring of senators by authorities around this Parliament in the making of decisions which are of vital concern to senators and which have quite an impact on the environment within which they have to work, either presently or in the future. Firstly, I wish to raise the question of the design of the Senate chamber, or at least the procedures which allow ordinary senators to make some contribution to the final design plans for the Senate chamber in the new Parliament House. On 11 March of this year I raised with, I think, the Deputy President, who was in the chair during the adjournment debate the fact that late in the Budget session last year senators and members were invited to view proposals for the interior of the new Parliament House. I think they were in a room near the private dining room. We were invited to make our suggestions known to the officers in attendance. I certainly went over, and I made the comment to the officers there that the viewing galleries of the new Senate chamber, to my mind, have the same defects as the present ones, that is, they are too high and remote from the floor and the viewing angles are such that much of the chamber is obscured from the view of those people who come into the chamber to view our work in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> In a sense I would not mind if there were any evidence that that suggestion had been seriously considered, had been looked at and had been taken into account. I have not to this date had a reply to the point I raised on 11 March and we are one day short of rising for the winter recess. I want a reply. I have had some informal discussions in the corridors with officers of the Senate, but nothing more than that. I have had no evidence that any suggestion made by a member or senator at that time was recorded and taken into account by any authority responsible for the design and construction of the interior of the chambers of the new Parliament House. What I am concerned about is that we were given a snow job-it was just another public relations exercise-and that senators who have to work in this environment and who are concerned about public understanding of our work have been ignored. If my suggestion has no merit, that is one thing. But my objection is that there is no evidence that we were taken seriously at all at any stage. It will be no answer to me to find out that my view was taken into account two or three weeks ago, for example. I want to know what happened to the suggestions made by members and senators at that stage last year when we were invited to make suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter along the same line by way of protest is that one of the best innovations made in the Library in recent times has been the setting aside during sitting times in the session of the carrels for work at the rear of the Library. It is most conducive to quiet work away from one's office and telephone and the general harassments of people knocking on one's door-including attendants full of good intentions-which are most disruptive. The fact is that a letter we all received early this week dated 20 May 1982 from the Speaker and President advises us that, there being only eight carrels anyway at the back of the Library for the use of senators and members during the session, two of them are to be removed over the winter recess and the space made available for a junior Australian political scientist taking up the fellowship which is offered in this place. I have no objection to some accommodation being found for this person. Indeed, a committee of this Parliament has made some suggestions as to how accommodation could be found in this place if only a certain department were not so obdurate-apparently successfully obdurate-in its occupancy of its premises. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am saying is that the decision to remove two of the carrels at the rear of the Library is a wrong decision on at least two grounds. First, I believe the decision to reduce the number of carrels to six is shortsighted and unduly restrictive of future methods of work of senators and members. I use the carrels , I suppose, daily. I could name, but I will not, two or three senators who certainly use them constantly and three or four members who constantly use them. I do not believe the assessment claimed to have been made that only four carrels are in use at any one time. Even if that were true on average I believe that space has to be made available for more or less maximum use. The fact is that quite often one urgently requires 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour in a quiet space to prepare work for a contribution to either this chamber or a committee. It is quite impossible to do that, as I say, in one's office. It may be, of course, that any new intake of senators or members after the next election will include people whose work preparation habits, whose study habits, are quite different; they may find those areas extremely conducive to their work. In that case the average of four carrels which is claimed at present may be unduly restrictive of the way in which senators and members wish to work in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> Further, when was this survey undertaken? It could well have been undertaken in a week, for example, when many members or senators did not have their research assistant with them in Canberra. If one has one's research assistant with one in Canberra one can leave that assistant in the room to guard the phone, to receive the messages, to open the mail and to keep abreast of the paper work. One does not need to be in one's room; one can go back to the rear of the Library and work on one's own. As I say, a misleading impression could have been given to the Speaker and the President, and apparently the Library Committee, about the use of these carrels. It is a bad decision not only from that point of view. What I really object to-and this ties in with my previous objection concerning the design of the Senate chamber-is the fact that senators have not been consulted. I can see Senator Janine Haines is nodding in agreement with my concern about this matter. Senators have not been consulted concerning their wants in this regard or--</PARA>

Senators have not been consulted about this matter nor has this information been circulated in time for discussion by members of the House of Representatives. The letter is dated 20 May 1982. Members of the House of Representatives have left this place and they have no opportunity to make their views known as to the propriety or the worthiness of this proposal.

<PARA> Therefore, Madam Acting Deputy President, I ask that you convey to the Speaker and the President the dismay which I feel and which I know from conversations is shared by other honourable senators in respect of this proposal. I say that the fellow can make as much unimpeded use of that area as he or she wishes over the winter recess-for some 10 weeks-because senators and members do not have the privilege of exclusive use of the area during this period. Let that 10 weeks be used to find alternative accommodation. As I say, I believe that accommodation can be and maybe ought to be found, but certainly not at the expense of the need of senators and members at the moment, and certainly not in a way which will unduly restrict the possible use of that area by senators and members in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring before the Senate tonight the case of a woman suffering from childhood-onset diabetes, a problem which, I understand, is faced by a considerable section of the Australian population. This woman wrote recently to South Australian State politicians and Federal politicians of all political parties. She outlined the drastic but apparently quite common predicament that many diabetics suffering from this particular form of diabetes face. She wrote, in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although my plea is for diabetics generally, it is more specifically for the sufferers of childhood onset diabetes. These people can be treated only with daily (sometimes multiple) injections of insulin all their lives. The long-term complication of this type of diabetes is vascular disease affecting the eyes, kidneys, heart, limbs and circulation, and inevitably causing neurological disorders. Each condition is sufficiently distressing in itself, but when grouped together, the resultant distress is enormous. Technology has advanced a great deal to help the diabetic cope with these problems, with home monitoring of blood glucose, blood pressure and possibly renal dialysis. </PARA>
<PARA>She goes on to point out that that technology has a price. She cites her own case as an example of the expenses with which this sort of diabetic can become involved. She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I recently purchased (on my doctor's advice) a blood glucose home-monitoring machine at a cost of $230. The strips needed to work the machine are $3.20 per prescription of 25. I must use the machine four times daily to get the most benefit from it and this means a prescription every 6-7 days, at a total cost of $16 per month. The needles needed to obtain the blood become blunt very quickly with this continuous use and have to be purchased every couple of weeks at $3.20 for 10. So, the purchase and maintenance of this one item is excessively expensive. Combined with the costs of five prescribed drugs ($3.20 each), insulin (two types-$3.20 each), swabs and syringes (injections 2-3 times daily), urine testing strips (2 types-$3.20 each) regular medical, podiatry and laser ophthalmology treatment, plus contributions to a health fund ($8.50 per week), the outlay gets almost prohibitive. To try and save some money for the future is also very difficult, as life assurance policies are not available to diabetics. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore make this appeal for financial assistance on behalf of myself and fellow sufferers in the sincere hope that something can be done to ease the situation and would be deeply appreciative if you would be good enough to give the matter your serious consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>The woman who wrote this letter is known by a member of my staff, who assures me that the letter does not adequately express the personal suffering that this woman has to endure as a result of her illness. She is apparently a very determined lady and is attempting at the moment to hold down a full time job, fortunately with the somewhat generous assistance of sympathetic employers. In addition to the sheer physical suffering she has to endure as a result of the side effects of her condition she and others like her are forced to pay extremely dearly in order merely to remain alive and in a relative degree of comfort. On her behalf and on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of diabetics in this country, I ask the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) to give some indication of whether the Government plans to do or can do anything to assist this not inconsiderable group of people. I understand that an honourable member in another place raised this matter some time ago. I also understand that the woman has not yet received any reply to her letter to the Government and Opposition senators or as a result of the matter being raised in the adjournment debate in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I want bring up very briefly is a matter that I raised in the Senate in October last year. It relates to the consequences of the harassment of a Commonwealth Government employee at the Defence Research Centre at Salisbury in South Australia. I will not go into the details again. They are in Hansard. The problem is that it is now a considerable number of months since I raised the question in the Senate. It is two years since this woman first laid complaints. She is without a job at the moment. No resolution of her case seems to have been reached. She is in a most unfortunate state of limbo, suffering physical and mental illhealth as a result of the stress that she has suffered over the last couple of years. I simply ask the new Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) to give his Department a hurry up if it is somehow, probably inadvertently, holding up a decision. If it is not the Department of Defence-if it is in fact the Public Service Board or some element in the Public Service-which is going slow in the matter, putting it into the too hard basket or hoping that if it ignores her long enough she will go away, will the Minister involved please take some action to satisfy what has been an extremely distressing case for far too long for this woman?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I detain the Senate at this unconscionable hour for a few minutes only because the subject matter that I propose to mention concerns the liberty of a subject. It is yet another case history concerning the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the rights of an individual and a record of incompetence, delay and lack of concern for those individual rights on the part of, it seems, both ASIO and the supervising department-the Attorney- General's Department. The matter concerns Mr Stephen Rix, who is employed as an assistant research officer in the Department of Trade and Resources. Mr Rix was offered employment by the Department of Trade and Resources in November 1981, an offer which he immediately accepted. A week later he received a questionnaire from ASIO, in common with other putative employees in the Public Service, which he completed and returned. This was the first indication that he had had of the need for a security clearance but it was a procedure which he was happy to comply with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two months later-in January of this year-Mr Rix contacted the Department of Trade and Resources asking why he had heard no more about the job and when he could start it. He was told that no reply had been received from ASIO and this was the cause of the delay in proceeding to his actual employment. However, the Department of Trade and Resources said that, notwithstanding the failure of the receipt of advice from ASIO, it felt that as the Department had offered him a job which he had accepted it had no choice in all the circumstances but actually to employ him. He was flown to Canberra for discussions about an appropriate slot within the Department, commenced work at the Sydney regional office on 4 February and commenced work in Canberra on 16 February. It happened that on 4 February at the Sydney regional office he was interviewed personally by ASIO, an interview which again was conducted without apparent incident and in the course of which Mr Rix answered all the questions put to him fully and honestly. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened subsequently is that ASIO has not submitted any report, as I understand it, to the Department of Trade and Resources either to confirm or deny that Mr Rix is any kind of security risk. Nearly six months have elapsed since the series of events to which I have referred took place but no word whatsoever has been forthcoming from ASIO as to the granting or denial of a security clearance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that it is too late at night, so I will not overdo the rhetoric. It is an empty, soulless corridor unaccompanied by any communication with the higher-ups as to whether he is in or out of national security favour. As a result of this failure to clarify his status, Mr Rix has been employed in a section of the Department which does not require a security clearance but which does not provide the work experience normally given to an assistant research officer in Mr Rix's position. At the end of this week there will be a rotation of all assistant research officers within the Department, and indeed in others, but without a security clearance there is no prospect in practice of any improvement in Mr Rix's situation. ASIO's slackness in this matter is clearly having an extremely detrimental effect on this man's Public Service career. I wrote to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) on 7 May, apprising him of the situation and asking him to investigate the case as a matter of urgency. As yet, there has been no substantive reply to my letter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The points I wish to make about this case are just two. In the first place, there seems to be a manifest denial of justice involved in the non-reply by ASIO . If Rix was ultimately to receive an adverse security report he could at least go to the Security Appeals Tribunal, the machinery set up under the new Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act, to challenge the basis on which that adverse security report had been put down. But in the absence of any report-even after six months of waiting for it-he can do absolutely nothing. He has not been granted a security clearance, nor has he been denied one. He just exists in this limbo-land to which Senator Mulvihill referred. I cannot believe that any justification can be advanced for ASIO's behaviour in this respect. If Mr Rix is perceived by that organisation to be a security risk by virtue of his membership of a particular political party or some other organisation, ASIO should be prepared to say so and to back its judgment before the Security Appeals Tribunal in the event that it is challenged. If Mr Rix is not perceived to be a security risk, grotesque negligence can be the only explanation for a reply not having been forthcoming during the period to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that I feel obliged to make in this case is about the performance of the Attorney-General and his office in this matter. Once again, we seem to have a clear demonstration that the Attorney and those who work for him simply do not understand the concept of urgency. I wrote nearly three weeks ago, as I have said, drawing his attention to the pressing nature of the problem and the way in which this man's career advancement was being manifestly denied or inhibited by the failure to act in this matter. But I have had absolutely no results. The demands of the situation have been ignored and the career prospects of the individual remain quite bleak so long as they are ignored. In conclusion, I simply say that it is this kind of case which seems to me to point to the need for a much greater degree of accountability to this Parliament and in other ways for actions of ASIO than the present practice seems to allow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The page outlines the work force at both Garden Island Dockyard and its Victorian counterpart, Williamstown. Between 30 June 1980 and 31 March 1982 there was a decline in the aggregate work force in both dockyards. Nevertheless, representatives from the Royal Australian Navy who came before Senate Estimates Committee D gave the impression that there had been a more or less stabilising effect on the work force, which I think all of us on the Committee, which was chaired by Senator Kilgariff and included others such as Senator Sibraa and myself, accepted. Senator Sibraa questioned Government policy on the cessation of activities to some degree at the Small Arms Factory, Lithgow . It is not hard to understand all the trade unions involved, on either dockyard maintenance or, for that matter, small arms production, being a little concerned about what was ahead for them. This morning when I read page 7 of the Sydney Daily Telegraph I was stunned to discover that a Singaporean firm called Autoblast Singapore Pty Ltd has a contract to indulge in certain sand blasting and painting of several Australian Navy craft.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The contract involves HMAS Stalwart, and I understand the same treatment is to be given to HMAS Stuart, HMAS Parramatta and HMAS Brisbane. Of course, compounding what to me is, to say the least, an improper action, is that in the article the manager of this establishment boasted that not only is he adhering to Singapore trade union conditions which are inferior to ours-I do not say that with a jingoistic attitude-but also they are even lower. I say at the outset that if someone argues that in order to preserve international relations we must throw a few crumbs to nearby Asian countries, then we are doing that. As a matter of fact, without offending the sensibilities of the Senate, I call this matter two-tiered scabbery because on the one hand we are undercutting Australian naval trade union conditions and on the other hand undercutting the recognised trade union standards of Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the first complaint I wish to make. Job protection means that everyone in an industry is a taxpayer. There is no need for me to refer to certain overseas countries and deflation. Sure, one can make people redundant, but as a result they require social security and represent a minus and not a plus. They are out of the taxation field from which the Government gathers. To take the matter a little further, we face this situation: Garden Island Dockyard had already had a tussle with nearby residents about a sand blasting complex and was successful in having it constructed. It mystifies me why we have to let this work out to firms from a low wage country. Getting away from the syndrome of government enterprise, in the Port of Sydney, Vickers Cockatoo Dockyard Pty Ltd employs many painters and dockers. It has a workforce of 150 people who do some of the sand blasting and painting of our various naval craft. They will be sent to industrial Coventry, too. But what is most sinister is that in this article in the Daily Telegraph the manager boasted that his friendship with the United States Navy was important and that it was able-he used the words-to apply pressure to the Royal Australian Navy to see that the company obtained a continuation of this work. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not my intention to go into a filibuster, but I spoke today to Mr Terry Gordon, the National Secretary of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union of Australia, and his State officials. They are quite adamant that a work force is available there to do this work. From a national point of view, they have a perfect right to do it. I spoke to officials of the Trades and Labour Council. I see no reason why this work has been given to Asian dockyards. I am more concerned because during an Estimates committee hearing-if Senator Kilgariff were in the chamber he would endorse what I am saying-we went on record as saying that we got honest answers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. But, believe me, when we got on to the Defence area we got, to say the least, grudging responses. I am being very polite in this matter. I can assure honourable senators that nothing was said to the effect that the unions responsible for naval dockyard maintenance would have to live with this situation. I could say a lot more tonight. I made a pledge to the officials of the union concerned and the matter will not stop here. The next matter will involve workers covered by the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia and then other workers in the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union. I took the opportunity, as the Minister would well know, to alert him to the fact that there is considerable resentment in Sydney in regard to this situation. I will await the response of the Minister with interest. </PARA>

Although it does not fall within my portfolio responsibility I will try to follow up the matter of the employee that she mentioned some months ago who was employed at the defence establishment at Salisbury. I do recall her raising that matter and I will undertake to chase up a response for her.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the insulin dependent diabetics, I appreciate the points that she is making. I would not want people to exaggerate the amount of suffering that is associated with diabetes. As the son of a diabetic and the nephew of a diabetic and having several diabetic colleagues in this chamber one could overemphasise the suffering associated with the illness. Most people want to live as normally as they can. Senator Haines's contribution tonight concerned the non-availability, as a subsidised benefit, of certain equipment and certain aids. The Government does make certain things available. Not only does it make insulin available under normal prescription circumstances but also, where a diabetic has particular needs, special arrangements can be made to get insulin in large amounts for prolonged periods. That is something which doctors can and do organise. In the same way other items available on prescription can be obtained by special application to directors of health if there are special needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with the matters which she mentioned-syringes, blood glucose monitoring equipment, the special strips for use of that equipment and needles for drawing blood-is that they are not pharmaceuticals. They are not available under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. As things stand there is no scheme available which would allow them to be subsidised. What Senator Haines is seeking is a new form of benefit. That would simply involve a government decision and would be a matter for the Minister for Health (Mr Carlton) to take up with the Government. It is therefore appropriate that I refer this concern on to him. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was Minister for Health I was aware of a large number of representations which were being made in this area. I believe that the Minister whom I represent in this place would be aware of those representations, would be sensitive to the matters which Senator Haines has raised and would appreciate that there is much concern among the people who have the need to use this quite expensive equipment . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans raised a matter regarding a delay in the provision of a security assessment for a Mr Rix. It is true that Mr Rix has been engaged in the Public Service on work which requires an assessment and the matter has been referred to Australian Security Intelligence Organisation for that purpose. It is also true that Senator Evans wrote to me on 7 May in regard to this matter and my attention and that of my staff was drawn to if I have had a discussion with the Director-General of ASIO in regard to the complaint which Senator Evans has raised in the Senate this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thought it was particularly ungracious of Senator Evans to comment as he did about my staff. I think it is a bit unreasonable to complain about a delay in the matter from 7 May, particularly when we are all heavily engaged at this stage in the session of the Senate. However, putting that aside, Senator Evans and his staff have received a good deal of attention from my staff and I do not appreciate the comments he made about them, regardless of what he may say about me. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I have discussed the matter with the Director-General of ASIO and I am satisfied that there is some justification for what is certainly a delay. A number of assessments requiring care and attention have been necessary during this period. I am sure honourable senators would expect very great attention is required to be given to matters of this kind. I hope that the matter will be finalised in the near future. I will refer the comments that Senator Evans made to the Director-General. I am sure he will expedite the matter in the light of those comments. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Mulvihill referred to an article which appeared in today's Sydney Daily Telegraph. I do not think Senator Mulvihill raised all the matters referred to in that article so I do not propose to canvass all of them. The position is that the maintenance work being done on HMAS Stalwart in Singapore is being carried out in accordance with ordinary practice. When ships are on deployment for certain periods it is established practice to carry out preventative maintenance work. The work on the ship in Singapore is being done during what is known as a scheduled self-maintenance period. It was necessary for the Stalwart to depart from Sydney in accordance with the fleet program to meet deployment commitments in South East Asia. Given these constraints the work could not be carried out before departure without disruption to that commitment. As this work is required to be done in accordance with those established practices it has been carried out in Singapore and not in Garden Island Dockyard . Again in accordance with normal procedure the work was offered for tender in Singapore. The firm carrying it out is the only one that responded. Although it has been suggested in the article it is not true that this firm has been given any indication that further work will be placed with it by the Royal Australian Navy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The same consideration applies to the other vessels as well. I am sorry but I thought Senator Mulvihill's main concern was in relation to the work on Stalwart. The work on other vessels is repainting work. The chipping and painting of hulls which are not part of the refit are normally performed by sailors and not by dockyard personnel. The work on those ships also comes within the self-maintenance period. Work is certainly being carried out but it is of a limited maintenance kind. Nothing is to be inferred from the work done on these ships that there is any change in policy or there are to be any procedures other than ordinary maintenance procedures.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Senator Tate's speech in the adjournment debate this evening he raised for the consideration of the President, in his capacity as joint parliamentary head of the Parliamentary Library Committee, his comments regarding the use of the carrels in the Library by senators and members. Under a letter dated 20 May the Speaker and the President circularised senators and members to point out that two of the eight carrels in the Library would be converted during the forthcoming winter recess into a small permanent office for the use by a parliamentary science fellow. I should mention to Senator Tate and to the Senate that yesterday Senator Walters and Senator Teague spoke to me about this matter. They mentioned to me that in their capacity as members of the Parliamentary Library Committee they were not able to be present at the meeting of the Committee when the decision to convert the two carrels was taken but that since the letter of the President and the Speaker had been received by honourable senators two or three senators had complained to them personally about the decision that had been taken. Following that notification to me by Senator Walters and Senator Teague, in my capacity as Deputy President, I wrote to the President yesterday and drew the matter of the complaints to the attention of the President.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Tate mentioned also that on 11 March of this year during the adjournment debate he had expressed concern about the positioning of the public galleries in the design for the Senate chamber in the new Parliament House. As I understand his remarks, he complained that apart from a conversation in the corridors he had received no further information. At the time of the adjournment debate on 11 March I was in the chair and at page 771 of Hansard of that date I am recorded as having said:</PARA>
<PARA> In response to the remarks of Senator Tate, I note that the President is one of the joint chairmen of the Joint Committee on the New Parliament House. I will ensure that Senator Tate's remarks are brought to the attention of the President and that a reply is made to the honourable senator as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>I transmitted to the President the content of Senator Tate's remarks and on 25 March the President of the Senate wrote to Senator Tate in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Tate,</PARA>
<PARA> During the Adjournment debate on 11 March 1982, you expressed concern about the positioning of the public galleries in the design of the Senate Chamber in the new Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> The Schematic Design as presented by the Parliament House Construction Authority during the Budget Session last year and viewed by you and many other Senators, complied with the building brief in respect of requirements for the Senate Chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The suggestions made at the time by Senators were not recorded against specific Senators' names. However, as a result of many of the comments made on the Schematic Design, numerous changes have been made and will continue to be made as the design process advances. The Architect has given particular attention to sight-lines in the Senate Chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The Developed Design for the building as a whole is to be presented to the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House in the near future. As co- Chairman of the Committee, I undertake to ensure that the Committee is made aware of your concern. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely, HAROLD YOUNG President of the Senate</PARA>
<PARA>In case that letter dated 25 March 1982 directed by the President to Senator Tate was not received by Senator Tate, I shall ensure that a copy of the letter is transmitted to the honourable senator. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Statistics now publishes a range of measures of average weekly earnings in lieu of the measure published prior to the December quarter 1981. Of the new series, one which enables comparison with the previous measure is 'total weekly earnings for all males'. Another measure which is of relevance is 'total weekly earnings for adults in full-time employment'. The level of average weekly earnings for December quarter 1981, based on these two measures, was $303.20 and $307.10 respectively.</PARA>

<PARA> (1), (2) and (3) The American naval architects Gibbs and Cox undertook a comprehensive study in 1974 covering modifications required to the FFG-7 design to install a five-inch gun and other weapons and engineering changes. The report showed that major modifications would have to be undertaken to the FFG-7 design including lengthening the ship 8 feet forward and 8 feet aft to incorporate all of the proposed changes while retaining the MK13 launcher. Considerable ship redesign costs would be involved in such a modification. The report did not separately address the impact of installing only a five-inch gun. The Gibbs and Cox report was dated 15 February 1974 and was received shortly after.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The FFG-7 was designed as the 'low mix' component of the US Navy for the 1980s to supplement the capabilities of the 'high mix' ships.

These studies culminated in the Government decision that the first two ships of the follow-on-destroyer project should have the same weapon and sensor fit as FFG 04 (HMAS Darwin) excepting for the possible substitution of the AN/SQS-56 sonar with the Australian designed Mulloka sonar.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. Expenditure by the Commonwealth for advertising and related activity arranged through the Australian Government Advertising Service in 1980-81 totalled $23,248,375. Advertising accounts due to be paid in the first 10 months of 1981-82 total $16,098,102.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Total Commonwealth expenditure for advertising arranged through the Australian Government Advertising Service results from the aggregation of costs of meeting advertising needs from funding approved within appropriations to the separate ministerial portfolios. No formal decision is made in setting, increasing or decreasing total advertising expenditure for a specific fiscal year in single budget terms. Hence it is not possible to accurately forecast the total annual advertising expenditure. However, based on the current progression of expenditure likely for the first 10 months of 1981-82, total advertising expenditure in 1981-82 can be expected to be below $20m.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There is no single budget for total advertising by the Commonwealth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The possibilities proposed by the Plant Diversity Protection Committee for avoiding PVR are extremely limited in providing rewards or protection for plant breeders. None of the alternatives suggested provides the comprehensive protection which will be provided by the PVR Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> The various non-statutory provisions proposed by the Committee, such as the use of hybrids, specialised production techniques and other commercial arrangements, give plant breeders a limited advantage only. Most of these arrangements are already in use today. Clearly they do not meet industry needs, otherwise there would be no demand for a PVR Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> Equally, the proposed statutory provision, such as the use of trademarks, resort to common law and inventor's certificates, are limited in effect and do not provide the comprehensive protection which would be available under PVR.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A plant variety right gives the holder control over the sale of plants and reproductive material of that variety. It also entitles him to license others to sell plants and reproductive material of that variety.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as I am aware, this is the basis of the right in all countries where plant variety rights (PVR) schemes exist. It is a matter for the holder of the right to make a commercial judgment as to the premium that he considers the market is prepared to pay because it considers his variety superior to other varieties.</PARA>
<PARA> The royalties, or premiums, being made in various countries at any particular time are a function of the market forces existing at that time.</PARA>
<PARA> It is important to remember that farmers and gardeners will also make judgments about the seeds and plants they are purchasing and it is highly unlikely that a premium will be paid for a variety if that variety cannot return the investment.</PARA>
<PARA> The question referred to 'other charges'. In PVR schemes in other countries there are specific charges related to the granting and maintenance of the right. The level of fees varies from country to country but generally amount to something under $1,000 per variety registered.</PARA>
<PARA> In the United States of America, for example, the fees are $US250 application, $US250 search and a further $US250 when the certificate is issued. That is, a total of $US750.</PARA>
<PARA> In New Zealand and the United Kingdom there are different levels of fees for different categories of species. In New Zealand, for example, fees for agricultural crops and vegetables amount to a total of $NZ750 and the annual renewal fee is $NZ50.</PARA>
<PARA> In the United Kingdom the application fee for cereals and potatoes, for example , is #220. In addition, a test fee in the first year of #385 (slightly less in subsequent years) is charged and an annual renewal fee of #165 the second year ( increasing in subsequent years) is charged.</PARA>

<PARA> I have also approved additional funds of $35,000 for Victoria for the remainder of this financial year, as the Commonwealth contribution towards the shortfall in that State's Scheme for this year.</PARA>

<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Under the health care card arrangements a person whose income is below certain qualifying limits is entitled to a health care card which is valid for a period of 6 months provided his income over any period of four consecutive weeks does not reach 125 per cent of the qualifying limits.</PARA>
<PARA> This arrangement is designed so that once eligibility is established it will be continued for 6 months irrespective of minor fluctuations of income.</PARA>
<PARA> When a health care card is issued the person is informed of the expiry date of the card and of his obligation to notify if his income reaches 125 per cent of the basic limit (the actual amount represented by the 125 per cent is printed on the card).</PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the 6 months period entitlement to the grant of a further card is considered. To be eligible for a further card an applicant must again satisfy the basic income limit.</PARA>
<PARA> It has become apparent that some people have gained the impression that they remain eligible for health care card indefinitely provided their income remains below the 125 per cent limit. As I have indicated above this is not correct. Accordingly, I asked my Department to carry out a review of the wording on advices and other literature concerning the income limits. This has now been done and the review advice form specifically referred to by Senator Colston has been redesigned to overcome the problem.</PARA>

Senator Coleman also sought the Commonwealth's views on such a proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised by the Treasurer that the Commonwealth has not received a request from the Western Australian Premier on the matter. Senator Coleman may have had in mind a Press release by the Premier on 22 March 1982 in which he stated he would prefer tax sharing grants to be based on personal income tax collections rather than total Commonwealth tax collections.</PARA>
<PARA> The move to a total tax collection base was decided at the May 1981 Premiers' Conference. There are advantages in the use of total tax collections as a base, including the 'insulation' it would provide the States in the event of any shift in emphasis between personal income tax and other Commonwealth Taxes. This was acknowledged in a statement on tax sharing arrangements made by all Premiers in February 1981. A sharing of total taxation could also be regarded as more equitable in the sense that both the Commonwealth and the States would share equally in movements in all Commonwealth tax receipts.</PARA>

<PARA> For beneficiaries living in extremely remote areas, who would otherwise have difficulty lodging fortnightly applications for continuation of unemployment benefit on time, special procedures operate which provide for an application for continuation of benefit to cover a 4 week (rather than the usual 2 week) period. As these procedures operate in the Northern Territory the form is due for lodgment at the end of the 4 weekly period and is issued 2 weeks prior to that date. Benefit payments are not interrupted provided the form is received within 2 weeks of the date it is due to be lodged.</PARA>
<PARA> In some communities in the Katherine area it was the practice to extend the period allowed for the return of the forms to 6 weeks from the date the forms were due to be lodged.</PARA>
<PARA> This arrangement was recently reviewed and it was found that this longer period was not necessary. This was confirmed by an examination of cases over a 3 month period which showed that 85 per cent of forms were lodged within 2 weeks of the due date.</PARA>
<PARA> There are also other procedures to ensure that any individual Aboriginal or groups of Aboriginals are not disadvantaged because of difficulties in having forms lodged. For example, if a number of forms are outstanding at the end of the specified period the Aboriginal Liaison Officer looks into the reason for the delay before any action is taken to suspend payment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 21 April 1982 (Hansard, page 1354) Senator Robert Ray asked Senator Peter Baume as Minister then representing the Minister for Administrative Services the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services aware that in the compilation of the joint electoral rolls there are different qualifications between State and Commonwealth elections? Is the Minister aware that in Victoria prisoners are entitled to vote in State elections but are not entitled to vote in Federal elections and hence the roll is marked 'not entitled to vote for Federal elections'? Would the Minister agree that this sort of marking on the roll readily identifies, and unfairly so, those who have been prisoners. Could he look at the productions of the rolls in such a way that that marking will no longer occur?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth produces electoral rolls jointly with New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. Distinguishing marks are placed on these rolls against the names of those who are enrolled only for Commonwealth or only for State purposes. This marking is not restricted to prisoners.</PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria, for example, the names of electors falling into any one of three categories may be marked to indicate State but not Commonwealth enrolment:</PARA>
<PARA> persons who are under sentence for an offence punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer;</PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginals, for whom State but not Commonwealth enrolment is compulsory; and</PARA>
<PARA> parliamentarians, who may be enrolled in different divisions for Commonwealth and State purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> The only practical alternative to placing distinguishing marks against the names of such electors would be for the Commonwealth and the State to publish separate rolls.</PARA>
<PARA> This would tend to defeat the purpose of joint roll arrangements; it would be expensive; and it would no longer be possible for individual electors to verify both their Commonwealth and their State enrolment by consulting a single roll in a single location.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 April 1982 (Hansard, page 1570) Senator Watson asked me a question, without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry in the Senate. His question concerned the implications to Australian agriculture of the European Economic Community's (EEC) trade sanctions against Argentina and in particular which Australian industries are likely to benefit most.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied me with the following additional information.</PARA>
<PARA> The EEC has banned imports from Argentina with effect from 16 April until 24 May 1982 and will decide whether to extend, modify or withdraw its ban before the end of that period</PARA>
<PARA> latest seven-day limit (from 18-24 May) imposed by EEC saw Italy, Denmark and Ireland expressing strong reservations.</PARA>
<PARA> Because, initially at least, the EEC's ban is in force only for five weeks and does not extend to goods already contracted for, shipped, or for which import licences have been issued, the short-term impact on EEC supplies (and Australian exports) of beef, wool, grains, and fruit is likely to be minimal.</PARA>
<PARA> If trade sanctions were significantly extended the Australian industry most likely to benefit would be the wool industry. Australia could not undertake to supply sufficient quantities of processed wool but could probably supply the market within one or two years if processors had assurances of permanency</PARA>
<PARA> Argentina supplies around 250,000 bales, greasy in this form each year in the short term.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the beef industry, the EEC trade sanctions are unlikely to have a direct impact on Australian exports although some benefits may be derived from a subsequent reduction in EEC exports to third world markets.</PARA>
<PARA> For wheat, coarse grains and fruit, the likely shortfall in Argentine supplies will have a minimal impact on EEC and world markets.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 5 May 1982 (Hansard, page 1825) Senator McLaren asked me a question without notice seeking some information on the minimum expenditure of $A30m which the Esso company has undertaken to spend over the next three years on a technical and economic feasibility study of the Rundle project. The honourable senator asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How much of this $A30m will be spent in Australia? How much will be spent in the United States of America? How much has already been spent? Did any of the $ A30m include expenditure undertaken or committed in the Exxon Corporation's Colony shale oil project in Colorado?</PARA>
<PARA> I undertook to seek that information and I now provide the following answer based on advice from Esso:</PARA>
<PARA> Esso estimates that the $A30m three-year commitment will be spent approximately as follows: 52 per cent in the United States of America, 4 per cent in Germany and 44 per cent in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> For accounting purposes the Rundle Joint Venture agreement became effective on 1 January 1982. In the first quarter of 1982 $A1.0m was spent in Australia while $A2.2m was spent in the United States of America. The joint venturers also agreed that a further $A2.0m spent in Australia in the latter half of 1981 on slot cut sampling at the Rundle site and shipping be included as expenditure under the commitment. Thus of the $A5.2m spent under the Rundle Joint Venture Agreement up to the end of March 1982, $A3.0m was spent in Australia and $A2.2m in the United States of America.</PARA>
<PARA> None of the $A30m commitment by Esso to the Rundle project is connected in any way to expenditure on or com- mitted to the Exxon Colony shale oil project in Colorado.</PARA>
