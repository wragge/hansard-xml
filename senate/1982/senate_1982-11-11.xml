I refer to a report in today's Canberra Times which states that Trans Australia Airlines has told airline unions that it wants to cut its staff by 350 by early next year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been well known for some time that TAA has been in a very difficult financial position. Substantial losses were incurred in 1981-82. It has been acknowledged for some time that retrenchments would need to be undertaken by TAA. In fact, I think an announcement was made some two months ago in that respect. Naturally, it would be the Government's concern to see that those who were retrenched found work in other areas as quickly as possible. The Government would be concerned as to the outcome. To obtain information on measures that might be taken in respect of the kind of situation outlined by Senator Colston I will need to refer the question to the Minister.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand the sufferings of honourable senators opposite but we have to help them out of their problems. I ask the Minister: Firstly, what action will be taken by the Government to ensure that the rights of non- smokers and, in particular, those people who are forced to become involuntary smokers are recognised and protected? Secondly, what steps, if any, have been taken by the Government to protect the rights of non-smokers in the Commonwealth Public Service?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the poll which appeared in the Melbourne Age but I am aware of the emerging majority of Australians who share the attitudes which Senator Missen has set out in his question as coming from that poll and indicating the views of citizens. A majority of Australians now share the views expressed by Senator Missen. Smokers who exercise their right to smoke are a minority of the community. Senator Missen's question falls into two parts. Some of the matters raised in the Age poll really fall within State areas of responsibility. For example, I do not think that the Commonwealth could legislate in regard to taxis, restaurants, doctors' waiting rooms, et cetera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth can have an interest in the second part of Senator Missen's question which relates to Commonwealth Public Service operations and the rights of non-smokers within the Commonwealth Public Service. It is my understanding, without having any detailed information with me, that there is a code within the Commonwealth Public Service which attempts to regulate the rights of smokers and non-smokers; that there is a provision for the setting aside of non-smoking areas in buildings and in departments; that smoking is not allowed in public areas or lifts in Commonwealth Public Service areas; that negotiation generally takes place with those officers of the Public Service who want to work in smoke free areas; and that non-smoking areas are provided. The Commonwealth has a policy in place and it is being extended, mostly by negotiation and agreement. This is the way in which we have tried to move. I cannot answer the honourable senator about what is happening in other areas, some of which are outside our control. I think he will agree that the effort to move within the Public Service represents an attempt to respond to what is an emerging majority view in Australia.</PARA>

Certainly the transport problems of Tasmania are very much connected with the affairs of the maritime unions.

Because there are now 504,800 persons in Australia willing to work, looking for some kind of work and unable to find work, because this figure represents a record since the Great Depression of the 1930s, because of Press reports that the Acting Prime Minister has rather quaintly stated that the Government has no immediate plans to alleviate the situation and because the House of Representatives in an outrageous act of cynicism has risen for the year after sitting for only 26 days in this half of the year, will the Minister declare whether the Government is contemplating any action?

The Government and the people of Australia regard the present level of unemployment as very serious indeed. The level of unemployment is primarily caused by the fact that the world is in a major recession, Australia is a major trading nation and there has been a very serious fall-off in trade. It is caused also by the fact that as a result of a soaring wage rate of something like 17 1/2 per cent last year we have costed ourselves very seriously out of world markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is very keen indeed to do everything it possibly can to abate unemployment. We have, of course, been undertaking a great number of incentive schemes-job training, transition from school to work programs and others. We have, in fact, provided within the last Budget a series of incentives to restrain the need for the upward pressure of wages. This is fundamental. We have provided in the last Budget a net incentive to people of something like $17 a week. This will be free of tax. It is the equivalent of something like a gross increase of $30 a week. We are looking towards ways in which we can further improve the employment possibilities in this community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By cutting tariffs by 25 per cent across the board in 1974, the Labor Party-they grin about it now-disemployed 110,000 Australians in one year. These are the people who come here today and scream and interject about unemployment when the main architects of unemployment in this country were those who created the huge upsurge in unemployment. There was a 37 1/2 per cent increase in wages in the space of 18 months and a disemployment of 110,000 people in 1974.

All the shouting by the Labor Party to prevent this answer will do no good because the louder Opposition members shout the more I will bring the facts to the attention of the Australian people. The primary ways in which the Labor Party can help are to stop provocation and to ensure that there is wage restraint and an abatement of industrial unrest in this country.

The Government certainly has this matter constantly under review. I know nothing of the Press statement. The fact that the House of Representatives is to resume is now established. The fact is that there is no relationship at all between the number of days that the House of Representatives or the Senate might sit and the policies for the overcoming of unemployment.

The Senate has had and has such opportunities. I repeat that this is a very serious matter. If one wants to put Australia back into a favourable trading position, one must secure an abatement of costs in this country. The rising costs in this country, which have been due essentially to a wage push in the last year, have costed us out of world markets by comparison with other member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. We were in the first quarter of high inflation countries in the days of the Whitlam Government. We then improved our position until our costs put us in the lowest quarter. Recently that position has been reversed because of the decline in inflation in other countries. We must come down in our costs if we are to match those countries.

It is designed to make available to those who are offering medical services a better understanding of what is needed for Aboriginal Australians. I think the AMA deserves complete commendation by the Senate for what it has produced and for the way in which it has been done.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand why Senator Button is getting anxious now because he can see the answer in its clarity. The fact is that in 1980 the flow of investment that was indicated for commitment fully supported the statements by Sir Phillip Lynch and the Treasurer. From recollection the total amount that was envisaged and published for commitment in Australia was a figure , on the Australian Government's measurement, in the order of $32 billion or $33 billion. That year and the year afterwards the Wran Labor Government, led by the Federal President of the Australian Labor Party, published authoritative documents which stated that in New South Wales alone there would be a commitment of capital and jobs in the order of $23 billion to $26 billion. I talk from recollection. In other words, something like 60 per cent to 70 per cent of this commitment was to take place in New South Wales. The Wran Government's figures showed that what Sir Phillip Lynch and Mr Howard were saying was, in the Labor Party's view, very modest indeed and that the real figure was much larger. That was the stated view of the Federal President of the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is more, the printed document and the policy speech of the Labor Party went on to say that if the Labor Party were re-elected New South Wales would have such abundant electric power, which would be the cheapest in Australia, that it would be able to attract such capital that there would be full employment in New South Wales. We are talking about the major industrial State of Australia which accounts for 40 per cent of Australian industry. I was asked whether the two Federal Ministers made certain comments and whether they were a distortion of facts. Far from a distortion of facts, the evidence from the major State, by a Labor Premier, was that it was an underestimation of the evidence that had been put forward. That Premier, the Federal President of the Labor Party, said: 'Re-elect the State Labor Government and we will get full employment in New South Wales'.</PARA>

On the judgment of experts that State now has the dearest commercial and industrial electricity in countries of the free world. It has growing unemployment, and what the Wran Government said was wrong. The answer is: Since 1980-81 companies that have committed investment in this country have abated that. The Chemical Bank of America, in a very recent statement analysing investment in Australia, stated that these figures would not be proved wrong in this decade and that there would be some slippage of a year or two in their actual implementation. The Bank stated that investment in Australia in this decade would be as much as or more than had been foreshadowed. The Premier of New South Wales and one of the most prestigious investment bodies in the world, the Chemical Bank of America, supported the fact that that diagnosis was true.</PARA></TALK.START>

Sir Phillip Lynch and Mr Howard made a far more modest estimate than the Labor Party made at that time. The Labor Party said that through its Premier and Federal President. Nothing that Senator Button can gainsay gets away from the fact that there are published booklets showing that the Labor Party claimed at that time far more investment trends than ever the Commonwealth Government did and that the Commonwealth Government's estimates were very modest compared with the Labor Party's estimates of that date.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think at the outset I should say that neither Australia nor the world should be bemused in any way by what is undoubtedly a very temporary glut of petroleum products in the world. The fact is that all the most authoritative commentators are convinced that this will be a temporary situation and that in the latter part of this decade we will return to shortages and, indeed, to higher prices. Those who look at the Middle East and particularly at the Iraq-Iran war can look with only the greatest trepidation at the very great danger of destabilisation of a centre of one of the world's most important oil production sources. Having said that, I say that it is, of course, the bounden duty of governments which are importers of petroleum products to look towards their own sources. I have to say that in the present year, whilst there is some indication that the bonanza in development and exploration will be not as great as was forecast last year, the situation has been such that supplies have been immensely greater than they were in the previous year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Petroleum exploration and development drilling in the first nine months of 1982 exceeded that achieved in the whole of the previous year. For example, in the first nine months of 1982, 117 exploration wells were drilled compared with 142 in the full year of 1981. In nine months 35 off-shore wells were drilled compared with 16 in a full year. In nine months 86 development wells were drilled compared with 41 in a full year. There were 10 off-shore development wells drilled compared with 14 in the previous full year. The total expenditure this year on exploration and development will be in the order of $2.3 billion. Whilst there is evidence that the peak of activity has passed and that there will be some settling down, nevertheless, in view of the world glut at this moment what is happening in Australia is very interesting indeed. There will be a reduced pace of activity. Nevertheless, we have made progress this year in modest--</PARA>

The doctor is now practising in South Australia. What measures, if any , has the Department of Health initiated to rectify urgently this highly questionable practice of dual registration of doctors whereby, if they are struck off the medical practitioners' roll in one State, they can simply move to another State where they are also registered?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the consequences of having a federal system is that each State and Territory has a separate method of registering doctors and, I imagine, other professionals. There has been some move over the last few years to work towards the establishment of an Australian medical council, to have a common body to set standards and carry out registration. However, this would require agreement between the States and Territories affected. We would need a package to which all could agree and which they could all implement. I understand that it has not yet been possible to get to that stage. A lot of work has been done. I believe Emeritus Professor Eric Saint was involved as chairman of the body working towards the establishment of an Australian medical council. Those of us who know Professor Saint will know that he is a highly respected person. He has been trying to get people to agree to the formation of this council, which would have both examining and registration functions if it were agreed to by the various parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not certain that the problem set out by Senator Elstob relates basically to the fact that there is dual registration. There is nothing basically wrong with dual registration. The fault might well lie with the fact that there may have been failure to pass information between States. We would like to be certain that information regarding a doctor struck off in one State for certain misdemeanours would go to all the other registering authorities. It may be that the error lies there. I will ask the Minister whom I represent whether there is some way in which we can perform a facilitating role or at least encourage the States and Territories to make known to each other that kind of information. That may overcome the problem to which Senator Elstob has referred.</PARA>

I do not know that what is envisaged by the Leader of the Opposition would be of very great help if the freezing of State charges were to be compensated for by the Federal Government. State charges have been instrumental in imposing a large element of cost on much of manufacturing industry as well as on families and people generally. This has urged people to seek wage increases. What really need to be taken into account at this time are the wage levels being sought and gained by those who have employment. We should look at the effect that that may have on their own continuing employment and the opportunities for employment for those who are at present unemployed. I think that Commonwealth, State and local governments, together with the trade unions and employers, all have a responsibility to see that the level of wages that is sought is consistent with the reduction of inflation and the improvement of our competitiveness in the market in which we seek to sell our services and commodities. What has been suggested by the Federal Labor Opposition, which seeks action only from the Commonwealth Government, ignores the responsibility that ought to be shared in many of these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>

Of course, vastly different international circumstances influence unemployment today. I believe that unemployment in America today is running at a much higher rate than it is in Australia. I am well aware of the circumstances of the New Deal in America. I remind Senator Mason that those who understand the history of the New Deal will understand that the strength of the Democratic Party in those days was that it was able to persuade the trade union movement of America to work with the Government of the day to achieve certain ends. That was a fundamental of the success of the New Deal. Indeed, it is something that this Government is advocating very strongly in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

That, of course, was also recognised by Mr Hayden in 1975, when he said that simply turning on money, to create employment by inflation, would not solve the problem at all; it would create more unemployment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It is reported that 107 people have been apprehended for smuggling Australian birds, animals and reptiles since 1975. The figures cited indicate that the illegal trade is increasing in volume. During its inquiry into quarantine the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources heard evidence that a large number of Australian birds die because of this trade and that smuggling is likely to increase because of the high value of these birds, animals and reptiles overseas. It seems to me that the obvious way to stop this terrible trade, or at least substantially to reduce it, is to permit the controlled export of those Australian birds, animals and reptiles which are in large numbers in Australia. Will the Government seriously consider this suggestion?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Acting Attorney-General: Which particular forces of reaction are making the Government so obviously duck for cover on the series of family law reforms to which it previously purported to be committed? In particular, why has the Family Law Amendment Bill, which has now been buried on the bottom of the Notice Paper for over a year, not been brought on for debate, which means presumably it will not be enacted till the middle of next year? Further, why has the Government not moved to set in train the inquiry into matrimonial property law which was announced by Senator Durack as far back as October 1981? Further, in relation to the matrimonial property inquiry, why has the Government now apparently refused to appoint one of the nation's leading experts in this respect, Professor David Hambly, to head that inquiry notwithstanding that negotiations to that effect were entered into, as I understand it, with Professor Hambly some months ago, which negotiations led him to abandon his deanship of the Law Faculty at the Australian National University and a series of other research projects in reasonable anticipation that he would be running the inquiry this year?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the question and the elements in it are irrelevant to the situation. The fact is that at present hundreds of thousands of Australians, even millions, are receiving concessional loans. There are people receiving concessional loans through banks, insurance companies, the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, the Reserve Bank of Australia, subsidiaries of Federal and State governments, the Defence Service Homes Corporation and many other institutions. It was well known, and availed of fully by Labor members at the time, that if there was a justification for having a house in Canberra, a member, a Minister, whatever the Government, could get such a loan. That was availed of by Labor Party Ministers and used by them. Now it suits them to be selective, as they have been, and as they were in the tax recoupment argument. It has no relevance at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The interjection is: 'Answer the question'. It hurts the Opposition if in fact we show the Opposition's selectivity. The fact of the matter is that many people with high incomes in the community, particularly in the business world, are receiving concessional loans. There is absolutely no way of knowing at all to what extent this is done. It is obvious that in business, commerce, industry and in other ways concessional loans are available. It would be impossible to know the full extent but if we take the range of people in Australia receiving concessions there would be very many Australians so doing. The fact of the matter is that when Labor Ministers on high incomes sought and gained those loans at low interest rates it was all right, but it is not good when members of opposing parties were able to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking of the consensus in society. Senator Martyr can make his childish interjections if he wishes. But the fact of the matter is that if honourable senators opposite listen to me and understand what I am talking about they will see that there is no consensus on those matters in this country any more. The institution of Parliament and the concept of a legitimately elected government were irreparably damaged by Fraser in 1975. The important point, of course, is no longer what happened in 1975; it is that the spirit of 1975 and the values of 1975 live on in this Government. In 1977 Professor Manning Clark, giving the Boyer lectures on the Australian Broadcasting Commission, said this country had been taken over by what he called 'interest men with the values of receivers in bankruptcy'. Honourable senators opposite are interest rate men all right; under this Government we are experiencing the highest interest rates this country has ever seen. The Government is a collection of interest rate men-experts on that topic. We are experiencing the highest rates this country has ever seen. I refer again to Question Time when the double standards of this Government which gave the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) a 4 3/4 per cent housing concessional loan were raised. At that time the general interest rate was about 8 1/2 per cent. In 1974 the then Opposition moved a censure motion against the Labor Government because interest rates had gone up to 9 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They were the values in those days and they are the values of today. The point I make is that the values of 1975 live on in the way this Government operates. As the country slides into further economic ruin every decision is governed by political expediency rather than by values. The values which motivated the Leader of the Opposition in 1975 are ones of cynicism and the desire to dominate the policies of any government. The driving ambition was to get into power, to use power, to manipulate it, and to use the institutions of this country to maintain power. The values of Fraserism then, as now, were no attempt at consensus, but at divide and rule, cynicism and political expediency. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the 1977 election, for example. It is said with what I call intellectual cowardice by spokesmen in this Government that all the responsibility for the present economic chaos in this country lies, first of all , with overseas factors or, secondly, with the trade unions. When honourable senators opposite justified an early election in 1977 the Deputy Prime Minister said: 'We have to have an early election so we can show that we can stand up to the unions'. He was accepting his responsibilities then. What has happened since ? Has the Government succeeded in that aim? Of course, it has not. That was the sort of proposition which was floated at the time. What we have in this country is government by scapegoat, government by alibi-alibis which were not conceded to the Whitlam Government in 1974 and 1975 although, as Senator Jessop said in the Senate yesterday, we are now seeing the biggest international recession since 1974-75. At that time the Prime Minister said that if the Ministers were honourable men they would stand up and admit that it was their responsibility and not the responsibility of overseas factors. Not too many honourable Ministers are saying that sort of thing today. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1980 election there was another example of scapegoat politics, illusion politics-the resources boom which was promising tens of thousands of jobs. Dishonesty was displayed in those suggestions. There have been international alibis all the time. But there are no alibis for a government which was elected to power in 1975 on the assumption that it could do better, and which assumed responsibility to do better. There is no alibi for a government which has uniquely succeeded in having an enormously high inflation rate and the highest levels of unemployment since the Great Depression at the same time. There is no other government with that record of success-if one likes to call it success. This Government is unique in producing those two factors at the same time, together with an enormous overseas debt for this country. </PARA>
<PARA> All these matters cannot be denied after seven years of this Government. What was done instead was to try to set groups against each other in this society. We do not hear much today about the dole bludger syndrome. That was the stunt in 1976 and 1977. Will the Government call half a million Australians dole bludgers in 1982? I do not think so. The suggestion that has continued since the beginning of this Government is that all the problems of this country can be laid at the door of the unions but the Government has no wages policy. Mr Peacock says that, I say it, and it has not been denied by Government Ministers at any time. The Government has no wages policy. The wages explosion which took off in Australia in 1981 was the direct result of the Prime Minister giving more importance to going to the royal wedding than to dealing with wages issues in this country, as he should have done. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission abandoned wage indexation in 1981 and the Government did nothing. It has done nothing since to try to restore a centralised wage fixation system in this country, which would have produced much better results in terms of inflation and equity. We have seen continued cowardly attempts to confer on everybody else the responsibilities which governments ought to assume. Governments are elected to govern. It is no good Senator Sir John Carrick saying at Question Time that Mr Wran was wrong too . These sorts of statements are petty-minded alibis. His responsibility is as a Minister in the Commonwealth Government of Australia. We stand here today in the wreckage of Fraserism, seeing a Government bereft of ideas and presiding over an economic crisis and vast social inequities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. It was his task, he said, to restore growth, to provide jobs for everybody who wanted to work, to provide prosperity for Australians and to provide sound economic management. I ask Senator Lewis-the very noisy chap that he is-to say whether the Prime Minister has fulfilled his task. Senator Sir John Carrick will say it was not his task at all, it was the responsibility of Neville Wran or somebody like that. But it was the task of the Prime Minister and of the Government to do those things because that is what it said it would do and that is what justified the abysmal performance on 11 November 1975.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the statistics. In 1975, the rate of unemployment was 5 per cent ; in 1977, 5.5 per cent; in 1982, for the last quarter, 7.4 per cent. Now it is 7.8 per cent. The inflation rate for the year at the end of the September quarter in 1975 was 12 per cent. That is the last quarter for which we have figures. In 1977 it was 13.1 per cent; in 1982, 12.3 per cent. Those are the figures of a government which said that it was not so much concerned about unemployment, as it would fight inflation first. As I said last week, as Senator Lewis knows, the Government should pick on something smaller because it is getting hell beaten out of it in its fight against inflation first. The Government really ought to try to pick on something smaller because it is not doing much good in that area. The promises of economic management have collapsed around the Prime Minister's ears. There is no better example of that in Australian society than to quote the words of J. K. Galbraith when he was discussing the sort of half baked monetarist policies of this Government. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Under monetarism the rich need more money as an incentive. The poor need less as an incentive. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what has happened under this Government. Of course, the international comparisons for this country are alarming. Australia is rapidly sliding down the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development scale in relation to its economic management and performance. It was eighth on the list in 1976 in terms of gross domestic product. It was fifteenth on the list in 1981 and going down. In six years of government that comparative change came about. The comparisons with Austria, Germany, Japan and other countries do no credit to this Government . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know. The honourable senator might as well ask me what the divorce rate is or something else. I am talking about the key indices of economic management. The simple point is that in comparative terms the economic policies of this Government have failed and have resulted in national disaster. Let me say a brief word about taxation. Under this Government, taxation has become an enormous vehicle for social division. The effect of the tax changes since 1975 has been to place a greater tax burden on lower and middle income earners. The average rate of taxation for those on high incomes of around $30, 000 or more-the Mr Doug Anthonys of this world-has fallen since 1975-76. I said those people on incomes of $30,000 or more. The percentage of tax paid by pay-as -you-earn taxpayers has risen as a percentage of total tax revenue. The percentage of company tax has fallen, of course, for reasons pointed out in the McCabe-Lafranchi report and the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Professor Mathews said, if this Government had collected the revenue, if it had shown as much keenness and zeal about collecting the taxation revenue of this country as it had showed in messing about with minor cuts in Government expenditure, then the balance of payments situation would have been better, the interest rate situation in this country would have been better and there would not be the vast division between rich and poor which has arisen as a result of this Government's policies. Of course, there are political consequences as well as the tragic economic consequences of what took place on 11 November 1975. They are consequences which are reflected in the debasement of political life in this country, for instance, the incapacity of this Government to obtain a consensus in society because nobody trusts it; the total ad hockery of every policy which this Government embarks upon. We do not talk about these issues as much as we ought to. But the fact of the matter is that in the last seven years there has been no real government imagination or initiative to do anything to develop new industries in this country or to restructure existing industries. The Government lumbers on from by-election to by-election hoping that something like a resources boom, a trade union strike or something else will turn up to help it through the next election. Time is running out for all those things. They will not work any more. They worked for two or three elections, but they will not work any more. That is a tragedy for the country but it is a greater tragedy for the Government because the consequences will be seen next year. There have also been no constitutional initiatives by this Government. My colleague, Senator Evans, of course, will be dealing with those matters. But what--</PARA>

All that they can claim after seven years in government is that somebody else is responsible, that it is not their fault. They just keep their backsides on the white taxi seats which is their right because of some curious event which happened on 11 November 1975. One has to look at the realities of the performance of this Government. Over seven years it has been one of gradually accelerating disaster because of a lack of imagination, initiative and concern about the real issues. The cynical manipulative issues which developed in 1975 still remain the values of the Fraser Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 11 November 1975, exactly seven years ago, the Whitlam Labor Government was dismissed because of its misconduct in office. Subsequently the people of Australia elected the Fraser Liberal Government with massive majorities in the three Federal elections in 1975, 1977 and 1980. It has been a popular pastime of members of the Australian Labor Party over the seven years to respond to the injunction 'maintain your rage' of their former leader-they are now tearing him apart in the United Nations; they want to disown him-by saying that there was a very serious incident on 11 November 1975 that touched the constitutional and parliamentary institution. They have argued two things. I think it is a good thing that we have an opportunity today to remind people of what happened on 11 November 1975. The argument of the Labor Party is that the Governor-General acted improperly and the then Opposition took improper action by blocking Supply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to deal with these two important points. I will seek leave in a moment to incorporate in Hansard the official media statement of the then Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, on 27 February 1974, as printed in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, announcing the appointment of Sir John Kerr as the Governor- General in terms that indicated that the Labor Party believed he was eminently equipped to be the Governor-General in all respects. That statement was repeated and re-endorsed totally by the Labor Party throughout the ensuing months. The Labor Party knew that Sir John Kerr had been a member of the Labor Party in the past. It believed that Sir John Kerr would do its bidding. It acknowledged to the world that he was uniquely equipped to understand consitutional problems at State and Federal levels. Mr Whitlam's statement said that. The Labor Party therefore endorsed Sir John Kerr as the ideal kind of Governor-General. I repeat : It appointed him. I repeat: It knew that he had been previously a member of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party's error was believing that a man of that kind of intellect and that kind of probity would be the lackey of the Labor Party. The error was not that of the Governor-General; the error was that the Labor Party believed that because it appointed him he must do its will even though he knew it to be wrong. I seek leave to incorporate that statement by Mr Whitlam in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>APPOINTMENT OF GOVERNOR-GENERAL</PARA>
<PARA>Media Statement, E. G. Whitlam, 27 February 1974</PARA>
<PARA> It is announced today from Government House, Canberra, that Her Majesty The Queen has graciously approved the appointment of the Hon. Sir John Kerr, K.C.M.G ., to be Governor-General of Australia. He will take up office at the end of June this year when the present Governor-General, Sir Paul Hasluck, relinquishes his appointment. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir John has been Chief Justice of New South Wales and Lieutenant-Governor since 1972. He has had a distinguished career in both the law and public administration. After war service with the Second A.I.F., Sir John was the first Principal of the Australian School of Pacific Administration. He then followed a distinguished career at the Bar in New South Wales, becoming a Queen's Counsel in 1953. In 1966 he was appointed a Judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court and a Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. He has also served as a Judge of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory and has held other Australian judicial commissions. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir John has held a number of executive positions in the legal profession, including President of the New South Wales Bar Association, President of the Law Council of Australia and foundation President of the Law Association of Asia and the Western Pacific. He has also served on a number of Government bodies, including, in 1968 as Chairman of the Committee on Review of Administration Decisions, and in 1970 as Chairman of the Committee on Review of Pay for the Armed Services. In 1971 he conducted an inquiry into the salaries and allowances of Members of the Australian Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir John was appointed C.M.G. in 1966 and K.C.M.G. this year. Sir John's significant attainments in the field of law and administration have given him a familiarity with Australian Government and State Government affairs and he is of course, well known throughout Australia. All Australians will join me in congratulating Sir John and welcoming him and Lady Kerr to their high appointments. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me make clear the only reason that members of the Labor Party are maintaining their rage. Indeed, Labor members in the passage on that day said to me: 'He couldn't do it. He couldn't do it. I do not believe he could do it'. They believed that, having been a member of the Labor Party in the past, he would be subservient to their will and not do his duty in the law as he saw it. They failed in that judgment. He did not fail. He acted, as constitutional lawyers over the years have indicated, superlatively correctly. Indeed, it was the Labor Party's misjudgment which brought about the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Now let us step to the next argument, that it was wicked of the then Liberal Opposition to oppose Supply. Everybody knows that. Labor Party members have said that 100 times. Now they are weakening. Every new statement by Senator Evans weakens it. Of course, recently Mr Keating said: 'Given a chance, we would bolt and we would reject Supply'. Let us have a little joy about this. It was a sin to reject Supply, was it? I will now read to the Senate the statement on 18 June 1970 by the then Senator Lionel Murphy, speaking as the official spokesman of the Labor Party on the policy of the Labor Party on money Bills and Supply. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He was the Leader, I am reminded. I quote from Hansard of that date. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate is entitled and expected to exercise resolutely but with discretion its power to refuse its concurrence to any financial measure, including a tax Bill. There are no limitations on the Senate in the use of its constitutional powers, except the limitations imposed by discretion and reason. The Australian Labor Party has acted consistently in accordance with the tradition that we will oppose in the Senate any tax or money Bill or other financial measure whenever necessary to carry out our principles and policies.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that members of the Labor Party would reject any tax or money Bill or any financial measure if it suits them. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has done this over the years, and in order to illustrate the tradition which has been established-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the tradition of rejecting Supply Bills-</PARA>
<PARA>with the concurrence of honourable senators I shall incorporate in Hansard at the end of my speech a list of the measures of an economic or financial nature, including taxation and appropriation Bills, which have been opposed by this Opposition in whole or in part by a vote in the Senate since 1950. </PARA>
<PARA>For the joy of the Senate I will seek leave to re-incorporate in Hansard the list of those many Bills, including Appropriation Bills, which the Labor Party in Opposition sought to oppose. So the two things-the two absolute arguments on this-go. The Labor Party said that the Governor-General was pre-eminently suited as a jurist of world renown to be the Governor-General. That was quite clear. Constitutional lawyers have indicated that, in fact, he acted with absolute propriety and probity. The Labor Party has said that not only is it right to reject Supply but also it would do that, repeatedly-and it has done so repeatedly. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened on 11 November 1975, to which this matter of public importance relates directly? The community of Australia had watched the tragedy of scandal after scandal, the latest had been the removal of Mr Connor by his Prime Minister for having given-according to the Prime Minister's statement-false information. The Labor Party had, in fact, corrupted the constitutional and parliamentary processes by calling a completely unconstitutional Executive Council behind the Governor-General's back and without his knowledge. This is the party that is now talking about constitutional, parliamentary and administrative procedures. In fact, the Whitlam Labor Government, without telling the Governor-General, held an Executive Council meeting. It did so quite illegally. For what purpose did it do that? To get through the Khemlani loan-a completely contemptuous situation. The Labor Party did not tell the Governor- General that the Khemlani loan was such that it would have bankrupted Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand that the recitation of the facts of 11 November 1975 must hurt the Labor Party. Once this has been said I never want again to hear this nonsensical alibi. Bear in mind what members of the Labor Party are trying to do. They will never admit to themselves or to anyone else that they were defeated because of their own mismanagement, misbehaviour and scandals. They want to suggest that they were beaten by the umpire. They were indeed beaten by the umpire three times-at the ballot box in 1975, 1977, and 1980. They are saying that they were not beaten at all, that it was all a constitutional impropriety. What I have said today has properly exploded that. In those years there had been the devastation of the Khemlani loans affair, the devastation caused by Cairns, and all the mismanagement, bungling and allegations of impropriety. There were the quarrels over Connor and, of course, the demotion of the Minister for Labor and Immigration. All this at a time when Australia needed good government. Labor Party members talk about the consequences. The consequences were that the Australian people looked at those years and said: 'The Labor Party failed miserably in office on every score. It must go out and we are going to keep it out'. They have done that and will do so .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So let us not talk again about 11 November, except in its true perspective-a situation in which an eminently qualified and internationally recognised jurist, the Governor-General of Australia, acted with full propriety. He did not behave like the lackey of the Labor Party. The Opposition of the day did what the Labor Party had said was its official policy-to reject Supply when that opportunity occurred. The then Opposition did what the Labor Party had done repeatedly. That is the background. We are asked in this discussion on a matter of public importance to look at the constitutional, political, parliamentary and administrative aspects of the events of those days. The people of Australia have already done so at the ballot box. They have said: 'We will not have a bar of your unconstitutional and unparliamentary behaviour, your administrative mismanagement'. </PARA>
<PARA> I have traced the background. Let me come now to the hard facts. In Question Time today I believe it was alleged that I had given false information on the trend of inflation in Australia. I now cite the inflation rates. I gave the figures for the year to the last quarter of 1975, the September quarter. I said the inflation rate was 17.6 per cent for the year ended in that quarter. I have figures for the June quarter. They are official Treasury figures. Let us hear Opposition senators say they are lies, fibs, or whatever they like to say. In 1970-71 the inflation rate was 4.8 per cent; in 1971-72 it was 6.8 per cent. Now we come to the three years of the Labor Government. In 1972-73 the inflation rate was 6 per cent; in 1973-74 it was 12.9 per cent. It had doubled. In 1974-75 it was 16.7 per cent. What do I hear about untruths? Then the Labor Government was dismissed. Inflation in the June quarter of 1975 was running at 16.7 per cent when it had been between 4 per cent and 6 per cent when the Labor Party came into office. It nearly tripled. In the financial year 1975-76 the inflation rate was 13 per cent. In the next year, 1976-77, it was 13.8 per cent. Those are the years of the Fraser Government. In 1977-78 it was 9.5 per cent; in 1978-79 it was 8.2 per cent. Those figures are against the rate of 16.7 per cent during the Labor Government's term. In 1979-80 the inflation rate was 10.1 per cent; in 1980-81 it was 9.4 per cent; and in 1981-82 it was 10.4 per cent. I seek leave to have those figures incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite clearly, these figures give a king hit to Senator Button because he said that there was a disastrous movement in the inflation rate after the Labor Party was tipped out of office. What have we seen ? The inflation rate, which at the end of the June quarter of 1974-75 was 16.7 per cent and soaring-in fact it rose to 17.6 per cent by the end of the next quarter-has been brought down very substantially.</PARA></TALK.START>

<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK" NAMEID="2U4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me talk unemployment because we are very interested in this matter. Honourable senators will remember that at Question Time today I was accused of telling lies, untruths and fibs in giving the figures I gave. It is strange now that when I produce them and put 11 November 1975 in its true perspective we do not get a whimper because I am telling the truth about the situation. In the space of 18 months from 1973-74 wages in Australia rose by 37 per cent. That was the beginning of the wage push. Australia moved from being a country with one of the lowest rates of inflation and one of the highest rates of full employment in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in the 1950s and 1960s-the average unemployment rate and the average inflation rate were below 2 per cent-into the top bracket in the Whitlam years. That was not bad in the space of three reckless and wrecking years. What also happened? The Labor Government made a tariff cut across the board of 25 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Labor Party talks about unemployment. That wound to the manufacturing industry has never healed. In one year more than 110,000 people in Australia were disemployed out of manufacturing. Manufacturing has never recovered from the absolute shock and devastation. How can the Australian Labor Party be proud of itself when, in one year, it disemployed 110,000 people? Members of the Labor Party have deliberately said that they believed that the people overseas who make the goods and export them to Australia ought to get the jobs rather than the Australians. That is what they said. If tariffs are cut by 25 per cent- honourable senators should bear in mind that this Government is maintaining the tariffs-we are inviting countries overseas to use their workmen in the place of Australian workmen. A total of 110,000 people were disemployed. That started the fundamental rot which has taken an emormous time for this Government to recover from. The fact is that the Labor Party talks about things but in fact when one looks at them there is no truth in them at all.</PARA>
<PARA> Today Mr Hayden is saying we must spend thousands of millions more; in fact, let us get the deficit up. Mr Hawke is breathing behind his neck and wanting more. Mr Hayden is saying that the way to create jobs is to spend more money. Mr Hayden was the Treasurer in 1974-75. In his Budget Speech he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> On the economic front, inflation is this nation's most menacing enemy. We aim to curb it. Unless this aim is achieved, the nation's productive capacity will run down and job opportunities will diminish.</PARA>
<PARA> Our present level of unemployment is too high. If we fail to control inflation unemployment will get worse.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me make that clear. Mr Hayden stated the Fraser Government's policy today. The Labor Party is denying it because it is in opposition. Let us remember that today he says that we must spend more. In his Budget Speech he continued:</PARA>
<PARA> We are no longer operating in that simple Keynesian world in which some reduction in unemployment could, apparently, always be purchased at the cost of some more inflation. Today, it is inflation itself which is the central policy problem. More inflation simply leads to more unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> Some might argue that a large deficit could be offset by a tough monetary policy-but this would mean greatly increased interest rates, disruption in financial markets, further depression of business confidence and serious company failures. That is an unacceptable option.</PARA>
<PARA>The very unacceptable option is the option that Mr Hayden and Mr Hawke put forward in recent days and which every newspaper in Australia, including the Australian Financial Review, condemned out of hand. In other words, the Labor Party comes along with a whimper trying to find an alibi for its failure in 1975 and trying to blame that failure on the umpire instead of itself. I am sure all honourable senators remember the quotation from Shakespeare:</PARA>
<PARA>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in Ourselves, . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That was the message of 11 November 1975. The fault was that members of the Labor Party believed that a highly equipped Governor-General, a highly respected jurist, would obey them rather than his conscience. He obeyed his judgment and his conscience.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to honour with a detailed reply the intellectually and morally poverty stricken diatribe we have just heard from the Leader of the Government (Senator Sir John Carrick). I want to make a more constructive contribution to this debate, which is about the consequences of 11 November 1975. But before I do get on to that more constructive contribution, let me just correct the record on a couple of economic statistics around which Senator Sir John Carrick built the whole of that particular morally, intellectually and factually poverty stricken diatribe that we have just heard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the case that when one looks at inflation rates for one particular quarter and multiplies them by four-there were some bad quarters in the period of the Whitlam Administration-one can come up with the kind of inflation figures that Senator Sir John Carrick has today. But let me remind him that if the most up to date inflation figures are used as the basis for calculation for the year ending in the September quarter 1982 the inflation rate was 12.3 per cent, whereas for the most immediately comparable period in the Whitlam Administration , the September year ending 1975, the inflation rate was 12 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Let Senator Sir John Carrick not go back five or six months and pluck a figure out of the air for the June quarter. Let him take the most recent quarterly figures that are available for the year ending September this particular year and he will find that the inflation comparisons, in fact, run the other way. The selective indignation is contemptible here as it is in so many other instances with Senator Sir John Carrick. Let us take the unemployment figures, which he did not deign to give us in anything like that degree of detail because he could not. In that case the comparisons are very odious and invidious. The current unemployment rates are 7.8 per cent actual and 8.2 per cent seasonally adjusted. Let Senator Sir John Carrick and those who defend him compare that with the unemployment rates that existed at any period in any quarter of the Whitlam administration and make a comparison there. Let us calculate the index of misery by adding together indexation and unemployment and comparing that index as it stood in any period of the Whitlam administration with the way in which that index stands now-right up over 20 points with an 8.2 per cent unemployment rate and a 12.3 per cent inflation rate. The record of this administration is absolutely abominable by reference to any economic criterion. </PARA>
<PARA> But let me go back to some of the other consequences of 11 November with which this matter of public importance is intended to deal and let me focus on the constitutional, parliamentary and administrative implications of the putsch of 11 November 1975. The dismissal of the Whitlam Government 7 years ago remains the most traumatic shock ever administered to the Australian constitutional system. I believe that democracy was put at risk by what happened on that day and by the events leading up to it in this chamber. I believe that so long as the constitution remains unamended to make impossible, or at least very difficult, a repetition of the events of that day democracy will remain at risk. That perception is shared, as we all know, not just by my colleagues in the labour movement but by many people right across the political spectrum. Some honourable senators who are whimpering at the moment share, if they are intellectually honest with themselves, a similar perception about the structural weaknesses of our present constitutional system which makes possible this kind of instability. Many of the more upright and courageous Government senators have expressed their position on these matters openly and overtly, not just in a hole in the corner way when privately pressed upon to do so. Bitter as those divisions that were generated by 1975 were, bitter as those divisions remain, as extensive as the ideological divide remains on a lot of these issues, it is important to appreciate that there is a perception in many parts of the community, including the political community, that the issues at stake transcend those immediate partisan, ideological preoccupations that so many of us have. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to appreciate that we do now have a situation, as a result of the legacy of the events of 11 November 1975, in which the Senate has the power, not only on paper but also in practice-one that is likely to be exercised-to bring down the Government of the day by blocking Supply, even when that Government has a clear mandate and a clear maintained majority in the other House. The Senate, an institution which is less democratic by any account in the method of its construction than the popular House, the lower House, the Senate, which has long since abdicated any claim or pretension to represent any other kind of interest in this nation as a States House, is in a position of overweening power as a result of this state of affairs. We have a situation, as a result of 1975 and the unamended constitution since 1975, of a Governor- General, himself not democratically elected, who has no claim to democratic legitimacy, entitled, it seems now, to intervene in an essentially political struggle and to strike down a democratically elected government in the way that happened. We have a situation in which, as a result of all this, we have an inbuilt, evident instability and uncertainty in our whole political and constitutional structure. It is a situation which is not doing anybody any good on either side of politics because of the continued uncertainty it creates about the way in which we go about our affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been the contribution over the last seven years of the Fraser Government to doing something about accommodating these difficulties which we all, in our saner and quieter moments, are aware do exist? The contribution of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and his senior Ministers has been dogged, churlish, pigheaded and unconstructive in every conceivable request. There has been no acknowledgment that a problem even exists, and to the extent, on occasions, that there is a partial acknowledgment that some kind of a problem might exist, there has been no willingness to debate that in any coherent or sensible way. There has been no willingness on the part of the senior Ministers of this Government to make any constructive contribution towards reaching some kind of consensus solution. </PARA>
<PARA> That is evident in a number of ways which I will briefly identify. It is evident in the statements and actions of Mr Fraser and his senior Ministers. It is evident, for a start, in the performance of Mr Fraser and his senior Ministers at the Australian Constitutional Convention held in Perth in 1978 when this matter was debated and where there was a dogged, churlish, pigheaded insistence on the Court proposal for dealing with this problem, a proposal which would do no more than simply endorse and institutionalise what actually happened in 1975 and create a situation where an automatic double dissolution followed upon any indefensible exercise by this chamber of its power over money Bills. This unwillingness to look for a middle way, a consensus solution-some solution to this problem-was evident in the attitude that has been demonstrated, not by all members on the other side but certainly by the senior members of the Government, to the fixed term parliament proposal which I introduced one year ago today, 11 November 1981. With a little bit of luck and good management, we might actually succeed in finalising the passage of that legislation through the Committee stage in this Parliament today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats have co-operated in producing a Bill which, although it will not provide a total and perfect solution to the institutional problems that were created by the events of 1975 or the problems of instability and uncertainty associated with our unfixed term debate, recognises that the kind of solution which has emerged from debate in this place is one that can make a serious contribution to solving an obvious and deep- rooted problem in our system. That perception has not been shared and that contibution has not been made by the senior members of the Government on the other side of the chamber. That is a matter for shame and unhappiness for those who want some sensible contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The attitudes to which I refer have been evident again in the 'constitutional reform' proposals, as he described them, of the Attorney-General, Senator Durack , which he floated in a major speech he made in May this year. In the course of describing his rejection of the fixed term parliament concept, he floated the possibility of a retention of the Senate's Supply blocking power but at the same time adopting some sort of convention whereby the Senate would be prevented from altering any detail of a government's Budget. That proposal is cynical in the extreme. It is the proposal of a government wanting to have its cake and to eat it too. The Government wants an exercise of self-denial by the Australian Labor Party, the Opposition, when it comes to harassing the Government on issues such as the sales tax proposals in last year's Budget, but will not involve itself in any willingness to engage in a similar act of self-denial by promising not to block Supply in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The narrow-minded atitude to which I have referred has been evident again in the atitude to constitutional reform generally demonstrated by the Government by the halting and faltering enthusiasm of Mr Fraser, Senator Durack and the rest- the feet dragging of them all-in the context of setting in train another session of the Australian Constitutional Convention, a convention which did have a degree of momentum with meetings in 1973, 1975, 1976 and 1978, but which has ground to a halt during the tenure of the latter years of the Fraser Administration. We have had the rejection of any willingness to talk about changing the character of that convention to make it more democratic, more representative, more open and more likely to encourage a spirit of change in the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had the extraordinary attitude finally of total pigheaded, insensitive rejection by the Prime Minister of the very serious-minded attempts at cross- party, cross-community, consensus that are currently being sponsored now by the Law Foundation of New South Wales in generating a proposal for systematic constitutional review with a view, perhaps, to systematic constitutional change by our 1988 bicentennial year, a process in which several prominent members of Mr Fraser's own party here in this Parliament are contributing very constructively. This was a process which Mr Fraser described in his Barton lecture earlier this year as 'one of the most divisive proposals that can be contemplated in Australia'. Coming from the man who brought us 11 November 1975, the effrontery in that kind of statement is absolutely breathtaking. For Malcolm Fraser, the man who is to the Australian Constitution-as I have said in the past -what Attila the Hun was to the Roman Empire to advance the proposition accusing of divisiveness those of us who are attempting in a very constructive and public spirited way to find some grounds for consensus is carrying cheek to the point of breathtaking grotesquery. </PARA>
<PARA> The constitutional legacy of the events of 1975 is a profoundly unhappy one. I hardly need to labour that point any more. But it ought to be appreciated that that unhappiness is evident in a number of other dimensions as well, such as the parliamentary dimension. The attitude to and the consequences of the divisions and bitterness of 1975 have made themselves manifest in the way in which we conduct this Parliament and in the way in which the institution of parliament has-far from flowering under the Fraser Administration -crumbled almost into cynical collapse. It is very close to collapse in many ways because of the actions of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to several instances. A very current one is the cynical manipulation of the parliamentary timetable. I instance the rising of the House of Representatives now, weeks early, in order to avoid the exposure and the scrutiny of the shoddiness of this Executive and this Administration by the Opposition. It is evident also in the sluggish way in which the Fraser Administration clamped down on and made impossible the rationalisation of parliamentary sitting hours. That was another sensible reform-promoted to a large extent by Senator Martin and others on the Government side-which was designed to get a more flexible, sensitive and civilised working environment in which the institutions of this nation could operate. But the great Monty Python kind of heel came thundering down from above in the tory party room. That was another move in the direction of achieving a sane and more civilised parliamentary institution which was crushed by the demagoguery and personal dictatorial tendencies of this Prime Minister who came to power in November 1975 . </PARA>
<PARA> We have had the cynical closing of the one decent experiment in the development of committees in the House of Representatives-the closure of the Estimates committees with the opportunities they presented for our House of Representatives colleagues to make a serious contribution to the analysis of Executive behaviour and administrative misbehaviour in the lifetime of this Government. That is the other major legacy and consequence to which I want to refer in winding up my remarks on the events of November 1975-the administrative consequences, and legacy, that this putsch of November 1975 has left the nation. We are talking administratively about a Government which came to power claiming, again as I have said, with breathtaking effrontery, to make up for the alleged incompetence or maladministration of the Labor Administration. It has proved to be the Government which has given us the tax evasion scandal, as revealed by the Costigan and McCabe reports. It is the Government which has given us the medifraud scandal which is being revealed in the current hearings of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. It is the Government which has given us the meat substitution scandal and the crude and vulgar attack from Mr Fraser on the judicial umpire which followed that. It is the Government which has given us the Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd scandal-and everything that has been associated with that-which was revealed, again, by one of the Government's chairman-led committees, Senator Rae's Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the wreckage of this Government's maladministration and Executive impropriety has been visible in the resignations, suspensions, dismissals and forced early retirements of over 20 Ministers from this Government. Other things have not been so visible. They have had to rise to the surface like bubbles breaking as gas from the fetid pond that represents the quality of this Government's administration. Bubbles have come up through the Finance and Government Operations Committee. Other bubbles are coming up through the Public Accounts Committee. Bubbles have risen through the slime from the reports of Costigan and miscellaneous other reports of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA> One way or another the truth is being revealed in a piecemeal way about the vaunted quality of administration, and the legacy in this respect which the Fraser Government has left to us. So, far from having a government which has saved the nation, we have a government which has plunged this country into economic despair in an unprecedented way-unprecedented since the Depression. It has made an unprecedented contribution to the index of misery, however one calculates it. We have a government which, far from saving this nation from bad government, has produced mismanaged government on a scale that is unprecedented in the history of this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Evans, he and his three colleagues are making enough noise. Senator Evans referred to the so-called constitutional crisis. I have said repeatedly that that is a euphemism for a political crisis. It was one of those rare occasions when this Parliament managed to summon up the courage to stand up to the Executive Government. It seems that whenever and wherever it happens, be it in Australia or in another country, as soon as a parliament has the courage to take a matter into its own hands and stands up to the Executive Government of the day there is a crisis. Senator Evans can call it a constitutional crisis: I can call it a political crisis. It is a crisis because it is a contest between the legislature-the parliament-and the Executive Government, and it is a constitutional political crisis which sometimes goes to a political death. That is precisely what happened in November 1975, and with all good reason.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally-it has taken until 1982-a member of the Australian Labor Party, a senator in this place, has got round to admitting some of the things that happened in 1975. I refer to a speech made by a Victorian colleague, Senator Robert Ray, who is a member of the Opposition. On 13 October 1982, at page 1363 of Hansard, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party does not claim to be totally clean. I think the lowest point in Labor Party history was the Iraqi breakfast when the Labor Party tried to borrow overseas money to pay for its election debts. None of us in the Labor Party is proud of that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Who said that?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was said by Senator Robert Ray, an ALP senator for Victoria. To my knowledge that is the first time that has been admitted in this Parliament . In fact, I think it is the first time it has ever been publicly admitted. At long last a Labor senator has had the courage to say: 'We are not proud of it'. I do not think honourable senators opposite are proud of bringing forward this subject today to maintain the rage. From observing the situation in the chamber at present, clearly there is less opposition now. As I was saying, when there is a crisis between the Executive Government and the parliament, the legislature, it is frequently because the government does not have the numbers in the Parliament. That was recognised by our founding fathers when they drew up the Constitution. They recognised that that would occasionally happen and they provided the solution. The solution is that the people should decide the matter. That is what happened in 1975. The conflict was resolved by an election. The Labor Party could have called an election if it had wanted but it refused to do so until ultimately it forced the then Governor-General to take steps to call an election in accordance with the Constitution to enable the people of Australia to decide the issue. Notwithstanding the rhetoric of Senator Evans, that was the fundamental principle in the Constitution when it was drawn up and it is a right and proper principle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have heard today Senator Evans and others talking about the so-called failure of the Fraser Government. I refer them to a letter from a Mr A. K. Sandell of North Balwyn published in the Age of 2 November this year. It seems to me that Mr Sandell has a good grip on the constitutional problems of the country and on what the Labor Party should be involved in. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it would be disastrous if we made it impossible to remove a failing Government before its term expired except by violent revolution. </PARA>
<PARA>Is that not true? He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>If the Labor Party really believes its rhetoric about the failure of the Fraser Government to produce policies which will rescue Australia from its present predicament, then it is its obvious democratic duty to take whatever steps are available to it to remove that Government--</PARA>
<PARA>So he issues a challenge to the ALP. If the ALP believes its own rhetoric why does it not take steps to remove this Government? It can do so. The Labor Party, with the Democrats, has the power in this chamber to remove the Government, but it does not have the courage to do so. Mr Sandell went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I accuse Mr Hayden, Mr Hawke and Mr Chipp of being afraid to unseat the Government at this time, of hoping that conditions outside Australia will make governing less difficult in 12 months' time, and of concealing their lack of guts and the poverty of their remedies with a self-righteous plea that it is wrong under any circumstances to block Supply. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, he has put his finger right on the pulse of what is happening here at present. Senator Evans misunderstood, as he always does, many things. He misunderstood what Senator Sir John Carrick was saying about the consumer price index figures. I will now put him right by saying that the figures cited by Senator Sir John Carrick were the June annual figures-not quarterly figures-as provided by the Treasury. They are the official figures. They show that until 1973 the consumer price index inflation rate was 6 per cent. Twelve months after the Labor Party came into office, inflation rose to 12.9 per cent, which was double the 1973 figure. In 1974 it rose to 16.7 per cent. I have heard Senator Gietzelt complain about honourable senators on our side referring to an annual inflation rate of 21 per cent, a figure arrived at by multiplying the quarterly figure by four. I accept his criticism of honourable senators on our side who cite a figure of 21 per cent. We do not have to cite a figure of 21 per cent when the figure for the year ended 30 June 1975 was 16.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, ever since the Fraser Government took office it has undoubtedly attacked and reduced inflation. At the same time as it has faced the problem of a world wide and increasing depression, it has managed to maintain social service benefits for the unemployed, for the sick and for those in need. Those are the reasons for high taxation, the relatively high consumer price index and the relatively high interest rates. These levels remain high because the Government is showing humanity in these areas. Of course, the Labor Party knows this. These are difficult times and in difficult times people seek instant solutions and scapegoats. The Labor Party is endeavouring to provide them with instant solutions of the sort of nonsense that My Hayden recently came up with but for which he was dealt such a demolishing blow by the editorial of the Australian Financial Review of 27 October, which stated-these are not my words or Liberal words but those from the editorial:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is easy for the Labor Party to make grandiose promises about spending stimulus through tax cuts or higher pensions and benefits, . . . to make capital grants for job creation, to maintain industry protection regardless of the viability of industries, and to maintain real wages. </PARA>
<PARA>It is easy for the Labor Party to say this. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA> This is what the Leader of the Opposition proposed in Parliament yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable senators to listen to what the editorial then said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a recipe . . . for economic disaster, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Labor Party blames the Fraser Government for Australia's economic problems but gives no solution. Instead it comes up with a recipe for economic disaster. Let me say what disappoints me about the debate today. Rather than encouraging this hatred and division within this nation, the Labor Party Opposition could be today proposing some sort of bipartisan or consensus approach--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh. He is a Labor senator from Western Australia. He made a speech from which I would like to quote some of his words. He was talking about Keynesian remedies being supplemented by an effective prices and incomes policy. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Australia, federal governments have almost no coercive powers in the area of prices and incomes control. </PARA>
<PARA>He recognised that as being one of the major problems of any government, whether it was an ALP or a Liberal-National Party government. That would be one of the major problems in Australia. Now there may be a solution to some of our economic problems. We have a continuing world depression and that is difficult to cope with. But what else is happening is also creating problems in Australia, and that is the continuing demand for increased wages and less working hours. We could be coming up with some sort of consensus approach. If we suggested to State and Federal parliamentarians and to top level public servants that they should take a cut in their salaries, maybe we could then call upon professionals such as solicitors, doctors, barristers and lawyers and dentists not to increase their fees. We could issue a national call as a consensus with a bipartisan approach, but the ALP is not interested. All it does is attack this proposal. I say to you, Mr President, that we could have some sort of consensus approach whereby both parties-we could even include the Australian Democrats, although they have not been here today to take any interest in what is going on-could take some sort of consensus approach, a national call for a general cut in salaries at a top level and then a request to all the workers of this country not to seek wage rises or reductions in working hours. It may very well be successful. At least it would be a bipartisan consensus approach. I put that forward to the Opposition and clearly it is being rejected by its members, showing that they are not all interested in the economic problems of Australia. They are only interested in taking some political advantages of the difficulties being created in this country by world-wide problems and the actions of certain extreme trade union leaders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In case the Senate does not know, we are debating the following matter of public importance:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The disastrous economic, political, constitutional, parliamentary, and administrative consequences of November 11, 1975. </PARA>
<PARA>Because this is an important day for Australia and for the Government, I think it is proper that we should use this debate to review the sort of tone set by this Government in its past and present performance. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that in the first three months after the Australian Labor Party won the 1972 elections members of this Government, Ministers now in this place, very consciously and improperly sought to bring about the downfall of the Whitlam Government. They sought to put the Government in a besieged position. I would remind the Senate that Senators Cotton, Withers, Guilfoyle, Webster and Carrick did everything possible in those early months, before any of the problems that have been referred to in this debate arose, to create obstacles and to obstruct the Government, which had won office for the first time in 23 years, in its proper task of administration and leadership of this country. As a result of that, within 15 months-in April 1974-Supply was delayed to such an extent that a double dissolution took place. As my remarks will subsequently suggest, that course was rejected by the Australian people and the Whitlam Government was given a second mandate. However, the same sort of obstruction and conspiracy continued. The Senate was again used in the latter part of 1975 for the purpose of bringing down the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> That Government was brought down as a result of a coup that was illegally and improperly engineered in a conspiratorial way by a Governor-General who can be described only as a drunk and besotted individual who had links with the Santamaria movement in this country, which hated the Labor Government, and links with an intelligence organisation. He conspired with a disloyal, opportunist, unscrupulous and immoral leader of the Liberal Party to bring into fruition the course of events that are now known as 11 November 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened in the subsequent period? For seven years this Government has had the responsibility of bringing about a state of economic prosperity, development and growth. It has failed dismally to do that. The Fraser Government , with which we are concerning ourselves today, is shown to be a government of corruption, hypocrisy and dishonesty which has to face scandal after scandal. A review of events since 1975 shows this to be the case. I would like to detail some of the key elements which make up the basis of the Fraser Government. These elements become clear if we pay attention to the statements that were made by then Opposition spokesmen in 1975. Just look at what Mr Fraser had to say. On 22 March 1975 the Australian newspaper contained an article headed 'Labor has the right to govern; Liberal leader takes pressure off Whitlam' in which Mr Fraser is reported as saying, prior to the double dissolution of 1974:</PARA>
<PARA> I generally believe that if a government is elected to power in the lower House and has the numbers and can maintain the numbers in the lower House, it is entitled to expect it will govern for the three-year term unless quite extraordinary events intervene. </PARA>
<PARA>As the party forming the government of the day-that is, the party which has the numbers in the lower House-we were asked to believe Mr Fraser and the Liberals. We were asked in March 1975 to trust the Opposition parties which less than a year before had forced the Labor Government to an early and premature election and which had engaged in a continual process of obstruction before and after that election. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give an example of that sort of obstruction. On 21 March 1974 the then Attorney-General, Senator Murphy, replied to a question. It is important to quote what Senator Murphy had to say then having regard to what Mr Fraser and Mr Anthony have said in recent times, that we have to consider the possibility of a premature election because of obstruction in the Australian Senate. This is what Senator Murphy said on 21 March 1974:</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator made a third request about the divisions which have taken place and about the results of the divisions demonstrating the obstruction by Opposition senators. </PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to senators of the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Country Party of Australia. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>I think I can comply with that request, and I will inform the Senate about this matter. There have been a number of divisions. On 6 March there were 8 divisions , and the Government was defeated 8 times. On 7 March there were 10 divisions and it was defeated 10 times. On 12 March there was one division and the Government was defeated. On 13 March there were 3 divisions and it was defeated 3 times. On 14 March there were 4 divisions and the Government was defeated 3 times. On 19 March there were 3 divisions and the Government was defeated 3 times. On 20 March there was one division and the Government was defeated. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Murphy was referring to the autumn period of 1974. Yet the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) have the audacity, the gall and the effrontery to suggest that the Senate is playing an obstructive role when, in fact, we have dealt in a negative way with only four pieces of legislation by this Government in seven long, hard years. None of those was included in the mandate of the Fraser Administration. We make no apology for refusing to increase sales tax on the necessities of life, for refusing to apply tertiary fees for secondary students, and for refusing to impose penalties in regard to social security benefits for wives whose husbands may in some remote way be involved in industrial disputation. The only other such piece of legislation-it is currently before one of the Senate's committees- is that dealing with loans for students. So we can see what sort of hypocritical and dishonest government we have. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us again turn to Senator Sir John Carrick and Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. In October 1975, Senator Guilfoyle had resiled from Mr Fraser's earlier stated position that a government should be allowed to run its full term and carry out its program. On 22 October of that year, she said to the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> We have no hesitation in saying to the Australian people that this Government has shown the dishonesty which requires it to face them for their verdict. We are using the mechanism of the elected senators in this country to force this Government to the Australian people. It is a situation where a government without integrity is too dangerous to be allowed to remain. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Carrick had discovered this principle also. On the same day, while speaking on the Appropriation Bills, he told the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> We come to the situation in which our responsibility is this: If we are satisfied that this is the most dishonest government, the most corrupt government and the government of the worst economic disaster in history, it is our bounden responsibility to bring it to the electors. </PARA>
<PARA>What is the position? As compared with unemployment in November 1975, we have now in November 1982, double the number of people out of work. We have an inflation rate which is approximating 14 per cent. We have the highest interest rates in Australia's history. We have economic downturn and a lack of confidence throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Just look at the sort of scandals with which this Government is faced. We have had to have Ministers sacked for misleading the Parliament or for impropriety- Messrs Withers, Garland, Moore and MacKellar. We have had corruption of the highest order, including corruption in respect of tax-as brought out by the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. This Government has paid precious little attention to the wholesale rip-offs that have taken place. We cannot be really sure how much money has been ripped off because every second day the Treasurer (Mr Howard ) ups the amount of money that might have been lost. Certainly, somewhere between $1 billion, as he admitted in Parliament yesterday, and $5 billion, which has been suggested by others, has been lost by the inaction of this Government. If that is not corruption, I do not know what it is. It has failed to plug the holes that enable the wealthy to evade their tax responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd scandal, was of major magnitude. This Government saw fit not to take any action against the appropriate Minister. The meat substitution scandal has destroyed our reputation in overseas markets. In the last couple of days Mr Hunt-the former Minister for Health-admitted that the Government was losing at least $100m a year as a result of Medibank fraud. Evidence has shown that past Ministers such as McLeay and Garland have been involved in all sorts of behaviour indicating that we have a government whose honesty is very much under challenge. Yet it is suggested that the Government of this day is entitled to the confidence of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had indecisiveness about an early and premature election. As a result of the scrutiny of the Appropriation Bills we have learned of attempts by the Government to use taxpayers' money in the promotion of Government programs. Senator Carrick seems untroubled by all of this. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact is that this Government-</PARA>
<PARA>He was talking about the Labor Government of 1975 and I will refer to what he said then and to the position today--</PARA>
<PARA>has been a government of abysmal misconduct and behaviour, a government which has had to sack one of its Deputy Prime Ministers and an Acting Prime Minister for misleading the public. </PARA>
<PARA>All of those allegations were not made about any personal impropriety of those Ministers or their personal integrity but about mistakes in public administration. That is not the record of recent Ministers who have been unceremoniously sacked as a result of public pressure, public disclosure and public debate in this place. This Government cannot say that it is handling the economy of this country in a satisfactory way. Of course, Senator Carrick is constantly on his feet talking about high inflation. Everybody knows that the next consumer price index figures will show a further increase in inflation. Everybody knows that today's figures are expected to show at least another 40 per cent increase in the unemployment figures. Everybody knows that our small business sector and the building industry is in a state of crisis which has not been seen for around 50 years in this country. In the cold light of today's facts the Fraser Government cannot stand up against such criteria and evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> The behaviour of the Fraser Government is blacker than anything that Senator Carrick and the other apologists in this debate can dream up in their rush to try to defend the Government and justify the conspiratorial attitude that it took in 1975. There is no doubt that this Government always seeks to blame everybody else. It has blamed the Whitlam Government that was in office for three brief years and which was forced into two elections in those three years. It has blamed the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, and judges who have been appointed by it to carry out inquiries. It blames the workers. It blames the whole world for the recession or the depression. In fact, it blames everybody but itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the unholy arrangement and alliance that took place during 1973, 1974 and 1975 the Government has the audacity to suggest in this place that the trade union movement and the Opposition should sit down, establish a consensus, and assist the Government. The only way in which this Government can be assisted is to be removed from office and a government of integrity elected in its place-a government that will activate itself in the interests of the Australian people in every sense of the word. We have a government now that has seen interest rates rise in recent times by 50 per cent, a government that cannot control inflation and a government that admits it has to get the Parliament up early because it is unable to provide solutions to today's problems. </PARA>

As long as the Labor Party chooses to look back seven years that fascination will be fatal. However, one remark by Senator Gietzelt made even me sit up and take note-that was the allegation that the dismissal of the Whitlam Government in 1975 was a result of a conspiracy between the Governor-General and Mr Santamaria.

Senator Gietzelt got it half right when he referred to the fact that the Whitlam Government was re-elected in 1974. What he needs to remind his speech writer is that the people of Australia chose not to give the Labor Party a majority in the Senate. The lament in Senator Gietzelt's speech about the Whitlam Government's not getting its own way all the time in the Senate should have taken account of the fact that this was a result of the choice of the Australian people.

It is very strange indeed that Senator Gietzelt should say in tones of ringing indignation that Liberal spokesmen, in the Senate and elsewhere, improperly sought to bring about the downfall of the Whitlam Government after its election in 1972. That is the first time I have ever heard it suggested that there is something improper about an opposition trying to bring about the downfall of a government. I thought that was the role of an opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed having sat here in government for seven years watching the Labor Party in opposition I would have thought that that was what it has been trying to do for that time-imperfectly I will admit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important that we treat seriously the Labor Party's attempts to maintain rage so the people of Australia will be able to put their actions into some sort of proper perspective. As Senator Lewis said, these difficult times call for statesmanship from people in politics. It might be relevant, when talking about the economy as the Labor Party has chosen to do at length today, to consider some of the factors that affect the Australian economy . It might consider the fact that we have declining commodity prices. The Labor Party might admit that there is declining world trade and that the drought in Australia has had a dramatic effect on our country's earnings overseas. However, for the Labor Party to admit that would be to face the fact that exports support the economy of this country. We cannot put some political barrier around Australia, say we will fix up everything internally by propping up high wages and high costs within Australia, find some way of financing them-heavens knows which way-and that way we will all be right. The Labor Party is still insensitive to the profound importance of our primary industries in Australia. People in rural areas and provincial cities overwhelmingly rejected Labor Party policies when it was last in power. If the Labor Party continues with that sort of insensitivity to those fundamental factors and the economic health of this country then, I dare say, it will be overwhelmingly rejected again at the election next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the Opposition and those honourable senators who have spoken today and those few who have chosen to listen to the debate that when honourable senators opposite bring up the subject of the consequences of 11 November 1975 and whip themselves into a lather about that day they should divert their attention for a couple of minutes and think about the implication of the consequences of the elections of December 1975, December 1977 and October 1980. The implication is that the Australian people have rejected the Labor Party. They have rejected its policies and its proposals for Australia. Since 1949 the Australian people, in their own particular wisdom, have elected Liberal governments for 30 years out of 33 years. They have elected Labor governments for three years. In elections the Australian people have shown a 10:1 preference for Liberal governments over Labor governments. Nevertheless, the Labor Party in the Senate still apparently regards Liberal governments to be an interregnum. The reason the Labor Party considers them to be an interregnum, although they have been in office 30 out of 33 years, is that it still does not find it necessary to examine seriously those alternative policies which are consistently rejected. Senator Evans might say that the public is dogged, churlish and pigheaded in its consistent rejection of Labor Party policies. It is just possible, though, that the Australian public considers that the Labor Party is dogged, churlish and pigheaded in insisting on putting forward the same recipe for economic disaster at election after election . </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button), in some very florid rhetoric which did him credit but not his party and its policies, said that this Government is presiding over an economic crisis and socal inequities which are consequences of this Government's policies. Senator Button, as the senior spokesman of the Labor Party in this chamber of Parliament, paid no attention to the factors that I mentioned earlier that are impinging overwhelmingly on the Australian economy at the moment. I refer to commodity prices, world trade and the drought in Australia. He swept aside and ignored those factors. He referred to what he said were the consequences of government policies. He said that all economic problems and the social problems that flow from them are the fault of the Government. So long as Senator Evans has a mental block that extends so far as the shoreline of Australia he does not have an argument fit to justifiably put to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course Senator Button talked about consensus. He rubbished our views on consensus. I will deal with that in a minute or two. Senator Button and the Labor Party would do well to look at where the areas of consensus in the Australian community can be found. He should not try to turn everything into an area of division. Those Labor Party policies which are being reiterated yet again in a lead up to an election next year have been soundly criticised by many economists. I should like to quote from the Australian Financial Review of 27 October. In considering whether one ought to look at the Labor Party's policies as a credible alternative government the editorial stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The real danger is that the Labor Party might achieve power in the belief that it has answers to Australia's problems which do not take account of the constraints. </PARA>
<PARA>They are the constraints to which I have referred. The editorial continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In this climate it is easy for the Labor Party to make grandiose promises about spending stimulus through tax cuts or higher pensions and benefits, to avoid the need to increase government charges at a time when government enterprises are running huge deficits, to make capital grants for job creation, to maintain industry protection regardless of the viability of industries, and to maintain real wages. </PARA>
<PARA> This is what the Leader of the Opposition proposed in Parliament yesterday. It is a recipe not only for economic disaster, but also what is worse, given the need for a strong democratic system, for the ignominious collapse of yet another Labor Government if the ALP should win the next federal election. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time as proposing to maintain the real wages of the employed labour force at, inevitably, the expense of new investment and private sector employment creation, the Labor Party in Parliament yesterday proposed to increase government expenditures on social welfare benefits and job creation. How are these to be financed?</PARA>
<PARA> It is not enough to talk about more effective collection of tax from high income tax dodgers. Although there are undoubtedly large sums involved, they are nothing like the billions which the fantasies of some members of the Opposition would have it. </PARA>
<PARA>Those words, I remind the Senate, appeared in the editorial of the Australian Financial Review. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA> This leaves the Labor Party with a fiscal program which promises nothing but unemployment and inflation on a larger scale than we have now, and the prospect of further involuntary devaluations of the Australian dollar as we are locked into a devaluation/inflation spiral. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> With mounting unemployment and active protest by the unemployed, it is only too easy for the Labor Party to opt for easy package solutions which it freely promises will cure all problems without pain. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Labor Party needs to consider whether it can deliver in terms of effective policies which will actually benefit the Australian economy. If it cannot, it is doomed to repeat the pattern of long period of Liberal government, interspersed with occasional disastrous short periods of ineffectual and disintegrating Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA>They were the comments of an external observer. In the context of more spending, with some fantasy of where the money will come from for that spending, it is worth reminding the Labor Party what the current leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden, said in 1975 when Treasurer in a Labor government. In his Budget Speech he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to provide more and more government services or transfer payments from the Budget without ultimately having to pay for them through cutting back after-tax earnings via increased taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the solution Mr Hayden sees for the economic prescription which the Labor Party insisted on repeating to us today. Mr Hayden then said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to get quarts out of pint pots. </PARA>
<PARA>In its criticism today of the Fraser Government's record in the last seven years and its comment on the problems that face the country today, the Opposition harked back to the old, tired and frequently rejected policies that it has held for years-policies which even Mr Hayden disowned in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button attempted to rubbish consensus-a consensus which this country needs. he asked: 'Where was consensus in 1975?'. I suggest to Senator Button that in 1975 there was a consensus by the Australian public which the Labor Party then ignored at its peril. There was a consensus about the Labor Government's activities in relation to the loans affair and its economic policies. The electorate ultimately delivered its verdict and showed what was the consensus of the Australian public. It rejected the Labor Party in December 1975, and has continued to do so ever since. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This annual report of the Commissioner of Taxation again highlights the extent of tax evasion and avoidance practices in this country and the development of those practices during the period of the Fraser Government. In fact it is instructive to look at this report of the Commissioner of Taxation in the light of his previous reports for the years ending 1979, 1980 and 1981 which document the growth of the tax evasion industry. The Commissioner points out in this report for the year ended 30 June 1982 that an analysis of income tax objections lodged by tax avoidance scheme participants reveals that in that year 24,972 potential taxpayers were identified as having been involved in 'blatant, artificial and contrived schemes'. Some $1,035m had been assessed in that period as due by participants in attempted tax avoidance schemes and, under administrative challenge, that amount of revenue still remains outstanding. There is a further $465m in tax owed to the Commissioner of Taxation by stripped companies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate has already heard today, in the course of an earlier discussion, reference to Professor Russell Mathews's speech at the Institute of Political Science seminar in January of this year. Professor Mathews drew attention to the fact that if the Fraser Government had devoted as much attention to collecting revenue as it had to so-called limitations on government expenditure there would be no need for any increase in taxation in this country. Professor Mathews was, of course, talking about taxation increased by stealth. He also referred in that paper to the implications of the revenue lost through tax avoidance. The important point I wish to make in respect of the Taxation Commissioner's report is that for four years now the Commissioner has complained of his incapacity to deal with tax evasion schemes because of a shortage of staff and because of a deliberate policy imposed on him by the Government. That matter is again referred to in the annual report for the year 1982. At page 21 the Commissioner states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is noteworthy that, in revenue terms, overall results for the year were marginally ahead of the 1980-81 year despite a significant drop in the numbers of cases completed by all programs brought about largely by the decrease in staff ceiling in 1981 and the need to devote additional resources to tax avoidance activities. That greater revenue was obtained from fewer completed cases tends to confirm the view expressed last year that tax evasion appears to be increasing. This is, of course, a matter of considerable concern to me. </PARA>
<PARA>Earlier in that section, under the heading 'Tax Evasion and Fraud', he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Enforcement programs to detect income tax evasion and fraud continued to be carried out during the 1981-82 year in the form of investigations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He referred to the slight increase in revenue gained by that increase in activity. As I said, the Commissioner has complained in his last four reports about the inadequacy of staff and the imposition of a policy by this Government on him which has prevented the collection of tax from many people whom the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has described in the most derogatory terms and who should be paying taxes but who are avoiding their tax obligations. That emphasises two facts about the Government: Either it is not genuine and bona fide in its stated intentions about tax evasion or it is incompetent. There is no other choice left if one reads the reports of the Taxation Commissioner over the last four or five years. I do not know which description the Government opts for as the favoured description of its activities or inactivities in respect of the collection of tax revenue; that is up to the Government to decide. But there is no alternative conclusion. It is now admitted that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Prime Minister knew in 1977 that blatant frauds were taking place and nothing has been done about them. That situation is documented. The ignoring of the Taxation Commissioner's reports in that context reveals the incompetence, negligence and lack of will of the Government in relation to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the only point I wish to draw from the Taxation Commissioner's report. The rest of the report is devoted to rather technical and detailed material, to taxation review boards and matters of that kind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should also like to address a few comments to the sixty-first report of the Commissioner of Taxation. Some of my comments will be directed to the point that Senator Button discussed. Initially, however, I should like to make two points which arise out of the report of the Commissioner. During the debate on the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and the discussions in this Parliament, both at committee level and in the Parliament as a whole, the defence of the Government continually was that because of the secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act the Ministers were in no position to know what was going on in those relevant years between 1975 and 1982. That point was heralded by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in defence of his ignorance of the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the Senate Estimates committee hearings in August this year we had the opportunity to discuss with officers of the Attorney-General's Department whether they had advised the Government as to the extent of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, the secrecy provision of the Act behind which the Government was hiding. We were advised that advice had not been sought as to the extent of that Act and advice had not been given by that Department as to the extent of that section of the Act. On page 4 of his report the Commissioner addresses comments to that same section of the Income Tax Assessment Act. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> There has recently been some comment about the secrecy provisions of the income tax law. Conclusions about the interpretation and administration of these provisions have been reached without, I must regretfully say, hearing any evidence on these matters from me or other senior taxation officers. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Commissioner stated that even he had not been consulted in respect of the ambit of the secrecy provisions. That is more evidence of the shallowness of the defence of the Government at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the next matter raised in the report, and that is the problem that we will face more and more in the next few years as our profits and our tax base are milked by multi-national organisations. I turn to page 17 of the report and the section entitled 'International Business Transactions'. In this section of the report, two problems are highlighted by the Commissioner of Taxation. These two problems are not Australia's problems alone, for they raise-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall take the time of the Senate only briefly. I take the opportunity on the first reading of the Dried Fruits Export Charges Amendment Bill, which is a money Bill, to make some further remarks about a question which I asked in the Senate yesterday. That question concerned fraud involving international airline tickets. I do that because this morning I have been contacted by New Zealand television with a request for an interview. I was informed that apparently the Minister for Civil Aviation in New Zealand this morning either has made a statement on this matter or has been interviewed by New Zealand television on this matter. New Zealand television has asked me whether I could explain details of the scheme. I have taken this opportunity to raise this matter so that I can get the details into Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been informed that a multimillion dollar fraud involving tickets for international flights has been discovered in the Melbourne and Sydney offices of Qantas Airways Ltd. I have been informed also that other airlines are checking to ascertain whether they have been defrauded. Apparently criminal prosecutions are likely against several previously reputable travel agents as a result of the fraud. The scheme has taken advantage of the 30 per cent exchange rate difference between Australian and New Zealand dollars, that difference, of course, being in favour of Australian dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> What the travel agents have been doing is importing ticket coupons from New Zealand and tailoring these tickets to the travel requirements of their customers who start their international journeys in Australia. The tickets have coupons written for the Wellington-Sydney, the Christchurch-Sydney or the Auckland-Sydney sector to prove that the passenger started his flight in New Zealand. I have been sent some duplicates of tickets from New Zealand which prove this point. One ticket that I have shows that the journey Christchurch to Melbourne is written on the ticket as 'open'. Then the ticket provides for travel from Melbourne to Auckland, Auckland to Los Angeles, et cetera; all the details of the flights are given on the ticket. At the end of this ticket the details are filled out for a flight from London to Melbourne with the section from Melbourne to Christchurch left open. Of course, the Australian passenger who boarded the aircraft in Melbourne will not go back to Christchurch as shown in the details of the ticket. The coupons for the two sectors that I have been talking about are torn out, leaving the carbon copy, to make it appear as if the ticket is already partly used. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the Australian dollar is worth 30 per cent more than the New Zealand dollar, travel agents can sell these tickets for less than the normal Australian price, often charging the passenger the New Zealand price plus half of the difference between the two prices. This is still substantially less than the full Australian price. The fraud arises because the airline whose ticketing the flight coupons are written on redeems them in New Zealand. It then gets paid in New Zealand currency, effectively at a rate substantially lower than the applicable fare level in Australian dollars. That is how this fraud scheme has been worked in detail. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason why I raised the question yesterday is that I have been led to believe that not only are the travel agents who sell these tickets liable for prosecution but also there could be a case in which people who have knowingly taken part in this scheme, airline passengers themselves, would be liable for prosecution. It does not worry me if some of the smart operators get caught. If people knowingly buy the ticket, that is their fault. I would submit that probably many people who have been involved in this fraud, if they were caught and had to pay the full price of the ticket, would be in a position financially to pay the full price. What concerns me is the person travelling on an international airline for the first time who really cannot afford the money and does not know the applicable fare rates. He or she may go to a travel agent and be told by him: 'Here is a ticket to a particular place. It will cost you X amount of dollars'. According to the advice that I have been given, if on presentation of that ticket to the airline in Melbourne or Sydney it is found to be wrongly issued, that person is liable to be charged the full fare. Because he or she did not travel from New Zealand to Melbourne or Sydney in the first place , the amount would be quite substantial. That person, unknowingly, could then be placed in a situation of serious financial embarrassment. </PARA>
<PARA> That concludes the remarks that I wish to make on this matter. I have taken this opportunity to get the details into Hansard as they are required by the New Zealand authorities who are looking at this matter today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it the Dried Fruits Export Charges Amendment Bill. By tradition, of course, on the first reading of such a Bill, honourable senators may raise other matters that they consider to be of some importance. I inform the Senate that I do not intend to talk about the Dried Fruits Export Charges Amendment Bill. I intend to raise something else -again just briefly, because time in these debates is very short-that I think needs raising and will need raising frequently because of the low level of awareness of governments and, indeed, of individuals in Australia of the problem .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recent times I have had occasion in a number of venues to make some reference to the position of women in Australia. I want to take some areas of their situation as I see it today which I think are urgent for government attention and for public debate so that the situation is appreciated, the implications of the situation are appreciated and some action can be taken. I note that the Minister present in the chamber is the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). Whilst I am aware that the Minister does not reply on a first reading debate, I am pleased that he is here because some of the things I have to say I think are particularly applicable to his area. </PARA>
<PARA> Women in Australia today are in a situation which has historic origins. It is not very long ago, only 20 to 30 years ago, that the expectations of women in Australia and the expectations of the parents of girls were very particular. The expectation was that girls would marry, probably not very long after leaving school, that they would have a family and that they would not re-enter the work force. The expectation between leaving school and marrying and having a family was that they would work for a short time. But, since they were not likely to need training and skills which were to take them through life to provide them with a home or with any of the pleasures that a superior economic position provides Australians with, as it was not considered that they would have to provide those aspects themselves, education was not considered a priority for girls. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not very long ago, indeed less than 30 years ago, that most girls in Australia were educated only to the age of 13 years, that is, to a level of only basic competence in literacy and numeracy. Those girls of 25 years ago are now women, some of them still in their 30s, certainly many of them in their early 40s and over, who face a very different Australia from the one that their parents thought they would have to face and that they thought they would have to face as they grew into adulthood and made choices in relation to marriage, employment and education themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation simply is that in Australia most women over the age of 40 years have a level of education which is not much above just basic literacy and numeracy. However, we have an increasing divorce rate in Australia and we have increasingly a situation in which women are head of the household and are responsible for providing for the economic and other welfare well-being of the children of this country. As I have indicated, those women are not skilled or well educated and, therefore, are not fitted to enter the work force seeking high or even reasonable remuneration in jobs which would enable them to achieve individual goals, such as home ownership to provide for their own old age, or some of the benefits of the generally high standard of living in Australia that they might seek for their children. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to mention some of the comparisons in the rates of employment between men and women where there is only one adult head of household to show how the situation breaks down. The figures for 1981 showed that of the sole heads of households who were men, 82.5 per cent were in the work force-12.1 per cent were not in the labour force or seeking work. On the other hand of the sole heads of households who were women, only 37.6 per cent were in the work force. I do not believe that that indicates that those women would not like to work and would not like to earn something a little above what they receive on the supporting parent's benefit and the benefits associated with it. In fact the result of a survey carried out in 1978 by the New South Wales Council of Social Service was, in very general terms, that women with dependent children were as negative about not working as those who did not have dependent children. In other words, those who had dependent children would have preferred to work in the same proportions as those who did not have dependent children. These women have indicated that they would like to work but the structures of our society make that virtually impossible. The structures impinge on that historic situation, to which I referred a few minutes ago, that very few of these women finished their education with skills of a level which would carry them into any satisfactory position in the work force. Not only do they lack employment skills but also they lack confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us-I think that includes every honourable senator in the chamber now and most honourable senators generally-who, since finishing our education, have been continuously in employment do not always understand the effect that being out of employment for extended periods has on morale and confidence. For women who took themselves out of the work force because they were bearing children and rearing young children that extends to a very significant period. I am not talking about just those who are on an extended period of unemployment because of economic circumstances; I am talking of those who, for 10, 15 or maybe more years, voluntarily did not seek paid employment in the work force or voluntarily did not seek to put themselves in a position of having to please a boss or gear themselves to a task that was outside their homes. It becomes an enormous psychological hurdle for women at the age of 40, who might have left the work force in their early twenties, to re-enter what has by then become an alien and, they might feel, probably even an unknown atmosphere. It is all the more so when they know, through reading advertisements in 'Positions Vacant' columns and applying for jobs, that because of their lack of recent work experience and their general lack of skills really they are regarded as basically unemployable by those who have jobs at their disposal. Whatever confidence some of them may have summoned up to try disappears very rapidly. It becomes very easy for them to remain on a pension although they may well have had a feeling that they would have preferred not to. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons for wanting to go into employment are not just economic and are not just related to the fact that one can get a higher income than the amount which one receives on the supporting parent's benefit. It also has a lot to do with personal dignity. Attempts to achieve the level of personal dignity that is associated with paid employment of a reasonable level are very short lived for very many women. The figures that I gave much earlier showing the contrast in the position between men and women with dependent children I think proves that. It is not enough to assume, just because one parent is looking after dependent children, that therefore that person cannot exercise the option of going into the work force. Men do when they have dependent children and they do it more than twice as successfully as women who have dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures for women on their own without dependent children also bear out my thesis. Those figures show that only 33.3 per cent are in the work force, an even lower percentage than for those with dependent children. In my opinion that is a legacy of that employment situation to which I referred. The older women in their late forties and their fifties who have been out of the work force while they had dependent children reach a stage where their children are no longer dependent and they may well try to seek to re-enter the work force. But they find on their own-on a widow's pension or on some sort of superannuation that might have been left to them by their husbands-that, in the view of current employers, they are absolutely unemployable. Therefore, only 33.3 per cent-one- third of them-are actually in the work force. It is very sad to think that at that stage of life, when one has many years of vigour and industry ahead and one would like to be earning as much as possible to provide for old age, when the option of work might not be so readily available for personal reasons, one is doomed to a pension existence and does not have the option of extending one's capacity to work. </PARA>
<PARA> Figures relative to the position of sole parents in an Australian Capital Territory survey showed that 90 per cent of sole parents live solely on the supporting parent's benefit. In most cases where there is a single parent situation that parent is a woman. This shows that a very high rate of women are transferred on to the supporting parent's benefit when they are having children. The indications of the New South Wales survey to which I referred are that that is not because women want it that way. They might want it another way. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest very briefly that governments, be they national or State, ought to look at this matter with some urgency. Some people like to pay great attention to the amount of money that we are paying out in pensions. They refer particularly to the supporting parent's benefit. We are all familiar with those people in the community who insist that it is all because of a mob of immoral young girls who are having babies in order to support themselves. But the truth does not support those allegations at all. The truth is that most of them would probably prefer to be in employment and not on this type of social welfare-an area of social welfare that admittedly is growing very rapidly and about which we ought to be concerned. We should not be concerned about whether we can take that benefit off these people and let them fend as best they can without recognising that many of those people-women in particular-are not in a position to fend for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already referred to the historic legacy of education. I do not think it is something that we have to live with forever. However, the structure of our education system, particularly our schools to which those people would have to return, militates against the entry of adults. I am very attracted to the community college system in Tasmania, where it seems that from mid-high school on there is a loosening-up of the old institutionalisation of our high schools. That sort of loosening-up, which on the basis of the information I have been given has not had any deleterious effect in Tasmania would, I think, enable many adults-in this case women who are looking after young dependent children-to go back to school through the day, and under those sorts of optimum conditions get a more soundly based high school education which will give them the confidence to attempt either higher education or to try to seek employment. I would like to mention one other small factor because I think it illustrates my general claim that governments do not understand the factors of this modern society as it has developed in the last ten years. They may mean well but they do not understand because they think in terms of the effects that old policies which are continuing policies have, and the hopeless position in which they put people. </PARA>
<PARA> I will instance very briefly, as I have in other places. Quite commonly I get inquiries to my office from women with young kiddies who receive the supporting parent benefit and who urgently have to find new accommodation. I have found the Queensland Housing Commission to be very co-operative in attempting to find them accommodation quickly because it recognises the urgency of such a situation. However, invariably the house is in Beaudesert or somewhere like that. There are housing commission ghettoes of single parents, particularly mothers, in that position where they are distant from employment, from education, from public transport and indeed from jobs. The positioning of those women in those sorts of housing commission acreages does not give them any option. They become locked into the pension until they are of an age where they have lost hope. I believe it is urgent-quite obviously, it is urgent for economic reasons, but it is also urgent for personal reasons-that the Government should face the reality of the new Australia that we are now versus the Australia we thought we were preparing ourselves for 20 or 30 years ago and not just turn its back on or dismiss as too hard the enormous human casualties that are occurring amongst women in our community, some of them as young as in their 30s but also those older. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the time allocated to me to speak to the motion for the first reading of the Dried Fruits Export Charges Amendment Bill 1982 I wish to raise the subject of a tragedy which I hope I will never have to raise again. On 30 September this year a Cessna 205 aeroplane departed from Mount Isa en route to Atherton, which is a distance of roughly 411 nautical miles. It was scheduled to arrive at Atherton at 6.25 p.m. but it never landed, certainly not in that location. The Atherton airstrip is unlit and has no navigational aids for bringing in planes in times of squally weather or cloud. On this particular date a smoke haze covered a large portion of north Queensland , which made visibility fairly bad in a number of other areas also. The points that I want to highlight are why the equipment was not available, why more activity had not been shown by those in authority and why governments, both State and Federal, have absolved themselves of all responsibility for the tragedy that took place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At 6.20 p.m. on that date the pilot reported that he was lost and he made initial radio contact with a ham radio operator at Edge Hill, which is a suburb of Cairns. He was not picked up by official radio because, apparently, the official radio was not manned. His last report came in at 8.40 p.m., which was two hours and 20 minutes later. At that stage he was running out of fuel and he still had not been properly located. He reported that he was disoriented and totally unable to locate the Atherton Airport. On Tuesday, 19 October, Ray Jones , the State member for Cairns, put a series of eight questions to the State Minister for Transport to try to ascertain what went wrong. The questions were well framed and the Minister's terse reply was in three paragraphs, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> In answer to the Honourable Member, all of the matters raised by the Honourable Member are directly under the jurisdiction of my Commonwealth counterpart. </PARA>
<PARA> According to information conveyed to me, the aircraft in question was on a private flight at the relevant time and therefore was not subject to any State issued Air License. </PARA>
<PARA> May I suggest that the Honourable Member direct his question to my Commonwealth counterpart. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not much comfort to someone who is trying to dig deeply into the problem to see what actually went wrong. But, because of the official bungling, five lives were lost. They were the pilot, two children aged eight and six, and the children's father and grandfather. At 6.30 p.m. the pilot reported that he was completely disoriented and still could not locate Atherton. </PARA>
<PARA> This raises a number of questions. Firstly, was the meteorological station at Cairns unmanned at the time? I believe it was. Secondly, as the plane obviously kept in semi-continuous radio contact, why was not the instrument landing system at Cairns, if it still operates, activated and radio used to bring in the plane, particularly as the plane apparently went down within a radius of about 36 kilometres of Cairns? Thirdly, did the plane crash into the sea near Feather Reef, which was the first theory that some of the bureaucracy had? Fourthly, was it also possible that it crashed into some other area, perhaps in the rain forest covered mountains? I heard one report of a plane, obviously in difficulty , in the Kamerunga area but as far as I know that was not even searched. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem is that the staff of the Cairns Airport weather office has apparently been reduced from five to three. Along the north coast, there are a number of stations where, because of the activities of the razor gang, this sort of reduction of staff will take place. So this particular instance may be repeated many times over, particularly in squally weather with the onset of the wet season, which is only a few weeks away. </PARA>
<PARA> Another question that has to be raised is: Why was the plane allowed by the authorities to depart from Mount Isa with such a fine margin before last light and with the termination of the flight on an unlit landing ground? The expected last light on that day, because of the haze, was about 6.40 p.m. The estimated time of arrival was 6.25 p.m. Seas in the area on that evening were very rough, with strong south-east winds ranging from 20 to 25 knots, so that a small plane going down in the sea probably would have sunk straight away. If it had landed with its nose down it is possible that the front of the plane would have been pushed in and a large amount of water would have taken it down straight away. The only thing that might have saved it, if the tanks were not ruptured on impact, was that there was no fuel. That might have given it some bouyancy. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask this question of the Minister for Aviation (Mr Fife): Is it a fact that light aeroplanes which fly over water either by accident or design are not compelled to carry life jackets or life rafts? The official explanation for this , as I understand it, was that as the plane took off from Mount Isa and did not usually fly over water, almost certainly it would not have been carrying any rescue gear. I think a reply should be available as to whether this Cessna 205 was in fact carrying any sort of life raft or life jackets. </PARA>
<PARA> Delays need explanation. When at 6.20 p.m. the pilot radioed that he was lost, there were some very strange delays. The naval vessel HMAS Townsville did not commence a search until 10.40 p.m. In fact the Navy was not advised that there was an aeroplane in trouble until 9.30 p.m. This was 50 minutes after the plane had disappeared. When HMAS Townsville took off it was instructed to make a circular search 32 kilometres to the north and south of Cape Grafton. On the night of 30 September the coast watch at Canberra was on standby, as well as coastguards at Innisfail and Cairns. Some of the first signals that came back were taken by officers at the Townsville Airport. On the next day, 12 aircraft from Cairns and Townsville were despatched to take part in the search. It was finally called off about a week later. A number of ships and boats were also engaged in the search, including the local police boat, HMAS Townsville and some of the prawn trawlers. But the Queensland Government is allowed to escape by saying that it is not its responsibility. The old man who is the Minister for Transport has apparently adopted that attitude ever since. The Queensland Government could not care less. Apparently, the Queensland Government did not get involved at any stage with the search aspect. </PARA>
<PARA> I pose these questions and I hope that the Minister will take them seriously: Why does Atherton not have a track guidance system or some sort of aid to help planes in difficulty, particularly at the approach of last light or straight after last light? Why was a plane cleared for takeoff with an estimated time of arrival dangerously close to last light? Taxpayers pay millions of dollars for coastal surveillance. When a tragedy was about to occur with a two-hour margin- nothing was done until the plane disappeared-one wonders what advantage there is in setting up any sort of surveillance at all. Nothing was heard as to whether the air surveillance people were used. In fact, I have been always highly critical of the civilian surveillance that we use around our coastline. </PARA>
<PARA> I recite again the occasion when I was in a far northern motel having breakfast one morning. I asked a gentleman at the table what he did. He told me that he was an observer and that he did not know much about the place. He did not know anything about aeroplanes but he had some slight knowledge of ships. He said that he probably would be able to identify them. In any case he said: 'We are not staying out too late today. We have a party in Cairns tonight so we are getting back early'. This meant that a whole strip of coastline was missed out while they went back for their grog party. Again that highlights the necessity, of course, to have proper and competent people doing this job, people who are trained and disciplined, such as people in the Royal Australian Air Force and the Navy. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask these further questions: Were search and rescue operations not available because it was a public holiday in Queensland? It was the day that was gazetted as a public holiday for the opening of the Commonwealth Games. This sort of complaint has been heard before. It is said that if an enemy wants to land by either plane or boat in Darwin the best day to come in is Saturday, Sunday or a public holiday when, apparently, radar as well as all other safeguards are unmanned. Cairns is notorious for unusual weather. I recite these past events to emphasise again what can go wrong unless search and rescue operations are set in train immediately. On 3 October 1975 a Heron aircraft en route from Mount Isa to Cairns-actually it started off in Alice Springs; at one time there used to be a regular flight across that route-got into murky weather and crashed into a cane paddock near Holloways Beach which is just north of Cairns. There were 11 persons, including passengers and crew, on that plane. All were killed. A few weeks after that-getting closer to the monsoon season-I was coming in from Weipa one night. Again I was on a scheduled commercial flight in a small plane. We went very close to coming to grief in the same way. The aerodromes behind us were out because of the weather and we could not return to any of them. So, we had to keep attempting to make a landing at Cairns. We finally got in. There are three rather dangerous landings that I have had at that airport-once on a charter flight and on two other occasions on regular aeroplane flights. All were emergency landings. </PARA>
<PARA> It is too late now to save the lives of the persons involved. But the massive sums of money that were obviously unsuccessfully used in this search after the event could have been better spent in advance in making sure that all of those stations were adequately staffed. If we are to continue to cut back staff there will be more tragedies of this nature. The money could also be spent on putting some sort of landing aids at Atherton Airport and other small aeroplane landing areas around other small towns in the far north of Queensland. It could be better spent in setting up navigational aids at various points so that in particular small planes which get into trouble at least would be able to make contact and be guided to some safe landing spot. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot over-emphasise the fact that there seemed to be a totally unco- ordinated operation. In two hours there should have been an opportunity for a proper search and rescue operation to be carried out. But because of a series of mini tragedies associated with the major tragedy none of these things came into operation at the time they should have. Had we had proper manning of stations in the Cairns area the ham operator would have been merely a supplementary person in the search to try to save that aeroplane and its five passengers. I feel particularly sad about the fact that two tiny children-a six year old and an eight year old-were killed on that flight as was their father. So, there is a family now wrecked by tragedy. I hope that the Minister will take note of the points that I have raised and endeavour-even if we are in a time of economic crisis-to provide the necessary aids and the necessary organisation for a search and rescue operation that can be implemented not in one, two or three hours' time but within minutes of when the first distress call is received. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take advantage of the first reading of the Dried Fruits Export Charges Amendment Bill to draw the attention of the Senate again to the developments around the Nugan Hand bank and white collar crime. This Government claims that there is a need for a special crimes commission to handle these sorts of major rip-offs and major areas of criminality that are obviously taking place in Australia. This is the third time I have utilised such an opportunity. Of course, I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) and I during this year on numerous occasions have called for a proper judicial inquiry, particularly into the nefarious and subversive activities of the Nugan Hand organisation. I remind the Senate that in a paper presented to both Houses of Parliament on 20 April 1982 by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and the Solicitor-General, Mr Byers, following numerous submissions made by the Opposition, we have this rather unusual response from the Government. The Government sought the opinion of the Commonwealth's law officers. Here again one has only to say how deficient is the information given to the law officers by the Commonwealth Government having regard to the reports that were placed before the Parliament at that time. I refer to the statement put down in this place by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume). The statement reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Law Officers have formed the opinion that an extension of the terms of reference of the Royal Commission-</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we are referring to the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking of which there is another volume; volume 2 was tabled today in the Senate and earlier in the week in the House of Representatives-</PARA>
<PARA>Is warranted to cover allegations of:</PARA>
<PARA> Nugan Hand's involvement in drug dealing, beyond any association with the Clark group;</PARA>
<PARA> Nugan Hand's laundering of money, and association with organised crime;</PARA>
<PARA> Interference with earlier investigation of Nugan Hand. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has noted the Law Officer's conclusion that the need for a specific inquiry into any foreign intelligence agency links has not been established. There have been firm United States denials about CIA involvement with Nugan Hand. The Government intends, however, that the extended terms of reference will be wide enough to allow the Commission to investigate Nugan Hand links with any organisation. </PARA>
<PARA>I quote from another portion on the same page. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister had indicated to the House, the Government has had repeated assurances from the United States Government that there was no connection between the CIA and Nugan Hand. On 26 March 1982 the Public Affairs Division of the CIA took the unusual step of issuing a statement responding to allegations about links between Nugan Hand and the CIA and operations by the CIA against the Labor Government. It emphatically denied those allegations. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the text of a cable handed to the Government by the US Embassy referring to the statement by the Public Affairs Division of the CIA. </PARA>
<PARA>That is part of the law officer's report. Now I would like to refer to page 299 of volume 2 of the Commonwealth-New South Wales Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking dealing with one of the principal operators the man whose name is associated with the bank, Michael Hand and the United States of America intelligence services. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> There seems to be little doubt that Michael Hand became involved with U.S. military intelligence activity during his military service in Vietnam and South East Asia (1964-7) if not before that time. His subsequent business activities in Australia in the late 1960s and early 1970s with members and former members of the C.I.A. controlled airline Air America (formerly Civil Air Transport) and C.I.A. connected Continental Air Service (C.A.S.) and Agency for International Development (A.I.D.), lead to the strong inference that Hand's intelligence activity was with the C.I.A. </PARA>
<PARA> There is some evidence to suggest that Hand retained his U.S. intelligence ties -whatever they might have been-throughout the 1970s and probably into the 1980s. For example, in handwritten notes Nugan made to himself exploring the business prospects for Nugan Hand in South East Asia, apparently between 1977-9, Nugan wrote: 'Mike good Vietnam specialist (C.I.A.) tough physically'. Other examples which support this view are Maurice Houghton, his relationship with Hand, his role in Nugan Hand and his apparent connections not only with U.S. intelligence personnel but also with personnel in Australia's own A.S.I.O. </PARA>
<PARA>The same report at page 409 deals with Mr Houghton. Honourable senators might recall that he was given a clearance by Australian Security Intelligence Organisation agents and, quite coincidentally and unusually, he was given a character reference by two former Hungarians, Messrs Charody and Strasser, who were party to a major development organisation in Sydney. He was bailed up at Sydney Airport. This man Houghton is clearly known to be involved in white collar crime, drug running and all of the other nefarious activities of the Nugan Hand organisation. Mr Justice Stewart said about Houghton:</PARA>
<PARA> On the information available it is probable that Houghton was associated with U .S. intelligence personnel in South East Asia and Australia, and had some type of association with personnel in Australia's intelligence agency, A.S.I.O. Hand too had an involvement with U.S. intelligence services and there seems to be little doubt that this common background was the very root of their relationship . Though that is not to say that their relationship was one of intelligence activity. </PARA>
<PARA>I indicated earlier that there was a great deal of derision in the Government ranks when I referred to the fact that there was abundant evidence that the Central Intelligence Agency had a vested interest in the overthrow of the Whitlam Government. There was similar mirth when I made suggestions about Mr Santamaria. The records show that Mr Bartholemew Santamaria saw Sir John Kerr only a few days before the coup of 11 November 1975 took place. So let us not have any illusions whatsoever that the CIA and Mr Santamaria who has agents in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation were not involved in some part of that conspiracy to overthrow the Whitlam Government. Let us not have any doubt that, in respect of this report about drug trafficking, the Joint Task Force and the activities of Nugan Hand, the CIA is lying about its involvement in the internal affairs of countries throughout the world. The record shows that it has been involved on a world-wide basis in destabilising governments that it believes are not friendly to its interests or governments which have some economic reason to curtail the activities of American business interests. There is no doubt at all that the CIA, even though it is now a popular whipping horse, was involved in these activities. </PARA>
<PARA> There is abundant evidence available in the United States Congress, in a film on company business and in books, that the CIA was involved in the murder and assassination of leading members of governments that it considered were not friendly to its interests. Let us have no doubt about that. The CIA was involved in the overthrow of former Prime Minister Mossadegh in the 1950s. That assassination finally led to the problems that exist in Iran today. Let us not seize upon this as something of little consequence or of little moment. It is a matter of considerable concern that this report confirms that there is every reason to believe that that organisation had an ulterior motive in the events of 1975 and the overthrow of the Whitlam Government, having regard to the fact that the Whitlam Government was required to renegotiate the agreements relating to American installations and bases in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this report is a most welcome addition to the sum of material on the activities and the criminal links of the Nugan Hand Bank. One newspaper reporter suggested yesterday that the bank seems to have been involved in every other form of illegal and subversive activity except banking. That seems to be beyond any doubt at all. I recall that when I first raised these matters some of my colleagues whose support and friendship I enjoy from time to time were somewhat incredulous that there should be this sort of organisation operating in Australia when I pointed out their links with the Narcotics Bureau in this country. This report indicates that, in fact, a lot of that evidence has now been made public. </PARA>
<PARA> This report brings together many of the fragments of information relating to Nugan Hand. It gives us an accurate background which is an essential prerequisite for an objective understanding of the past and present day drug and other activities, legal and otherwise, in or affecting Australia, of those under investigation and perhaps the operation of the drug trade generally. This report gives us a more complete picture of Nugan Hand's activities. The picture will improve, of course, when the confidential material which has been deleted from the report becomes available. The report shows clearly that the Opposition's long held concern with Nugan Hand has been warranted. It confirms what Mr Hayden , Mr Bowen and I have said. It highlights a number of important matters that I would like to highlight again. It highlights a significant linkage of drug- related and organised crime in Australia. It highlights that a number of senior crime figures are related to this organisation. It highlights a need for investigation of the link between intelligence agencies, particularly the CIA and ASIO, and drug-related crimes. It highlights the neglect of the Government of this important matter which can be counterposed in the Opposition's concern and a need to expand the terms of reference of the Stewart Royal Commission properly to take into account the spread and linkages of organised crime in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looked at those links throughout the report one would see confirmed the broad links that operate in the Australian drug world. Listed at pages 484 and 486 of the report is a schedule of drug traffickers known to have had dealings with Nugan Hand. It reads like a who's who of the drug crime world. Names like Murray Riley, James Sweetman, Andrew Lowe, Mr Wainwright, the Mr Asia syndicate and other people are mentioned. The extent of these things cannot be overstressed. Experts have argued that these links have existed. The Opposition has long put that view. Only now, in late 1982, are these arguments being confirmed as a result of this report. This is shown in chapter 16. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden, raised the Nugan Hand-CIA link in Parliament in March and April this year. The Government did not take his comments seriously. As recently as Tuesday, the Government was seeking still to downgrade the issue in the House. The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) quoted a statement from the CIA at some length as he did in April this year. The CIA naturally denied that it was involved in these sorts of activity. Therefore, the Government does not take the matter seriously. It will be to its everlasting regret if it does not carry on the work and look at what was done by people like Colby, Yates, Black, Vasey, Holgrean, Pauker, Houghton, Hand and all of those who have been substantially involved in the Nugan Hand organisation and whose links with the CIA are clearly outlined. Mr Hayden raised these matters, as did I. The activities particularly of Bernard Houghton and other matters have been raised in a series of articles in the National Times. All of these matters have been glossed over in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's response to the mounting evidence has been to ignore it, to sweep it under the carpet. Yet now, as this information comes to light, we have to say that the Government misled the Parliament when it produced that report earlier this year. It simply denied it. The Government has extended the terms of reference of the royal commission and obviously further links will be uncovered in due course. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to refer to the prices and incomes policy which is currently being put forward by the Australian Labor Party, at least in name. In fact, apart from the occasional references to a prices and incomes policy in the Parliament and the odd Press release, Labor has done very little to explain its policy, how it will work and what it is designed to do. It is one thing to say that we should have control of prices and wages and it is quite another thing to say at what level prices and wages should be pegged and what rate of increase is commensurate with the other economic goals. It is one thing to say, as is stated in a joint Press release of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Dolan:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The components of a prices and incomes policy are agreed between the parties rather than imposed by the Government . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is yet another to explain how that agreement is to be reached, or even, if such an agreement is attainable, why the policy is necessary in the first place. It is stated that the policy is 'directed towards equitable redistribution of income as well as basic economic objectives'. That does not explain whether the two are reconcilable or how the two concepts are defined in the first place. In other words, it becomes apparent that once the prices and incomes policy is stripped of its rhetoric very little of real substance remains. </PARA>
<PARA> From the little that one is able to glean from the announcements made from Mr Hayden and Mr Dolan, however, one thing is immediately apparent: The policy, to say the least, is one sided. On the one hand it promises 'a pricing authority with legislative criteria to assess price rise proposals by corporations within its jurisdiction'. That is, to control prices there will be a sort of revamped Prices Justification Tribunal with the power to decide whether a certain price increase is justified. When it comes to wages, we are promised a centralised wage fixing system in which full cost of living adjustments will be advocated as well as the maintenance in real terms of over award payments. We are also promised that wage and salary earners will share in national productivity gains 'either through increased real incomes or reduced hours, or an appropriate combination of both'. </PARA>
<PARA> The implication of the Labor prices and incomes policy is very clear. On the one hand it would establish a mechanism by which prices would be controlled and on the other it would rely on promises and handouts to gain the co-operation of the trade unions to ensure that wages remain under control. In this form the policy is nothing more than an admission that the Labor Party remains the anti- business party which is prepared to establish controls over the freedom of action of the business sector while taking no such action in respect of the real and main cause of Australia's economic problems-the uncontrolled demands of the trade unions. In this form the policy guarantees that real incomes will continue to rise. It would not have had the support of the trade union movement, even to the limited extent it does, if it had not contained such a promise. </PARA>
<PARA> Having identified business as the enemy in the present economic climate, Labor would set up new Government machinery to ensure that business cannot respond to increased costs, including wage costs, without the permission of a Prices Justification Tribunal. However, the sell-out to the ACTU does not end there. Under Labor's prices and incomes policy, prices would be controlled in such a way that 'unnecessary cost increases are not reflected in higher prices'. Labor spokesmen claim that that will discourage payment of wages beyond that warranted by increases in prices and increased national productivity. In part I agree because the employers will be discouraged from paying increased over award payments because they will not be able to demonstrate to the Prices Justification Tribunal that the corresponding price increase in any way is warranted. But it does nothing, as indeed is the case of the entire incomes policy, to prevent unions making demands for such wage increases. If it had done so, what would have happened? The Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union Assistant Secretary, Laurie Carmichael, made it very clear when he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> If and when I do discuss the substance . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He was referring, of course, to the trade union-ALP agreement-</PARA>
<PARA> I shall be taking the position that real wages must rise and not merely be maintained through indexation. </PARA>
<PARA>Carmichael is not interested in the capacity of business to pay for these real increases in wages. He made it clear that his union, the AMWSU, was not interested either. So in order to give the false impression of even-handedness in its prices and incomes policy the Labor Party says that under a centralised wage fixing system 'there shall be no extra claims except where special or extraordinary circumstances exist'. Those special or extraordinary circumstances are not defined in Labor's policy statement in any way. Of course, they are not intended to be. They are an escape clause for the Labor Party when it finds that the unions do not feel bound to accept a Labor Government's decision on wages, just as in 1974-75 when the unions wrung out wage increases of 25 per cent, the largest annual increase in the history of Australia, under a Labor Government, of which the present Labor leader was the then Treasurer. They are an escape clause designed to give the Labor Party an excuse for caving-in to union demands when the sort of scepticism of prominent trade union leaders expressed about the prices and incomes policy is translated into action. Crucial to Labor's claims is the attitude of the unions, especially since from the wages side the policy has no teeth to enforce moderation. But the strong indication from the trade unions is that they have reservations about the policy. Laurie Short, the Secretary of the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It would be very difficult to get every union in Australia and every employer to agree in a period of either full employment or massive unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>Although unemployment is presently very high, I think it would be untrue to say that it has become 'massive'. In this instance it seems, that the Federated Ironworkers Association believes such an agreement would not exist. Others have expressed similar reservations about a social contract where taxation relief and prices control are traded for wages restraint. I refer honourable senators to Ken Carr of the Federated Furnishing Trade Society of Australia. He made his union's position very clear when he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We are completely opposed to social contracts and we will have to express that view at any A.L.P. or trade union forums. </PARA>
<PARA>The Secretary of the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia, Pat Clancy, made his point even more clear when he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . we don't believe it's possible to have an incomes policy that gives wage justice to the ordinary worker. </PARA>
<PARA>The FIA and the BWIU and the joint federal secretary of one of Australia's largest unions, the AMWSU, at the Federal Labor Party Conference last July, stated that they also do not believe that the prices and incomes policy will meet their plans for future wage demands. The reason is that none of these unions is committed to restraining wage demands to restore some of Australia's competitiveness in world markets. Last year wages rose by an average of 15.2 per cent. In Japan the comparable figure was 4 per cent, in West Germany it was the same and in the United States of America it was 6 per cent. While much of the rest of the world is climbing out of its inflationary path-inflation rates in Japan, West Germany and the United States are 3.1 per cent, 5.1 per cent and 5.9 per cent respectively-Australia's annual inflation rate, based on figures for the September quarter this year, was 12.3 per cent. It is no coincidence that wages growth and inflation are both considerably higher in Australia than in three of our major trading partners because excessive wage demands are now the mechanism through which the inflation rate is being fuelled. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year Australia's trade deficit was $9,097m. In 1979-80 Australia posted a small deficit. I believe this graphically demonstrates and illustrates the effect of inflation on our competitiveness. It is no secret that the effect of this loss of competitiveness is eventually felt through business failures and increased unemployment. They are inevitable consequences of inflation, especially when inflation is high in one country while its trading partners enjoy lower inflation rates and greater stability in wages and on the industrial relations front generally. The fact is that the trade unions do not seem to be interested in these facts. If they were interested they would have offered wage restraints, which have presently not been demonstrated. They might even be expected to join the Labor Party, which is after all the political wing of the trade union movement, in its social contract-in its prices and incomes policy. Jack Garland made the position of one of Australia's largest unions very clear when, in July of this year, at the ALP National Conference he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> If one modicum of this proposal . . . is to be seen only as total wage restraint without clear understanding of the working people of this country that it is based on the proper premise that there must be automatic quarterly adjustments to wages and . . . allocations, probably annually, of productivity increases where those increases occur, then in fact we will not reach first base . </PARA>
<PARA>The Hayden-Dolan statement of 20 August this year makes it clear that in its desire to reach first base all those demands and more will inevitably be met. In fact, the element of wage restraint has been almost completely removed from Labor's social contract by threats of union non-co-operation. What is left is control of prices only or, to put it in another way, a fundamental attack on the ability of employers to meet the increasing wages bill which the unions have as good as promised will be forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two specific problems which ought to be considered in respect of this policy which the Labor Party has devised: Firstly, its relationship to the capacity-to-pay principle and, secondly, its effect upon inflation. The capacity -to-pay principle was well defined by the Vernon Committee of Economic Inquiry in 1965 when it wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the capacity to pay the proposed wage increase means that the expected performance of the economy will enable the proposed wage increase to be absorbed by the increased national output. In other words, the proposed increase will not of itself be expected to result in a change in the price level. </PARA>
<PARA>That would seem to be a very clear and proper enunciation of how wage increases should be structured. However, by advocating full cost of living adjustments, as reflected in the consumer price index, increases which go beyond the increased national output are promised. The CPI reflects increased State and Federal Government charges and cost increases for such items as petroleum products, which have no relationship whatever to national output. Employers will have to meet increased wage costs arising from factors which bear no relationship to the factors which the Vernon Committee defined as appropriate in considering a wage increase. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Labor Party's prices and incomes policy such price rises will be built into the wage growth component. It is simply a formula for further erosion of profits, for a further erosion of the capacity of business to employ, to expand its output, to enter new markets and generally to develop in the present economic circumstances. A prices and incomes policy, as it has been proposed by the Labor Party, is also a recipe for built-in inflation. Changes in tax scales to shift substantially the taxation mixture, as well as reductions in indirect taxation, can only mean increased government borrowings to finance the extravagant promises which Labor has already made. Proposals that any future taxation increases should be put to the trade union movement for ratification will virtually ensure a narrowing revenue base for government, promoting further government borrowings and increased inflation. Most importantly, by building into future wage movements the full effect of the CPI, including the impact on the CPI of external and government influences, Labor is building into the Australian economy a certain and permanent inflation situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor's proposal has no real checks on wages-only on prices-and when the wages pressures become too great for industry to bear either the prices machinery will break down or, if it is too rigid, business failures will result. The Labor Party has implied, rather naively, that prices and not wages are the source of the present inflation. Otherwise it would have sought to control both prices and wages. Instead it has sought to strike a bargain with the unions along the lines of the social contract which operated in Britain between 1974 and 1979. The experience of a prices and incomes policy there is well summarised by the Labor Government's Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Joel Barnett, who wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we went much further in the way we co-operated under the terms of the quaintly titled Social Contract, supposedly enshrining a new relationship between government and unions. To my mind the only give and take in the contract was that the government gave and the unions took. </PARA>
<PARA>Elsewhere Mr Barnett explained the effect of the social contract in Britain in disarmingly frank terms. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It may have helped secure our election victory but it did nothing to prevent- some would argue it ensured-the 27 per cent growth in earnings (in 1974). </PARA>
<PARA>The British prices and incomes policy, which was described by a Labor Government Minister as disastrous, helped bring the British economy to its knees. The same sort of wage chaos would also result in Australia. Labor's prices and incomes policy is not a credible alternative economic strategy. It is an attempt to secure an election victory by promising a situation of unencumbered wages growth . It has been recognised as such in the community. The Australian newspaper, in an editorial, claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the most reckless piece of political chicanery is the Australian Labor Party's supposed pact with the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA> Put simply it means that many thousands of trade unionists who might otherwise have hoped and expected to keep their jobs will find themselves without them. </PARA>
<PARA>Max Walsh, in the weekly magazine Australian Business, summed it all up with a very neat turn of phrase. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party has its own special brand of snake oil-it's called a prices and incomes policy. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a snake oil designed to charm the electorate but the reality of the matter is that, like previous attempts to control wages and prices both here and overseas, the appeal will quickly wear off when the real costs of such a policy have to be met in terms of lost jobs and higher inflation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the short time I have available to me on this, the first reading of a money Bill, I want to refer to something that occurred in 1975. It is not what we debated earlier today but rather a report which was put down in that year entitled 'Open Tertiary Education in Australia'. It was the final report of the Committee on Open University to the Universities Commission. It is a pity that, given the problems of 1975, this report received so little attention at the time and was left to languish for the succeeding seven years. In the last few days I have raised again the notion that Australia, if it is to do anything in relation to tertiary education and making education available to all sectors of society-in other words, to the problem of liberalising university entrance and intake-must look again at open tertiary studies. I believe it is very useful in 1982-even more than it was in 1975-to consider this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one reads the 1975 report on open tertiary education in Australia one is indeed struck by how far, in the short time since, we have moved in communication technologies. For example, there is in the report an offhanded reference to video and a rather desultory discussion about microfiche, which is ruled out as being far too expensive. All the projections that the report made at that time were for way off in the future. However, in 1982 we find that not only have we gone way beyond those rather futuristic possibilities that were mentioned in 1975 but also now have available to us, in hundreds of thousands of homes around Australia, the very basis needed for university or tertiary education studies. </PARA>
<PARA> I will mention only two ideas which suggest that this is a possibility. Firstly , in all tertiary studies-certainly the Open University in Britain has borne this out-there has continued to be a great reliance on the printed word. Of course, a microfiche reader enables one to have within one's grasp a fairly voluminous library at very little cost, certainly very little postage cost. A microfiche reader is now available for about $US20. Also, in the last year the British have developed a positive microfiche, as distinct from the negative microfiche which normally people know about. The positive microfiche is read by a different and much cheaper technique. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I raise concerns the availability of video. One of the major problems with video in 1975 was the enormous cost and fairly poor quality of reproduction. However in Australia the Australian Broadcasting Commission network has a large number of hours-I think in most States some eight or ten a day-which are unused. I refer to the period generally from 11 or 12 o'clock at night to the time when the early morning shows begin. That down time could be employed for the broadcasting of a range of educational material. One could set the normal on-off switch of a video machine to record these programs for later play-back. In other words, we do not have to look-as the intent was in 1975-at the enormous cost of either putting up a whole new communications channel or running these types of programs in prime time, the opportunity cost of which would also be enormous. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest those two examples show that in 1982 technical and technological communications facilities are such as to make available to Australia the opportunity that we have not had in the past. The availability of such courses would depend upon academic contribution. In Australia we already have in place adequate academic staff engaged in distance education. I refer, of course, to the existing units of external studies in a very large number of universities and colleges of advanced education. By employing academics in external studies and setting up a central technological body to bring the two items together, we would have a viable proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> What I mean by that is that the academics from the external studies units in universities and CAEs would provide the academic input. The centralised organisation, the technological input, would be provided by a group-presumably it would be based initially on existing facilities such as those able to be provided by the ABC but I hope it would very rapidly develop its own facilities- of producers, directors, script writers, graphic artists and other skilled communicators. These people would take the academic input and, in conjunction with the person who has developed that academic course, take it through from go to whoa. After they had dealt with that course they would have a package which was able to be communicated to the vast bulk of Australians. On overseas experience, the time that would take would be from nine months to 12 months per course. Therefore, it would probably be necessary in technical terms, in relation to staff appointments, superannuation and a number of other matters, to provide the open tertiary education institute or open university with a charter to enable those types of co-operative ventures to come about. It would seem far simpler to provide the institute with a charter, as a university, to enable it to offer degrees based on co-operation between a large number of institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe we are now at a point in Australia where we ought to look at the notion of providing open access to education institutions. We have a fairly highly educated population. Not all people are able to undertake full or part time studies. Many people are not capable of undertaking conventional external studies. The conventional external study program tends to be based very much on the ability to succeed at normal education institutions. If one looks at the success and failure rate between full time students who undertake full time study and those who undertake external studies the logical conclusion which one would draw from the statistics is that those groups of people are probably homogeneous in their makeup. </PARA>
<PARA> I am looking at a range of other people in the community who ought to be allowed to attempt higher education studies. The sole criterion should be that they reach the standard required by the institution when they sit for their examinations at the end of the first year. This type of opening-up would provide to those people who are seeking a degree-based course an opportunity which is unavailable at the moment. It would provide those who are not seeking a degree with a general education in a variety of areas which would, I believe, be suitable and beneficial. I notice that the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) is in the chamber. Perhaps at some stage he will be interested in opening up again this debate on the notion of open university in Australia. </PARA>

The Presiding Officers direction, as set out in the Australian Federal Police Standing instructions, provide that firearms will not be worn by police on duty inside Parliament House. Express permission was not given to police to carry sidearms in Parliament House on 26 October 1982.

<PARA> I am informed that on 26 October 1982, at the time of the disturbance in King's Hall, additional police were summoned from areas outside the precincts of the House to augment those already on duty here. A number of these were motor cycle police who, as part or their normal kit, carry a sidearm. The degree of urgency for additional police attendance on this occasion was such that the motor cycle police were still in their full kit, including holstered sidearms, when they entered Parliament House. The police response was appropriate and commensurate with the unusual circumstances which arose on that day. I think all honourable senators commended the police for the way in which they conducted themselves under extreme pressure during that period.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As the report on the selection and development of senior managers in the Australian Public Service was tabled some time ago in the House of Representatives and has received widespread comment-I am pleased to say favourable comment-in the Press, on this occasion I do not wish to read the whole of the statement which accompanies the report. For that reason I seek leave to incorporate the statement in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The 202nd report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts is unusual as it has broken new ground by addressing problems of Public Service personnel policy. In its 1980-81 annual report, the Committee advised the Parliament of the need for an inquiry into the selection and development of senior public servants. The Committee has feared for some time what has become manifest since, that in some areas the management of the Public Service is not meeting the demands of government. I must emphasise that the Committee does not denigrate the valuable contribution of many dedicated loyal and efficient officers at all levels in the Service but believe that reforms are necessary to ensure that senior officers are able to give of their best in the service of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Public Service is the nation's largest employer. Through it, the Commonwealth Government manages an extraordinarily complex organisation engaged in a wide range of activities as diverse as defence and foreign affairs, construction, consumer protection, health, education and social welfare. Such diversity provides flexibility in applying systems of management and personnel policy which the Committee believes are often neglected. The Australian political system is based on the principle of responsible government, in which Ministers are accountable to Parliament, and ultimately to the people for the conduct of public administration. The Commonwealth Constitution vests all legislative power in the Parliament, and the executive power in the Ministry, assisted by Departments. Yet it is a fact of contemporary political life that the government now includes the public service, with which the Ministry shares executive power. Under the Australian democratic system, power must not be severed from responsibility. By responsible government, we mean not only that the Ministry is responsible to Parliament, but also that the public service, through senior administrators, are answerable not only to Ministers but also to Parliament for their management of the resources provided by Government through the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> One must acknowledge that the Ministry and Parliament are legitimately empowered to determine the political parameters within which public policy is to be administered. However, within those parameters, senior public servants exercise a host of management functions relating to the delivery of programs that provide services to the public. A major factor in the degree to which the Commonwealth government can successfully respond is the performance and motivation of senior public servants. The Committee believes that if Parliament is to make them accountable for this management, then Parliament itself has a duty to outline the type of management it considers appropriate. At Federation, the task facing the public service was relatively simple. In addition to the Treasury, only 5 Commonwealth departmental responsibilities are mentioned in the Constitution. As a result of a substantial increase in the number of Departments , the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government to administer policies of great complexity has grown. Although Ministers remain responsible to Parliament for their departments, recent events have highlighted how difficult it is for an individual Minister to personally direct all activities relating to policy in the department. Thus there is a need for Parliament to redefine the relative responsibilities for accountability by Ministers and public servants. Under these changed circumstances, the Public Accounts Committee believes that improvements have to be made if the political system is to be kept within the spirit of responsible government. </PARA>
<PARA> The focus of this report is upon selection and development of senior managers and their Department Heads; a written appraisal system; external recruitment; on -the-job development; mobility; special development programs and courses; and the role of the Public Service Board in this field. However, it should not be thought that it is only public servants that require more careful selection and more thorough training. The Committee notes that Ministers also require managerial skills. Consequently Ministers, and potential Ministers, should have much greater opportunities for training in management and policy skills. While this may be difficult to achieve, the ideal should be attempted. The essence of good management is taking responsibility for an organisation, even though the details of directing its activities are delegated to others. This Inquiry convinced us that current senior staff selection and development practices need to be changed if the Public Service is to meet the challenges of the 1980's and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has recommended that the First and Second Divisions be replaced by a Senior Executive Group, within which promotion would be to a personal grade or level, rather than to specific positions, leaving department heads to allocate-and reallocate-specific tasks. These promotions would be made on the basis of general management, policy and administrative skills, rather than the requirement of a specific job. Departments would have much greater flexibility to design their top structures to accommodate the strengths and weaknesses of particular senior executives (thus a department would have freedom to promote an individual to a higher level without necessarily adding to the breadth of his or her responsibilities, and also to reduce the role of an officer with limited abilities). </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently the Committee believes that the concept of permanency should be redefined so that: senior career officers have permanency within the public service but no claim to a specific rank or position indefinitely; and the holding of senior rank within the senior executive group depend upon consistent and satisfactory performance of duties, together with the needs of the department and the service. This means that an officer could be required to accept a demotion should the appraisal report(s) indicate an inability to maintain the acceptable level of efficiency and effectiveness at that level. Under some circumstances, officers may wish to take a demotion in order to have less responsibility, a choice not currently available to them. The Committee expects that the PSB would be the appropriate body to develop guidelines for the implementation of these recommendations. We would assume they would include adequate provisions for appeals and preservation of accrued superannuation at the higher level. </PARA>

As a result of the meeting I would like to make a few comments on the importance, as I see it, of the IPU to Australia at the moment. Nine countries set up the IPU in 1889. Australia joined the IPU in 1956; there were then 39 members. Last year in Havana there were 99 member countries. As honourable senators can see from the holding of the conference in a place such as Cuba the guidelines, which state that all that a country has to have to become a member is a parliament according to its constitution, mean that any country which has any sort of parliament at all can join the IPU. It can be any sort of parliament as long as it is elected by the people. The parliament does not have to have a multi-party system. It does not have to sit for more than a day or two a year, as happens in Cuba. Many of the member countries do not have a vestige of an idea of what a democracy is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I am quite sure that everyone from the democracies which attended the IPU in Havana-including the Australian delegates-would query whether those objectives were undertaken in any way at all. I want to give some indication of the sort of thing that happens at these conferences. We could not get the simplest motion through that Inter-Parliamentary Union which, as I have said, exists to contribute to international understanding and peace. An item was raised which read:</PARA>
<PARA> Violations by Israel of the resolutions of the United Nations and the Inter- Parliamentary Union through its behaviour in the occupied Arab territories and its attacks against Lebanon . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I sought an amendment to that item. My amendment read:</PARA>
<PARA> Security Council resolutions 242 of November 1967 and 338 of October 1973, calling on all parties to enter immediately into negotiations aimed at establishing a just and durable peace in the Middle East;</PARA>
<PARA>All I was asking was that that conference show its concern for the problems in the Middle East by asking all parties to get together, negotiate on and aim at a durable peace in the Middle East. It seemed to me that that was a fairly moderate amendment to ask the IPU to accept remembering that its main objective is to foster international understanding and peace. But no, my amendment was not accepted. In fact, it was defeated. It was rejected by 28 votes to 26 votes with 2 abstentions. It seems to me incredible that such a very moderate amendment asking all parties to get together was defeated. I finally did get an amendment passed by leaving out the Security Council. The Security Council happened to be regarded by most of the member nations present as a bit taboo. The paragraph I proposed to insert reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Calls upon all parties concerned to enter immediately into negotiations aimed at establishing a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East;</PARA>
<PARA>It was a rather similar amendment. Again that amendment was knocked back. It was suggested that if I added the words 'including the PLO' the amendment would go through. The amendment called upon all parties, so there was really no need for the words 'including the PLO' to be added. But as it was a means of getting the amendment passed I agreed to have the words 'including the PLO' added. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe another issue throws some light on this subject. It was referred to on page 97 of our report. We point out that there was strain and confrontation within the Inter-Parliamentary Union during the Havana meeting. Dr Castro addressed the delegation. It is customary for the leader of the host country to welcome the 1,000 delegates who go along to these Inter-Parliamentary Union Conferences. Dr Castro spoke to us for two hours. We were a captive audience. He abused the United States; he abused the British; he abused all the Western democracies. In what was hardly a host-like way, he created tremendous strain and confrontation, as is mentioned in our report. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, we had a situation involving the chairman of the plenary session. Canada moved an amendment to a motion put by Nigeria about concern for human rights in El Salvador. Canada then added the amendment 'and in Afghanistan'. The amendment was accepted and there was quite a deal of debate on it. The motion was then to be put to the vote. The chairman of the plenary session, a Cuban, decided he did not like the amendment and said that he would not ask the nations to vote on it. Instead he insisted upon the original motion being put first, and only if that original motion were defeated would the amendment be put. As one can well imagine, delegates from the democracies took points of order. Australia took points of order on numerous occasions on whether or not amendments which had already been accepted ought to be put first, before the original motion. This took a couple of hours. In the end, after we had pointed out so many times that it was against all meeting procedures, the Cuban chairman just ended up saying: 'Well, that might be the way you do it in your country. I'm chairman. It's not going to be done here and I'll take the vote on the original motion'. The vote was taken. On that occasion I refused to vote on the motion relating to El Salvador. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to say any more about the conference in Havana. I have pointed out that many of the democracies had severe reservations about the way the meetings were conducted in Havana. Many have voiced those reservations. I have serious reservations about the value of Australia's participation in the IPU. I admit the conference has some things going for it. We do meet people from other countries; we do talk and create friendships. But I have great reservations about the value of the sessions to Australia. I would like there to be further discussions and further debate from other members who have attended these sessions. I think it would be valuable for this Parliament to make some decision as to whether we continue to send delegates to IPU conferences. </PARA>

<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>REPORT BY SENATOR ALAN MISSEN, SENATE DELEGATE TO THE AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION TO THE INTER-PARLIAMENTARY UNION CONFERENCE AT ROME-SEPTEMBER 1982</PARA>
<PARA> As the only Senator included in the delegation from the Australian Parliament, which attended the IPU Annual General Meeting at Rome, Italy in September 1982, I now make this report to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the 1982 official report by the Australian delegation has not yet been prepared and indeed will not be tabled in the Parliament until 1983, indeed the 1981 Delegation Report has not yet been tabled or debated in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I have consulted other members of the 1982 Delegation as to the contents of this Report and believe that my observations are supported by a number of the House of Representatives delegates. However I accept full responsibility for the conclusions and, as I believe they call for urgent action by the Australian Parliament, I now table this Report and seek to have early debate on its contents. </PARA>
<PARA> This Report contains observations of and conclusions formed from attendance both at the IPU Seminars at Lagos, Nigeria (April 1982) and the IPU Annual General Meeting at Rome, Italy (September 1982). The critical conclusions relate primarily to the method of operation of the IPU, indeed to its very existence, but do not reflect on the excellent efforts of the host nations and their IPU Sections in the provision of conference arrangements and other social events. These will no doubt be fully recognized in the full report of the Australian delegation to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Function of the IPU</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Experience of the two 1982 conferences leads to the inescapable conclusion that the IPU fails in its primary purpose of promoting and enhancing democratic parliamentary systems. The expansion in membership, which the IPU applauds, has now led to some 98 nations joining the IPU, yet the number of genuinely democratic parliaments in the world does not exceed 30. Consequently, the delegations from pro-Soviet and other authoritarian regimes have a numerical dominance and turn the debates and decisions of the conference into a 'mini- United Nations' gathering where mouth-pieces of totalitarian governments can carry outrageously one-sided resolutions (e.g. Lebanon and Israel; anti- colonialism and Falkland Islands). In the course of debate and in voting on these resolutions, the western European delegations, in particular, adopt a spineless attitude and often abstain from voting on the more offensive resolutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The continued participation of the western and other democracies in this farce only gives respectability to dictatorships employing the forms (but not the substance) of parliament and they make every use of it for propaganda purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact little or no attention is paid in discussions to the main problems of parliament in maintaining its real influence over governments, with the possible exception of the meetings of Parliamentary officials which takes place simultaneously with the main conference. I understand these meetings of officials concentrate mainly on the more abstruse aspects of parliamentary procedure, but rarely consider the real problems e.g. the relevance and effectiveness of Parliament, its central position in government, and the resistance to Executive dominance over Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I recommend to the Australian Parliament that we immediately enter into negotiations with the U.S.A., Great Britain, European and other democratic States to secede from the IPU and form a new Union of genuinely democratic parliamentary States, which will concentrate on the promotion of the parliamentary system and the adaptation of Parliament to the needs of modern government. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge this action on the Australian Parliament for the foregoing and also the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA>Method of Procedure of IPU</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The IPU has, for some time, been considering the ''Erickson'' plan, a very mild suggestion of reform of the procedures of the conferences. However, even this proposal has met with opposition and it will not, in any event, overcome the real weaknesses of the IPU. It will indeed reduce the items for discussion at the two yearly conferences but the present tedious form of debate in plenary sessions would be retained. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular feature of the conferences is the long series of prepared speeches, largely of a propaganda or national promotional type delivered over long hours of the conference. In contrast to the previous Conference in Cuba, ( where I understand the Chairmanship was outrageously partisan) the general conduct of the Lagos and Rome conferences was fair. Yet the tedious procedures ensure that there is little or no debate in the real sense of the word (except in the smaller drafting committees at Lagos). When the resolutions are presented to the plenary sessions, one speaker is allowed for and one against any amendment although ''points of order'' enable some other interventions. The tedious roll-call voting takes up hours of the conference time. </PARA>
<PARA> The debating sessions are consequently unconstructive, without real exchange of views and most voting is shaped by prior meetings of factions (such as the so- called ''Committee of 10''-actually 22-western nations, meetings of the Soviet bloc, and the Arab group). </PARA>
<PARA> The inconsequence of debate was illustrated by the ''welcome'' of Yasser Arafat to intervene in the debate and speak to the conference. He is a figure who, as I pointed out to the conference, was totally irrelevant to democratic parliamentary institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>Nature of Resolutions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The passage of resolutions at the IPU conferences has little consequence and leads to no observable follow-up (apart from reports to national parliaments). On the whole, they deserve little respect as they fall into two categories:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Resolutions of a ''motherhood' nature, full of cliches, platitudes and empty rhetoric, with often the irrelevant inclusion of buzz words like ''peace'' , ''disarmament'', ''colonialism'' or ''zionism''. </PARA>
<PARA> Study of the Rome conference resolutions on environment and on world hunger will show that they make up, in their tedious length, for an almost total absence of content or the facing up to real problems. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Resolutions where vituperation prevails and the Soviet and its allies have successfully exploited anti-American, or anti-Israeli sentiments in the conference. </PARA>
<PARA> Resolutions at the Rome conference on anti-colonialism and a special resolution on the Lebanon-Israel situation are classic examples of this, being absolutely one-sided condemnations that would be a disgrace to any deliberative assembly. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly enough, the U.S.A. delegates were absent, apparently at a party, when an anti-British condemnation on the Falkland Islands was carried by a majority of 4 votes (and the 22 U.S.A. votes accordingly could not be counted). Again, on the last day when final resolutions were adopted, the U.S.A. delegation had already flown home, giving no encouragement to those opposing these resolutions. If the U.S.A. is to continue membership in this charade, its delegates should at least be there for the voting. I am relieved to report that a majority of the Australian delegation voted against most of the offensive resolutions (while the rest abstained). </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to resolutions described in (a) (motherhood resolutions) the avid desire of western delegations to seek compromises is ever present. It leads to the results that no-one is really offended by the ultimate resolution, but one wonders whether the effort is really worthwhile. </PARA>
<PARA>Conference Controversies</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> During the week of the conference in Rome there were constant negotiations and intrigues over the appointment of a new IPU President (as if it really mattered) . The western-supported Belgian candidate failed to 'get up' and ultimately the Soviet-supported Finnish candidate won the post (and Finland was awarded the next conference site). Westerners feared, possibly with good reason, that the Finnish President would be too much under Soviet influence, but the officials of the IPU are too inured to compromise to make this any real change in the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The other great controversy was over the site of the next annual meeting in September/October 1983. South Korea made the only offer and one might have expected little opposition, but the North Koreans, and the rest of the Soviet bloc, went to inordinate lengths to stop a decision being made. Ultimately they were voted down and South Korea's offer was accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> One might observe, particularly from Lagos, that the great cost and trouble of accommodating and entertaining between 1000 and 2000 delegates and their spouses is an excessive demand on the economies of some host nations. The time, effort and expenditure is worthy of a better result. </PARA>
<PARA>Resolutions on Parliamentary Institutions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Juridical, Parliamentary and Human Rights Committee (Australian representatives: Senator Missen and Mr Klugman) produced a resolution that did not fit the two classes earlier described. In Lagos, we were able (despite Soviet and Bulgarian objections and threats) to secure the adoption of a general resolution that did uphold the balance of power between Parliament and Government, called for scrutiny of government actions (particularly in foreign affairs) and upheld democratic elections, free media, rights of opposition parliamentarians and decentralized control. Despite further Soviet attempts at Rome to 'degut' the proposals, the resolution remains undamaged and constituted one of the Soviet failures at the conference. One problem was that the original 'topic' for discussion was so confused that it led to controversy and part of the topic was ruled irrelevant by the Chairman. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Representation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ryan and Mr Mick Young, M.P. (A.L.P. representatives at Lagos) decided, probably for good reason, that their positions as A.L.P. spokesmen required their presence at Canberra, and they withdrew from the Rome delegation. As the A .L.P. did not then include a Senator, the consequential attendance at Rome consisted of 8 Members of the House of Representatives and one Senator (and no women). I have found it impossible, to date, to find out how this allocation is made. The delegation was, as a consequence, somewhat unbalanced but all Australian delegates played an active and useful part in the deliberations, within the limits of the conference procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the traditional justification, adopted by most delegations ( including many Australians) that the IPU serves some purpose in bringing together diverse nations, promoting friendships and exchange of ideas. It does so, to some extent, although it also leads to an 'old boys' attitude, with many delegates coming to conferences for their own benefit, year after year, (some up to 20 years in a row. In contrast, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, though limited in its membership, does concentrate on parliamentary needs and reforms and is educative for inexperienced parliamentarians. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that such exchanges are useful, they would prevail in a genuinely democratic parliamentary body to which other nations could aspire to join. At present, the mere existence in a country of a formal representative body (even if it is a one-party state lacking free debate or opposition) is enough to admit that country to IPU membership. </PARA>
<PARA> But the cost of our continued promotion of this mock parliamentary body and the propaganda it provides for 'parliaments' that are a mere parody of democracy is too great a price to pay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to make some brief comments on the statement. It is not what one might regard as the usual statement from someone who has just come back from a conference. I have listened with interest to what has been said already today by Senator Walters in regard to the previous conference, which had the further disastrous disadvantage of being in Cuba. Ours was in Rome and one could say it was run with reasonable precaution so far as the rights of delegates were concerned. But it still showed up, as I trust my statement will indicate, the futility and uselessness of this body to which we have been sending delegates for some years. </PARA>
<PARA> I have made this statement knowing full well that the report on the 1982 conference probably will not emerge in this Parliament for another year. We have just seen that the 1981 conference document was put down in the House of Representatives yesterday and here in the Senate today, well over a year after the conference took place. That is an indication of the significance and urgency of those conferences. It is clear that no start has been made on the official report of the 1982 conference. I came back to this country determined that we should set on the way, in the manner I have recommended in my statement, the idea that Australia and the Western powers ought to secede from this organisation and set up a genuine democratic inter-parliamentary union which is concerned with parliaments and is not concerned to masquerade as a mini-United Nations or to spend its time with such irrelevancies as inviting out of the blue Yasser Arafat and others to come to address the conference. I want an organisation concerned with parliamentary purposes. The fact is that the IPU is an organisation with nearly 100 members from alleged parliaments. In most cases they are not parliaments; they are just playthings of the government. The representatives who come to the conference, like the Iranian delegates and others, are merely spokesmen for governments which bear no resemblance to those which observe parliamentary practice as we know it. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting to read in the report presented by Senator Walters the remarks which Mr Barry Cohen M.P. made at the conference last year. He said that Havana would be his last IPU conference, and he wanted delegates to know why he would never participate in such a farce again. I say the same thing. I assure honourable senators I shall never attend any such conference again. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not just the United Kingdom; it is the United States and other countries as well. Delegates go back time and again. Mr Cohen, in his remarks about the conference, said that if the IPU continued as it had in the immediate past it was possible that the genuine democracies would walk out of the organisation and form their own association. He, for one, supported such a move. I must say I entirely agree with him. I trust I have added further fuel to the desire which he expressed. The only genuine justification for this body is the interchange between members of parliament from around the world. Of course, that has some merit. Friendships are made and people do exchange some information. If we had a genuine inter-parliamentary union which was concerned with the problems of democratic parliaments and with the problems which parliaments have in keeping some control over the executives in the various democratic countries, and which was working on the updating of parliamentary procedure, we would still have the interchange with people but not the humbug and hypocrisy which absolutely dominate these conferences. At present the Western powers and delegates compromise all the way. Unfortunately that happened to some of our delegates. They compromised on the most outrageous resolutions which should have been opposed. Because they would have displeased this one or that one, they chose to abstain. Not only did they do that in the course of proceedings but also they were often absent when they should have been there to vote.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this statement, honourable senators will find my reference to the United States. The United States is clearly a world leader, but is that an excuse for 22 delegates from the United States to be a party when a resolution that censured Great Britain's action in the Falklands was carried by four votes? They were not present that night. When the final disagreeable resolutions were being put through on the last day, the United States delegates had gone home a day early on Air Force 1, or whatever they call their government plane. If one is to be part of an organisation one has to be there for the votes and to take the unpleasant consequences of them. It seems to me quite clear that we have to face up to this issue. I am not suggesting in this document-I will not say any more than this-that just a walk-out by us will achieve anything. I am saying that it is time that the Western powers said to other countries that are genuine democracies: 'Can we set up an organisation which has some genuine usefulness and start afresh?' That is why I have taken the opportunity to make this statement. I hope that it will encourage debate when this report and that of Senator Walters come on for debate early next session. Both reports have a great deal of common experience across these two areas. I believe that we ought to have a full debate in this Parliament about whether we will send delegates. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the Senate sent only one delegate to this conference and that no woman represented the Australian Parliament. I was the only delegate from the Senate. I am not criticising Senator Ryan, who chose not to go to this conference. She had been to the one in Lagos, but she felt that her more important duties were concerned with her party activities instead of going to Rome. I really think she was probably absolutely right. The result was that there were at the conference one senator and eight members of the House of Representatives, which I would have thought would have been a matter of some interest to honourable senators on both sides of the chamber. That is only a minor point. The major point is that it is impossible to do anything with this body. It sets itself up as a mini-United Nations. It carries the most beastly and unreasonable resolutions and it spends very little time in genuine debate. For these reasons, I have moved to take note of the statement that I have made. I hope that we will be able to engender a full debate on this in the near future . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise extremely briefly to note with concern the report by Senator Alan Missen in relation to his participation in the Inter- Parliamentary Union conference in Rome in September of this year. It is a matter that honourable senators will need to take extremely seriously when a senator of Senator Missen's calibre and his general and well-known concern for the parliamentary institution comes to the conclusion that within that union of parliamentarians no scope can be found for expression of genuinely independent views such as would be expected if indeed they were acting as parliamentarians elected as part of a genuinely democratic process. Rather, it is the case, as I certainly experienced in Cuba in September of last year, that so many of the delegates merely express the viewpoint of the executive government to which they owe allegiance and indeed vote as a bloc.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was the experience of the Australian delegation of which I was a member in Cuba that so overwhelmingly well organised were the blocs aligned with the Soviet Union, aided and abetted by nations calling themselves non-aligned but in fact mere puppets in relation to Soviet foreign policy, that we were left stranded. I think that is the point at which I would perhaps differ a little from Senator Alan Missen's conclusion. I feel that we may be nearing a stage where parliamentarians from genuine democracies may feel that, for a proper exchange of views on the matters of concern not only in relation to the relationships with the executive in their respective countries but also in relation to matters of foreign policy and other issues of major concern to the world's future, a separate forum is required-a forum of which it would be a privilege to be counted a member. Indeed, it would be a privilege much sought.</PARA>
<PARA> This is the case, for example, with the Socialist International to which the Australian Labor Party is affiliated at an international level. The fact is that many organisations claiming to be socialist parties attempt to affiliate themselves with the Socialist International, seeing it as a privilege and as a mark of recognition, but are denied such affiliation because they are not truly operating as genuine parliamentary parties in a political process which we would describe as democratic. There have been quite a few instances-I will not name the countries concerned-of governments setting up puppet opposition parties to get that opposition party into the Socialist International and to give an appearance of democratic activity in the country concerned. Even in the experience of Senator Missen in Rome, there was an instance, which he records in his report, of he and Dr Klugman of the Australian Labor Party during discussions of the Juridical, Parliamentary and Human Rights Committee securing a resolution-I take it that it was affirmed in plenary session-concerning the proper balance of power between parliament and government, calling for scrutiny of government actions, particularly in foreign affairs, and upholding democratic elections, free media, the rights of opposition parliamentarians and so on. In other words, with proper organisation, foresight and a lot of extremely hard work it is possible to achieve some results. </PARA>
<PARA> My experience in Cuba led me to believe then that it was the failure of parliamentarians from the Western democracies and the failure of my own Socialist International to organise before the IPU conference which allowed the Soviet bloc in particular to so overwhelm the voting on the resolutions of the Conference. What needs to occur is what occurs in relation to the Soviet bloc, namely, those of us who belong to the genuine democracies, to the genuinely non- aligned countries, and to such supranational organisations as the Socialist International should get together to look at the resolutions that are to come before plenary session and try to regain some of the original purpose and ethos of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. If that proves impossible, we may need to take the step-I do not think it is very far off-of leaving the IPU and forming a genuinely democratic parliamentary body to which other nations, as I say, would aspire to join. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I place on the record my disgust also with the United States delegation, because both in Cuba and apparently in Rome that delegation, which purports to represent the Congress of the most powerful nation in the so-called free world, has failed to provide even the numbers to enable votes to be affirmed which would reflect our beliefs in the nature of parliamentary democracy. The fact is that not only have numbers not been provided as they ought by the United States delegation-that would be bad enough-but also there has been a dearth of reasonable, reasoned argument from the delegation on the occasions when they have been present at plenary session. I think it is a failure of the United States Congressional delegation to give not the leadership , but the strength which ought to come from that democratic institution, which has played a large part in the demise of the IPU. I am saying that unless in the next year or two the United States of America, the genuine parliamentary democracies, the genuinely non-aligned countries and supra-national organisations such as the Socialist International get together before the plenary session of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and, without requiring bloc votes and unthinkingly falling into line, nevertheless provide a genuine coherent and cohesive voice for the aspirations of the democratic parliamentary bodies around the world, I think we ought to withdraw. I can only say that for two years now well-respected parliamentarians from the House of Representatives and now the Senate have alerted us to this problem, and we ought to take their warning very seriously and try to respond to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks will be brief. Although I do not agree with Senator Missen's recommendation, I am attracted to it but some remarks need to be made about it. He recommends that the Australian Parliament immediately enter into negotiations with the United States of America, Great Britain, European and other democratic states, to secede from the Inter- Parliamentary Union and form a new union of genuinely democratic parliamentary states. If Senator Missen's recommendation is agreed to by this Parliament I would say that Australia will no longer be entitled to send a delegate to the IPU or whatever organisation is formed, because Australia cannot be classed as a truly democratic parliamentary state. The State Government of Western Australia is not elected under a democratic franchise, the Upper House in Victoria is not elected under a democratic franchise and the Queensland Parliament is certainly not elected under a democratic franchise. We have to set about bringing democracy to those three States. No doubt we will be doing something about it in Victoria but we might have to wait some months before we can set about it in Western Australia. We could wait until the end of this century before we can do something about it in Queensland. We are going to have to do something and I hope that Senator Missen will support any moves that are made in this chamber to bring about a sense of democracy in Australia so that if his recommendation comes into being we can take our place as representatives of a truly democratic country, something which Australia is not at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Words have been said about bloc votes. I was fortunate to be a delegate to the IPU conferences in Prague and in Caracas in 1979. I was astounded to hear what some of our Australian delegates had to say before they got there. They went there with preconceived ideas. They were opposed to some of the Eastern bloc countries before they ever met the delegates. They were not prepared to sit down and discuss the problems. They went there with preconceived ideas and they even enunciated them in this Parliament. I will not mention who they are. Senator Missen probably knows. One of them is now a Minister in the Government. I had the unfortunate experience of being with him and arguing with him every morning prior to the Conference sessions when the Australian delegation met to decide what its tactics would be. Every morning, immediately after breakfast, there was an argument on his attitude to the people of the other nations which were represented at that conference. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot legitimately level criticism at other countries whem some of our own delegates go to the conferences with preconceived ideas and without being prepared to sit down and listen to the problems which affect other countries. I look forward to the full debate on this matter. I also look forward to Senator Missen making some move in his own party so that we can bring about a democratic system in Australia so that all of our parliaments are elected by a simple majority of the electors-whether the Government be the party I am a member of or the party Senator Missen is a member of. At least the people ought to be given the opportunity to be represented by a party in a democracy and have the Government elected democratically. </PARA>

I referred to them very briefly, but I point out that I took them very much on the run. In any event the questions had been asked a good five weeks earlier. I suggest to the Minister concerned that he take whatever steps are appropriate to point out to those responsible for this that that really is not a fast enough response to an Estimates committee request.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-My statement on the annual report of the departments and authorities is a fairly lengthy statement running into 12 pages. I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The first six reports of the Senate Committee on Finance and Government Operations on 'Statutory Authorities of the Commonwealth' were tabled on 20 February 1979, 15 November 1979, 19 February 1980, 22 May 1980 and 15 September 1982. The report of the Joint Committee on Publications entitled 'Annual Reports of Commonwealth Departments and Statutory Authorities' was tabled on 13 September 1979. The Government has reviewed and is now responding to the recommendations in these reports relating to annual reporting arrangements and to the Senate Committee's observations and comments on the annual reports of specific authorities mentioned in its third, fourth and sixth reports. </PARA>
<PARA> Wider issues relating to statutory authorities (raised particularly in the fifth Senate Committee report) are still under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The reports of both the Senate Committee and the joint Committee contain recommendations directed towards ensuring that annual reports are submitted to Parliament expeditiously and maintain a high standard of quality and integrity in the information they impart and hence fulfil their potential as accountability documents to the Government and Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of statutory authorities, the Senate Committee recommends the enacting of an 'annual reports Act' while the report of the Joint Committee included recommendations that new legislation to establish an authority should include specific reporting provisions and that reporting provisions in existing legislation should be defined and improved whenever such legislation is being amended. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government agrees with the recommendations requiring the timely submission of annual reports and with the objective of achieving a high standard of quality and integrity in reporting. However, the Government is not convinced of the need to introduce new legislation solely to achieve this objective. </PARA>
<PARA>Legislation And Guidelines For Authorities</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Instead, the government has decided that it will introduce, in the next Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill, an amendment to the Acts Interpretation Act to require all major statutory authorities to submit timely annual reports. The amendments will ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA> All major authorities submit annual reports as soon as possible and not later than 6 months after the end of their financial year (unless a shorter period is provided in the legislation of an individual authority), and that Ministers table authorities' reports within 15 sitting days of receiving them;</PARA>
<PARA> any extension of this deadline must be accompanied by an explanation of the reasons tabled in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The three month period proposed most recently by the Senate Committee for non- commercial authorities is too short a period to include in legislation-although the Government would expect it would normally be met. </PARA>
<PARA> The only two major statutory authorities which the Government proposes be exempted from these legislative requirements are the Australian Security Intelligence Organization and the Office of National Assessments: National security considerations require that the special reporting arrangements now applying to them remain. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations relating to form of financial statements are still under consideration, as mentioned earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also examined the specific requirements for non-financial information that both the Senate Committee and the Joint Committee have recommended be included in statutory authority annual reports. The Government has drawn up a set of guidelines which, as well as supplementing the proposed legislative requirements, specify the non-financial information authorities are to provide in future annual reports and, as these matters directly concern the Parliament, I seek leave to incorporate the guidelines in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will draw to the attention of Commonwealth authorities the arrangements now available for the publication of annual reports at times when Parliament is not sitting and will encourage authorities to make use of this mechanism for their annual reports when those reports cannot be prepared in time for tabling when Parliament is sitting. Authorities will also be advised of procedures for making copies of such reports available to all members and senators. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Committee also recommended that if an authority were unable to meet the deadline for presentation of its annual report, an 'interim report' should be provided and tabled. The Government does not propose to require such reports as a general rule as it believes this could lead to confusion through having ' interim' and 'annual' reports tabled. Authorities would not be prohibited from tabling interim reports and, in some circumstances, would be encouraged to do so . However, if unable to meet the deadline for submission of an annual report, an authority will now be required by law to advise the Minister, who shall report to the Parliament, of the reasons for the delay. </PARA>
<PARA>Guidelines For Departments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Besides making recommendations on reporting arrangements for authorities, the Joint Committee on Publications put forward proposals for departmental annual reports. The Government had already approved a set of guidelines for such reports and a copy of these was provided to the joint Committee. I now seek leave to have a copy of the guidelines, with some additions and alterations in line with the Committee's proposals, also incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will also require departments to report as soon as practicable ( if possible, in time for Estimates committees' consideration), and certainly well within six months of the end of their reporting period. </PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Committee also made a number of recommendations concerning the physical production of annual reports and related aspects. The Government agrees , in principle, with these recommendations, which will be drawn to the attention of departments and authorities and will be kept in mind by the Australian Government Publishing Service. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate Committee's Observations On The Annual Reports Of Specific Authorities</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the Senate Committee's observations and recommendations on the annual reports of those authorities which the Committee found cause to mention in its third, fourth and sixth reports, particular attention was paid to some technical difficulties which led to delays in presentation. </PARA>
<PARA> These included difficulties related to the conversion from a cash accounting system to an accrual system, the procedures involved in approval of the form of financial statements and the audit of the accounts and financial statements, and the capacity of the Australian Government Publishing Service to provide for the design and to co-ordinate the production of annual reports.</PARA>
<PARA> To a large extent, the Senate Committee itself recognised that explanations for past delays had been given and appropriate action had been taken. The Government sees no need to rehearse further the histories of particular difficulties. However, I wish to draw attention to the statement made by the Minister for Primary Industry in the House of Representatives on the future preparation of annual financial statements of the Australian Wheat Board (Hansard 1980, page 1534). In any case, the guidelines I have mentioned are also aimed at the prompt provision of annual reports by Commonwealth bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators, the Government trusts that the new arrangements and proposed legislation will improve the overall performance of Commonwealth departments and authorities in their reporting to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>GUIDELINES FOR THE CONTENT, PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION OF ANNUAL REPORTS BY STATUTORY AUTHORITIES</PARA>
<PARA>Introduction</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> These guidelines are intended to cover generally the annual reporting requirements for statutory authorities (incorporated or unincorporated authorities established by or pursuant to a law of the Commonwealth or of the A. C.T.) and are subject to refinement in the light of experience. </PARA>
<PARA> Reports of small unincorporated authorities and office holders within the public account may continue to be included in the related departmental reports where it is practical to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The guidelines do not, of course, override statutory requirements imposed by the legislation on individual authorities, but to the extent that they require a higher standard than does the legislation, they should be followed by all such authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> All authorities are to provide annual reports as soon as possible after the end of their financial year, if possible in time for the estimates debate in the Budget Sittings. At the very latest, reports should be submitted within six months (unless a shorter period is provided in the legislation of an individual authority). An explanation will be submitted to Parliament if the deadline has to be extended in exceptional cases (the new deadline is to be mentioned in the explanation). Ministers will ensure that reports are tabled within fifteen sitting days of receipt. </PARA>
<PARA> Where there is a requirement for a form of financial statements to be approved by the Minister for Finance, authorities should commence negotiations with the Department of Finance early enough to allow issues to be resolved without delaying the annual report. Authorities also need to bear in mind the need for reasonable time to be allowed for completion of auditing of the financial statement within the six month deadline. </PARA>
<PARA>Report Contents</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Reports should be the means of providing a wide dissemination of information on authorities, with special attention being given to making available material that might not otherwise be made public as a matter of course. </PARA>
<PARA> Application of these guidelines to those authorities engaged in commercial competition with the private sector is subject to the need to protect commercially sensitive material. </PARA>
<PARA> The following information is to be provided in future annual reports:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Enabling legislation: A clear statement of the legislation (if any) under which the organisation operates. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Responsible Minister: To be shown. A description of any statutory powers of direction which the Minister has over the authority and details of the exercise of any such powers, subject to the need to protect confidential information, to be included. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Powers, Functions and Objects: To be detailed. </PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Membership and Staff: A list of the members of the body and their terms of appointment, together with listing of senior executive staff and a statement of the total number of staff employed by the organisation. In addition, the basis for staffing of the organisations should be identified. The address and phone number of the information officer should also be included. </PARA>
<PARA> (v) Financial Statements: All Government bodies should provide statements which adequately disclose financial aspects of their activities. For example, where the form of a body's financial statements is approved by the Minister for Finance, the approved form must, of course, be followed; where an unincorporated body has no specific financial responsibilities and no financial reporting requirement exists, it might be appropriate to disclose departmental receipts and expenditures relevant to its operations, while avoiding unnecessary duplication of the information contained in the annual Financial Statements prepared by the Minister for Finance. The requirement for adequate disclosure will extend to bodies incorporated under companies legislation if the Commonwealth is sole owner or shareholder; this will not affect the need to satisfy the reporting requirements under company law. The Department of Finance and the Auditor-General's Office are preparing guidelines which will assist Commonwealth undertakings in preparing financial statements; an exposure draft entitled 'Proposed Guidelines for the Form and Standard of Financial Statements of Commonwealth Undertakings' was issued in August 1980. The Exposure Draft has been considered by the relevant Parliamentary Committees. </PARA>
<PARA> (vi) Activities and Reports: A description of the principal programs and activities of the body noting objectives and reviewing achievements. Information on interaction with other authorities, departments and State and international bodies should be provided as should a list of publications during the reporting period. </PARA>
<PARA> (vii) Operational Problems: A description of the major problems which have arisen in the body's activities, including details of requisite Government action to overcome such problems e.g. the amendment of the enabling Act. </PARA>
<PARA> (viii) Subsidiaries: Details of subsidiary companies formed, or interest acquired in existing companies, are to be provided. It is a desirable practice to include the annual report of such subsidiaries as are controlled by the parent authority with the report of that authority, where this is feasible. </PARA>
<PARA>GUIDELINES FOR DEPARTMENTAL ANNUAL REPORTS</PARA>
<PARA>A. General Principles</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> (1) Reports should be the means of providing a wide dissemination of information on the activities of departments, with special attention being given to making available material that might not otherwise be made public as a matter of course. Undue repetition of material already widely publicly available should be avoided; reference to the source and availability of such material may be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) The reports should provide an account of departments' more significant activities and any background information necessary to an understanding of these . </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Reports should be oriented towards administrative, managerial and operational aspects of departmental activities. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) Ministers will be responsible for tabling annual reports in the Parliament and otherwise publicising them. The detailed content of reports will be the responsibility of Permanent Heads who should consult as necessary with their Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> (5) Where comments are made impinging on the operations of other departments and authorities, special care should be taken to see that all views are presented in a balanced way. </PARA>
<PARA> (6) Reports should be concise yet present all information necessary for an understanding of the matters covered. Some reports, especially those from policy oriented departments, may be quite short. </PARA>
<PARA> (7) As reports are to provide information on the operation of departments rather than to promote them, modest standards of production are desirable and appropriate. Relevant AGPS Guidelines should be closely observed. </PARA>
<PARA> (8) If practicable, reports should be prepared on a financial year basis and should be available if possible for the estimates debates, in the Budget Sittings. When there are difficulties getting reports finished in time for the estimates debates departments should provide an interim statement in A4 duplicated form for the information of the Parliament. Departments currently producing annual reports on a calendar year basis may continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>B. Contents</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> (1) Standard information such as:</PARA>
<PARA> a top structure organisation chart, including regional offices and associated bodies, with an indication of those that report separately to the parliament</PARA>
<PARA> a brief outline of the main functions of the department, highlighting any changes consistent with the Government's policy on access to information, an indication of further sources of information, including other publications, policy information and policy discussion papers and references to submissions to various advisory mechanisms, committees of inquiry, etc. with adequate bibliographic details and address and phone number of information officer</PARA>
<PARA> selected financial information associated with the administration of programs and the operation of the departments; this information should be consistent with financial information published in the Budget Papers, and the Financial Statements prepared by the Minister for Finance</PARA>
<PARA> statistics in annual comparative form, on main programs administered and departmental administration, including staffing</PARA>
<PARA> a list of senior officers (at divisional head level and above)</PARA>
<PARA> information relating to the Freedom of Information Act (covered by separate guidelines issued by the Attorney-General's Department)</PARA>
<PARA> reference to the activities of smaller statutory and non-statutory bodies responsible to the Minister where separate reports are not produced by these bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Optional information such as:</PARA>
<PARA> a description of programs, particularly those involving direct services to the public, including significant developments during the year and reference to the principal Acts administered</PARA>
<PARA> reviews of objectives, processes and achievements, including information on management improvement activities</PARA>
<PARA> personnel development activities</PARA>
<PARA> systems and legislative changes significantly affecting the department</PARA>
<PARA> the effects of administrative review mechanisms (Ombudsman, Administrative Appeals Tribunal, etc.) on the organisation, operation and workload of the department and any consequent changes in procedures and decision making processes. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(3.2)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a few matters in relation to the estimates for the Department of the Treasury. The first matter relates to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. During the hearings of Estimates Committee C I asked Treasury officials whether they could supply me with a comparison of the forecasts of the OECD and the eventual results. I was somewhat prompted to do so because a Minister, in a three-month burst, waved around an OECD report as living proof that the Australian economy was not only in a healthy position but also was going to get healthier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wondered at the time what the validity of the OECD forecasts would be and how accurate they were. I also wondered about the degree to which we should take notice of them. I will take just one or two indicators out of the answers supplied. The first one relates to economic growth. In 1979 the OECD overestimated the rate of economic growth in Australia by 1.75 per cent. In 1980 it overestimated the rate of economic growth by 0.95 per cent. According to the last available figures for 1981, it overestimated the rate of economic growth by 1.65 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I was a little suspicious about that. As the OECD had overestimated the rate of economic growth, I thought it might have been consistent and overestimated the rate of inflation. However, looking at the figures for 1979, I saw the OECD underestimated the rate of inflation by 1.75 per cent. It underestimated the rate of inflation by 1.6 per cent in 1980 and by 0.15 per cent in 1981. These comparisons do not necessarily mean that the OECD is in any way a poor predictor of economic trends.They do not mean that it does not do valuable work, that we should not be a member of this body. It costs us $140,000 per annum plus the cost of trips to be a member. In the last five years the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has never qualified or amended OECD draft reports. I am not saying today that we should pull out of the OECD. All I am saying is that Ministers should not come into this chamber and regard the OECD's predictions as absolutely accurate. They should not wave details of them at the Opposition and say that the points that Opposition is making about the economy are not correct because the OECD has said other things. Of course, in the last three or four months Senator Sir John Carrick has not been doing that in here because the disparity between the OECD predictions and the end result in Australia has been too great. So he has gone back to his normal pastime of berating the Whitlam Government when answering questions. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I wish to raise very briefly under the Treasury item concerns the Taxation Advisory Committee. I did not know then the purpose of this Committee and I still do not know what value it really serves. The Committee held nine meetings with the Treasurer to June 1982. I think it costs about $10, 000 to get this body together, and this is probably not an exorbitant amount, but I cannot quite understand the purpose it actually serves. I know that it has been established for the purpose of advising the Treasurer. However, I do not see a need for such a committee as we have a Taxation Office which costs probably upwards of several hundred million dollars to run and which provides advice. I asked the Commissioner of Taxation for his comments on the Taxation Advisory Committee. However, consistent with being a good public servant, he just blushed and said nothing. I take that to mean that the Taxation Office itself is not too wrapt about the Taxation Advisory Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that one could raise in respect of the Treasury is a particular allocation of $1.5m. This matter was pursued at some length by Estimates Committee C. I am sure that my colleague Senator Gietzelt will expand on some of my remarks. A $1.5m allocation has been put aside for what is called, I think, publicising Government decisions. The actual border line between publicising Government decisions and Government propaganda is a fairly shaky one. It is very difficult to anticipate in advance whether the $1.5m was to be used in genuine propagation of Government policy or whether it was to be used for electoral purposes. The first question I asked and pursued during the examination of this matter by Estimates Committee C was how the $1.5m was arrived at. No explanation was given. We spent some time asking for an explanation but we still have not got one. However, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle did say on 13 September when I asked that question:</PARA>
<PARA> Because the figure is $1,500,000; that is why, the figure of $1,500,000 was decided upon. </PARA>
<PARA>When we asked what criterion was used by which it could be decided upon we were informed that, as we have never had this sort of allocation before, there were no guidelines. I still do not know from where the $1.5m came. We still do not know the reaction of Treasury officials. In particular we do not know what remarks were made to the Treasurer by Mr Stone when he suddenly had this $1.5m lobbed on him. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have any objection to governments advertising Budget decisions. I do not have any real objection to their advertising new health schemes. But I do object to campaigns such as the $300,000 one launched just before the Victorian election that are blatantly political. That campaign was so political that when the State Secretary of the Labor Party in Victoria took the matter to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal the advertisements were banned in the blackout period because they were obviously political. We have to ask whether any of this money will be used during an election period and whether, from the moment writs are issued, any of this $1.5m will be spent on Government advertising. Of course , it is quite clear to me that the Government intends to advertise some of its programs that it believes are more appealing. We will not see the Government dipping into this $1.5m to advertise its less popular Budget measures. I believe that we have not been given sufficient explanation as to why this item has been set aside. One explanation which I think has some credence is that the Government's attitude has been actually to dip into funds in an ad hoc manner and spend them on Government propaganda-sorry, Government information-and this is just a way of formalising that procedure. However, we have to go to another section of the Estimates to understand the relevancy of the $1.5m, and that was the $10,000 spent on the post-Budget survey. I do not think that we would ever have seen the post-Budget survey, the questions or the answers, if we had not raised it in the Estimates Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In reference to that question, we asked in the Estimates Committee whether a copy of this particular Budget survey was sent to Mr Eggleton at any stage, and, as far as I know, we have yet to get an answer. I should like to be as sure of winning Tatts as I am that he was one of the first persons to get this survey. But the rationale behind this survey is that it was carried out because governments, having to commit so much money in government propaganda, really know where to slot it in. I would accept that as a fairly rational argument-that one holds a survey and finds out where the target areas are, and that is where one puts the thing. But I have read this survey. In my view, it is a taxpayers-paid, Liberal Party survey to gauge public reactions on what the impact of the Budget was, and nothing more. Reading through the various questions asked on how acceptable the Budget was, I would regard it as a valuable tool in planning an early election campaign. If we are to understand the $1 1/2m allocation in Treasury and that $10,000 being spent on the post- Budget survey, it was all in the context of an early election. It was allocated for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some people might say that that is the government's right, that the Government has the right, if it wishes, to commission a survey and to put $1 1/2m of taxpayers' money away to spend on election campaigns. But where that does not read true is in this Government's fanatical opposition to public funding. Every time we have had a debate in this chamber on whether political campaigns should be funded, what happens? We are told from the Government side of the chamber that that is dipping into taxpayers' money and is virtually robbery from the taxpayer by political parties. But what we have in this country is a very one- sided dipping in-by governments. I have been made more aware of this issue by what is starting to emerge in the Victorian Government since Labor acceded to the Treasury benches there last April. We are just starting to find out the amount of public relations campaign funded by the Liberal Party, all aimed in the lead-up to an election time. We are just starting to dip into the Department of Economic Development to find out where the funds were and where they have been milked out to projects that do not meet any of the criteria of that Department. Whether or not the Department of Economic Development is a Liberal- dominated department, it is the Department that dished out the money. These two particular instances could fulfil the same sort of aim. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the post-Budget survey, as I have said, I do not think that we would ever have seen a copy if we had not pressed for it. The survey was done by Burke Marketing Research. It was a telephone survey, and it was done, I think, on 19 and 20 August. It was first mentioned, though, by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) on 3 February 1982 in a ministerial statement that it was thought that this would be a good idea. As I understand it , the survey went out to tender and the lowest tenderer won the job. One of the questions we asked was: Why was it not a written survey? Why was it a telephone survey? I think the answer was given that unless it was a telephone survey, people's views of the Budget would be distorted a couple of days after the Budget. Looking at the actual results of the survey, one finds that it really sought to get the general awareness and attitudes towards the Budget. Its findings were quite interesting. Its only specific conclusions, however, for the $10,000, was that the Budget was liked for family and personal provisions and disliked for lack of economic contribution. There were certain State variations. Tasmania and South Australia generally supported the Budget; Queensland was 50- 50; New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia had a generally negative reaction. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as these telephone surveys, however, we are having community issues surveys. I am far less clear about the cost of these surveys and what sorts of areas they are going into. If the Government is to be genuine and say that these surveys are done to help the Government, it will not mind publishing them the moment they become available. It will not mind sending copies of the surveys, not necessarily to every member of Parliament but at least to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) , so that we can see that government funds are not being misused. </PARA>

<PARA> In summary on this matter-I know that Senator Gietzelt will probably expand on some of the points that I have made-I should like answers to the following questions: Will any of the $1 1/2m be spent during an election period, from the moment when the writs are issued? Secondly, will all other surveys undertaken by government departments and paid for out of the public purse be made available to all members of Parliament on request? I do not say that it should be a mandatory issue of all these surveys to members of Parliament, but they should receive copies when they request them. Thirdly, will the community issues surveys as well be made available? If those questions were answered and assurances were given, some of the problems relating to the matters I have raised could be solved. I just hope that we do not get into a Victorian situation, as we did earlier this year, where it is estimated that $2.1m, I think, was spent by government departments promoting themselves and in turn trying to promote the Liberal Party Government back into power in Victoria. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was referring to the Estimates Committee consideration of the Government's departmental information activities. As I had indicated, considerable concern was being expressed in the Estimates Committee about the increased amount of funds that was being required and the way in which these funds were being allocated in a fashion that made it impossible for the Parliament to appreciate how much increase in publicity was being made available in the Budget for 1982-83. I do not think that it can ever be argued by any Government senator that the Whitlam Government, in the 1972- 1975 period-even though some honourable senators may disagree with the emphasis given in that period-was not a great reforming government, and that it had a large legislative program and set about changes and introducing much innovative legislation which was designed to redress a number of deficiencies in the community. One has only to refer to a few of them, such as the air improvement program; the Australian Assistance Plan; the supporting mothers legislation which gave social security benefits; the introduction of the Regional Employment Development Scheme; and a host of other legislative changes which were completely new in the way in which the Commonwealth Government was becoming involved for the first time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yet when that Government set about publicising these innovations and these new programs, the Opposition of that day, the present Government and particularly those who now constitute the Government front bench in this place, raised merry hell about the amount of taxpayers' money being expended in the explanation and amplification of these legislative changes. You, Mr Chairman, were in charge of the program at the time. It finally worked out to represent something less than $4m. Yet a hue and cry was raised throughout the land, led principally by the front bench that is now part of the Government in this place, that we were spending taxpayers' money willy-nilly in a haphazard and injudicious sort of way . We defended that because we believed that the taxpayers should know what new benefits were becoming available for citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government can only be described as a standstill government and a government that is not being particularly innovative. That is pretty obvious. But we have nevertheless seen advanced by this Government over recent years the establishment of two new organisations-the Government Information Unit, and another rather strange organisation called the Information Co-ordination Branch, most of whose officers happen to be quite peculiarly members of the Liberal Party or, if not, very closely ideologically and philosophically supporters of the Liberal Government's attitude. What have we seen in the documents finally extracted from the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle)? We have seen an increase in the sums available. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA> At this stage of analysis of the returns, expenditure, excluding salaries and support costs on the kind of departmental information activities outlined . . . is estimated at about $40 million in 1982-83. Of this some $25 million will be spent on 'operational' information . . . with about $15 million spent on ' publicity' activities. </PARA>
<PARA>When we turn to the next page of the document we find an incredible contradiction because the major method of information delivery by the departments in terms of cost is paid advertising. It is estimated that in 1982- 83 about $20m will be spent on advertising. On one page of the document an amount of about $15m is mentioned and on another page an amount of about $20m. As my colleagues-for example, Senator Robert Ray-have already indicated, we were not able to obtain that sort of precise schedule stating how even the $1.5m was allocated, against Treasury wishes, in a party political way. Of course, reference has already been made to the fact that in the immediate post-Budget period the survey which the Government carried out was a clear use of taxpayers money to find out how the citizens were reacting to the Budget. As the survey showed, 27 per cent of the people thought that the Budget took away more than it gave. Of course, that is exactly the case. </PARA>
<PARA> More money was collected in tax than was given out in benefits. That is the situation. That sort of analysis was referred to by Ross Gittins who carried out a Sydney Morning Herald survey. That survey found:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . only 20 per cent of voters believed that the Budget left them better off, while 31 per cent believed themselves to be worse off. </PARA>
<PARA> Only 18 per cent of voters believed the Budget left the nation better off, while 41 per cent believed the nation to be worse off. </PARA>
<PARA> The results of the Government's own opinion poll were little better. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly that survey was designed to give the Government some sort of indication of whether there should be an early election. Tuesday, 9 November was supposed to be the last day on which notice of an election could be given but there is still no clear writing off of an early election. We have had no information about this. We have had an election in South Australia. We have a by-election of 4 December. The Government is still proposing to proceed with spending that $1. 5m which Treasury officials have some sensitivity about-and quite rightly so. As my colleague said, at what point does government advertising of achievements and benefits become propaganda? I suggest that we ought to have a decision in this Senate to the effect that that $1.5m ought not to be spent until the Flinders by -election is over. Why should money of that magnitude be spent for the purpose of bringing about a desired result in respect of the Government's electoral difficulties? That is clearly its purpose in respect of the Flinders by-election . The Government and the Opposition parties have carried out surveys which show that the result in that seat will be a line ball one. </PARA>
<PARA> Why should the scales be tilted by spending $1.5m to promote what this Government believes are goodies? However, the surveys show that the Government goodies are not accepted by the Australian people. Clearly, if the Government can spend another $1.5m in the next few weeks it can achieve a result that it believes will be in its own interests. </PARA>
<PARA> I think if we are to have advertising campaigns-the Opposition does not quibble with that; it thinks that is fair enough-the Government ought to be open and frank and say that the campaign is not related to an election. If the Opposition feels that there is a component of electioneering in this matter we will postpone it to another date so that clearly the taxpayers money can be used for the purpose of providing and disseminating information on government activities in a way that will not be of political benefit to the Government. Surely that is not an unreasonable thing to put to the Senate. It is not an unreasonable approach to put to the government of the day. I believe that if the Government was fair dinkum and prepared to concede that, there would be very little criticism from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen in the life of the Government over the last three or four Budgets a tremendous growth in the area of consultants. Hundreds of consultants are now employed by the Government. The Prime Minister has on his staff what he considers to be top advisers. He handpicked a number of people and put them on contract for large sums of money for the purpose of advising him what to do. Obviously they could not have advised him about the election because we still do not know whether there is to be one, even though the zero date of 9 November has well passed. </PARA>
<PARA> What really concerns the Opposition and certainly concerns me as the shadow Minister for Administrative Services is the way in which information gathering and advertising costs are padded in the Budget matters before the Senate. The Minister admits that in the documents she has made available. She said that there are considerable difficulties in obtaining precise figures on departmental information programs. Quite honestly, I do not think that is satisfactory. There is considerable difficulty here. If we are voting large sums of money-the Minister has accepted the figure of $40m and it might well be that half of that amount is quite legitimate in terms of advertising for defence forces, publishing of gazettes and all the other matters that come within the purview of normal government administrative functions-and that being the case then nobody has any argument with her at all. </PARA>
<PARA> We find it unsatisfactory-we can only say that it is done at the direction of the Government-that money is disbursed throughout every department so that we cannot really find out what is scheduled to be done with the money. For example, I refer to the way in which that Government Budget survey we referred to was carried out. If the money is purely for the purpose of releasing government information such as the publication of manuals, Acts and all of those matters, that is one thing. However, to think that there is somewhere between $15m and $ 20m spread throughout various departments of the Commonwealth, on which little information is available to the Senate on its spending, is, I believe, a very unsatisfactory position. It is one on which we would certainly challenge the right of the Government to expect the Senate to pass without some critical comment. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not quarrel with the Government's right in relation to spending the $1. 5m which Mr Stone has objected to and which the Government has spent in spite of the officers' opposition. I think the officers are entitled to express their point of view. The Government is the responsible body. The Government makes the decision. The Government should tell us how it is to be spent. It should state whether it spent $300,000 on television advertising, $250,000 on publications, $ 100,000 on newspaper advertisements, so much on radio talks and so on. If that is the way the money is spent then let us be told. It seems to me we would certainly then have some valid grounds for objection if we could show-or even if we had a suspicion-that the money was to be used in respect of publicising Budget matters in a way which would suggest that it was a Budget of goodies. It is not a Budget of goodies. It is a Budget that takes more than it gives. That has been confirmed by the Sydney Morning Herald survey, by the Government's own survey and certainly the survey that my party carried out in respect of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably we are now not going to be in a position where we will be fighting another premature election. Let us face it; this Government during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s was always associated with premature elections. One is entitled to say that if the Government does not intend to hold a premature election then perhaps it will not want to spend $1.5m. Maybe that money can be saved and spent in a more useful way, such as in the area of child care or in other areas of public expendture which the Australian people are demanding that the Commonwealth Government support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; As nobody else appears to want to speak on this particular matter it falls to me to draw this debate to its conclusion. When I last spoke on this matter I was considering the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Industrial Relations Legislation concerning the Government's proposals for industry-based unions. I now turn to the recommendations that were made by the Committee in respect of the Government's abolition of preference proposals. The Committee considers-it pointed this out in its report-that although issues of preference and voluntary unionism enjoy a high political profile the Committee received no substantive evidence from any employee claiming to have been directly aggrieved by the operations of the preference clauses, despite the issue of widespread public invitations for persons to make submissions to the Committee. Submissions were received relating to conscientious objection rights of sub-contractors and these were referred to the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. Since the interim report which raised serious doubts about the proposed section 4B the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) has written to the Committee but these doubts have not been resolved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee notes that the Government intends that its proposed legislation will weaken the power of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to deal with union membership disputes. The Committee shares the view generally expressed by witnesses that the proposed legislation would not be conducive to industrial peace and would further unsettle the industrial relations climate. The Committee notes-I quote from the second reading speech-that the Government also intends its legislation to 'provide a better balance in the powers, rights and duties of employers and employees'. Clearly, this legislation would fundamentally disturb this balance in favour of employers. The Committee considers that the proposed legislation is an undesirable and unwarranted intervention into the field of industrial relations, particularly at a time when high levels of unemployment have already disturbed this balance. The Committee believes that viable unions are essential for the operation of Australia's system of conciliation and arbitration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers that the proposals of the Government for a new section 144A of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act would undermine this viability to an unacceptable extent and it recommends that it should not be incorporated into the Act. For similar reasons, the Committee recommends that the provisions of section 47 should be retained in the Act. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the amendments proposed by clauses 3, 4 (2), 5, 7, 9 and 20 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill 1982 should not be incorporated in the Act. In the second reading speech on the Commonwealth Employees (Voluntary Membership of Unions) Bill 1982 the then Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Viner, said that the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA> is . . . designed to put into effect in the area of Commonwealth Government employment the principles proposed in the Conciliation and Arbitration ( Amendment) Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>For reasons outlined in the Committee's proposal, the Committee recommends that the Senate not pass the Commonwealth Employees (Voluntary Membership of Unions) Bill 1982. The Committee notes further-I will quote again what the Minister said -that the Government intends that this legislation should ensure 'the protection of the rights of the individual'. Some individuals are quick to recognise their perceived rights but are not as quick to recognise their duty to associate with others for the common good. That is the view of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Committee states that there is a distinction between personal choice based on conscientious belief on the one hand and the dictates of self- centred individualism on the other hand. Quite clearly, what the Government was proposing to do was to put conscientious objectors on the same level as those whose objection to union membership is based on self-centred individualism. The Committee rejects that attitude. The Committee acknowledges the need to retain the status of conscientious objector which is presently provided for in section 144 of the Act. However, it recommends that those who object to union membership , for example on political grounds, should be entitled to exemption provided they pay a fee for service, as proposed by the Committee's extended recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee stated that the submissions and evidence it received were extensive and raised complex issues. It recommended that there be consultation between the Government and the National Labour Consultative Council before further legislative initiatives are contemplated. I suddenly seem to have lost 20 minutes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. I turn to the recommendations relating to stand- downs and I will be brief. The Committee was unable to form an opinion from the evidence whether the rights of employers to stand down employees as a result of industrial action without reference to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is consistent with modern industrial practice. However, it is the Committee's opinion, that the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill 1982, as drafted, would erode the authority of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and deny natural justice to aggrieved and unfairly treated employees. The Committee considers that the provisions of the Bill would not contribute to industrial peace but would create industrial instability. The Committee therefore recommends that the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill 1982 which provide for automatic stand-downs, be not passed by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major concern of employers with respect to the current stand-down provisions are perceived delays which occur in proceedings taken pursuant to section 33 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The Committee accordingly has made suggestions as to how the current Act might be amended to overcome these concerns. The Committee suggests that a course of action that would take account of the concerns underlying the provisions of the Bill would be for existing section 33A to be tightened so as to require the initial hearing of applications for the insertion of stand-down clauses to take place within two working days after lodgment. Determinations would follow as soon as possible thereafter, depending on the surrounding circumstances. A right of appeal to the Full Bench would remain in section 33A. It would be exercisable within 21 days, and appeals would have to be heard within three working days of lodgment. Appeals would not be subject to restrictions imposed by section 35 of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers that it would be desirable for these issues and proposals to be the subject of consultation between the Government and the NLCC, and has recommended accordingly. The Committee considered other provisions of the Bill relating to common rule and casual vacancies. They are listed in the report, and I do not intend to refer to them in detail. By and large, the Committee, with some reservations, recommends their adoption. Those recommendations are contained in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee endorses the view that, where a State union is deregistered in its own jurisdiction for actions inimical to the interests of the State jurisdiction and the parties thereto, such union should not be able to move into the Federal jurisdiction to avoid the consequences of its actions. The Committee considered that that view was shared by all responsible participants in both the Federal and State industrial relations spheres. (Extension of time granted). The Committee considered that this view is shared by all the responsible participants in the Federal and State industrial relations systems, but submissions to the Committee cast doubt on the efficacy of the proposals under consideration. It recommended that they would benefit from further detailed study by the industrial relations community and, in particular, by the NLCC. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not able to canvass at length all of the report, which comprises some 130 pages, but it is clear that the weight of evidence collected by the Committee was overwhelmingly opposed to the major provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill 1982 and the Commonwealth Employees (Voluntary Membership of Unions) Bill. In speaking of the evidence it is essential to note that the Committee's work was greatly assisted by the thoughtful and well- documented submissions which it received from the industrial relations community . I had it in mind to send to the script writers of the Yes Minister program the evidence given by various government departments, and the letters received from various Ministers. I must say that some of the material upon which the former Minister based his second reading speech was simply not correct. As one example, I advert to the fact that he stated quite categorically that the industry-based union proposal represented a policy decision of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. In the regard Mr Viner, no doubt unwittingly, misled the House. The policy of the ACTU on this subject is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The matter of the structure of unionism in Australia is one for the unions and the ACTU to determine. Employer organisations enjoy the same rights. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. ACTU policy is not in favour of industrial unionism as being promoted by the present Government, employers and media. The policy of the ACTU is for fewer small unions by the developing of larger unions. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Branches and unions are requested to join with the ACTU to correct the false impression of ACTU policy being created on this subject. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an example of how the Minister had not revealed to this chamber the facts concerning these important measures. The new Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) has announced a review of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, but despite this apparently the Minister has still not withdrawn the legislation. In a statement to the American Chamber of Commerce on 24 September 1982, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I have asked my Department to undertake a wide-ranging review of our existing industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA>He added:</PARA>
<PARA> I have had discussions with the NLCC on the way this study will be carried out.</PARA>
<PARA>I should like to draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that this statement was made while our Committee was still considering the Bills which, if enacted, would have had profound effects on the Australian industrial relations system. The Minister said that the review would be undertaken in respect of 'our existing industrial relations system'. Therefore, such a review would not take into account the changes sought to be introduced by the Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> Why the Government has not withdrawn those Bills is beyond me. It has the opportunity to include in three of the Bills that are to come before the Senate within the next two weeks what has been recommended. Reference to the other matters should be completely withdrawn. The Parliament is entitled to ask whether legislation presented to it creates in the public mind expectations which might be largely unrealised. Such legislation could run the risk of making matters worse by fostering disillusionment directed not only at legislators but at the system of conciliation and arbitration itself. Perhaps, as one witness has said-</PARA>

Honourable senators will recall that on that occasion I warned of serious problems which would flow for small businesses, for employees in the industry and for the community at large, if such a deregulation were to take place. I pointed to the fact that a number of the sites are controlled by property owners who in fact have the ability to exert considerable influence on the lessees of small shops in those centres when it comes to the question of trading hours. The raison d'etre for the Commonwealth Functions (Statutes Review ) Act in respect of section 90 did not apply. That is to say true market forces, of course, do not apply in that particular circumstance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The majority recommendation of the Committee was to the effect that the present Trading Hours Ordinance be repealed and replaced by an alternative ordinance and that a new trading hours ordinance be drafted to include the following provision :</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the sale of goods in the ACT be permitted at any time except that a major retailer may not open for business between 1.00 p.m. Saturday and midnight Sunday. A major retailer is defined as a retailer employing more than 100 people in the ACT or elsewhere in Australia in any number of shops. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a recommendation by other members that the time be noon on Saturday. There is also a minority recommendation that the present Trading Hours Ordinance be gradually reinforced and that sufficient resources be made available for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot see anywhere in the report where the Committee has justified defining a major retailer as one employing more than 100 people. Where is that contained in the report? Where is the basis for that number of 100? The only similar situation that exists in the whole of Australia in respect of the employment of 100 people is in Tasmania. That is the place which the Committee did not visit. It went to the Northern Territory but it did not go to Tasmania. Yet it has picked up this figure and defines a major retailer as one which employs more than 100 people in any number of shops in the Australian Capital Territory or elsewhere in Australia. The law in Tasmania is precisely as is suggested in this recommendation, except that the closing time is midday on Saturday, but the definition of a major store is one that employs 100 people. </PARA>
<PARA> One would have expected, if the Committee were at all conversant with the retail industry, that it would not have defined a major store by reference to the number of people that it employs. A very major store can have only a few employees. Surely the Committee should have considered an appropriate definition to be by reference to the criteria of floor space. That would be the correct way to have done it, particularly with technological innovations that, unfortunately , are occurring in the retail trade. I say, unfortunately, because these stores do not have to compete overseas. They are a local industry. We ought to look at the employment of technology within the retail industry to see whether it is justified under the current circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Recognising the fact that we can now have a very large store with only, say, 20 or 30 employees, the Committee surely, one would have thought, would have attempted to look at that situation and define a large retailer by reference to floor space. But it did not do that. Did it pluck the figure of 100 out of the air or did it take it from the Tasmanian legislation? I will tell the Senate how the figure of 100 employees comprising a large store came about in Tasmania. At the time there was no legislation in Tasmania governing shop trading hours. That lack of legislation was hurting the small businessmen. It was also having a disruptive influence on the lives of those in the retail trade. It was also giving undue emphasis to the very large retailers. The reason that the Committee picked the figure of 100 people-I was not one who supported the definition-was that one supermarket in Launceston happened to employ about 89 employees. Because it would have been a politically inopportune decision for the government of the day to pick any figure below 89, it picked 100. </PARA>
<PARA> Is that the sort of standard that we ought to be dished up by a committee of the Senate? Why should we be given this sort of drivel? We are given the definition that a large store is one that employs 100 people without any explanation that I can see in this report. One can only conclude that it is because of a political decision in Tasmania at a particular time. Surely the national capital will not be led by the nose in this respect. Surely it deserves a better consideration than that which has been provided in this report, particularly by reference to the definition of what is a large retailer. I again suggest that this matter should be referred to the House of Assembly in the Australian Capital Territory so that it can perhaps establish some sort of inquiry as to what should, in the circumstances with which the national capital is faced, be a large retailer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am opposed to the amendment moved by Senator Colston. The motion I originally moved was that the Senate take note of the paper. I did so because I believe that the report ought to be made available for the Senate, the Parliament and the community to have an adequate opportunity to look at it. I move the following amendment to Senator Colston's proposed amendment:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave out all words after 'Senate', insert:</PARA>
<PARA> 'is of the opinion that it would be premature for the Senate to determine an attitude to the Report of the Committee before the Canberra community has had the opportunity to consider the report in detail and before the Government has had an opportunity to respond to the Report'. </PARA>
<PARA>The view that I put to the Senate is that that is a more appropriate way of dealing with a report which has been tabled by the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory. At this stage the Senate ought not present its view on the findings in the light of the Government's report. In a sense it is setting a lead that is in appropriate taking into account all the evidence. It is a pity that Senator Harradine did not present his views to the Committee. He did not choose to do so although we took evidence over a considerable period. I will deal with the other matters raised by Senator Harradine today at the conclusion of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter will be put to a vote in the Senate. Clearly, there is debate in the community about it. A lot of evidence has been given to the Committee on all aspects of the inquiry. Various points of view have been put forward. Three reports are before the chamber at the present time. One was presented by Senator Colston, Mr Fry and Mrs Kelly and another, independently, by Senator Georges. It is the view of the Liberal Party and the Government that trading hours should be deregulated. The majority of Committee members felt that deregulation was not appropriate at this time and presented another report. Obviously the Australian Democrats want full local deregulation. As I have said, I think it is appropriate that the community and the Parliament have an opportunity to look at this report in some detail before firm decisions are taken about trading hours. Certainly I think the Government should have an opportunity to respond to the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats oppose the full deregulation of shopping hours. I say that with great respect to what has been said by one of my colleagues in the House of Assembly. For reasons which I propose to give we believe that a national campaign is being waged by major retailers for total deregulation of shopping hours. Canberra is being used as the toe in the door-the thin end of the wedge. If this proposition is successful in Canberra it will be copied nationally to the detriment of small business people, particularly those who are being exploited mercilessly by people renting out supermarkets. As Senator Reid ought to know, it would be to the detriment of the local suburban or village shopkeeper. If deregulation were brought in the livelihoods of those shopkeepers would almost certainly be finished.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Functions (Statutes Review) Act 1981 was rushed through the Senate to beat a change in the composition of the House. Honourable senators will remember that that was before the five Australian Democrats took their position in this chamber and before the Government lost control of the Senate. This legislation was rushed through on party lines. During the debate on that Bill it was agreed that clause 90, seeking to repeal the present trading hours ordinance for the Australian Capital Territory, would not be proclaimed until the Committee had conducted an inquiry into the question of the implementation and possible effects of deregulation of trading hours. The Government must be disappointed with the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory as they do not support the complete deregulation of shopping hours. Clearly, this is what the Government was hoping for-a position which is consistent with its inclination to cater to the needs and desires of big business. The Australian Democrats are disappointed with the majority report because the Committee has chosen to recommend, on the basis of what it admits is inconclusive evidence, that Saturday afternoon trading-the first step towards total deregulation-be allowed. </PARA>
<PARA> The report has identified all the major problems involved in the deregulation and extension of trading hours. Nevertheless, it has chosen to disregard the weight of evidence against adopting such measures to make proposals which will severely affect the competitiveness and viability of small business in the Australian Capital Territory. This will lead to the further acceleration of the trend towards casualisation of employees in retail industries and consequent loss in job security. It will lead to a significant increase in prices of goods to the consumers and force the small retailers in large shopping complexes to remain open whenever management so decides. I have heard some humbug from big business representations that have been made to us that this would not happen. Can any honourable senator really imagine a small trader in the Woden or Belconnen shopping complexes closing down while the bigger emporia remain open even if the masters of the shopping centres or complexes tell them to do so? They would find themselves out of business very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, in making these recommendations, the Committee is clearly creating a precedent which big business can draw upon to press its case for extended trading hours in other States. The Committee admits in its report that small traders were unanimous in their complete opposition to weekend trading because of fears regarding the implications of increased competition from big business and the nature of the restrictive leases operating in large shopping complexes. The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to support or reject this proposition. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet amazingly the Committee concludes on page 25 of its report:</PARA>
<PARA> It is the Committee's view that change in current hours of operation would not have a significant detrimental impact on small business. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, after hearing evidence, the Committee admits that the unanimous view of small business is that deregulation of shopping hours should not proceed and then it recommends against that unanimous view. I sometimes smile when I see those filthy publications that come out of Liberal Party headquarters denigrating the policies of other parties. At the same time some creature over there states that the Liberal Party is for small business. Yet it allows this sort of thing to happen. Every Liberal member on the Committee recommended deregulation of shopping hours in the Australian Capital Territory. The Committee has failed to address itself to the problem of small traders in large shopping complexes being forced to trade during hours determined by the management of the centre. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of the effect of Saturday trading on prices to consumers, the small traders asserted that the deregulation or extension of trading hours would inevitably result in higher prices because of the extra costs involved with longer trading hours. Even David Jones estimated that Saturday trading would cause a 1.5 per cent rise in the price of goods while Waltons estimated it would result in an increase of 13.3 per cent to the wages bill. Here we have a big trading conceding an increase in wages of 13.3 per cent. From what side of the House do we get the argument that the only cause of inflation is an increase in wages? It is from the Government side, and yet we have all Government members voting for a move that will result in an increase, according to Waltons, of 13.3 per cent to its wages bill. Nevertheless, the Committee, in its final summary, states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is not known how any increased costs which may be associated with a change in present operating hours could be offset. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee, in its discussion of the impact of extended hours on employees, accepted the validity of the unions' arguments. The Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA> There is, however, strong support for the claim that in light of the experience of late night trading, deregulation with its concomitant increase in trading hours will contribute to a further decline in the number of full-time permanent positions . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The concern of the unions about the likelihood of an attack upon penalty rates for Saturday afternoon work is also justified since the major retailers have indicated their intention to include and consider Saturday as an ordinary working day. </PARA>
<PARA>That is on pages 32 and 33 of the report. Despite this acceptance of the evidence submitted by the unions and the fact that the retail industry in the Australian Capital Territory provides employment for twice as many people as does any other private industry, the Committee is prepared to make recommendations which will threaten the job security of thousands of people. In 1980 11,000 people were employed in the retail industry in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority report, with a callous disregard, also dismisses the argument that weekend trading will cause disruption to the family life of employees and reduce opportunities for sporting and religious pastimes at weekends. What it would do to the family life of family businesses where a business depends essentially on the total presence of a man and wife is not mentioned. The report of the majority of the Committee is totally inadequate. Clearly it set out to justify a policy of the Government which was decided long before the Committee was requested to investigate the issue. As it turned out, the Committee found it could not justify the complete deregulation of trading hours yet its proposals signal the first step towards such a policy. Therefore, the Australian Democrats accept the minority report of Mrs Kelly, Mr Fry and Senator Colston as a more balanced assessment of the evidence presented and the needs of the community. If I understand their minority report they recommend that there be no deregulation of trading hours and that the status quo be preserved from 1 p.m. on Saturday; that is, that there be no deregulation from 1 p.m. Saturday until the ordinary hours of opening on Monday morning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to Senator Reid's amendment. The Australian Labor Party does not accept Senator Reid's amendment for reasons that I will outline. Her amendment is to state that the Senate:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Is of the opinion that it would be premature for the Senate to determine an attitude to the report of the Committee before the Canberra community has had an opportunity to consider the report in detail . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I cannot see any reason why the Senate should not express an opinion even if the Canberra community is going to consider the report in detail. The Canberra community has already expressed an opinion to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory in great detail. In the dissenting report which I signed together with Mrs Kelly and Mr Fry, we pointed out in paragraph 2 the number of people who had approached the Committee. I would like to reiterate what we said in paragraph 2:</PARA>
<PARA> An indication of general opposition to deregulation of trading hours is contained in Appendix III of the Committee's report. Approximately 4,000 shoppers, 200 small traders, the Australian Association of Independent Businesses and the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Union wrote to the Committee to register their total opposition to deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA>When the Committee was sitting, the Canberra community had the opportunity to put forward its opinions. We believe that our dissenting report follows the recommendations which were made by the Canberra community. Even if the Canberra community wishes to make some comment-I am not quite sure how it will make that comment as a total group-there would be no reason for the Senate to withhold its expressing an attitude to the report. Senator Reid's amendment went on to say that the Senate should not determine an attitude 'before the Government has had an opportunity to respond to the report'. </PARA>
<PARA> When Senator Chipp was speaking a moment ago, and certainly when I spoke to this report about two or three weeks ago, it was pointed out that the Government did not give this Senate the opportunity to express an opinion on whether the Trading Hours Ordinance 1962 should be repealed. What it did was to give to the Senate as it was composed some time ago the opportunity to do this. It used a Senate which was not composed as it is now. The new Senate had been elected but the new senators had not taken their place at the relevant date of 1 July when the opportunity was given to the Senate to express an opinion about whether the Trading Hours Ordinance 1962 should be repealed. I presume-I understand that the Government would have presumed-that if the opportunity were given to this Senate to vote on a motion that the Trading Hours Ordinance 1962 be repealed it would not pass this Senate. So I hold that this Senate should be allowed to express an opinion, an attitude, and that it need not wait until the Government has had an opportunity to respond to the report. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other matter that I would like to mention. Senator Harradine made a comment about our definition of a major retailer. A major retailer was defined in both the majority report and the minority report as a retailer employing more than 100 people in the Australian Capital Territory or elsewhere in Australia in any number of shops. Because we put in the words 'or elsewhere in Australia in any number of shops' it includes all major retailers in the Australian Capital Territory-Waltons Stores Ltd, David Jones (Canberra) Pty Ltd, Coles New World Supermarkets, Myer Emporium Ltd and J. B. Young Limited-as all have 100 employees or more in the ACT or elsewhere in Australia in any number of shops. I spoke to Senator Harradine about this outside the Senate chamber and he expressed the opinion that perhaps shops would be set up which were major retailers but would have branches only in Canberra and therefore would circumvent the spirit of what the Committee recommended. I imagine that if the spirit were circumvented the relevant ordinance would be changed accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine also mentioned that perhaps we should have considered floor space rather than the number of employees. Unfortunately this was not evidence that was presented before the Committee so it was not something that we were able to take into account. I reiterate that the Australian Labor Party will oppose the amendment moved by Senator Reid. </PARA>

<PARA> My recommendations are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) deregulation of trading hours in the A.C.T. be rejected in the interests of retailers, employees and consumers;</PARA>

<PARA>I must explain that I find the recommendations of the majority report and the dissenting report to be unreal. I believe that the recommendations and the dissenting report as it stands would be very much to the disadvantage of the people of the Australian Capital Territory. As a result of my dissenting report a rather harsh editorial in the Canberra Times suggested that I was very hard, that, in fact, I was unreal and that I did not have the interests of the citizens of Canberra at heart. It indicated also that I did not properly understand the situation that applied that is, that Canberra citizens were not obliged to shop at 11 o'clock, if they did not want to. I know that. The editorial went on to say that retailers were not obliged to open their shops. That is where it is wrong. In that conclusion the editorial is absolutely wrong. The writer does not know the nature of a market- place when it comes to retailing. One person opening a shop in a particular area for an extended period forces his competitor to open.

<PARA> What has happened in my experience is that extended shopping hours permit certain retailers to take advantage of those extended shopping hours. Even if a majority of other retailers disagree they are forced for a variety of reasons to follow the change. We have a situation where the whole social environment can be destroyed by a need of retailers to match their competitors. If there is one greedy and avaricious retailer operating in a particular area, he influences the decisions of every other retailer in that area. We can have the classic example in Canberra where at night one can see in a certain area a service station in all the glory of its illumination with not one customer present but with some poor juvenile sitting behind a console waiting for a customer. In the next area, exactly the same situation exists. An operator cannot close if another is to remain open. It would be to his disadvantage. </PARA>

What fascinates me about Canberra and about Senator MacGibbons's attitude is that in Canberra 65 per cent of the employees work possibly a 37 1/2-hour week. They have the best of conditions and a limitation on working hours; yet they expect the service industries to stay open for extended hours for their benefit. They do not seem to realise that that sort of attitude leads to higher costs and higher charges which are to their disadvantages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This proposed extension of trading hours, if adopted will lead to a further problem. It will lead to the breaking down of the conditions of employees. I refer to the conditions of work, the type of work and the awards under which employees operate. The planned industrial awards and the regulations which apply in this area which we are discussing exist for the benefit of all. They lay down the conditions under which everyone operates. They do not lead to unfair competition. I remember in this House when lawyers who did not understand what the market-place was all about, what conditions of work were and what conditions were needed in the market-place, moved for the abolition of resale price maintenance. This was a lawyer's approach to the problem. All that flowed from that was, I might say, widespread discounting and a breakdown in the level of servicing. I interrupt my argument to note that I had forgotten that the time for this debate is limited by the proposed order of the consideration of business.

However, I seek to take out of it the final definition of the Governor-General's powers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By agreement, albeit the kind of agreement one enters into when one has someone standing over one with a foot on one's neck, the time for debate for the conclusion, we hope, of this Committee stage of the Bill is limited to 10 minutes. So, again, like Senator Martin, to whom I am indebted for her speech, I will be very brief in indicating my position on the amendment she has moved. Basically, I accept the inevitability of the success of Senator Martin's amendment. For that reason I will not kick and scream to the extent that I might otherwise have been minded to do. It might be thought that the particular phrase that she seeks to take out of the Bill does go further than is strictly necessary to ensure the kind of qualified fixed parliament model that this Bill is now all about. Certainly, the presence of that clause would, if it were to remain, quite properly generate debate as to the extent, scope and necessity for the reserve powers of the Governor-General. It remains the position of my party that the powers of the Governor-General be codified and limited. This Bill codifies and limits them, so far as dismissals are concerned, to a very considerable extent and, arguably, I appreciate, to a greater extent than is the accepted convention at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps the better place to have a debate about the proper scope and extent of the Governor-General's reserve powers of dismissal if any such are to remain would be at the proposed next session of the Australian Constitutional Convention. In that respect, might I take another minute to read into the record the proposed declaration of convention that will be coming to that Convention from one of its standing committees relating to the Governor-General's dismissal power. The proposal that will, it is hoped, be debated by the next session of the Convention as perhaps an appropriate statement of what conventions governing this should be is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Governor-General dismisses a Prime Minister (and thereby dismisses the other Ministers constituting his Government) only if-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The Government fails to obtain or ceases to have the confidence of the House of Representatives and the Prime Minister does not resign or obtain a dissolution;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) It is established that the Government cannot and will not obtain Supply for the ordinary annual services of the Government in time to enable it to lawfully carry on the business of government and the Prime Minister does not resign or obtain a dissolution;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The Government is involved in a gross and patent breach of the basic principles of the Constitutional system and the matter is not justifiable, or cannot be resolved by the courts. </PARA>
<PARA>I simply put that on record-it is probably improper of me to have done so, I am not sure-as a basis for debate in the months between now and what may be a session of the Constituional Convention rather than having that kind of debate here and now. If it does turn out that there is an agreement along the lines embodied in that proposal or in some more drastically curtailed version of it then, of course, there may still be time to embody that in the text of the proposal which I hope will be going forward to constitutional referendum. I indicate that it is not proposed to put to a division Senator Martin's amendment . It is one, the force of which we accept the inevitably of even if we do not like it very much. </PARA>

Senator Evans's proposed alteration is almost ultra vires section 5 of the Constitution, which is very much in line with the Constitution of Papua New Guinea at present. It is interesting to note that in that country the Prime Minister, with the support of the Opposition, is seeking to move away from the circumstance whereby, if a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister is carried, another Prime Minister can be appointed without the voters having a say about the new government. Of course, one recognises from time to time that that has happened in our history as well. But I do not think it is thoroughly desirable.

<PARA>This Bill provides for the hour of closing the poll for Senate and House of Representatives elections to be two hours earlier than is presently the case; namely, 6 p.m., instead of 8 p.m. The purpose of this is to attempt to make the polling times in all elections, State, Territorial, and Federal, as uniform as possible in order to reduce confusion. Already a majority of polls operate with 6 p.m. as the closing time, the trend being in the direction of earlier closing, and this Bill will bring the elections for the national Parliament into line. Additionally, this measure will reduce the hours which polling staff are asked to work. This will decrease the pressure caused by a long day's effort on both the Commonwealth Electoral Office staff and party supporters, as well as reduce slightly the cost of holding the election. The earlier closing of the polls will also enable the Electoral Office to conclude the night's count with a firm result in any but a finely balanced election. For those electors who are not able to vote during the hours proposed, such as those restricted by religious conviction, ample opportunity exists to cast their ballot earlier using postal balloting procedures. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>The objective of this Bill is to reduce the effect of the unconsidered vote- normally called the donkey vote-on the national result in House of Representatives elections by introducing the law of probability into the selection and order of listing of names on the ballot paper for such elections. In combination with two other proposed reforms of the Electoral Act-the printing of party affiliation next to the candidates' names, and the simplification of ballot marking procedure through optional preferential voting-this Bill should help to eliminate the donkey vote as an undermining factor in our electoral system and remove the temptation, succumbed to in the past, for particular political parties and individual candidates to abuse cynically the loophole of alphabetical listing. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will also ensure uniformity in the method of selection for order of listing between the House of Representatives and the Senate, as well as allow for the continued use of how-to-vote advice, which is a traditional feature of Australian elections. There was little, if any, opposition to this measure when it was introduced in the Parliament in 1974. The current Treasurer (Mr Howard) was one of its supporters. The package of reforms contained in the Commonwealth Electoral Act Amendment Bill 1974, one of which this Bill is based on, was passed in the House of Representatives and was lost in the Senate only on a tied vote. This measure then has been delayed for eight years now despite widespread bipartisan support for it. There should be no further tardiness in its implementation.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The aim of this Bill is to reduce the extremely high number of informal or invalid ballots, particularly at elections for the Senate. The means by which this will be achieved is by replacing the current requirements of compulsory exhaustive preferential voting with a form of optional preferential voting and by liberalising the definition of informality. These two measures, in combination with the printing of party affiliations next to candidates' names, the listing of names on the ballot papers by lot, the continued use of how-to- vote cards, and an effective program of voter education, will ensure that more Australian electors will have an effective and secure involvement in the electoral process. The key to achieving this result can be summarised as simplicity and clarity. In Senate voting enormous numbers of voters are deprived of a meaningful vote purely because of the requirement that all squares must be marked. The percentage of informality regularly rises above 10 per cent nationally and often over 12 per cent in particular States. This clearly may have an influence on the outcome of the election. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet there is no rationale for this requirement. The number of ballot papers whose extreme preferences have to be counted is miniscule. Indeed, at least 80 per cent of voters in Senate elections see their first preference candidate elected, and in the case of States which elect a minor party candidate or independent this can be as high as 98 per cent. How perverted then is a system which can require that voters have to mark as many as 72 preferences on one ballot paper. There can be no plausible defence for the current electoral situation which deprives so many hundreds of thousands of citizens of their voting rights. If these reform measures are not implemented this number will pass the one million mark at the next election. I have prepared tables and a much longer second reading speech on this Bill. I seek leave to incorporate them in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA> Some further information will assist in any interpretation of these figures. The election for the first Federal Parliament was held under various State Acts and as such, plus the fact that it was the initial and somewhat novel experience of federal elections, can be ignored for statistical meaning. </PARA>
<PARA> From 1903 to 1917 voters were required to mark 3 and only 3 crosses against the names of their choice (in 1914, 6). The informality during this period is obviously lower than at any other time (mean=4.72%). </PARA>
<PARA> From 1919 to 1931 this was changed to a form of optional preferential voting which required the voters putting down preferences for twice the number of vacancies plus one, generally speaking that was 1 to 7. The mean informal vote during this period was 8.96%. However, it should be noted that during this period the number of candidates for election was generally small and on several occasions less than 7. </PARA>
<PARA> From 1934 to 1980 exhaustive preferential voting has prevailed with the number of senators to be elected generally 3 per State; and since 1949 this was increased to 5, with 7 in 1949 and 10 in 1951, 1974 and 1975. Since 1949 also the number of candidates has increased considerably. The mean informal vote for this period is 9.06%. However, it should also be noted that during this period occurred the four Senate-only elections in which mean informality was considerably lower. </PARA>
<PARA> One further point needs making, and that is that with all the systems used, including the form of optional preferential used between 1919 to 1931, there was a very strict requirement for the ballot to remain valid. That is, any variations from the requirement would be set aside as informal. </PARA>
<PARA> The only conclusion that can be reached then from these figures is that simplicity, whether it be in the form of the ballot paper, or the style of voting, or the number of candidates, or the absence of a simultaneous House election, contributes a major role to the reduction of the informal vote. There has been insufficient study done of this problem (the limited work done by the Australian Electoral Office in 1978 has not been made public) and academics are not agreed on the implications. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is an attempt to bring as much simplicity as is possible and practical into the current electoral system. No matter how many candidates may appear on the ballot paper the elector will still only have to put in preferences for the number of candidates plus one (i.e. 6 or 11) in the Senate, and just one in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Senate method of counting this number of preferences will ensure a balance between the smallest possible number for effectiveness and simplicity (i .e. 1 preference) and the need to prevent large numbers of ballot papers being set aside because their preferences have run out before they have voted for a successful candidate. </PARA>
<PARA> These exhausted ballots (as they are called) will account for less than 1% of the formal vote, and could be even less provided electors are aware of the nature of the voting system. Of course, not exercising their full voting rights of putting in more preferences is an added alternative for electors who wish to do so in an optional preferential system. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major contributory factor to the high level of informality is the strict definition and interpretation of what constitutes an informal vote. When this is associated with a complex voting system then the negative result is amplified. </PARA>
<PARA> The current situation is such that any voter making the simplest of errors anywhere on the ballot paper invalidates the ballot even though the error may not have any connection with the voter's intention. For example, '25' may be written twice, or the number '38' left out altogether. The number '27' may look like a '24' or a '21'. Yet the first few preferences (perhaps only the first preference) would be the only preferences that need be counted and the intention of the voter would be clear. Nevertheless, the votes would be invalid. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no reason why the voter's intentions should not be counted while they remain clear, even though later in the preferences there may be an error.</PARA>
<PARA> Nor should these measures be seen as a party political attempt to gain advantage for the ALP. The optional preferential method presented in the Bill does not deprive smaller parties and independents of the opportunity to direct their supporters' preference votes to selected candidates. Nor should it prevent surplus preferences from successful candidates flowing to them. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, if anything, the smaller parties and independents have most to gain. The Australian Electoral Office survey of informal voting showed that such candidates suffered disproportionately more from probable protest informal votes than did the major parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The most recent major academic study of informality claims that high informality relative to low informality actually favours the conservative parties over the ALP. In short this Bill strives to reduce the informal vote. </PARA>

The list goes on-the Agricultural Policy; the report of the Australian Shipping Commission; the report of the Uranium Advisory Council; the report on the Higher Defence Organisation in Australia, the report of the Industrial Relations Bureau ; the report of the Australian Federal Police; the report of the Industries Assistance Commission; and the report of the Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Council. The Government has said that honourable senators will be denied the right to comment on those reports and exercise their right of review. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it very ironic that that situation should occur after both Senator Walters and Senator Missen this afternoon felt constrained by their experiences at the Inter-Parliamentary Union meetings in Cuba and Rome to complain about the fact that parliamentarians at that international forums were not acting as responsible, democratically elected parliamentarians exercising a proper right of independence from the Executive. I find it amazing that within half an hour of those comments being made from Government senators that the Executive should override our ordinary senatorial rights of comment on this important range of reports which covers, as I have indicated, a very wide variety of matters of concern to the general public and the community of Australia. I certainly did not want to let the matter pass without raising my voice in protest. </PARA>

The sessional order adopted earlier this year provides that on a Thursday the Senate will debate for at least an hour and a half in the morning the papers which are tabled on a Thursday. They are especially tabled on a Thursday and the sessional order provides that we will start off with an hour and a half debate in the morning.

Perhaps Senator Button could have spoken for his side and the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Sir John Carrick, could have responded; that would have been adequate. At first our side was told that there would be two speakers a side. Finally we were told that the Opposition intended to have three speakers a side. We ended up having six speakers on an absolute nonsense matter talking about past history. As a result we had 12 minutes to debate papers. I was in the chair at the time. It was nearly ten to one before we got around to debating the papers for which we should have had an hour and a half debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Tate complains about our side riding roughshod over the Parliament. It is his side which is riding roughshod over the Parliament. It is not giving honourable senators on this side an opportunity to debate matters which we consider to be of importance.

We have had an opportunity of discussing the matter with him. In some respects there was an error by the Government-I think some delay was occasioned by us-in the procedural motion which Senator Chaney moved, an error in the sense that it was not agreed that it should be done in that form. Senator Tate, who is gaining his rage rather than maintaining it, as Senator Lewis said, was I think properly and understandably aggrieved by the course which was followed. I do not think it is of any help for Senator Lewis to come in here with his red neck arguments from Portland, or wherever he comes, and talk about this sort of thing.

But that was not done because, of course, the legislation was not ready. The Government has had much disagreement within its party about what it is going to do about tax evaders. That is the problem with which the Government has been concerned. The matter of public importance which was raised this morning was not a nonsense matter. Senator Lewis referred to it as a matter of history and said that we are not interested in history. If honourable senators read the Hansard they will find that the Leader Government in the Senate, Senator Sir John Carrick, is interested in nothing else but history.

I do so because of the way in which the motion was put by the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney. We on this side had no idea that Senator Chaney intended to incorporate things in the motion in the way he did. I understood, from looking at the Notice Paper, that at the end of the introduction of certain Bills by Senator Gietzelt the motion would be put by Senator Chaney that Government Business would take precedence over General Business. We would have been given the opportunity to lodge our objection to that-even though I realise that some agreement had been made-and we would not have gone to a division on the matter. We would have gone on to consider Government Business. The matter was handled in a very sneaky way.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I am indebted to Senator McLaren who made it clear that he did anticipate our moving on to consider Government Business but that he thought a different procedure would be followed. I can only say with respect to the procedure that, as Minister in charge of the Senate at the time, I used the form of motion which was prepared by the Clerks. I was not in any sense trying to be clever in what I did. I was surprised that the objection which I understood would occur did not take place. I understand that when I read the motion honourable senators might not have picked up that it was in three parts and that the third part covered the return to consideration of Government Business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am indebted to Senator McLaren because I would not have wished the Senate to think this was a matter of bad faith. The setting of business is normally handled by the Whips with the respective leaders being involved. I became involved today because, on behalf of the Attorney-General, I was concerned with legislation which Senator Evans, on behalf of the Opposition, was anxious to have passed through the Committee stage. For that reason, and for that reason alone, I became involved in some discussions with Senator Evans. It was arranged that his Bill-I understood with the approval of the Opposition-would take precedence to enable it to be cleared in time for him to meet commitments elsewhere in Australia. In other words, there could not have been a more obvious attempt to accommodate the requirements of the Opposition that it should get a non-Government Bill, which it regarded as important, considered today. I note the request which has been made by the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button) that we should look at the possibility of providing some time to discuss papers. I will refer that to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Sir John Carrick, for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to stress that in a situation where numbers in the Senate are so even- the balance lies with the Australian Democrats and the independent senator-it is quite obvious that the Government would not really see it as a particularly clever way to approach the business of the Senate to proceed by way of subterfuge or trickery. If we are to meet the program which is set down it is necessary for reasonable compromises to occur. Sometimes that is very dificult given the strong interest which honourable senators have in debating particular issues which are perhaps close to their hearts or the hearts of their electors. In the instant case, we have moved a motion which I understood was anticipated. As I say, I am grateful to Senator McLaren for the acknowledgment of that in his comments. I suggest that we move on to consider some Bills and other matters of moment rather than spend endless hours debating this procedural matter. </PARA>

Whilst I disagreed with that, obviously there was no point in objecting to it. If the Opposition parties had wished to discuss the papers, we would now be discussing them. I thought that the point raised by Senator McLaren was very odd . I cannot see what this matter has to do with the times at which the Senate sits.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senators Robert Ray and Gietzelt made comments on the same matter concerning an information program vote of $1.5m for the Department of Treasury. Throughout the Committee stage of the Appropriation Bill and the consideration of the Estimates the views of those honourable senators have become well known with regard to this matter. They have been expressed on numerous occasions. The information in response to their earlier discussion was presented to the Committee on 21 September and was printed in the Hansard record of the Estimates Committee C on 11 October.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Robert Ray asked some questions with regard to advertising programs. In particular, he raised the question of the nature of advertising programs during an election period. As was stated in the information presented to the Committee, there is considered to be the need for information to be given on a number of program changes and programs that have arisen from the Budget which is before the Committee at present. Changes have been made in areas such as housing rebates, housing assistance, taxation matters, social security, training schemes for the unemployed and matters of that sort. Programs are being arranged in the usual way as far as many departments are concerned. Indeed, some of the information that was given to the Committee listed a number of departments with information or advertising votes. As was said earlier today, and previously something like $40m will be spent on these matters in this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray was particularly interested in the forthcoming by-election in Victoria and asked about the way in which government advertising would proceed throughout the campaign. I think it has to be understood that information programs and advertising campaigns of government are a matter of continuity. They are matters which arise from time to time. They can be spasmodic things that might occur with regard to, say, Aussie Bonds or something of that sort. We really would be seeking the proper use of funds, the accountability of government with regard to public expenditure. When talking about information programs that arise from the most recent Budget, I think one would have to differentiate between those sorts of programs and what would be a political campaign which would be run during a campaign by the party organisations of the political parties concerned. To my thinking the political party campaign is quite different from government services and government information programs. The only example I could perhaps give to Senator Ray, who is from Victoria, is the advertising for the forthcoming Waverley by-election which will be occurring in that State. He could look at some of the advertising that has been undertaken by the Victorian Government with regard to, for example, its tourist authority or its tourist aspirations. We see the Premier featured in those advertisements and advertisements to attract attention to the--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I am talking about advertisements in Victoria. There are the sorts of advertisements we see with regard to public transport and so on. I think it is accepted that throughout a by-election in a State or for a Federal seat there is still a continuity of government. Government does not suspend all advertising that might arise from government departments during that time. It is a matter of the accountability for expenditure by government and the proper use of expenditure. Political campaigns are quite separate from government advertising in that sense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Ray was also interested whether the results of surveys which were undertaken through the Department of Administrative Services could be made available to senators and members on request or generally. I think he mentioned the public surveys and the community issues surveys. Just as we did with the post-Budget survey, in which some interest was shown, I am quite certain that the Department of Administrative Services, through the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman), would be perfectly happy to make the results available. I will see that Senator Ray's interest is drawn to the Minister's attention. As to whether they are complicated surveys containing the volume of information of the sort that arose in the survey report which was placed in the Parliamentary Library or whether they are short surveys that could be put on general distribution to members and senators, I think that matter would need to be investigated at the relevant time. When the information that comes from the surveys undertaken through the Department of Administrative Services becomes available I can see no difficulty in making it freely available . </PARA>
<PARA> Questions were raised by Senator Walsh with regard to the $1.5m for information funds. He asked whether this program is to proceed, whether the advertisements have been prepared and on what date they will commence. I do not know that it is appropriate to relate those questions to the $1.5m. Some advertisements which are in the course of preparation through the Department of Administrative Services will cover the changes in the Budget. As I understand it, Ministers are still to meet to determine the acceptability of the proposed advertisements, what form they will take and when they are to commence being shown. I think that meeting is to be held either at the end of this week-that would probably be tomorrow-or early next week. At the meeting a decision will be taken with regard to some of the proposed advertisements that have been prepared through the Department of Administrative Services. </PARA>
<PARA> Having made those statements, I am not able to say whether the campaign is to proceed because we have yet to decide, through the Ministers concerned, on the acceptability of proposals put forward by the advertising agents. As to the program of issue of advertisements and whether they will involve radio, television or the Press, I am not aware of the precise facts but I understand that some of the television advertisements or the information to be given will refer people to more detailed information, say through the Department of Social Security, relating to housing or whatever. I think a combination of information would be provided through television, perhaps radio, and the Press on these matters. However, as to the commencement dates and the final form of the advertisements, I am not able to give information yet because as far as I know that has not yet been decided finally. I think they were the only questions raised with regard to these matters. I commend Group C to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of the reply I want to make a couple of points. The Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) has indicated that the primary, if not the sole, intention of this $1.5m information campaign was to convey to the public information about changes pursuant to the 1982 Budget. The great majority of those changes commenced as from 1 November. If the intention of the Government was to inform the public about those changes that information campaign-to adopt the Government's euphemism-would commence now or about now and it would continue for the next couple of months. The fact that the Government has not yet decided whether to proceed with the planned information campaign confirms very strongly the suspicion that the intention never was to provide the public with information but to provide the Liberal Party with a bit of public money for a political slush fund to spread Liberal propaganda for an election which was planned for this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Government does not proceed with the information campaign that it had planned we will have absolute confirmation that that, indeed, is the true situation-that the Government was not interested in informing the public but was very interested in diverting a bit of public money into the Liberal Party till in order to use it for spreading Liberal propaganda at public expense. I suggest that a further confirmation of that analysis of the intention of this measure is the fact that it is being contemplated that television will be used. If the intention is to convey information, particularly about rather complex matters such as changes in taxation and changes in social security benefits, obviously the most effective way to convey it is in written form so that people can refer back to it. The ephemeral message given from television does not convey information but it is a very effective means of spreading propaganda and impressions, which I suggest are likely to be highly misleading impressions at that. </PARA>
<PARA> With those words I will leave that matter. I want to take up one other matter. A letter concerning the Australian Taxation Office written only this week by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to Mr Willis in reply to an earlier letter to the Treasurer from Mr Dawkins states that the estimate of tax to be recovered from the recoupment legislation which is presently before the Senate is $620m which, I understand, comprises something like $500m of ordinary company tax not paid and about $120m of Division 7 tax which was not paid because the companies were disposed of in the way in which they were. Incidentally, that is the highest official estimate I have seen. I know that there is nothing terribly surprising about that because, as time goes by, the Taxation Office is able to compile more accurate lists of the number and type of companies which are to be affected by the legislation. A substantially different recoupment Bill was introduced in the House of Representatives on 21 October. Of particular note is the inclusion in that second Bill of clause 3, sub-clause (12), which was not in the original Bill. That sub-clause provides for the exemption of vendor shareholders of companies disposed of to promoters in the belief that current year profits would be successfully treated in the hands of the promoters under tax avoidance schemes-which schemes subsequently failed because they were disallowed either by the Commissioner or the courts. I trust that that is a brief but reasonably accurate interpretation of what that sub-clause provides. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that some 700 companies are likely to be exempted by that sub- clause, which was not in the original legislation, and that the revenue forgone as a result will be proportionately much higher than would be suggested by the number of companies involved. No figure has been suggested, but the impression created is that as much as a third, or perhaps even more, of the revenue originally expected to be recovered will not, because of the insertion of sub- clause 3 (12), the limited-innocence clause, now be recovered. I do not want to discuss in great detail the merits or otherwise of that sub-clause; it will be the subject of debate next week. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I want to take up is that the most recent estimate by the Treasurer of the revenue to be recovered from this legislation, as given in his letter of as recently as the last Monday, appears to make no allowance for the revenue leakage consequent upon the addition of sub-clause 3 (12) to the Bill which was introduced into the House of Representatives on 21 October. I seek clarification from the Australian Taxation Office, through the Minister for Finance, as to whether that latest figure of $620m has allowed for revenue leakage attributable to the insertion of sub-clause 3 (12). </PARA>

The Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) is well aware that for some time I have pursued the matter of the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training. I first raised it on 17 February. Whenever I raise the matter, whether in the Senate by way of question or speech, or at the Estimates Committee hearings, I am told that the Ministers involved will provide an answer.

The matter is well known to the Taxation Office. I have had letters from both Mr O' Reilly and the Deputy Commissioner in South Australia acknowledging that the problem does exist. When Mr Brown was Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations he acknowledged to me that there was an anomaly in the Act. All I want to know now is when we can be told whether the Act will be amended so that employers who availed themselves of the promise made by the Government will not be unduly penalised by having to pay tax on money which they received for taking on apprentices in the belief that the rebate would be tax free. They have now been called upon to pay tax on that sum. </PARA>

The basis of that advice was that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) had written to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on the question following representations that he had received. I understand that the Prime Minister has now requested the Treasurer to make a submission to the Cabinet so the issue can be resolved. I can only hope, with Senator McLaren, that that can happen quickly. If any change in policy is agreed to by the Government I will see that Senator McLaren is advised .</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to a matter which causes me a great deal of concern. It is to be found under the estimates for administrative expenses of the Department of Administrative Services at page 20 of Appropriation Bill (No. 1), and concerns the conduct of Commonwealth elections, referendums and industrial ballots. I want to refer to a number of specific matters in regard to that item. Honourable senators may recall that as shadow Minister for Administrative Services I have asked over the last couple of years a number of questions about the conduct of ballots and the preparation of the electoral roll. On 24 March 1982 I asked the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Baume, a question in respect of the habitation reviews and the maintenance of the electoral roll in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it a fact that, as a result of restrictions based upon staff and funds, the Chief Australian Electoral Officer is unable to carry out the regular habitation review procedures in most States of the Commonwealth? Does that mean that the electoral rolls will not be brought up to date?</PARA>
<PARA>The reply suggested that no particular financial problem or limitation had caused habitation review activities in this current financial year to be reduced . The Minister suggested that the curtailment did not flow from staff restrictions. Yet page 20 of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1982-83 shows that of a sum of $5,182,000, only $4,232,000-a difference of $950,000-was spent in that year. The reply that was given to me suggested that there was no curtailment of funds in respect of habitation reviews. That means that the information that was provided to the Parliament was inadequate and is belied by the information that is available in item 05 concerning administration of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. It is clear from the report of the Australian Electoral Office that there has been a reduction in the habitation reviews and, contrary to the reply that I received, there has been a definite curtailment of activities to such an extent that the habitation reviews were reduced considerably in the financial year ending 30 June last year. I would like an explanation for that. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise another matter which I believe is quite serious. The recent report of the Australian Electoral Office indicated a large increase in the number of ballots conducted under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act-in other words, ballots referred to as court ballots. A substantial number of unions now are utilising the provisions of the Act to have their ballots conducted by the Australian Electoral Office. There is currently a section 73 application before the Federal Court in respect of a ballot that was conducted a year ago from the New South Wales branch of the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union. I appreciate that I am restricted in what I can say about this matter. Honourable senators may recall that I raised some serious matters about interference in the post office in the conduct of a ballot in 1979. As a result of alleged irregulatirities, a section 73 inquiry is being conducted by the Honourable Mr Justice St. John. However, Mr Lewis, the officer who was appointed to conduct that ballot, has admitted in evidence-as reported in the Australian Financial Review about five weeks ago-that the ballot papers the subject of the court proceedings that were in his custody have disappeared while the court has been considering the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot comment on the case except to say that grave allegations of irregularities have been made. I find it completely unacceptable that the officer concerned in the conduct of that ballot should admit to the court that the ballot papers have disappeared from his custody. In those circumstances, I find it difficult to understand how the Chief Australian Electoral Officer can appoint the same person, Mr Lewis, to conduct several other ballots which are currently in progress. This officer has admitted before a court that he has lost ballot papers which are the subject of a section 73 application. It seems to me that for that officer to be placed in charge of other trade union ballots is a dereliction of duty not only on his part but also on the part of the Commonwealth Electoral Officer. If he cannot properly handle the ballot papers for a case which is currently before the court one is entitled to say, according to the constituents who have been firstly to see my office while Parliament was sitting and subsequently who came to see me, that there are misgivings, justified or not, about that person's capacity to handle properly the ballot which is due to start very shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice in an advertisement in one of the daily newspapers that the same Mr Lewis is conducting another ballot. I think we ought to be given an explanation here of how an officer, who freely admits that the ballot papers in his custody disappeared during a court case, can still be held to be a person above reproach in respect of the conduct of other elections. Not only must justice be done but also it must be seen to be done. Therefore there are misgivings felt by the unions concerned that that same officer should be appointed to carry out ballots when in fact he is still a witness before a court to which he has freely admitted that ballot papers have disappeared. If the trade union movement is to continue to utilise the resources provided by the Parliament, that is, the application for ballots to be conducted by Commonwealth industrial legislation, obviously a returning officer needs to be appointed for that purpose in whom members, no matter what their ideological beliefs may be, will have complete and utmost confidence in the way in which he conducts ballots. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter I want to refer to under the line items for the Department of Administrative Services deals with both the Remuneration Tribunal's changed recommendations and the parliamentary and ministerial staff and services. My colleague in the other place, Mr Manfred Cross, yesterday asked a question of the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr Newman) as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Was the definition of 'home base' for the purpose of the payment of travel allowances to Ministers altered in the 1982 review of the Remuneration Tribunal? What was the reason for this change? What evidence, or other information, was advanced to the Remuneration Tribunal in support of such a change?</PARA>
<PARA>In reply to the first part of the question the Minister said yes, the definition for the 'home base' was altered. To the second part of the question the Minister replied that the reason for the change was administrative convenience and efficiency and to the third part of the question stated that he did not know, and that the question would have to be asked of the Remuneration Tribunal. We know, of course, having looked at the latest recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal, which were put down in this Parliament early in the Budget session, that the definition of 'home base' was changed in the 1982 review of the Remuneration Tribunal. The 1980 review contained the following definition:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Home base' for the purpose of payment of travelling allowance to Ministers, shall be the home of a Minister unless he nominates otherwise to the Minister for Administrative Services. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1982 review changed the definition to read:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Home base', for the purpose of payment of travelling allowance to a Minister, shall be the principal place of residence of the minister. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the 1980 definition it would always have been open to a Minister to nominate a residence other than his home for the purpose of payment of travelling allowance. In the 1980 review it was made clear that the home base would be the principal place of residence of the Minister. There was no provision for nominating any other place of residence. The new wording allows much less scope for ripping the system off. I am told that the change in wording was not recommended by the Government. I want to know whether the change in the definition of 'home base' was recommended by officers of the Department of Administrative Services. I also want to know the reason for it being altered. If I do not get a satisfactory answer from the Minister I will ask further questions about three very senior Ministers who I am reliably informed were involved and were the reason for the changes being made in the definition of ' home base'. A very large amount of money is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> While we are being told repeatedly by senior Ministers of the Government that the work force of Australia should exercise great restraint in their demands for increased wages those Ministers are doing the very opposite. I will not pursue the matter further. I will leave it to the Minister or to an officer who perhaps might volunteer the real reason why the change has been made. The names of the senior Ministers might even be volunteered. If that is not forthcoming I will put to the Ministers a series of questions about those Ministers and the amount of money that is involved. This matter has to be cleared up. This country is being told time and time again that the work force is making too great a demand on the public purse and that that is the reason for the economic chaos we now face. We heard this argument enunciated here today by Senator Carrick in no uncertain terms. He said that the high level of unemployment in this country was brought about by the excessive demands of wage earners; that that was the reason the country is going down the gurgler. I would say from the outset that if we are to put a stop to that sort of activity the senior Ministers of this Government will have to set the example. I will leave the matter at that. I ask the Minister to give me the information I have sought. If she cannot, I will pursue the matter further. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will follow this matter up now so that we do not get out of sequence. I ask the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) whether in the recent 12 months period-that is the calendar year-the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Anthony Street, claimed travelling allowance for a total of 320 days. Was Christmas Day 1981, which he spent at his property in Victoria, included? If in fact he did claim for 320 days in the recent 12 months an amount of $30,000 would have been involved. We all know that a travelling allowance paid to members of parliament is tax free.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also want to know whether the Deputy Prime Minister, now the Acting Prime Minister, Mr John Douglas Anthony, claimed travelling allowance for 200 days in the last 12 months. I also want to know whether he was engaged in what is know as the rotation of home bases. That is, when the Parliament is in session, one nominates the home base in one's electorate as where one lives, and, when the Parliament is in recess, one gives one's home address as Canberra. We all know that Mr Anthony has a home in Canberra, financed at a very low rate of interest. From the answer that we had the other day, I think that he has paid only about $ 360 in interest on the loan for that home in the last year. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to know whether the Minister for Defence, Mr Sinclair, also made a claim in the last calendar year for a similar period of 200 days travelling allowance. To each of those persons this would have meant an amount of $17,000. I also want to know whether Mr Sinclair had been engaged in what is known, as I have said, as the rotation of home bases which means, I repeat that whilst the Parliament is in session the home base is given as the place where one lives in one's electorate, or somewhere else but away from Canberra, and, when the Parliament is in recess and one is back in one's home town or electorate, the home base is put down as having been Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is so, I can well see why a recommendation has been made to the Remuneration Tribunal. The Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Newman, may not have made that recommendation. He quickly sidestepped that question yesterday. He must have known all about it. He, being the Minister for Administrative Services, I would hardly think that he would not be briefed on what has been going on in the Department, particularly when these senior Ministers, as I have said, are repeatedly calling on the work force of Australia to exercise restraint in their demands. We know that the Acting Prime Minister would have a salary, without travelling allowance, of about $90,000. It would take the average worker about-</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Longer than five years, because not too many workers get more than $15,000 a year-so to earn $90,000, which Mr Anthony gets in one year, would take them at least six or seven years. As I have repeatedly said in this Parliament, he has availed himself of the perks of office by having a cheap home loan. We also know-it was revealed in this Parliament some time ago-that at one stage Mr Anthony rented that home to a member of the Central Intelligence Agency , Mr Stallings. That is another matter which perhaps the Australian Taxation Office might have a look at to see whether taxation was paid on the rental received for that residence in Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We notice another matter in an answer given to my colleague Senator Bolkus yesterday about Mr Sinclair. It cost nearly $1,700 of taxpayers' money recently- in July, I think-to fly him by VIP aircraft from Sydney to Inverell for him to spend about 2 1/2 hours in the electorate and then to fly back to Sydney where his aircraft broke the curfew by landing after midnight. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the sorts of things that are going on, and these are the people who ought to be setting the example to the work force. If they are continually to demand restraint from the work force, they are the people who have to set an example. In this Bill, one can see the amount of money that is being expended on these people. One can look there to see what it costs for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to go overseas. One can look to see what it costs for the Minister for Administrative Services. It is an enormous sum. Rumour has it that quite a large amount of that money was used in a weekend trip down the Nile for each of them. I am told that it was about $5,000. Perhaps as I have given notice of that, we shall get an answer about it. Another Minister-not so senior, but he is a Minister-made a trip on the Orient Express some time ago when he could have travelled by other means, and that was a large cost, too. If necessary, if I do not get the right answers, next week I shall name that Minister in Parliament, too. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The first question that I raise is somewhat similar to the matter which has just been raised by Senator McLaren. It is occasioned by the fact that earlier this week I contacted the appropriate Senate official to inform him that he had overpaid my travelling allowance-not that I object to getting money, but I could not quite understand how I was being paid for days when I was out of Canberra. While I was talking to that official he said that there had been a slip-up and that the payment for another senator from my State had been translated to my pay slip. He said that it would be adjusted. I then asked why anybody would expect to be paid for being in Canberra on a Saturday night except perhaps on some very rare occasion when there was some parliamentary reason for being here. I was informed that no real checking process is used and that senators and members are placed very largely on trust in their claims for TA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apparently prior to 1974 the situation was that a senator or member was paid travelling allowance for time necessarily spent in Canberra. That is how it was defined. At the moment we are paid travelling allowance for each overnight stay away from our home base which is occasioned primarily by parliamentary business. When the Senate or the House of Representatives is sitting this is checked on through the transport office when we fly in and fly out. In that case it is fairly easy to check on the number of days that we spend in Canberra. It is assumed that if we are here during a sitting week we are actually doing parliamentary business. At the moment I do not want to engage in a debate on who does what work and how often. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there would be a number of people who might fail that. During recess weeks apparently no assumptions are made about why we are in Canberra and each senator or member is expected to fill in a claim form. It is those claim forms, the officer told me, that are taken on trust. The officers assume that if a senator or member says that he or she is in Canberra for a particular reason then indeed he or she is. Checking around a little more after that, since my curiosity was aroused, I discovered that there are a number of senators and members who not only own, as I do, a home unit or a home here in Canberra or Queanbeyan but also actually live in Canberra, Queanbeyan or some other local area for a substantial part of the year. It has not been unknown, so the rumors that I have heard assert, for some of these members and senators to claim a substantial amount of TA including TA for the Easter weekend and Christmas Day. Being perhaps a bearer of very little brain, I find it difficult to work out why a senator or member should be so conscientious that he or she is busy in Canberra on parliamentary work even over Easter and on Christmas Day and New Year's Day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, I ask just exactly what checking up is done on claims made by senators and members for travel during up weeks and in particular for the longer winter and Christmas recesses. If it is not going beyond the bounds of decency, I also ask how many senators and members are known-I want the number, not the names-to live in or around Canberra for the majority of the year and whether there is in effect any significant difference between the TA paid to those senators and members who reside here for a substantial part of the year rather than in their home States or electorates and the TA paid to those of us who travel on a weekly basis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 22 September I raised with the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), who represents the Treasurer (Mr Howard), a matter relating to a de facto partner paying health insurance. In de facto relationships there may be no children. I understand that among de facto couples it is fairly widespread practice for one person to take it upon himself or herself to pay the family rate of health insurance. In actual fact de facto couples are being advised by some health benefit funds that they can claim health insurance payments as a taxation deduction. The problem is that misleading advice has been given by the health benefit funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In one particular instance misleading advice was given to me in relation to this matter by the Taxation Office in Perth. When I was contacted by a constituent about this matter I rang a fairly senior officer in the Taxation Office and I was told that it was quite permissible for a de facto partner to claim the family rate for health benefits. I passed on that advice to my constituent. At the time I spoke to the officer I said that, because the assessment had already gone out, perhaps the easiest way to resolve the issue would be for the person concerned to lodge an objection. The officer agreed that that might be a much simpler way of tackling the matter. I then advised my constituent of the action she should take. After she had taken that action she received a letter which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The basic health insurance rebate applied only to premiums which secure entitlement to basic benefits for the taxpayer on his/her legally married spouse . </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of my asking a question on 22 September about this was to find out whether in actual fact the Taxation Office was ever going to move into the twentieth century and recognise, as other government departments do, that de facto relationships exist and that, by its legislation, it is virtually encouraging people to cheat. To my knowledge, what happens now is that if the partners in a de facto relationship recognise that they can pay family rates but cannot claim family rates as a tax deduction in some cases both then claim the single rate, which is not the same as the family rate, so the Government is in actual fact losing money. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a little disturbed with the response from the Treasurer. Apparently the Government has no intention of changing either the Income Tax Assessment Act or the health insurance rebate provision to include de facto partners. I do not have an estimate of the number of people who are living in de facto relationships where no children are involved, but I have had a number of inquiries at my office and a number of inquiries have been handled by the health benefit funds. I am not naming any particular fund because I have been in touch with most of them in my State. Most of the health benefit funds have told me that they have been approached on any number of occasions during the year about whether it is possible for people in a de facto relationship to claim the family rate when they have no children. The health benefit funds have been under the misapprehension that it is possible for these people to claim a family rate. A number of them have been so doing. As the advice given to me came from a senior officer of the Taxation Office, I would anticipate that that information would have been handed on to a number of couples who are in a like situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I make this contribution to the debate basically to suggest that there are a number of ways in which this problem could be tackled. To my mind it is a simple matter. If we are concerned about tax cheats-much has been said about them in the headlines lately-we should not be encouraging people to cheat in a situation where they believe they have just cause to claim health insurance rebates. In actual fact we should simply be amending the health insurance rebate provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act to enable de facto partners who do not have dependants to be able to make a satisfactory claim on their taxation form. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) will recall that a short while ago I raised the matter of habitation reviews. As a consequence my office was contacted by the State member of parliament for the electorate of Bathurst. He claimed-I have every reason to believe that his claim is a correct one-that a habitation review is taking place in the urban areas of his electorate of Bathurst and that no habitation review has been carried out in rural areas. There has been a lot of criticism about the selectivity of habitation review-the fact that they are carried out in some electorates and not in others. There seems to be a rather haphazard approach to habitation reviews. As the Government has suggested in recent times that money will be allocated during this financial year for the carrying out of habitation reviews I wonder whether we could have an assurance from the Australian Electoral Office that habitation reviews will be carried out on an electoral basis, on a thorough basis and not on a basis of selectivity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the general experience we have had with these matters is that urban folk may well move about or be more transitory than others, but there is evidence, according to the local member, Mr R. J. Clough, of changes taking place in rural centres largely because of the current problems of unemployment in rural towns. All he is asking-I think his request is a proper one and is one that the Opposition would want to see applied generously-is that if the electorate is to be reviewed, and that would involve the Federal electorate of Macquarie, that it be done not on a selective basis but include every subdivision in every town and every little village, regardless of the difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure the Minister appreciates that persons in country towns are appointed by the Electoral Office to do these reviews, whereas in rural sectors they are usually done by the local postmistress, police constable or some other agent appointed by the Electoral Office who can or cannot do the job thoroughly. Different processes and procedures are involved. I wonder whether we could have an assurance from the Australian Electoral Office that these matters will be carried out in a way which indicates that there is no selectivity and that every member, whatever his political position-whether it be a Federal or State member- will be subject to no fear or favour with regard to the way in which the habitation review is carried out. </PARA>

In view of Senator McLaren's comments and in view of the fact that we seem to be working rather slowly through the appropriations it seemed at least a reasonable place to put the matter on notice so that I could get the information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next problem I wish to raise was brought to my attention by the Town Clerk of the City of Port Pirie. It is a somewhat more parochial matter than the one I raised earlier. Apparently earlier this year the Chief Property Officer of the Department of Administrative Services in South Australia wrote to the Corporation of the City of Port Pirie and also to the Port Pirie Rifle Club Inc. advising them that the property on which the rifle club was situated had been declared surplus to the requirements of the Commonwealth and asking whether either the Council, the rifle club or both were interested in purchasing the property. It gave them a sort of priority option on it. The property concerned is approximately 40 hectares in the hundred of Pirie. It had been used by the Army for some time. The Department of Administrative Services indicated that the Army had no further interest in the rifle range and as a courtesy, I guess, offered it to the rifle club. </PARA>
<PARA> The current market value was assessed by the Commonwealth valuer and I understand that the figure arrived at was $5,000. The Port Pirie Rifle Club is quite happy to purchase the land but does not want to spend that amount of money on the purchase. The club has apparently occupied the range in its present situation for something like 30 years. In that time the upkeep of the land has been basically its responsibility. It has undertaken almost all of the improvements made at the range at its own expense. Firing mounds have been grassed, water has been laid on, pit ramps have been erected, the stock butt repaired and raised. I am told that the only thing the Army was asked to do was to cut the grass to avert a fire, and that was only twice in 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> In a letter addressed to the Clerk of the Corporation of Port Pirie seeking his assistance, the secretary of the rifle club stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the 'Zoning' of the area and the fact that almost all of the land concerned is and has been subject to saltwater flooding, or inundation, we seek the support of the Corporation towards a revaluation of the property. We would have been prepared to accept a valuation of no more than $2,500. </PARA>
<PARA>Apparently the land consists, in part at least, of a tidal creek bed. The club felt that the $5,000 that the land had been valued by the Commonwealth valuer was twice the price it should have been. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that this is perhaps more a matter of revenue or at least of potential revenue forgone than actual expenditure. But I wonder whether I could be informed whether the Department of Administrative Services would be prepared to take into account the matters that were raised by both the Council and the rifle club with regard to the valuation, perhaps to ask the Commonwealth valuer to take these matters into account and to re-assess the price that is being asked for something that has been looked after and used by this club for over three decades. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Regarding the administration of the Department of Administrative Services, on 23 September the Treasurer (Mr Howard) issued a Press statement which stated, among other things:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been determined that Mr Costigan is not available. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement was made in the context that Mr Costigan was not available to conduct an inquiry into the disposal of a number of companies in which the principal shareholder was Mr Denis Horgan. On 14 October, in reply to a question in the House, the Treasurer said that it had been determined that Mr Costigan was available to conduct the inquiry in his capacity of Royal Commissioner which was, to say the least, somewhat in conflict with his Press statement of 23 September. But that is not the subject of my query. The Treasurer also said in reply to that question that Mr Costigan had been contacted by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman), the departmental head or some other officer of the Department. There was in the minds of many of us a good deal of confusion regarding just who was responsible for contacts with Mr Costigan, it having been previously announced, if I might interpolate, by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that Mr Costigan would be asked to conduct the inquiry. There was confusion as to whether the Attorney-General's Department was responsible for implementing that decision, whether the Treasurer, who had replied to one question and issued one Press statement, was responsible, or whether the Department of Administrative Services was responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> That was seen to have been clarified yesterday during the debate on the estimates of the Attorney-General's Department when it was stated that no correspondence or memos were on file in the Attorney-General's Department regarding this matter and that Attorney-General's believed that the Department of Administrative Services had handled the matter because, under administrative arrangements, that Department is responsible for dealing with royal commissioners. Therefore, the obvious assumption now seems to be that the only contact with Mr Costigan was made by the Department of Administrative Services. But of course on 14 October the Treasurer said that he believed it was made by the Minister, the departmental head or some other officer of the Department. The Treasurer has not yet seen fit to clarify which, if any, of those three people made the contact. That preamble leads me to ask: Assuming that what has been stated and the conclusions I have drawn from those statements are correct, who from the Department contacted Mr Costigan, in what way was the contact made and at what time was it made?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the Government Information Unit, which has been the subject of some discussion in the Senate in the past few weeks. It seems to me that information is slowly dribbling out about what the Government Information Unit really does. There was a suspicion for a long time that it was simply a publicly funded arm of the Liberal Party in at least part of its activities. Early in the year we learnt, through documents of the Liberal Party relating to the last Federal election, that the Government Information Unit had a significant role in the 1980 election campaign. Apart from carrying out a number of activities for the media, at least one of its officers, Mr Arnis Verbickis, was involved in what was described as ' a dirty tricks campaign' when he reported to his superiors at the Liberal Party Secretariat in Canberra on ways to distract producers of the Derryn Hinch show on 3AW to stop Ministers being put on a spot during interview programs on that station. Earlier this week I tabled in the Senate the minutes of the Tasmanian Liberal party campaign committee which was preparing the Tasmanian Liberal Party 's campaign for the State election which took place earlier this year. Those minutes revealed that Mr Montgomery, an officer of the Government Information Unit, was playing a role in the preparation of the Liberal Party's campaign for that State election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It really is pertinent to ask: What does the taxpayer, paying taxes to the Commonwealth, get out of a government information unit agency which is being used to support Liberal Party campaigns in State elections and, to a lesser extent in other ways, in Federal elections? Last year the cost of the Government Information Unit was $375,000. This year the cost of that unit has increased to $1.4m. More than half a million dollars is to be spent on setting up a new communications system for the Government Information Unit. Included in the expenditure this year is $300,000 for furniture and fittings and $228,000 for consultants. I ask the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) whether she will confirm these figures as being correct. The postage bill--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The postage bill will go up, as I understand it, almost fourfold from $40,000 to $150,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the Government Information Unit activities is production of a newsletter to defend or promote Government decisions. The cost of putting the newsletter into envelopes this year will be more than $67,000. Questions have already been asked in the course of the discussions on the estimates today about advertisements which will be funded by the taxpayer to promote decisions in relation to the last Budget. The cost of this campaign has been estimated and referred to by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle in her answers to questions earlier today. In connection with those advertisements a number of questions have been asked about whether they constitute electoral matter within the meaning of the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the Broadcasting and Television Act and ought to be authorised by a spokesperson for the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that in the State elections in Victoria earlier this year a number of Government television advertisements were sent to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal for adjudication on the question of whether they constituted electoral matter. The Broadcasting Tribunal decided that they did and should not be shown after the electronic media blackout period commenced. It was also said by the Tribunal that they should be authorised as election matter. Following that decision as to authorisation the Liberal Government in Victoria took the advertisements off the air. To the extent that they were election matter, they were quite long advertisements and were probably not productive-if anything could have been productive in the situation which that Government faced . We believe that to get access to the sum of money which has been referred to in discussions between Senator Walsh and Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle today the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) overrode his Minister for Finance, she being properly reluctant to release funds for the purpose until at least the Appropriation Bills had been passed by the Senate; that that sum should not be taken out of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the Government Information Unit there is one other so-called information unit, the information co-ordination group of the Department of Administrative Services. As I understand it, this is a new organisation and I would be grateful if the Minister could give some information about its role as a disseminator of information. I mention these matters just to re-illustrate a point that has been made in this place on a number of occasions, that the Liberal Party has a great penchant, if I might use that word, for getting taxpayers' money confused with Liberal Party money. That is something which should not be tolerated in any Parliament and should not be tolerated as continued conduct of this Government. There is ample evidence of its taking place and I raise the matter in order to ensure that the practice of confusing the money of hard-pressed Australian taxpayers with the funds of the Liberal Party should not continue further. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to register a protest at the failure of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) to respond to the questions which I asked about 10 minutes ago. More than a month ago the Government was asked, through the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in the House of Representatives, just what approach was made to Mr Costigan and by whom. Two days before that, on 12 October, a similar question was asked of Senator Sir John Carrick by me in the Senate and a question was asked again on Tuesday of this week. After all that the best response that the Minister can give us today is that the information will be gathered and supplied at some unspecified time in the future-perhaps, even after the Senate has gone into the summer recess.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw attention to the breathtaking imprecision of the Treasurer's answer to the question on 14 October. He said that he believed that Mr Costigan was contacted by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman), by the departmental head or by some other senior officer of the Department. The Senate is being asked to pass an appropriation which includes several million dollars for the administration of this Department. If this Department was not aware of the Treasurer's extraordinarily imprecise reply to that question on 14 October it should have been. If it was aware of the extraordinarily imprecise reply it should have told its own Minister, it should have told the Treasurer and it should have told the Minister for Finance who is representing the Treasurer who made that contact with Mr Costigan. Frankly, I believe that it is known who made the contact with Mr Costigan and that the Government will not say. </PARA>
<PARA> If that uncharitable interpretation or conclusion is rejected the alternative conclusion we are left with is that the Department of Administrative Services is grossly inefficient. It ought to be a matter of concern to the Senate that many millions of dollars are being appropriated for administration in that Department and that the taxpayers are not getting value for the money they are spending. This is a matter of very considerable importance. The question of Mr Horgan's involvement in tax evasion or, at the very least, in the sale of companies ' pregnant with profits', as the Treasurer dubbed them, to the Maher organisation and to the Wynyard organisation and the fact that he holds seven discretionary government positions were the subject of several Cabinet meetings. After all that, the best answer the Treasurer can give is: 'Oh, yes. Somebody contacted Mr Costigan. It was the Minister or it was the departmental head or it was somebody else in the Department'. That was the answer he gave a month ago today. Questions were asked before; questions have been asked since and the Minister implies that she cannot give an answer today. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask a slightly different question which is more in the nature of a background question. Was the Department of Administrative Services aware of the answer which the Treasurer gave on 14 October? If so, did that Department notify anybody in the Government as to what the precise position was as distinct from the breathtakingly vague reply from the Treasurer? If the correct and detailed information was supplied to somebody in the Government to whom was it supplied?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Department cannot supply the answer to that question the chamber ought not to pass its appropriation. But we have already given undertakings that that will not be done. It is of very considerable importance. I have stated already that it was the subject of several Cabinet meetings and a crisis in Government which extended for a full fortnight at least. The Government is engaged in a cover-up. When the Treasurer (Mr Howard) issued that statement on 23 September he engaged in an exercise aimed at deceiving the public. On 14 October he tried to bury the issue in confusion and imprecision. I might mention that already Press reports have been published which state that, in fact, Mr Costigan was available to do the inquiry . Indeed, the Press report in the National Times of 26 September implied that Mr Costigan was more than willing and was, indeed, eager to conduct the inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) had said that Mr Costigan would be asked to conduct the inquiry. I believe what then happened was that other members of the Government became extremely concerned because Mr Costigan was likely to do a very thorough job and would be likely to answer the crucial questions. Those crucial questions are: Was tax which would otherwise have been paid by Treamog Ltd and eight other companies of which we supplied details-no doubt there are others-not paid because they were disposed of in the way in which they were? Secondly, would Mr Horgan have been liable, as a vendor-shareholder, to repay the lion's share of that unpaid tax under the terms of the Bill originally introduced in the House on 23 September? Firstly, the Government decided that it would not have Mr Costigan. It made the mistake of asking Mr Costigan to head a royal commission. He came up with a lot of answers which the Government did not want and disgorged a lot of information which was acutely embarrassing to the Government and to influential people in the Liberal Party outside the Parliament . The first thing to do was to get Mr Costigan out of the inquiry. The next thing was to load the terms of reference in such a way that the critical questions that I have mentioned would not be answered. The critical questions were: Was tax that would otherwise have been paid not paid and, was Mr Horgan, as a vendor shareholder, liable under the Bill introduced originally on 23 September?</PARA>

It is a matter of very considerable importance as to who in the Department made the inquiries. If those questions cannot be answered when effectively they have been on notice for more than a month then the chamber should not pass the estimates for the Department which it is being asked to do.

I deliberately refrained from putting a written question on notice because that would not have appeared-even if I had done it now-until next Tuesday's Notice Paper. Senator Walsh has just pointed out that once a question is put on the Notice Paper, if the Government does not want to answer it the honourable senator concerned might have to wait for anything up to 12 months before getting an answer. Some questions have been on the Notice Paper that long. That is why I refrained from putting my question on the Notice Paper.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I mentioned three Ministers when I asked about the home base and the rotation of the home base, either once, twice, thrice or even four times a year. Could we also be provided with a full list, if the Minister is going to go into detail, as happened in the case of Mr Anthony's home loan? It has been falsely claimed many times in the Parliament that Labor Ministers availed themselves of certain things. We all know that those home loans were paid off. Let us have a complete resume and a complete answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I get back to the point of how many Ministers have rotated their home base. Very few, if any, backbenchers, would be engaged in rotating their home base. The Remuneration Tribunal, as I said, only mentions Ministers when referring to the home base. The home base has to be the Minister's principal place of residence. If the Government wants to include the back benchers, it can do so by all means. I would be of the view that all members of parliament get what they are entitled to and nothing more. If any member of parliament is trying to rip the taxpayers off he has to put up with his just desserts. We are all here to represent the taxpayers and to see that they get a fair go. It is well known that some senior Ministers are not of that view. The huge expenditure of taxpayers' money that is engaged in by Ministers is on the record. They seem to have no qualms at all in incurring enormous expense, such as flying by VIP aircraft. I pointed out the case involving Mr Sinclair-a 2 1/2 hour trip to Inverell at a cost to the taxpayer of nearly $1,800 and then a flight back to Sydney after the curfew, according to the answer given yesterday. I want to know whether Mr Sinclair got special dispensation for that. If we can get those answers it might save a lot of time. As the Minister would know, there are times in this Senate, particularly when we are dealing with Estimates, when it is like drawing wisdom teeth. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to persevere as I had to do 12 months ago in order to get the answer as to how much the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) owed on his home. We had a couple of hours debate before we finally got it. The Minister for Finance ( Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) who is at the table was here then. I am not blaming her for what happened. She was in charge of the Appropriation Bills at the time when we were debating the matter. The information could have been made available in five minutes; it was certainly documented. I even had the information; it had been given to me years ago. Although I was in possession of it, the Government tried to side-track me; it did not want to reveal the information. Since the information has been revealed, of course, we get repeated accusations by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Carrick-even again today he made the claim in answer to a question by my colleague Senator Walsh-that many Labor members of parliament were involved. Some of those Labor members who were mentioned were not members of parliament when they got the loans. They were private residents in Canberra and, as soon as they became members of parliament, they paid off their loans. But not Mr Anthony. He sees fit to keep his. I will have more to say about that matter when we get onto the estimates of the Department of the Capital Territory which is directly concerned with the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the consideration of the estimates for the Department of Defence, one of the first issues that was discussed by the Estimates Committee was what the Department of Defence had learned from the Falklands war, especially in relation to the effectiveness of Australia's present defence equipment and our future requirements. As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, I had been fortunate to receive a briefing from a British defence team, prior to the Estimates Committee hearing, on the major lessons from the war, such as the power of the Exocet A- type missiles and the ability of those ships that were struck by them to withstand fire damage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was certainly not unreasonable for Committee members to express interest in learning what lessons Australia had gained from the experiences in the Falklands . I do not believe that we received a satisfactory reply. It was an issue that was raised continually by a Government senator from Tasmania. It is a pity that he is not here this afternoon to raise the issue. I do not know whether it would have been possible but it certainly would have been to Australia's benefit if we had had observers from the Royal Australian Air Force, the Royal Australian Navy and the Army in the Falklands to report on the performance of some of the major defence show pieces of both Argentina and Great Britain. The availability of such first hand knowledge would have been invaluable for our defence strategists . </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that, some time ago, a Senate committee strongly stressed the fact that we should have defence attaches in parts of the world where conflicts are likely to break out. A Senate committee recommended that we have defence attaches positioned in the Middle East. Nothing has been done about that . The situation at the moment is that we have, I think, some 93 or 94 defence attaches throughout the United States but we do not have any in Damascus, Tel Aviv and the places where I believe they could do a very good job indeed. Also out of the Falklands war we discovered that the Australian Navy had been making a concerted effort to recruit British specialist officers and sailors particularly for submarine crews. As would be expected, the Falklands dispute has meant a severe blow to this recruitment campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the chamber are not terribly concerned that the Government will not purchase HMS Invincible. Whilst the proposed cost was supposed to make the purchase a bargain, we believe that the vessel possessed few of the requirements deemed neccessary by our Navy. The buying exercise in relation to the Invincible proved to be not only a waste of time but also a waste of a good deal of money. During the consideration of the estimates for the Department of Defence we were informed, following a question that I asked about the non- recoverable costs that Australia had so far been involved in concerning the purchase of HMS Invincible, that we had already spent money on the establishment of a project office in the United Kingdom, on overseas travel, including the assessment of HMS Invincible, and on the establishment of an office in Bath, England, as well as costs associated with the office of the Director General of Ships in the Ministry of Defence (Navy) and the initial operating costs of the project office. This came to a sum of approximately $200,000, which has now gone down the drain. </PARA>
<PARA> I now deal with another issue in the Department of Defence estimates-that is, patrol boats. For some years now the Government has been promising to supply additional patrol boats to make the outlying areas of the Australian coastline more secure. My Opposition colleagues from Western Australia in particular have become increasingly concerned at this Government's failure to build a patrol boat base in Western Australia and grant that State additional patrol boats. The Australian coastline is extremely vulnerable. We have long believed that the Government should give top priority to making some attempt to patrol it more effectively. Earlier this year the Minister for Defence deferred the purchase of five patrol boats. When I asked how many of these five patrol boats would now be purchased I was told that they had been deferred until 1985-86 and that, even then, it remained to be seen how many would be ultimately acquired. That is not a very encouraging response, I submit, on such a very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Some members of the Estimates Committee expressed concern about the ultimate cost to Australia of the 75 F18 Hornet aircraft. The contract which Australia entered into late last year has become increasingly complicated and more and more prone to price rises. Articles are appearing in the Press regularly suggesting that all is not well between the United States Navy, which is the major purchaser of the F18, and the supplier, McDonnell Douglas. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard an article from yesterday's Australian entitled 'F-18 bombs out in US Navy tests'. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>F-18 BOMBS OUT IN US NAVY TESTS</PARA>
<PARA>From PETER SAMUELin Washington</PARA>
<PARA> The US Navy's F-18 fighter plane-provisionally chosen by the RAAF as its new war-plane-has failed attack tests at sea and shown deficiencies serious enough to leave its future in doubt. </PARA>
<PARA> Many weeks of tests aboard the aircraft carrier USS Constellation have shown the F-18 seriously deficient in range, take-off ability, landing weight, fuel- carrying capacity, turnaround time and in escape systems. </PARA>
<PARA> The navy's prestigious Operational Test and Evaluation Force has recommended against certification of the plane for use in an attack role. </PARA>
<PARA> Since it is mediocre but very expensive when used as a fighter, non-use of the plane in the attack role will heavily undermine its whole rationale. </PARA>
<PARA> The Secretary for the Navy, Mr John Lehman, has repeatedly said the US Navy has adequate alternatives to the F-18 and is prepared to cut off the $40,000 million program. </PARA>
<PARA> The major argument in the F-18's favour is its ''swing'' capability, which means it can be switched from an attack role to a fighter role simply by being armed differently. </PARA>
<PARA> Three major Washington publications yesterday reported the failure of the F-18 in the carrier tests-Defence Week, Aviation Week and the Washington Times. </PARA>
<PARA> But there has as yet been no official response to these reports, despite promises of a statement by the Pentagon press office. </PARA>
<PARA> The stories in the three authoritative publications differ somewhat. </PARA>
<PARA> Defence Week said the carrier tests showed that as a bomber the F-18 was 110 sea miles short in range. </PARA>
<PARA> Naval officers described the plane's turnaround time-80 minutes-as ''terrible'' . By comparison the F-14 can be turned around, essentially rearmed and refueled, in 20 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> Aviation Week, published by McGraw-Hill, reported that the F-18 in its carrier tests proved a range of only 220 sea miles with two MK83 1000lb (4539kg) bombs and no external fuel tanks. In a similar mission the A-7E, an alternative attack plane, has a range of more than 400 sea miles. </PARA>
<PARA> Defence Week said the over-weight condition of the F-18 meant it required high winds across the carrier deck to take off. </PARA>
<PARA> Claims of a 575 sea mile range were made to Defence Week by defenders of the plane, but it was admitted these were achieved with the use of three external fuel tanks. </PARA>
<PARA> Commander of Naval Sea Systems, Admiral Ernest Seymour, is reported to have admitted recently: ''We thought we'd be able to fix it (the plane), but we have not been able to.''</PARA>
<PARA>By WILLIAM PINWILL</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence, Mr Sinclair, last night rejected the criticisms of the F-18 as not relevant to the latest production aircraft or not applicable to the land-based role in which the RAAF will use the fighter. </PARA>
<PARA> The US Navy report had also praised key features of the aircraft, he said. </PARA>
<PARA> In a statement to the Australian, Mr Sinclair said: ''The role of operational testing and evaluation is to critically assess the F-18 aircraft against the stated US Navy requirements irrespective of improvements planned or under development. </PARA>
<PARA> ''In this case, the aircraft used were not fully representative of production aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> ''The F-18 has performed up to expectation in the US Navy squadron at Lemoore Naval Air Station. </PARA>
<PARA> ''The report commented favourably on such aspects as the aircraft's capability for self-defence, reliability and maintainability.''</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One departmental officer who appeared before the Committee explained that this type of contractual problem was fairly common practice in the United States, where the Government demands a price reduction from suppliers as a matter of course. However, the Committee still feels that the Australian Government should make very sure that the arrangements entered into last year relating to cost, offset and Australian industry participation continue to be fair and equitable. The Committee in its report had this to say about the F18:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worth noting that the estimated $2,430m which Australia was expected to pay for 75 aircraft has already been significantly increased by the 20 per cent devaluation of the Australian dollar against the US dollar since August 1981. The Committee also wishes to point out that given that by 1983-84, projected spending on the FA18s will almost equal the total spent on all new defence equipment in 1981-82, it is obvious that the cost of FA18 procurement between 1983-84 and 1989-90 will place great strains on the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>Virtual doubling of the proportion allocated to capital equipment would achieve the 25 per cent goal set by the Government in early 1980. Whether the goal is feasible might be a matter for examination at future Committee hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue on which I might make some remarks regarding the Department of Defence is the VIP Boeing 707 fleet. It has been revealed during the Estimates committee meetings over the past few years that the Australian Government has paid excessive amounts of money to have the 707 pilots trained on 707 simulators in Hong Kong. The reason they have to go to Hong Kong for this training is that no airline, with I think the exception of Air Niugini, operates commercial 707s into Australia at the moment, with the result that we do not have the appropriate equipment. The nearest equipment suitable for the training of the pilots happens to be in Hong Kong. During the Estimates Committee hearing it was revealed that $216,000 was spent in the previous year for overseas training, $66 ,000 was spent on simulator training and $150,000 was spent on travel expenses. </PARA>
<PARA> I have raised in the chamber for many years why it is that we are continuing to use these 707s when smaller planes, such as the BAC111s, would fulfil the same function at a much cheaper cost. I have pointed out here in successive years that if it is good enough for the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) to be able to take a BAC111 from Australia to the Middle East and back we should be able to modify the planes we have at the moment and do away with the expensive 707s. The editorial that appeared in the Australian of 4 August 1982 gives a very good idea of how the Australian feels about the VIP fleet. The editorial contained these words:</PARA>
<PARA> The cost of salaries and allowances for the PM's staff has jumped by almost 50 per cent in the past year, to $759,025 a year . . . Cabinet costs have also risen sharply, as have the costs of staffs of other Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial continued:</PARA>
<PARA> These costs do not include the ludicrously expensive VIP fleet of aircraft, which stand by on the tarmac at Fairbairn to whisk Ministers away to lunches in Sydney and Melbourne where RAAF pilots have to await their masters' pleasures. Countries in a much better financial state than Australia make their politicians travel on commercial jets. Why not Australian Ministers? Mr Fraser is fond of lecturing others on how they should tighten their belts. He should set an example in his own office. </PARA>
<PARA>The 707s are being phased out all over the world and it appears that Cathay Pacific will shortly close down its simulator in Hong Kong. During the Estimates committee hearings I inquired about where in future pilots will receive the training which they now do in Hong Kong. I was informed that a decision will have to be made on how the VIP pilots will receive their training in future and that one of the more likely alternatives would be to acquire a simulator at an economic price. It would be interesting to learn just how much the equipment is likely to cost Australia. </PARA>

The function of the 707 is to provide a freighting and transport capacity for the Royal Australian Air Force which, if one happened to look at the manifest of the aircraft and their utilisation on an annual basis, would become very clear. They provide a capability for the Air Force that is absolutely essential. I am pleased to see that two more of them are to be bought. Those aircraft will be used in an air refuelling mode. It just happens that we do not have simulators in this country. The proposition that we get rid of those 707s is very wrong for Australia. I hope that, instead of buying another two, we can buy another four so that we will get both an effective freighting component and an air refuelling capability.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague Senator Mulvihill, who served on the Estimates Committee D with me, is away from the Senate ill today. He asked me to raise one issue. It concerns the fact that we have been using Singapore facilities for sandblasting and the painting of certain Royal Australian Navy vessels. Senator Mulvihill is concerned about that. He mentioned in a letter to one of the unions concerned that the Government used the magical term 'preventative maintenance'. He said that he thought that the increasing use of facilities of this type could be the thin end of the wedge. Senator Mulvihill , when dealing with this matter in May of this year, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This morning when I read page 7 of the Sydney Daily Telegraph I was stunned to discover that a Singaporean firm called Autoblast Singapore Pty Ltd has a contract to indulge in certain sandblasting and painting of several Australian Navy craft. The contract involves HMAS Stalwart, and I understand the same treatment is to be given to HMAS Stuart, HMAS Parramatta and HMAS Brisbane. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the point raised by Senator Sibraa on behalf of Senator Mulvihill-we wish him all the best-I would need to refer that matter to the Department of Defence and obtain a reply. However, I understand that generally the work done in Singapore in respect of sandblasting is a relatively small amount of work on vessels that happen to be visiting the area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the first point raised by Senator Sibraa in relation to F18 aircraft, I repeat the answer I gave in this place to a question asked by Senator Robert Ray yesterday in connection with the different kinds of uses to which F18s are put. I point out again that the United States Navy was commenting upon the use of the F18 in a mode related to the use of aircraft carriers, which is substantially different from that to which the Royal Australian Air Force intends to put the F18 as a land-based aircraft. It is for those reasons, whilst our attention has been drawn to the problems relating to the United States Navy operations, that clearly we will need to take other considerations into account in our assessment of the aeroplane. I can cite some further information from the Estimates Hansard of 9 September 1982. Apparently the amount spent in respect of sand blasting was of the order of $100,000. Of that sum, $75,000 was to remedy urgent defects which could not be held over until the vessels returned to Australia. That work related to safety, seaworthiness and fighting capability defects which had to be repaired while the ship was away from Australia. A further $25,000 was provided for preventative maintenance, which again was declared essential by the fleet commander at the time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter I wish to raise under the votes for the Department of Defence Support relates particularly to the expensive inquiry conducted by this Government into the sale of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory following a decision of the so-called Review of Commonwealth Functions in April 1981, and the decision of that inquiry that the factory should be sold. Of course, I am aware that more recently, when an election was thought to be in the offing, the Government abandoned its great principle about selling that factory. It has now announced that Government ownership of the factory will continue. Of course, that is not anything but a glib political solution to the problem of that establishment. During the course of the Senate Select Committee inquiry on the Government Clothing and Ordnance Factories a number of suggestions were made by the Committee, particularly in the minority report, regarding the administration of the factory, the accounting arrangements of the factory, the orders which were made available to the factory by the Department of Defence and the methods of defence procurement. Suggestions were made about the level of so-called commercial work which the factory might be able to attract in the heavy engineering field to support and reduce the loss to the Government of keeping that factory in business.</PARA></TALK.START>

Insofar as I believe it to be relevant I also ask the same question in relation to the level of orders from the Department of Defence to the Commonwealth Clothing Factory at Coburg, having regard to the fact that in connection with the clothing factory the Department of Defence in its submission to the Senate inquiry specifically recommended its retention and apparently thought that it was a worthwhile establishment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend to honourable senators and the public a publication entitled Tasmania 'The Squeeze'. This document has been compiled by a group of Tasmanians who are extremely concerned about the severe deterioration of the economic structure of my State and, with that deterioration, the putting into jeopardy of the livelihoods of many Tasmanians and, consequently, the whole way of life which has characterised Tasmania for so many years. The ever- quickening pace of that economic deterioration under the twin impacts of the policies of the Federal Government and the international recession becomes more evident day by day. This ever-quickening pace brings to the average Tasmanian a sense of foreboding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One reads in the newspapers today that Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd, which operates a paper and timber mill at Burnie and, indeed, is the foundation for the prosperity of that town and much of the north-west coast of Tasmania, has announced that it will close the pine sawmill with a further loss of 60 jobs . I say 'a further loss' because that announcement comes only two days before 190 people finish work at the East Mill of the paper production section which closes tomorrow. Consequently, this affects the log haulers who supply the timber to that enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, that is the type of thing Tasmanians read day by day. For that reason , it is important that there be a constructive and positive approach based on a sound and well thought out analysis of the Tasmanian economy. The theme of this publication which comes from a group which calls itself the Social Wage Group is that there is great inherent strength in the Tasmanian economy. That wealth is represented by the great mineral areas of the west coast of Tasmania which would be well known to honourable senators, the tremendous timber resources in the State, the agricultural productivity and the enterprise of those involved in agriculture and, dare I say it, the abundant supplies of electricity based on our great water resources and the skills and flair of Tasmanians. It is interesting to read-this may not be as well known to honourable senators-that the opium poppy industry is a very prosperous new industry for Tasmania. One reads in the Press of this week that there is a secure future for the island's 700 poppy growers, a guaranteed world market with competitive prices under the umbrella of various companies including Johnson and Johnson Pty Ltd. The season' s poppy crop is estimated to involve $5m in earnings to Tasmanian farmers, Tasmania being the only State in Australia where poppy cultivation is permitted for the production of opiate alkaloids. In fact they are grown in the fields around my own small block where I live on the north-west coast. In fact they have been grown on my property. </PARA>
<PARA> So there is an inherent strength in the Tasmanian economy, but the fact is that along with that inherent strength is a great dependence for many of the key agricultural and industrial development decisions on people and organisations outside Tasmania. That is not altogether a bad thing and of course one does not advocate that Tasmania be somehow closed off from the benefits which can accrue from investment decisions of those outside Tasmania to put money into a Tasmanian venture. But this dependence on outsiders for decision making creates a situation in which Tasmanians feel, with some justification, that decisions are taken without regard to the impact on the communities which are so fragile and so dependent on perhaps just one particular industry on which a town or a small regional area is based. One has a clear example of that with the closure of the Geeveston pulp mill some days ago where I think-Senator Harradine can indicate whether this is the case-some 350 workers found themselves without employment and without the proper notice and regard for their rights and future which one would have hoped would have characterised an employer with a more sensitive appreciation of its obligations to a Tasmanian work force which had been extremely loyal and efficient in co-operation with the capital put in by that company for the development of that enterprise. Tasmanians are experiencing a decline in economic activity which has come about not only as a result of the decisions of companies and corporations based outside Tasmania but also, it also has to be said, because of decisions by the Federal Government, which has not made sufficient contribution to the real level of moneys available to Tasmania for its public and community resources and activities. One thinks of hospitals, the education sector or, most spectacularly, the area of housing. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be out of order for me to go into definitive solutions to the difficulties facing the Tasmanian people. I think the desire of Tasmanians to take control of as much of the investment decision making taking place in regard to the State as is possible can be well understood. Not only is there that desire but also there is a desire for a marshalling of the wealth and funds which arise out of Tasmania but which at the moment can be syphoned off by banks , insurance companies and non-Tasmanian corporations for investment other than in Tasmania. The means that have been suggested in recent weeks, including a detailed proposal by the Tasmanian Leader of the Opposition, Mr Ken Wriedt, include a State development corporation and a State bank to marshal and invest those funds. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, it is not my purpose tonight, nor indeed is it the purpose of the writers of this pamphlet, to proffer definitive solutions, but there is a recognition that when those solutions emerge they can only be based on a sound analysis of Tasmania's economic structure. I believe that this pamphlet, 'The Squeeze', is indeed a step in pursuit of that analysis. It is easily readable. It is to be distributed at a cost of 60c, and that itself is an indication of how importantly the Social Wage Committee regards the distribution of this pamphlet in order that as many Tasmanians as possible come to an understanding of the situation of the State and therefore are able to engage in a process of discussion about its future. It is an encouraging sign that something as positive as this pamphlet should be brought into the public debate about Tasmania's future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Social Wage Committee consists of a range of people whom I will not name because they would not want to be particularly singled out. However, representatives of unions and community organisations, having held a seminar in Tasmania during June on the social wage concept, felt that they could make a good contribution by putting such a pamphlet together. They have done a considerable amount of work in order to ensure that their intitial hope is fulfilled in as short a time as possible. They have produced a pamphlet which I am sure will get the wide distribution which its contents deserve. I commend it to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; My reason for rising during the adjournment debate is altogether different from that of the last speaker. Of course, the question of employment has been the subject of a great many debates in the Senate. More importantly, it has been the subject of a great deal of consideration elsewhere. It appears Australia is not going to have an early election this year because of the bad back of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I would have thought, frankly, if I am not out of order in saying so, that the Prime Minister would show a great deal of statesmanship if he were to announce within the next week or so that he intends to give away his undoubted advantage of calling a double dissolution before 26 May 1983 and will allow the Parliament to run its full term until December 1983 come what may. That would then challenge the mettle on the Prime Minister and everybody else in the community. He could then say: 'I have given away this advantage. I ask everybody to focus his attention on the social and economic ills which beset this country. ' The Government could then put forward its own views on how these economic and social ills can be overcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Employers also would be put on their mettle-as to whether, even if interest rates do come down, they will employ more labour or will install more technology . I think it behoves the Government to consider whether the investment allowance in fact is inhibiting the employment of labour. One should really question very seriously the installation of new technology in industries which do not have to compete on the international market. The unions would also need to consider, as central to their wage fixing policy, the preservation of jobs. I believe that a consensus along those lines would lead the country towards a recovery. At another time-I know that I would probably be out of order if I did so now-I shall proceed with an analysis of the current situation and my suggestions for, as it were, a community-led recovery, with leadership, as well, from the Prime Minister down. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I want to raise, however, has nothing to do with that. I notified the President's office that I would be speaking about it on the adjournment and I have notified the office of the appropriate Minister, the Minister for Communications (Mr N. A. Brown). Today, outside of parliament in Sydney there was a very ugly demonstration. That demonstration was encouraged by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. It was mounted by a pro-abortion group, whose telephone number was freely given out early this morning over 2CN and 2JJJ in Sydney by an announcer who made no secret of his pro-abortion views. The news media have carried views of the demonstration today in their evening bulletins. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is that a pro-life group had decided to meet in front of Parliament House for the purpose of supporting a motion that was before the Parliament in respect of a pro-life issue. It would have been expected that that meeting would have been peaceful and it was not anticipated that it would be very large, since the pro-life group concerned had not marshalled the forces that were available to it but was simply there to make a point known both to parliamentarians and to those who would listen. </PARA>
<PARA> Early this morning, over 2JJJ which, incidentally, comes to Canberra through 2CN, the disc jockey, or whatever he is, whose name I have-he gave his name at that time-and whose pro-abortion views were certainly not hidden, indicated that those who wanted to turn up at a counter, pro-abortion rally should ring a certain person, whose number the announcer gave. This was all done at your expense, Mr Deputy President, and my expense, over the public airways of the public broadcasting media. I want to know what the Government and the ABC propose to do about that. What action will the ABC take against that sort of incitement to counter demonstration by a disc jockey employed by the ABC, which, in turn, receives its money through vote of the Parliament?</PARA>
<PARA> I need not say anything more. I have further details, but I am sure that they will be available in the ABC. The ABC knows precisely what went on. All that I want to know is what action it will take. I appreciate that the Minister at the table the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), is probably totally unaware of this matter, but I would be interested to know by this time next week what action the ABC has taken. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will briefly respond to the matters raised in the adjournment debate by Senator Tate and Senator Harradine. I wish to acknowledge the measured tone in which Senator Tate addressed the subject of the Tasmanian economy. I agree with him that one of the prerequisites of finding a suitable course of action is to have a careful analysis of the situation. I note the strengths of the Tasmanian economy which he listed and the concerns which he expressed. I agree with him that it is a matter of some complexity which does require analysis. I would quarrel with his comments towards the end of his speech when he referred to decisions of the Federal Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not in a position to give chapter and verse on this subject on the adjournment, but I think any fair-minded person, and I think Senator Tate is that, would acknowledge that there has been considerable attention to the economic situation of Tasmania. Of course in the transport field a lot of action has been taken to try to reduce the relative difficulties faced by Tasmania because it is an island. In terms of investment of Commonwealth money and placement of Commonwealth facilities there has been clear recognition following the Callaghan Inquiry into the Structure of Industry and the Employment Situation in Tasmania of the need to do things which perhaps historically were not done in Tasmania. I refer to the placement of institutions and to ensuring that an adequate share of funding goes to that island State. I was particularly conscious of this because I cam- paigned with Mr Hodgman in his electorate. He had a pamphlet which was headed '50 million reasons why you should vote for Hodgman'. It related to the $50m invested in his electorate of Denison during his term of office. That may be a fairly broad way of demonstrating the point I am making. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to Senator Tate I suggest that there has been a high degree of recognition on the part of the Federal Government of the difficulties suffered by Tasmania. As a result, particular policies have been directed in that respect . In addition to suggesting to Senator Tate that he might make sure that the pamphlet to which he has referred is in the hands of Government representatives of Tasmania as well as Opposition representatives, if the Social Wage Committee has not already done so, I will request either the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) or the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman), both of whom represent Tasmania in the House of Representatives, to provide some information to Senator Tate on the various measures which have been taken to provide adequately for Tasmania. I do not suggest that they would be provided on the basis that nothing more needed to be done. I think it is common ground around the place that there are considerable economic difficulties for the world , for Australia and for Tasmania. I would welcome attempts at analysis of the sort which Senator Tate has said is proceeding in Tasmania. I also welcome Senator Harradine's suggestion that he will at a later time set down his views on what action can be taken. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My point really is that I do not think anybody, whether the Government, the Treasury or whatever, has a monopoly of wisdom in this area.We can look around the world to see the different approaches adopted in other countries. For example, France changed its economic approach recently to some negative effect to some positive effect. It is quite clear there are no panaceas available and we should be prepared to both analyse and seek better solutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the other point raised by Senator Harradine is concerned, I must say that I did not hear any of the broadcast to which he referred. I have no advice from the Minister for Communications (Mr N. A. Brown). I can understand Senator Harradine's concern that a publicly funded body should adopt a partisan and, effectively, an advertising viewpoint, in that situation-if that is in fact what occurred. On Senator Harradine's description it does not sound a very satisfactory course of conduct. I have little doubt that soon we will be vigorously debating the Government's legislation on the Australian Broadcasting Commission. People will be alleging how horrific it is that we should have any mechanism to check bias in that exalted organisation. Perhaps some of these comments on the adjournment will be recalled during the consideration of that legislation. I must not get involved in that debate now. I will seek a response from the Minister for Communications with respect to the inquiry raised by Senator Harradine. I note that Senator Harradine would like that response within a week, if possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Discussions have been held between Commonwealth and State officials concerning the conditions which might be attached to a transfer of control of the Monte Bello Islands. Proposals by State authorities for management of the islands are currently being considered by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Revocation of the Commonwealth declaration under the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952, which controls public access to the islands and their waters will be considered as soon as agreement is reached between the Commonwealth and State on the management plans referred to in (1).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In 1962, 1968 and 1972 radiological surveys of the Islands were made for the Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee. In 1978, a further radiological survey was undertaken on behalf of the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council (AIRAC) whose subsequent report, AIRAC Report No. 5 ''Radiological Safety and Future Land Use in the Monte Bello Islands'', dated August 1979, was tabled in Parliament. This report, which is the prime reference point for Commonwealth/State consultations on questions of radiological safety and land use in the Monte Bello Islands, addresses the several questions raised. AIRAC has been requested to update its 1978 survey and a further radiological survey of the Monte Bello Islands will be carried out in 1982-83.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Naval Officer Commanding, West Australia Area (NOCWA) is responsible for the control of access to the gazetted Prohibited Area surrounding the Islands and their waters. For some time now, NOCWA has granted access approval on a case-by-case basis for recreational visits to specified areas within the Prohibited Area. These approvals however, do not extend into designated areas in the vicinity of ground zeros on Alpha and Trimouille Islands and adjacent waters . Persons seeking access to the Monte Bello Islands or adjacent waters should contact the Naval Officer Commanding, West Australia Area, PO Box 228, Rockingham, WA 6168.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Australian livestock showing clinical signs suggestive of mucosal disease may be affected by any of several important exotic or endemic diseases. Their accurate differential diagnosis requires a range of diagnostic tests which can only be carried out reliably in a specialised laboratory. It is unlikely that makeshift facilities would have the necessary specialised equipment operating efficiently and effectively to undertake a truly satisfactory diagnosis.</PARA>
<PARA> It would be possible to safely perform a number of tests and attempt to isolate viruses near the affected stock without the aid of imported viruses.</PARA>
<PARA> The results obtained under such conditions are likely to be affected by the vagaries of climate and weather and temporary equipment and would not carry the accuracy or reliability of a diagnosis carried out in a laboratory under controlled environmental conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> The range of tests that could be used under such circumstances would be limited and this would have a bearing on the accuracy of the diagnosis.</PARA>
<PARA> Any such testing, virus isolation and diagnosis would need to be undertaken by experienced personnel. It would be quicker and more reliable to transport samples to a permanent and secure laboratory, to enable the full range of diagnostic tests to be undertaken, than to transport facilities and personnel to the site of affected stock.</PARA>
<PARA> Results, particularly negative results, obtained under makeshift conditions as proposed, would lack international credibility.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Immuno-assay tests can be conducted using antisera supplied by overseas laboratories. These antisera would first need to be treated and tested to ensure that they contained no exotic disease contaminants.</PARA>
<PARA> Quarantine, slaughter and disinfection are the recognised means to combat foot and mouth disease and this is unequivocally the firmly approved first policy for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the use of vaccines cannot be disregarded in the event that an outbreak becomes wide-spread or cannot be controlled by conventional means. Vaccination must be considered as an important but secondary control option. Slaughter and disposal of affected herds would continue but vaccination could provide the breathing space to enable slaughter and disposal to overtake spread.</PARA>
<PARA> If vaccines have to be used it is preferable and safer for them to be manufactured in Australia. The timely supply of safe and effective vaccines from overseas presents problems as large quantities could be required. Additionally, the importation of vaccines from some countries can be a quarantine risk as they may be contaminated by other exotic animal pathogens.</PARA>
<PARA> The process of developing vaccine seeds and substrates for manufacture and scaling-up to production is time-consuming. It is too late to leave this until an exotice disease outbreak has occurred. Developmental work should commence in advance of an outbreak to ensure vaccines are safe and effective by testing their immunity with live virus challenge.</PARA>
<PARA> Live foot and mouth disease virus would also be used for research purposes and for training of laboratory and field staff in the diagnosis of foot and mouth disease. Research that has already been done extensively overseas would not be repeated at ANAHL.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has only a small number of veterinarians well trained in the clinical recognition and laboratory diagnosis of exotic diseases. A small number of veterinarians have participated in outbreaks of exotic diseases in overseas countries. Although this is the best form of training, it has to be restricted to small numbers of key people.</PARA>
<PARA> No final decision has been made to import live foot and mouth disease virus. This is still dependent upon security checking of ANAHL after the laboratory is completed, continuing consultation with industry and consideration by the Government of new technological developments in this area.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir John Carrick</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 27 October 1983 (Hansard, page 1851) Senator Robertson asked me a question without notice regarding the proposed rehabilitation of the Rum Jungle area, and whether water in the Finniss River will be suitable for stock, agriculture and horticulture when the rehabilitation program has been completed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I undertook to obtain further advice and my answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has agreed with the broad objectives of a rehabilitation program proposed by the Northern Territory Government subject to satisfactory arrangements and procedures being agreed between the two Governments. The Northern Territory estimates the proposed program of works to cost $16.2m in June 1982 prices over four financial years, which is comparable with the Commonwealth's earlier estimate of $12.1m based on 1980 prices. An amount of $ 800,000 has been appropriated in 1982-83 for commencement of works.</PARA>
<PARA> Following completion of rehabilitation works, water quality in the Finnis River will be suitable for stock, agriculture and horticulture use. However, in the east branch of the Finniss River which does not flow continuously throughout the year, some natural deterioration of water quality will occur during the dry season as happens in other intermittent streams in the Northern Territory. Thus at the end of the dry season, any remaining water in pools in the east branch may not be suitable for all purposes.</PARA>
