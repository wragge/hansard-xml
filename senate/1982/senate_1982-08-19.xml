<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator GIETZELT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to the principal article in the Sydney Morning Herald last Saturday headed 'Secret talks as Liberals split on tax' and to today's article in the Melbourne Age suggesting that former employees of the Prime Minister are involved in lobbying with respect to tax avoidance. I ask: Is it true that threats have been made that funds will be withheld from the Liberal Party if certain tax avoidance legislation goes ahead? If so, does this conflict with repeated claims by Liberal Party Ministers, including Senator Sir John Carrick, here and elsewhere that there is no connection between funding for the Liberal Party and Government policy and that there is no access for Liberal Party donors to Government members? Having regard to the different attitude taken by the New South Wales Liberal Party about public funding, I ask: Will the Government now accept the arguments put forward by the Australian Labor Party and me in this place on the question of election funding to guarantee complete propriety in the matter of the funding of elections?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I may take the second part of the question first, there is no suggestion that those who accept public funding, for example, the Wran Government, will not supplement that public funding by private contributions. Public funding in no way delimits the rights of political parties to receive moneys from individuals. I see no connection at all. I know of no threats at all by anybody with regard to the withholding of donations. I can only refer to the principles as I have known them and applied them over the years-and I believe them to be applied; that is, that in the Liberal Party any raising of funds is done by finance committees, which do not include members of parliament-</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know of no secret talks. I am aware that there are some who have said that the prospective legislation and approach to the collection of tax from what are called wet Slutzkin schemes-the wet, or wetter, bottom-of-the-harbour schemes-is wrong and should not be pursued. The legislation will be before the Parliament, including the Senate. It will be for honourable senators to look at its details and see whether it is equitable. I fully understand that there are campaigns which suggest that our attempts will embody retrospectivity and that retrospectivity is bad. That is a matter for judgment when the legislation comes before the Senate. There are people who are alleging that what we are proposing to do cuts across the principle of retrospectivity but I know of no secret talks in that matter; I know of no threats. I want to make it abundantly clear that no one will threaten with impunity any section of the Liberal Party; that no one will use the device of giving to, or withholding funds from, that political party in return for any favour.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I said was that I know of no such threats. For example, I am aware of threats being made in a previous Federal election campaign to the Federal branch of the Australian Labor Party by major left-wing trade unions that they would withhold funds unless the Labor Party did certain things. I have read of those threats and they have never been denied. I have said that I know of no such threats and that any threat that would be made would have no capacity to be implemented because, unlike the Labor Party-which is so susceptible to pressures from its big trade unions-there is within the Liberal Party no connection between the giving of money and any implementation of policies.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TITLE>ENERGY RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION GRANTS: WIND GENERATION</TITLE>
<QUESTION PAGE="280" SPEAKER="Collard Sen S.J." NAMEID="C67" PARTY="NP" ELECTORATE="QLD" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="C67">Senator COLLARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for National Development and Energy to his Press statement of 18 August 1982 indicating that in 1982-83 amounts of money will be provided for energy research, development and demonstration grants. I also draw to his attention information that I provided to him on a self-starting aerofoil section wind generator which is being developed by Solar and Allied Power in Caloundra, Queensland. I have visited the company's small factory there . The use of this aerofoil section for wind generation is a completely new concept. I ask: Can the Minister advise whether this sort of work would be considered for favourable treatment by his Department in the awarding of these grants?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="280" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon Sir J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Any suggestion or technical device that can add to the capacity for renewable energy sources, be it solar, wind or biomass, must be examined carefully by the Government because the non-renewables, as their name suggests, have a limited term of life. I have been very interested in the suggestions made by Senator Collard in the past and have asked my Department to have a look at them. Basically, the proposals that he mentions address technically interesting areas in relation to the use of renewable energy resources. The first proposes a method of overcoming the starting problems at low wind speed, which are associated with some wind generators. It is a vital concept and, if there is a breakthrough on it, that will be important. The second concept relates to storing solar energy and the third to the efficient conversion of direct current to alternating current. They concern three frontier kinds of problems in this field. The third concept is necessary when using solar collectors such as photo-voltaic cells if the energy is to be used for standard appliances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because the proposals embrace technical matters the information provided has been forwarded to the relevant National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council technical standing committee for evaluation and comment. I stress that the Government welcomes any device that will add to the ability of renewable energy sources to increase their efficiency. On the face of it, the device referred to by Senator Collard is an attractive proposal.</PARA>

Has the Minister's attention been drawn to an article in the Sunday Mail of 15 August 1982 which describes Queensland as the nation's company tax haven?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I have not seen the particular article in the Sunday Mail relating to Queensland, but I think we have had a fair amount of discussion on what is occurring with regard to tax avoidance schemes in any State of Australia. The matters that were outlined by me yesterday in the Senate 's debate on a matter of public importance and that were outlined in the other place the day before illustrated the list of legislation which has been introduced and passed, or contemplated. Also many statements have been made relating to stamping out tax avoidance or evasion to the greatest degree possible. I will have the Treasurer look at the article referred to by Senator Colston and see whether he wishes to make any further comment on the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Education. I am sure he will be aware of the extent to which our Aboriginal community has been disadvantaged by a lack of educational opportunities. Is the Minister aware also of the significant increase in the costs incurred by hostels that accommodate Aboriginal students? If so, what steps have been taken by the Government to help meet these additional costs? In particular, what additional benefits can Aboriginal students hope to receive?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="281" SPEAKER="Baume Sen The Hon P.E." NAMEID="ME4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="EDUCATION" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will be aware of the role which Senator Bonner has played in regard to Aboriginal hostels over a number of years, and I think continuously since Aboriginal Hostels Ltd was formed to provide hostel places for Aboriginals across Australia. I welcome his question, although it goes really to hostels provided specifically in association with schools. It was possible to announce in the Budget increases in Aboriginal secondary grants allowances for students and also increases in the boarding allowances, so that straight away a greater amount of money will be provided for boarding support for Aboriginals who have to be away from home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But there is a particular matter which we have been able to pick up in the Budget to the benefit of Aboriginal Australians. A number of hostels in country towns have been the sole source of boarding for Aboriginal students. Because some of these hostels were not associated with a school, in a physical sense, they did not qualify as school boarding houses. The Government has decided that they will now so qualify and the boarding allowance will be paid to Aboriginal students in certain approved hostels, even if they are situated slightly away from the schools. It does represent an increased capacity for Aboriginal people to obtain the secondary education which all Australians would like to see made available to them, for very obvious educational reasons.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. In order for it to receive an adequate reply it ought also to be responded to by the Leader of the Opposition. I leave it to you, Mr President, to say whether that kind of response is possible. The subject of the question is the new and permanent Parliament House, which I visited with some of my colleagues earlier this week. To be actually on the site brings home much more forcibly than the plans ever could the truly monumental nature of the extravagance and financial overkill being perpetrated on Capital Hill. I ask the Leader of the Government initially: Is it a fact that the estimated cost of the new and permanent Parliament House has already well over doubled from the figure of $151m when the project was announced in 1978 to $370m in March this year? Is it likely that the cost on present plans, if they are persisted with, may well reach $1 billion before the project is completed? In view of the grave shortage of public housing in Australia and the necessity for tens of thousands of age pensioners to live in conditions inferior to those in many of our prisons-I have seen them in Sydney; it is a fact-how can the Government and, for that matter, the Australian Labor Party stomach the extent of spending being lavished on this edifice? Since the building is well commenced, it would be naive to suggest that it be abandoned at this stage. However, I ask whether a genuine effort can be made now--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My clear understanding is that at all stages, from the original decision on the site and the building, the determination to build Parliament House has been totally bipartisan in both chambers of this Parliament . Therefore, it is a quite extraordinary situation that Senator Mason should ask this question today-it is not extraordinary that the Australian Democrats should be changing policy-the Democrats having in fact let it be known by their actions of the past that they accepted the bipartisan situation. It is doubly extraordinary because at all times the provisions have been available for the Democrats to go to the various authorities and state their views. Why is it that the Democrats, if they think that the plans are wrong, have not been to the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House? Why is it that years have gone by and they have suddenly discovered, because they went to the site the other day, the layout of the Parliament House? Are not the people who are recreant to their duty the very people who are now raising this matter? Why have they not been to the Standing Committee? I invite them to go to it. I invite them to go to their peers, members of both Houses, and explain to them why they have not inspected the plans before, why they have not come before their peers and told them their views before, and why each time the amount for the new Parliament House has been tabled in Parliament they have not risen in their places to dispute it in any way. It is extraordinary that with the fear of elections in their minds they are suddenly grabbing for things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With the fear of elections in the Democrats' minds-Senator Reid and Senator Ryan may have some acute sensitivities about this-I hope that their views on this matter are made known to every elector in the Australian Capital Territory, because the Australian Capital Territory has as the basis for its building construction industry at present the construction of the new Parliament House. I take it that the purpose of this question is to reduce the amount of work that is available. Incidentally, the management, the cost control and the quality control exercised by Sir Bernard Callinan and his committee make this one of the most tightly controlled and highly efficient undertakings in Australia today. I also pay tribute to the quality and the progress of the work that has been done on the site. I invite honourable senators to go there and see the progress that has been made.</PARA>
<PARA> Some honourable senators may know that I originally opposed the building of the new Parliament House, but I have come to accept that it is not only necessary but also a wonderful concept of imaginative creation and efficiency. I want to pay tribute to all those who are associated with this undertaking. I spoke to the Authority the other day, and my understanding is that the cost control is very good. Let me repeat that anyone who, in the past year, had reservations about this matter had recourse to the Presiding Officers, the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House and Cabinet Ministers to express his views . Senator Mason has not done so and his comments today can be judged for what they are-that is, running scared and looking for cheap issues, which will backfire, and nowhere more loudly than in the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Construction. In view of the Government's undertaking to provide $3,650m for roads over a five-year period to 1984-85 and the additional undertaking given in the Treasurer's Budget Speech to set up an Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program which will make a further $2, 500m available for roads by 1988-89, can the Minister state whether the road building programs which will ensue will be developed in close consultation with the Department of Defence? Is the Minister aware that many of the new roads which are being built as part of the national highway program and State and local government road programs are of insufficient design specifications to meet the requirements of Australia's defence forces, especially in the remote north and north-west of Western Australia? Can the Minister assure the Senate that the Department of Defence will consult with the road building authorities in all three levels of government to ensure that this weakness in our defence preparedness is quickly and effectively eradicated?</PARA></TALK.START>

I am not particularly aware that many of the new roads under the national highway program are of insufficient design specification to meet the requirements of Australia's defence forces. In fact a defence officer was a member of the Commonwealth-State joint study group which examined the Broome-Darwin road link recently. The Department of Defence made a definite input into the standards for that road and accepted the standard that was eventually agreed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not surprising, with a Budget that did so much for families and for Australians generally, that particular items may not have been publicised. I take it that the point of the honourable senator's question is that there is a group of beneficiaries for whom this information is important. I agree with the honourable senator that there is not much point in increasing benefits for secondary, tertiary or post-graduate students, particularly since the increases are significant, unless they know about them and know how to apply for them and use them at the appropriate time. We, accordingly, will be quite active on campus, for example, to make sure that through the student Press students at least will know what the Government is offering and will know the details of a proposed student loans scheme, which will be an option in addition to the student assistance schemes which have been announced. It is important that the information on post-graduate awards be passed on because they were introduced as a result of representations from post-graduate groups and the order of the increase is sufficient to make these awards most attractive once again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In order that proper communication did take place it was possible to meet the peak groups associated with tertiary education in Parliament House on Budget night.

<PARA> The honourable senator is correct; it will be necessary to make sure that both in schools and in the community, for those with children in the higher levels of secondary school, and on campus the very real benefits which this Budget has conferred on students be made properly known so that they can gain maximum benefit from them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator has asked a question which I find a little surprising coming from him because he picks a very narrow area of disadvantage to the housing industry, knowing that in this Budget a very significant step has been taken to assist the housing industry and knowing that last May a series of measures was announced by the Government to assist that industry. I find the selectivity of his question surprising, coming as it does from someone who does not usually indulge in that sort of activity in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that one of the major changes announced in the Budget was the concession on interest rates over 10 per cent which are being paid by all home purchasers. That, I think, is a far more significant contribution to reducing the cost to the user of housing than the relatively minor impost which has been referred to by the honourable senator. I remind him that in May of this year we announced a package of proposals which affect and help first home buyers . This included the housing deposit assistance scheme, which was introduced and under which a large number of payments have already been made. I really think that the honourable senator has picked out a very small factor when so many positives have been introduced either in the last housing package or in this Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> The general move towards a heavy reliance on indirect tax is one that the Government and the Treasurer have explained. I believe it is a move which is in the interests of the Australian economy and Australian people.

In common with the practice we have followed in the past, new programs are being introduced at a later date for the simple reason that they involve new systems and the establishment of changes which are not necessary when one is merely making adjustments to rates.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The loans scheme which was announced on Tuesday night has a number of features. The most attractive feature for students will be one not mentioned by Senator Lajovic and that, of course, is that the interest rate will be subsidised by the Government to the extent of 5 per cent. So whatever the market rate of interest is, students will be asked to pay 5 per cent less on any money they borrow. That is a very real and most attractive benefit for those who wish to take up that loans option. The honourable senator asked a question specifically about those who are in need. The Government took a decision that it was proper to concentrate access to the loans scheme to those in need. Accordingly, there will be a means test to qualify people for a loan under the scheme. Meeting the means test which applies to all the student benefits at present would also qualify people for the loans scheme. In addition, there is an extra slightly more liberal means test which might allow other students to qualify.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the other part of Senator Lajovic's question about those who may be unemployed at graduation or may have difficulty getting employment, I think that would apply also to those who take some time to settle into a post-graduate lifestyle; maybe they have been married and have establishment expenses. The Government has decided that there will be a two-year repayment holiday. That is to say, people will not have to start repaying the loan until two years after graduation. That, of course, also means two years after discontinuation if they do not complete their course. Therefore, with those features, the loans scheme that has been proposed represents a real gain to students. It is an addition to and alongside the present Student Assistance Scheme. It has a significant interest subsidy and a two-year holiday from repayment.</PARA>

I have no doubt at all that had a commercial flight been available the Minister would have used it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make a point in general terms as to the use of VIP aircraft and the quoting of costs. It is a common matter-both sides of the Parliament do it- to quote a cost for a particular flight. The fact is that those aircraft belong to the RAAF . The RAAF has an allocation of flying time over the year and if there were no passengers on the aircraft at all, as is often the case day by day by day, they would be flying with their crews. For example, the Hawker Siddeleys are part of the navigation training scheme and the transportation of Ministers and others is used as part of that training scheme. So there is a certain amount of inbuilt illusion about the thought that it is an extra cost. I simply add that to put in perspective the cost of VIP flights.</PARA>

In view of the declaration this week by the Queensland Government that unionism is not compulsory, which is in line with a decision of a former Chief Justice, Sir Mostyn Hanger, of some 15 years ago, will the Commonwealth make a similar response and affirm that unionism is not compulsory in Australia? Will the Commonwealth apply this decision rigorously in respect of employees of the Commonwealth and not covertly encourage its employees to join unions, as it has done in the past, but make it an act of free choice and also desist from collecting union fees?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="286" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a strict sense I do not think unionism is compulsory in any part of Australia in the sense that I think under the various State and Commonwealth Acts which govern industrial relations in this country there are at least exemptions for conscientious objection. In other words, those people who in a positive sense have an objection in conscience to membership of a union can obtain some form of exemption. There are varying levels of compulsion apart from that. It would be well known to the honourable senator that legislation affecting this aspect of Commonwealth industrial relations was introduced earlier this year. It was sent off by the Senate to a Senate committee. We are awaiting the Senate committee's report on the inquiries that it has made into that legislation. The Government would not wish to revise its stance on this or any related question until it has seen the findings of that Senate committee report and has responded to them in the way that it is committed to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter raised by the honourable senator is one of some contention. He is probably aware of the recent incidents in Western Australia which relate to the attempts of the State Government of Western Australia to ensure that there is genuine freedom on the part of people in various industries not to join a union . He is probably aware of the actions which have been taken, including the removal of contracts in situations where employers have been co-operating with unions to achieve a closed shop. The matter is a difficult one. I will refer the question and the statements that it contains to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Macphee, for his consideration. I do point to the fact that in that strict sense a person who has a conscientious objection must escape from having to join a union but there are certainly plenty of elements in Australia, in both the unions, and among employers, who are prepared to promote a situation where there is very little choice for a person who wishes to be a member of a union. My understanding of the Commonwealth's own broad position in relation to the collection of union dues is that it has co-operated with a number of unions in providing deduction of union fees from salaries. That privilege has been removed in a number of cases where the behaviour of the union has been such that it has been thought that there has not been a properly co-operative approach to industrial relations. As I understand it, decisions are made on the basis of individual cases. As far as I know, no general policy is applied. I will check that point and let the honourable senator have a supplementary reply if it is necessary.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of the advertisement referred to by the honourable senator. I am having a lot of trouble reading even one or two Australian newspapers a day without being able to refer to a Swedish publication. Nobody had drawn my attention to it prior to Senator Hearn's question. It does seem peculiar in the present employment situation in Australia to hear of the sort of advertisement to which the honourable senator has referred. I suppose that its existence reflects the odd fact that notwithstanding a level of unemployment that none of us finds satisfactory there are areas of shortage where particular skills are required. Of course, our current immigration program reflects that with a very heavy emphasis on the admission of people who have scarce skills. From the point of view of those who are unemployed, the availability of people with the requisite skills is very important. Very often the employment of less skilled labour is dependent upon the availability of the more skilled, so shortages in that field can have an unfortunate multiplier effect on those who are less equipped for skilled work but none the less are fit and ready for employment. Therefore, we do not wish to discourage people from seeking skilled labour overseas if it is not available in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I understand the point underlying the honourable senator's question. Obviously, we should be concerned to see that Australian labour is trained and able to take up the employment which is available. In that regard I point to the emphasis that has been put on training in the programs that are the responsibility of Mr Macphee's Department whose numbers have been increased considerably. I point also to the attempts which have been made within the portfolio responsibilities of Senator Peter Baume to improve the employability of people who are at work. The honourable senator raises issues which are of real complexity and also affect the trade union movement in its attitude to skilled training, apprenticeships and so on. I can merely say that I will refer the matter to Mr Macphee and ask him to give the honourable senator a considered reply to the points she has raised. However, I point to the various activities which have been undertaken by the Government, and are currently being undertaken by it, in an attempt to ensure that those Australians who have a skill gap are given an opportunity to bridge it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the beginning of Question Time today I saw a copy of the article referred to by Senator Martyr. I have not had an opportunity of reading it, but noted that Justice Lusink made some comments along those lines. I saw only some general comments about the Family Law Act being a compromise or perhaps a band-aid measure and so on. I would be very interested in studying what she has said and also perhaps getting some further explanations from her, or others, as to what this actually means, translated into concrete reform of the Family Law Act or the Family Court. I do not think that anybody has ever pretended that the Family Law Act is perfect, by any means, or that it is a panacea. Personally, I believe, and I think most people engaged in family law practice would believe, that people should think very carefully before they see divorce and the establishment of new relationships as providing an answer to problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the major objectives of the Family Law Act is to provide people with advice and help in the form of counsellors, so that they can be professionally assisted with their problems and so that we do not have the confrontationist adversary system of the old Matrimonial Causes Act. That is a personal view; no doubt other people had higher hopes for reform. Nevertheless, there is obviously a major problem in the community, in that there have been changes in moral and religious values. Probably large numbers of people do not agree with my views, or certainly with the views of Senator Martyr, and they require methods by which these questions that arise in relation to the custody of children, maintenance settlements and so on can be resolved. The Family Law Act and the Family Court were designed to meet those very clear problems. As I said, nobody is suggesting that the system is perfect. Indeed, the whole object of setting up a parliamentary committee, of which Senator Martyr was a member, was to address those problems. It presented a very valuable report and made a number of suggestions for reform of the law, many of which are incorporated in the Family Law Bill before the Parliament. I certainly have no intention of withdrawing that Bill simply because there has been some criticism of it by Senator Martyr or a few other people, even including Family Court judges.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I refer the Minister to the comments of the National Aboriginal Conference Executive on the Budget yesterday when it said, among other such statements, that it was devastated by the callous disregard of Aboriginal affairs in the Federal Budget. It is my understanding that there is considerable and increasing activity in the overall area of funding of this particular group of Australians. In the light of these comments, can the Minister give an indication of total Government commitment to Aboriginal affairs in the areas of health, social welfare, housing, education, National Aboriginal Conference funding and other specific programs?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="289" SPEAKER="Baume Sen The Hon P.E." NAMEID="ME4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="EDUCATION" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of the comments of the National Aboriginal Conference on the adequacy or otherwise of its appropriation. It is its function to represent Aboriginal views. It is its function, too, to act as an advocate group. I would be surprised if it did not say that anything it received was not as much as it could have used. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs has received significant appropriations this year. The Department and the Aboriginal Development Commission have received almost $164m, of which the Department itself will have about $112m to spend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, Aboriginal advancement is helped by appropriations other than those made through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. Many other departments fund through their programs benefits or other things which help Aboriginal Australians; my own Department, for example, through the Aboriginal secondary grants and Abstudy schemes. I understand that if one takes all the appropriations from all departments and looks for those areas which help Aboriginal Australians one finds that about $250m can be seen to be assisting Aboriginals.</PARA>
<PARA> So the $164m, or thereabouts, for the Department and the Aboriginal Development Commission represents a real increase over the sum provided for the previous year, and in terms of funding there has been a real increase after allowing for inflation. It would be possible to obtain for Senator Kilgariff the funding in the various sub-functions of the Department for which he asked. I undertake to do that for him. I can indicate only one of the figures, though; that is, the National Aboriginal Conference had an increase of almost 18 per cent on its appropriation for the previous year. That is a real increase of about 7 per cent . It is 7 per cent more in real terms for those concerned to use. I would hope that they would use it wisely and for the benefit of the people they represent.</PARA>

In refuting that, I quote from page 1134 of Hansard for 29 March 1979, when I said, during a debate on the Parliament House Construction Authority Bill:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regret in more ways than one that it falls to the lot of the Australian Democrats to be the sole dissenting voice in this matter. In ideal circumstances nobody could object to the idea of a new and permanent Parliament House, to domestic satellites in profusion, to Boeing 707 VIP aircraft, to $1-a-week flats for members of Parliament or to airconditioned cars for all. But we in this country live in circumstances which over the next decade will be far from ideal. We will be facing national challenges and competition on an unprecedented scale; and I suggest that we all know that. If we do not know it, we should. We in this Parliament will necessarily be calling on Australian citizens to work hard, to be more frugal and to accept sacrifices in the national interest. The going must become progressively rougher over the next 10 years. Now we propose to present the bizarre spectacle of a parliament which, while asking for this sacrifice and frugality, simultaneously expects the community to bear the cost of a magnificent new parliament house which basically will be there to our greater glory and comfort and which, I will say, is already seen as such. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The report of the inquiry into the long term future of Christmas Island is a very important report. It follows the determination of the last Labor Government to establish on Christmas Island a form of self-determination-a determination in which you, Mr Deputy President, played a very significant part-as a part of the process for the ultimate survival of the island in the new circumstances in which it found itself in the post-phosphate era. The report was commissioned by the Government with a view to looking at the long term future of Christmas Island. It is a very complex issue because of the long period of colonial administration and the distrust that inevitably follows Western influence. The inhabitants of Christmas Island were badly treated and were the subject of a form of personal feudal rule for a considerable period. The residual effect of that feudal rule is a distrust of the Australian Government. Probably that would be there regardless of the politics of the Australian Government, although it has to be conceded that certainly a lot more compassion and understanding would have been shown early in the post-colonial era by a Labor administration in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> What comes out of this report, of course, is the environment and conditions which the residents of Christmas Island will face when the period of phosphate mining winds down and finally comes to an end. That poses a number of very difficult problems, not only for the Administration, which is still in the hands of the Australian and New Zealand Governments, but also for the residents of the Island, having regard to their ethnic problems and their ethnic composition. As the report indicates, the Union of Christmas Island Workers is a very important organisation. In fact, very little can take place in respect of the present and future government of the Island without the active approval of that organisation , which represents practically the entire work force on the Island. Although I find in the report some laudatory comments about the Union of Christmas Island Workers and its dedication to public interest on the Island, nevertheless I believe that there is a failure in the report to evaluate properly the role that that organisation can play. I do not believe that the changes can take place without the approval of that organisation because it does, in every sense, represent the views of the members of the organisation who comprise the great bulk of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry sees the future of Christmas Island in terms of some broad based economic and social development. That cannot be disputed. Clearly other forms of development have to take place on the Island in the post-phosphate era. We believe that the exploitation of the phosphate deposits should be managed so that they are productive for as long as possible. Phosphate is the source of income and prosperity. It is the source of income which provides increasingly high living standards. The recommendations contained in this report, whilst they have certain theoretical objectives, nevertheless will change the whole of the conditions, incomes and work environment if they are to be put into effect. I just wonder how, in 10 minutes, one can deal with all of the complexities of the problems which are raised in the report. The alternative industries suggested in the report include market gardening, fruit orchards, spices, pig farming, poultry farming, fishing, tourism, mariculture, coconut processing and liqueur production and flowers, which are entirely different from the environment in which the phosphate organisation has existed since it came into contact with the Western world a couple of centuries ago and which, of course, is the basis upon which the current culture and commercial enterprises operate. This development will be accompanied by considerable changes in the social life of the Island, including changing job prospects and life- style. Therefore, the transfer of some of the administrative functions to residents and the encouragement of long term residency seem to my party to be important features and have to be recognised by the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry has recommended that the Island community be given representation in the Australian Parliament through attachment to one of the electorates in the Australian Capital Territory. That is a recommendation that could at least give the community a voice in this place, one which at the moment is lacking except on occasions such as this when reports are considered. The problems involved in implementing these recommendations, and they are very varied and different and difficult, should not be underestimated. They involve a considerable upheaval in the lives of the Islanders, both from the point of view of employment and lifestyle. Of course, Western culture is beginning to have an influence upon the hitherto perhaps more romantic and isolated lifestyle that existed in the old days under the sort of feudal influence of paternalism. </PARA>
<PARA> The feasibility of many of the industries recommended is equally far from tested, nor is their success ensured. The inclusion of the Island electorally in the Australian Capital Territory raises many questions, not the least of which is the relevance of such a move to the Island's residents, having regard to the background of the 3,000 people who make up the population. The recommendation will probably also run into opposition from the Union of Christmas Island Workers, which quite rightly and properly seeks to protect the income, working conditions and future prospects of its members. There is clearly a great deal of conflict about the short and long term problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, this Parliament must recognise the increased significance of the Island to Australia, both strategically and morally. Whilst there is no threat to the Island's status at this time, there can of course be no guarantee that the situation in the Indian Ocean region will always remain as it is, having regard to the difficult international times that exist. So Australia's treatment of Christmas Island and its residents may well be central to any future territorial arrangements that could take place, having regard to its closeness to the whole of the South East Asian region. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations in the report do not hold out much encouragement for a large scale population permanently settling on the Island. There is evidence to show that people are moving in and out of the Island fairly regularly. Those industries envisaged will probably provide only for home consumption and do little to raise or maintain the living standards of the existing population. It is obvious that a considerable amount of further involvement by Australia in the Island's future will be of paramount importance if we are to fulfil our responsibilities in the post-colonial era and in the post-phosphate era. It has been a sheltered society, it has been an exploited society, and it has been a society with a style of living entirely different from that in Western culture. Therefore we do have a very big responsibility to look very closely at the development in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very difficult to talk about Christmas Island without making some reference to fertilisers, which we discussed last night. The point I wish to raise is that in the debate last night on the Fertilizers (Subsidy) Amendment Bill 1982 I questioned the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) on the Government's attitude to the report entitled: Inquiry into the long-term future of Christmas Island. The Government has not yet determined its attitude. I wish to raise some points about the economy of the Island, which was dealt with in the report and which seem to me to be extremely important. I believe that the Government must eventually recognise that the legislation surrounding Christmas Island is ineffective and inefficient and that there should be an immediate review of all legislation concerning Christmas Island to enable that territory to enjoy at least some prospect of economic security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt has already referred to the parts of the report suggesting alternative industries and the question marks which must be placed over those. I certainly agree with Senator Gietzelt that the proposed recommendations for new industries leave one very much with a question mark. I cannot see in any of the suggestions that have come forward any chance of the Island becoming an economic entity. The odd thing about it is that the transfer of Christmas Island from the control of Singapore in 1958 was carried out at the behest of farmers in Australia because they were concerned that they might lose a secure source of fertiliser. It would be ironic if the same group was eventually responsible for the destruction of the source of fertiliser. </PARA>
<PARA> Christmas Island, as a dependency of Australia, is in a somewhat difficult position in that a number of Australian Acts apply to it and a number do not. I will give the Senate an example. In 1973 the Navigation Act was extended to apply to Christmas Island. This means that phosphate on Christmas Island must be carried on Australian National Line ships. ANL currently is charging $27.65 per tonne of rock carried from Christmas Island to Australia. According to the Shipping News, a ship carrying 25,000 tonnes of rock will be arriving from Jordan on 4 or 5 September. The freight rate applying to that ship is $10.75 per tonne. In other words, there is a problem in relation to applying that Act to Christmas Island because it puts an impost on Christmas Island rock and makes it uncompetitive. That was a decision of this Parliament to make a part of Australia's territory uncompetitive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security in response to a query I raised last night said that in fact steps could be taken to implement the provisions of the Customs tariff anti-dumping legislation or the Customs tariff countervailing duties which passed through the Senate last night. It so happens that that legislation does not apply to Christmas Island. This means that Christmas Island , as an Australian territory, is not able to take action under that legislation. What might Christmas Island do? It could be entitled to third party status under Article 12 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade anti-dumping code. That may be a way out. For example, if New Zealand runs into difficulty it could apply to Australia in relation to something which is coming into Australia from, say, Singapore. Unfortunately for Christmas Island any move to seek entitlement under Article 12 of GATT must be agreed to by the Government. In this case the Government technically happens to be the Administrator and the Administrator is in a Ministry run by a National Country Party Minister. So the Administrator has to go to a Minister wearing one hat and ask him, while wearing his other hat, to do something that he has already agreed not to do. I think the Customs legislation which has just been passed by the Senate raises a problem of legislative concern to the Senate in that not only Christmas Island but also many other Australian territories suffer from the fact that some legislation applies to them, often to their disadvantage, whereas other legislation, some of which would be to their advantage, does not apply to them. I believe the Government has an obligation in this regard to carry out a complete review of all legislation which affects our territories to make sure that this invidious situation is not allowed to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry raised some other matters in relation to the economy, particularly the long term viability of the Island when the phosphate supply has run down. It suggests a movement towards farming and other agricultural development. We have to look much more imaginatively at the development of the Territories of Australia, not in terms of traditional economic development but in terms of innovative development. Christmas Island, for example, would be a place to look at, as we have done with the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, with a view to assisting Australia and the Territory itself in the provision of a government resource which could become crucial to the economy of the Territory and could provide a stabilising element, because it is Government funded and will continue to operate because of the benefit that it will provide to the people of Australia. I believe that is one area that again falls within the Government's purview and indeed Government actions. I believe that suggestions that farming or any other activity may start up smacks a little of crossing one's fingers and hoping that something will occur. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I believe the whole of Australia has an obligation, a very important obligation, to the people of Christmas Island to make sure that the island remains an economic entity. We have derived vast benefits from Christmas Island for our agricultural industry over a considerable period. I believe it would be only just that, whatever happens to the economy of Christmas Island, the Australian nation does not look at it purely in economic terms. We should look at it also in terms of justice, in terms of what we owe to the island, what we have taken out of it and the products that we have been able to use, often at extremely low prices and often produced with by adopting certain labour practices which could only be described as verging on slavery. We have indeed benefitted enormously at the expense of other people. I believe that ought to weigh heavily with the Government when it is looking at this report. We hope that in the very near future it may give us its definitive view, which will be imaginative, innovative and just. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Initially I would like to endorse the remarks of Senator Macklin. I congratulate him on his very explicit and useful references to the anomalies and inconsistencies which have bedevilled Christmas Island for many decades. I find the report that is before us at the moment, the second report of the Sweetland Commission of Inquiry into the Viability of the Christmas Island Phosphate Industry, very interesting, mostly constructive and, as far as I am aware, tolerably accurate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to speak briefly on just two or three aspects of the report. I am not able to indicate whether the new industries which are being suggested for Christmas Island, particularly primary industries, are feasible but I do have the experience which leads me to believe that it would be a delightful place to develop in respect of tourism. From my experience it is one of the few places in the world where one can really get away from it all, and quite literally too because there is only one plane a fortnight out of Perth to Christmas Island. One can get there a little more easily via Singapore. Christmas Island is distinct from other tropical paradises of which we know and which have their own industrial and social problems. It has certainly had its problems over the years . We have seen more recently the workers getting on top of those problems. The problems are beginning to be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> I can assure honourable senators that it is a most cheering experience to witness the improvements that have been achieved over the last few years principally, almost solely, as a result of the industrial action that has been taken by the Union of Christmas Island Workers since its inception in 1975. Some of Mr Sweetland's remarks might be construed as being a little critical of the Union of Christmas Island Workers. I would like to draw the attention of honourable senators to the first Sweetland report, which drew, with no doubt whatsoever, the picture of the previous administration as 'colonial, outmoded and repugnant'. When the Union of Christmas Island Workers began taking action to improve the living standards of the workers on that island, to improve their wages and to bring them up to parity with Australian workers, it was a new world for the people living there, who previously, as Senator Macklin indicated, had been treated as veritable slaves. The low wages, poor working conditions and shocking class distinctions on the island had to be seen to be believed. It is really only since 1980 that there have been marked changes. Prior to that the situation was, as Mr Sweetland remarked, repugnant in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA> I think perhaps some credit should be given also to the West Australian Trades and Labour Council which has provided industrial and social support not just for the unionists on the island but also for the unionists who come to Western Australia on leave or who ultimately settle there. Mr Sweetland commented that the Union of Christmas Island Workers speaks with one voice for the wages employees on any issue it chooses. I see no objection to that. The previous situation was that the British Phosphate Commission spoke with its most appallingly class-ridden and dictatorial voice on behalf of the shareholders, certainly not on behalf of the workers or their families on Christmas Island. Mr Sweetland does admit that the leadership of the Union of Christmas Island Workers has shown commendable public spirit in many of its campaigns. For example, $26,000 was raised by members to pay for a spectrometer for the Royal Perth Hospital. The Union recently launched a campaign to raise funds for renovations to the present community hall. One could add to that countless instances of workers and their families being assisted by the Union of Christmas Island Workers. I am disappointed that I do not have time in which to fill out the picture a little more fully. However, this inquiry made a recommendation in relation to Federal representation for workers on Christmas Island. The recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA> That Christmas Island residents who are Australian citizens be permitted to vote in Federal elections by attaching Christmas Island to one of the Australian Capital Territory . . . electorates (Canberra or Fraser). </PARA>
<PARA>There may be good reasons for this recommendation. But in view of the fact that the majority of workers on Christmas Island identify very closely with Western Australia; in view of the fact that Western Australian politicians now make representations on behalf of Christmas Island workers and their families; and in view of the fact that the majority of them eventually will become constituents of Western Australia, it seems to me a little more thought should be given to deciding whether Christmas Island should be part of a Western Australian electorate. In the short term that would certainly have the effect of making Christmas Island a little more accessible to Western Australian politicians who currently are able to use their international travelling privileges to get to Christmas Island but who otherwise must use their own resources. The political and administrative structures of Christmas Island is described in the report. The recommendation relating to this states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . political activity on Christmas Island should be structured at three levels:</PARA>
<PARA> Federally, through inclusion in a Canberra electorate;</PARA>
<PARA> Territorially, through a Territorial advisory body charged with advising the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment . . . </PARA>
<PARA> locally, through an established local government authority with normal local government powers and authority. </PARA>
<PARA>In view of the fact that the Union of Christmas Island Workers has been the de facto and, might I add, elected local government authority for some years now it seems to me that at the very least the Union should be involved closely in any plans for subsequent restructuring of the Island's political and administrative bodies. I urge that this be the case. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The Family Medicine Program is one about which there has been some considerable controversy in recent months. It is a program about which a lot of people have felt very strongly. It has been opposed by some sections of the community and vigorously supported by others. People have maintained that it would be done away with completely and others believe that it is not even offering enough in what it attempts to do. Traditional medicine programs, certainly since they were taken over by men, have tended to be directed to preparing doctors to fight diseases, to curing people's physiological ills and to doing what little we can do at the moment for basic psychological ills. </PARA>
<PARA> Traditional medicine programs too have tended to be rather elitist with at least some faculty members in the departments of medicine in some universities in this country tending to foster an attitude of superiority amongst medical undergraduates. Indeed, I had regaled to me recently a story of the head of one medical faculty-I will not mention the university concerned-who traditionally begins his lecture to first year medical undergraduates by pointing out that they are indeed the creme de la creme of the university, should regard themselves as such and never forget it. One can only imagine what that does to the psyche of the students hearing it. Fortunately for most patients in the community there has been an increasing demand in the community lately for medicine and medical training to become more attuned to the patient as a person rather than as a set of symptoms or a bunch of organs which may or may not be operating efficiently. The family medicine program was one scheme designed to achieve this. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to note from the report that something like 65 per cent of doctors entering general practice in recent years have had some family medicine training . However, funding has been limited and is seen by many as grossly insufficient. The Family Medicine Program, as the introduction to this report says, is a post- graduate vocational training program directed essentially, but not exclusively, to doctors making an initial entry into general practice. It was established in 1973, and is funded by the Australian Government through the Commonwealth Department of Health. It is based, of course, on the premise that vocational training in family health should be received by doctors who are going into general practice because they are the sorts of problems that they are likely to be confronted with in the main. I see it and a lot of other people see it as a trend leading away from an unfortunate tendency that has developed in this country and overseas countries recently of doctors tending to specialise partly because there is more money involved in specialist work-hence, it is more prestigious-and, partly, because knowing more and more about less and less has become the norm these days. Therefore, it is pleasing to note that this review-I hope the last in a long line-has come out with conclusions and recommendations that are strongly in favour of the retention of the Family Medicine Program. In particular, I refer to the conclusions and recommendations on page 62, under item 4.7. Point 1 states quite categorically:</PARA>
<PARA>Family Medicine Program</PARA>
<PARA> There is a need for vocational training for medical practitioners entering general practice. This conclusion was the virtually unanimous view of all individuals and organisations which responded to this term of reference. This opinion was also expressed by the Seminar on Intern Training in New South Wales held in 1979 and the First Australian Conference on Post Graduate Medical Education (1960). It is also the view of the Australian Medical Association, The British Medical Association Working Party of 1976 and The General Medical Council of Great Britain. It is also the view of all State Health Commissions or Health Departments. </PARA>
<PARA>One wonders then why we must have another review to see whether the Family Medicine Program is worth while and needs to be maintained when there seems to be an overwhelming body of opinion, both in this country and internationally, that it is a 'good thing'. Point 2 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The need will continue to exist because:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Universities do not see their role as implying any obligation to produce a competent doctor at the point of graduation. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a rather astonishing, but unfortunately also accurate, remark by the committee about some university medical departments. It certainly confirms the point I made earlier when I referred to that anecdote. Point 2 continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) In consonance with this view undergraduate education in Medicine is structured to provide a corpus of scientific and clinical knowledge, on which further vocational training towards competence can be based. It is very doubtful if this attitude will change in the foreseeable future, as it reflects current tertiary education philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA>Point 3 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee agrees with these views and recommends that such vocational training should be available to all graduates after their intern year who wish to enter general practice. </PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, we certainly support these recommendations by the Committee of Review of the Family Medicine Program. They are certainly in line with the policy of the Australian Democrats on health, which maintains that community health relating to human beings as human beings, and not as symptoms, is an important element. We support wholeheartedly the comments, conclusions and recommendations made in the review. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer the Senate to a couple of items of the report which deal with the nature and function of the Services Canteen Trust Fund. I also wish to point to one of the impending measures announced by the Government, a measure that will hamper seriously the activities of the fund. The fund was established from the profits and assets of the Navy, Army and Air Force Canteen Services as they operated during the Second World War. These, with other subsidiary funds, totalled at the end of the war a considerable amount of money. They are administered by a volunteer trust fund, which disburses, from accumulated capital, welfare services of various kinds. In particular, it provides for men, women and dependants in needy circumstances. It also provides educational assistance for children, particularly those suffering from serious afflictions. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, money which came from servicemen during that war was put into a fund to assist people after the war. The trustees of the fund have drawn attention to the problem that the fund spends the vast bulk of its money on recently bereaved widows and orphans, particularly those in need of immediate cash and grants towards funeral expenses-something that I believe would have the total support of the community. The problem is that the fund will run out of money in the foreseeable future, yet that need will continue to exist and will not reach its peak until 1990. Therefore, the fund would presumably have the support of all honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> A resolution taken at the recent Returned Services League Ex-Service Organisations' Conference points to what I believe is an aspect of penny- pinching which must be condemned by all honourable senators. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> This Conference notes with great concern the intention of the Auditor-General's Department to levy charges for the annual audit of accounts of the Services Canteen Trust Fund. Indications are that the scale of charges is excessive in relation to the task involved. Furthermore, the resources of the Fund are diminishing at a time when the demand on its resources from recently bereaved widows and orphans is increasing. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Government intends to require a fund that consists solely of moneys provided by ex-servicemen during the war and is being used to benefit widows and orphans to meet the cost-an excessive cost at that-of auditing the accounts, basically a relatively simple proposition. Although I cannot give honourable senators the exact amounts involved, the estimates that I have seen strike me as being at a level that would get a private practitioner into serious trouble with his profession. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether the Government, in its excessive zeal to make users pay, has really thought about the nature and function of this particular fund. In the report, the trustees of the fund point to a need which will go beyond the period of its existence. I believe that, rather than penalise the operation of such a fund, which is philanthropic in nature, which has no costs of administration- many people devote an enormous amount of time, work and energy to helping past comrades of the Second World War-and whose activity is directed at widows and orphans of ex-servicemen, the Government should certainly have announced its intention not only of meeting that need but also of looking at ways and means of continuing the operation of the fund until at least after its peak demand point in 1990. In other words, it would seek to put renewed amounts into that fund to allow it at least to go into the year 2000 to provide for those immediate cash needs of widows and orphans. Instead, we find a penny-pinching operation, the type of thing that Scrooge would certainly have been very pleased to engage in, in an area where people cannot fight back, in an area where a lot of other people are putting in their time and their energies. I would have thought that the Government at least could have matched in a reasonable way those types of voluntary activities carried out by so many people in the community instead of seeking by a back-door method to penalise voluntary activity, to penalise ex- servicemen yet again. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This agreement appears to have been tabled in response to a request made by me in this chamber as early as 8 April 1981. Subsequent correspondence I have had with the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Newman, indicates that the Australian Police Ministers' Council, which is the Federal-State body responsible for the signing of this agreement establishing the Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, did in fact resolve to have the document tabled. In doing so it responded favourably to my request to that effect. It is a very belated production of what is, on any view, an extremely important document with very far-reaching consequences for criminal law enforcement in this country. The composition of the list of signatories to the agreement, representing as it does the composition of the Police Ministers' Council at the time of its signing on 6 February 1981, is not such as to give one enormous confidence as to the content of the agreement. The signatories include Bill Hassell, then the Police Minister in Western Australia, and Russell Hinze, the then Minister for Police in Queensland, of whom it will be recalled that he describes his own qualifications for that job as 'being 20 stone, having flat feet and no brains'. I am not suggesting that the whole of this document reflects that order of competence or that order of credibility, but it is nonetheless a very superficial document touching only very lightly on many matters which must be of very grave concern to those of us in the community at large with an interest in effective law enforcement on the one hand but sensitive law enforcement on the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are three matters to which I want to draw attention. The first is the question of political accountability for what this Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence actually does. It has been established as a joint body. The document expressly states in clause 7 that ultimate responsibility for the ABCI in matters of policy shall rest with the Australian Police Ministers' Council; that is, the seven governments represented by their police Ministers at that time. Clause 7 (2) further states that the ABCI shall be independent of any one participating government or agency-independent in every respect. So far as administrative accountability or responsibility is concerned, the only provision is for the management committee of the organisation to report annually to the Australian Police Ministers' Council. There is no provision anywhere in the agreement for any of the participating governments to report to any of the Parliaments of the various participating States. As a result there is absolutely no guarantee whatsoever that any aspect of the agency's operations will ever come to public light. The only public account of what it is all about that we have had so far is this particular document tabled in the Senate today. Apart from that, there have simply been hints and suggestions as to what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that that is simply not good enough. The track record of some of the individual governments and Ministers concerned is not such as to give one any confidence as to their effective responsibility or the effectiveness of the processes of accountability so far as just one government is concerned, but when we have seven governments participating, plus the Northern Territory thrown in for good measure, we have an enormous problem in pinning down the responsibility for anything that might prove to go wrong, either in terms of an overreach in the exercise of the powers of this body or in terms of some aspect of financial or other maladministration. The truth of the matter is, and I suppose it is a problem endemic to federalism, that accountability to everyone can so often in practice mean accountability to no one. I simply make the constructive point in this respect that, if nothing else, there should at least be agreement by the responsible governing body of this bureau-namely the Police Ministers' Council- that each one of the participating governments should table some appropriate annual report in its respective parliament to enable at least that much opportunity for scrutiny over what is going on on a regular, systematic basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I make goes to the scope of the operations and powers of the Bureau of Criminal Intelligence. The creation of the organisation arose out of a recommendation of the Williams Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs. The recommendation of the Williams Royal Commission was confined to the establishment of a drug intelligence body. What we have with this organisation becomes very clear when one stops to read clause 4. The agreement has been incorporated in Hansard so I will not waste time spelling it out, but it lists a wide variety of criminal subject areas involving generally the notion of organised crime. It becomes apparent that this body has been established with a much wider purpose and with a much wider jurisdiction than simply that of matters relating to drug trafficking. I do not say that that in itself is a bad thing. I do say, however, that there has been an element of dissimulation in the way in which the establishment of this body has been justified, certainly by the Commonwealth Government and I believe by a number of the State governments as well, referring as they constantly have to this body being created in the implementation of a recommendation of the Williams Royal Commission. In fact, it goes much further than that. It will have many more functions than those simply related to the scrutiny of the illicit drug trafficking, crucial as that problem is and related as it is to other areas of other criminal activity. To that extent there ought to be a little less coyness on the part of governments in explaining what is going on. The other point I make about the powers or the scope of the Bureau's operation-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not proposing specifically to do so. I would be indebted to Senator Rae if he leapt to his feet at the conclusion of my remarks and offered something along those lines. I think it does flow naturally out of what I have said and obviously I would support any such motion. I believe others in this chamber would, too. As to the powers of the organisation, which bear upon the accountability question, to the extent that new powers are being exercised, it is obvious that the powers at the moment are limited to the compilation and dissemination of criminal intelligence data to the participating governments, but various suggestions have been made public by the Director of the Organisation, Mr Fred Sylvester, formerly of the Victoria Police, that the bureau itself ought to have powers of telephone tapping, those powers being indispensable to the effective operation of any criminal intelligence outfit and in particular indispensable to the operation of a criminal intelligence bureau in a place such as Australia, where there has been a long history of jealousies and rivalries between the various police agencies. That suggestion about wire tapping powers was made on the second day of the hearings of the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking in 1981 and reported in the Press on 10 September last year. I believe suggestions of that kind do give one grave cause for concern again about what kind of an animal it is that we have here in the agency created by this agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third and final point relates to safeguards against misuse of power by this organisation, which is a particularly important consideration given both the lack of accountability in a direct way to any particular government and the questions that I have been raising about the scope of its operations and powers. There are very limited statements of intention about creating such safeguards in the document itself. The best we have is clause 6(j), which senators can read when they see it in Hansard, suggesting that guidelines be prepared for the Police Ministers' Council. There are a number of other issues, including those raised in particular by the Law Reform Commission in its criminal investigation report in 1975 about personal access to sensitive data, the kind of machinery that should and ought to be established to produce redress in cases in which there is an abuse of the police power in relation to such dissemination. </PARA>
<PARA> We welcome the tabling of this document and the information that it provides, but there is an awful lot more information that needs to be supplied if this Parliament can have confidence that we do not have here a very dangerous institution indeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I interjected during Senator Evans's speech to inquire whether he proposed to move a substantive motion in relation to the question of accountability in the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence agreement. As I have not yet a copy of the agreement, I find it hard to draft an appropriate provision on the run, as it were, and I would just indicate that it is something that I would like to see pursued and I propose to seek an appropriate opportunity. It seems to me that one of the problems about which the Senate has continually expressed concern is the ensuring of appropriate accountability. If, as Senator Evans has indicated, the agreement is defective in that way, I think it would not be inappropriate for the Senate to express a view about it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is very useful and good that this code has come into being. It is something for which I have asked in this place a number of times in recent years , because there have been some incidents, including a road accident at Port Macquarie, in which it has been brought home to us most pointedly that there should be some overall supervision of the way in which radioactive materials are carried around in Australia. I am a little concerned at the statement from the Minister. It has the fault of many ministerial statements of not really giving people much information. In a complex technical matter of this type, I should have preferred to see some masterly statement by the Minister which gave the Australian people a pretty good idea of just what was going on in this area, and explaining, for instance, the reference in the prelude to the report, 'Code of Practice for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Substances':</PARA>
<PARA> In this Code of Practice-'radioactive substance' means a substance the radioactivity of which exceeds 74,000 becquerels per kilogram of the substance. </PARA>
<PARA>I have made inquiries about that, and I find that is a very low figure and one I think most people would approve of. It takes into account most radioactive materials which could be dangerous. But it would be nice to feel that ministerial statements covering these sorts of reports would at least elucidate some points rather than obscure or merely comment on the presentation of a report such as this, which is of massive importance to society, to explain it a little more. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had an initial look at the report. I have not had much time to look at it, and I am certainly not a physicist. Most of it is above my head. I confess that freely. I should like my remarks to be taken in that context, so that if I have made errors through lack of understanding, it has only been in the interest of raising matters which seem at first sight to be important. </PARA>
<PARA> I go to page 2, section 107. It is fairly straightforward. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> A consignment of radioactive materials which does not satisfy all the applicable requirements of these Regulations must be made only under special arrangement which requires multilateral approval. The special arrangements shall be adequate to ensure that the overall level of safety in transport is at least equivalent to that which would be provided if all the applicable requirements of the Regulations had been met. </PARA>
<PARA>As in so much drafting of this kind, awkward sentences are involved. These seem to say that it is perfectly okay to leave out various things which are thought important enough to be requirements in this code, and yet some other authority, which is not defined, and on a multilateral basis, which is also not defined, can say: 'No, that is okay. In our opinion the overall level of safety for the transport of this thing is okay in spite of those things being left out, and indeed, we make the independent, quite subjective assessment that the safety is the same as would have been provided if they had been met'. How inconsistent can one get? It seems a reductio ad absurdum situation when we can have a document which makes that kind of statement and it is expected to be taken seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> Of rather more concern is section 108 on page 2 which says something which I think will distress many people in Australia, and it certainly distressed me that it appears in a report on the safe transport of radioactive substances in Australia. That means the carrying backwards and forwards through this country of radioactive substances. In the report we have this statement:</PARA>
<PARA> The transport of explosive radioactive materials shall be permitted only under special arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA>I thought that we had had time and again in the Senate assurances from the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) and others that we will not enrich uranium to explosive quality, that there is no question of that kind of material being in Australia. Why, then, has it been thought necessary to bring that provision into this code? It is something that could have been added later if necessary. The fact that it is there now worries me. Where are these explosive radioactive materials going to come from? Where are they going to go? Would they be nuclear weapons being transported around Australia? That is the only thing they could be, with the exception of materials used for making a bomb for civil purposes, perhaps for some sort of excavation work. That has been canvassed around the world in the past, but to my knowledge nobody has been silly enough actually to do it. </PARA>
<PARA> Explosive radioactive materials are those which are sufficiently enriched to create an explosion and are, in fact, the ingredients of bombs or part of the facilities for making the ingredients of bombs. Paragraph 121 on page 5 raises a matter of interest. It refers to uranium or thorium ores. I am glad to see that reference included. I believe it will have a relevance to honourable senators from Western Australia and others who are quite interested in monazite exports from Western Australia. It is a fact that by 1985 reactors using thorium will be in operation. I would like to feel that if the Government intends to comment on this report it will explain to us the relevance to the exporting of monazite of that reference to uranium or thorium ores in this document. As I said, I am glad to see the reference there. Presumably it is there for a reason I would think it would be there for that reason. </PARA>
<PARA> Pages 45, 46 and 47 of the report contain samples of stickers which have to be put on radioactive packages. I draw the stickers to the attention of honourable senators because they seem adequate until the dimensions are noted. These little stickers are 10 centimetres square, even for radioactive III, the worst type of material. How will any body know that there is a dangerous consignment if the label on the package is so small-only 10 centimetres square-that it is almost not there at all? The actual letters of the word 'radioactive' are well under a centimetre high. How will people know that the material is radioactive? Even more ridiculously, when we turn to the next page-page 48-we find a placard for vehicles of the same type and it is permissible for those placards to be only 15 centimetres square. How can a person tell that a vehicle is carrying radioactive materials in the event of an accident or something of that kind?</PARA>
<PARA> I go on to deal with fissile materials. The whole issue of weapons grade material is interesting. When we turn to the tables illustrated on page 81 of the Code of Practice we find some rather interesting references. I mention this in light of the fact that I have had repeated assurances from the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick) that there has never been any question of uranium being enriched in this country below a certain low nuclear reactor grade. Therefore, why has it been thought necessary on page 81, under the heading 'Table XXIII. Permissible Mass of Uranium-235 per consignment' and others, to lay down in detail the permissible mass in grams per consignment of U-235 right up to an enrichment of 93 per cent or more or above U-235? The figure for uranium exceeding U-235 by 93 per cent or more, which is plainly a weapons grade material-there is no doubt about that whatsoever-is 160 grams per consignment. </PARA>
<PARA> Section VII of the Code of Practice deals with the testing of packaging, such as the water spray test, the free drop test and the compression test. On my initial reading of the report-here again I could be wrong-there seems to be no check or test carried out on the degree of radioactivity of the substance. It is left to the person consigning to put on labels indicating it, but there seems to be no check that that information is correct. Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to continue my remarks. </PARA>

But in this as in anything else one must go to those who have, by the judgment of the community, the best knowledge of what it is all about. That is what has happened. I remind the Senate that we have a number of major safeguards. The Australian Safeguards Office deals with the movement, handling and management of materials of high levels of radioactivity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I repeat a number of matters. There is no intention at all in this country of the Government seeking to enrich uranium to anything other than a non-weapons standard. Indeed, no decision has been made as at this moment with regard to uranium enrichment to that standard. If there were to be a uranium enrichment plant the level of enrichment would be well below that standard. One should put out of one's mind any thought that this Government, by overt or covert means, will initiate or allow the use of any fissile material of that nature. The code of practice for the safe transport of radioactive substances aims to work out in the State and Federal spheres how we can get a common practice for the transport of materials. We must bear in mind that the kinds of materials range from the radioactive isotopes that are used for medical and industrial purposes-some of those have half-lives of less than a day; others have longer lives-to materials which are used for university and hospital purposes. I make it clear that the governments which will be carrying out these matters are governments of all political persuasions. </PARA>
<PARA> I was asked about thorium. The short answer is that thorium in itself is not an explosive material. For it to become an explosive material in a weapons situation it has to be associated also with plutonium. That ought to be completely understood. In order that that matter might be cleared up I point out that, of course, it is a component of monazite, in the mineral sands type of activities. I am aware of recent Press claims that Australian thorium is being used as a nuclear fuel in the Federal Republic of Germany and in the United States of America. In fact, there are no exports of thorium from Australia. I make that perfectly clear. Thorium is a component which typically contains around 6 to 7 per cent of monazite. Monazite exports from Australia have been permitted under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations only when the stated use of the monazite is for the extraction of rare earth elements, a non- nuclear use. These rare earths are used in areas such as glass, ceramics and metal alloy technology. Thorium is contained in waste sludge after extraction of rare earths. Thorium ore such as monazite and thorium ore residue is not subject to International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards and the export of monazite from Australia is fully in accord with Australia's Non-Proliferation Treaty obligation. The IAEA Australian Safeguards Agreement would apply to thorium only if it were concentrated as a source material. I stress that thorium is not fissile but is a fertile material having the ability to capture neutrons and generate fissile U233. Thorium on its own cannot be used as a nuclear fuel. It must be mixed with fissile material such as U233, U235 or plutonium. Nuclear uses represent only a fraction of total thorium production and this situation is unlikely to change before the next century. </PARA>
<PARA> I should add that the countries which take the exports of monazite have their own quite vast capacities to store it and therefore it should not be considered as having the difficulties as presented. I repeat that this is not a comprehensive comment on my part because the subject is a massive one. It is necessary, in Australia, in the overview of radioactive materials, to develop a number of methodologies. Firstly, we need to get a common code throughout Australia so that all States and the Commonwealth act in a common way in the handling of radioactive substances. The States are responsible for mostly substances which are of relatively low radioactivity. Operating in conjunction with this code there is, of course, the code of mining and milling which has been established and which has been adopted as a common code. There is the code which we adopt for our Australian Safeguards Office. This code is regarded as a strong code in international terms in the supervision of highly radioactive material whether moving in and around Australia or throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the best evidence of the quality of these codes is that they have been developed by consultations throughout the whole of Australia. They are acceptable throughout Australia as a common code. They are acknowledged by the scientists as being the best. I give the assurance that if, in the development of the exposure of these codes, there are seen to be weaknesses, we will step in and plug the holes. I suggest that what might happen is that, if in the weeks ahead the Australian Democrats or others would like to, we could initiate a debate on the broader subject after these codes have been exposed. I commend that suggestion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I take the opportunity accorded to me on the first reading of the Tobacco Charge Amendment Bill 1982 to raise a matter which I have raised quite a few times before, not only in this chamber and at Estimates Committee hearings but also directly with the then Minister concerned. The matter that I again refer to is the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full- time Training scheme. The Government, in trying to persuade employers to avail themselves of money that would be available, so-called tax free, some time ago issued some brochures. One of my constituents availed himself of this offer. He has since found that it is not all that it appears to be on first examination of the brochures. I quote from the brochure headed 'Job Training-$1,000 Now Prevent Skill Shortages Later.'. This brochure contains a message to the employer, and states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For each new apprentice you employ between 1 December 1979 and 30 June 1980, additional to the number you had for the same period last year, you will be paid $1,000 tax free. </PARA>
<PARA>The other brochure deals with the CRAFT technical education rebate. Part of that message to the employer states:</PARA>
<PARA> Over the apprenticeship this will be worth from $1,600 to $2,200 tax free. </PARA>
<PARA>An employer constituent of mine came to me after his business enterprise had availed itself of the so-called benefits mentioned in this brochure with the complaint that in fact it was not true. On 18 February, which is just six months ago, I went to the then Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, Mr N. A. Brown, and explained the situation to him. I said that I felt that there was an anomaly in the Income Tax Assessment Act. He agreed with me that there was some anomaly there. He wrote to me the next day. His letter states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator McLaren,</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for coming to my office on Thursday, 18 February 1982 and for the representation you made-</PARA>
<PARA>I will leave out the company because that is a confidential matter of taxation-</PARA>
<PARA>on the issue of the taxable status of payments under the CRAFT scheme. I was very interested to hear the representations you made. I have taken this matter up with the Treasurer and will be pursuing the matter with him. When a conclusion has been reached about the issue I will contact you again. </PARA>
<PARA>On 17 February, by way of question to Senator Guilfoyle, the Minister for Finance, I again raised this matter in the Senate. In her reply, the Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that Senator McLaren has made some representations on the matter-</PARA>
<PARA>That is the matter to which I am now referring-</PARA>
<PARA> I will refer the matter to the Treasurer to see whether there is some interaction between tax losses, exempt income and things of that sort and whether there is any necessity to look again at this to uphold the undertaking if there is any departure from it. I will see whether I can get some early response from him on the issue and clarify the matter as far as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing is mentioned in those brochures to encourage employers to avail themselves of the offer. Nothing is mentioned about interaction between tax losses, exempt incomes and things of that sort. But when the employer finds himself in that situation then of course the Treasurer (Mr Howard) will apply the relevant section of the Act. The South Australian quarterly Small Business News of February 1982 contains an article which refers to this Government's magnificent offer to employers, repeating word for word practically what is in those brochures. I wrote to the manager of the Small Business Advisory Bureau on 31 March-because that February issue did not come out until, I think, the middle of March. Immediately I received it I wrote to the manager and pointed out to him that representation had been made to me by an employer about the problem. In reply the manager said:</PARA>
<PARA> In consultation with the Adelaide Office of the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs, we understand that there is a problem with interpretation of whether or not the rebates are tax exempt and this is being pursued by the Minister. In the meantime, all references to tax exemption have been withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA>I take it they were withdrawn from the Small Business News issue, which is published quarterly. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> We look forward to hearing the Commonwealth Treasurer's answer to your question of 17 March, 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the question I have just referred to. I have not yet received an answer to it. On 19 April, during the hearings of Estimates Committee C, I again raised the matter with the officers of the Treasury and pointed out that I had spoken to the then Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs and also questioned Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. I recapitulated what I had done up until that time. Mr Daly replied:</PARA>
<PARA> I think we will have to take it on notice and provide a reply if that is satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course I agreed to that. On 11 May W. J. O'Reilly, the Commissioner of Taxation, wrote to me and said in part:</PARA>
<PARA> I have had the taxation assessments of the company-</PARA>
<PARA>That is the one I was involved with-</PARA>
<PARA>checked by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in South Australia and he has assured me that the assessments are in accordance with the law. </PARA>
<PARA>I did not dispute that but I did dispute the fact that when I approached the Minister on 18 February he admitted there was an anomaly in the law. I asked that there be some amendment to the law. I was told on various occasions that the Treasurer would look at that. That was my concern. Mr O'Reilly went on to quote in detail from the Income Tax Assessment Act as it applied at that time. On 19 May again I raised this matter in the chamber in the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1981-82. Senator Peter Baume was in charge of the chamber at that time. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . whether the Minister can advise me as to whether the Government is taking any action to amend that Act and, if so, when we can expect the legislation to come before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I quote in part Senator Baume's reply. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I note that the Government indicated in the response which is given there, that the matter that he has raised-</PARA>
<PARA>He is quoting me-</PARA>
<PARA>has been judged to be of sufficient importance that it is presently before the Government for decision. At the time that the report was written it was still in that situation, and to the best of my knowledge and that of my advisers it is still before the Government for a decision. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, Senator Baume was quoting the report from Estimates Committee C, where I raised this matter. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Until the Government has taken a policy decision we are not really in a position to give Senator McLaren the definitive answer he requires. It will require the Government to take a position, make a judgment, and then it will be able to announce what that judgment is. I undertake to check that that is still the situation. If it should be otherwise, I shall try to advise Senator McLaren as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>I again entered the debate and said:</PARA>
<PARA> I should like to ask the Minister, further, to ascertain when making these inquiries if the Government decides to amend the Act, whether it can be amended in such a way that the persons concerned . . . will be excluded from having to pay the tax they have now been called upon by way of an assessment to pay because of the problem in the present legislation. Will consideration be given to honouring the undertaking in the brochures that were freely circulated in the Commonwealth Employment Service offices, that if employers took on extra apprentices the amount of money that they received for taking them on would be tax free?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Baume replied:</PARA>
<PARA> I think it most appropriate that we try to make sure that this part of the Hansard record of today's discussion is placed before the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and any other Minister who would be involved in putting views to the Government. I think that that may be the best way of ensuring that Senator McLaren's concern is met. </PARA>
<PARA>Up until this time I have received no undertaking from the Government that it will do anything at all to amend that section of the Act, which it clearly admits contains an anomaly. To make matters worse, in a special feature article in the Adelaide Advertiser of 28 June last year headed 'Business to Business' again we find a section concerning this matter, headed 'Making apprenticeships work'. Again this brochure is quoted. The article reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Cash incentives are offered by the Federal Government under the Craft scheme- Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentices' Full-time Training. </PARA>
<PARA>The article mentions the tax-free amount of $1,500. So again in June of this year, employers are told that if they avail themselves of this scheme they will qualify for that amount. But again nothing is said about anything else-about whether or not they are in a tax loss situation. The Commissioner of Taxation recently wrote to a constituent of mine because he had appealed against this decision to tax him on that amount. I will not quote from the letter or even give the name of the people involved. On 5 August Mr Kilton, the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in South Australia, wrote to my constituent acknowledging receipt of the request for the decision of his objection to be referred to the board of review. In part Mr Kilton said:</PARA>
<PARA> However, in the circumstances of your case, provided that an amount-</PARA>
<PARA>I will not cite that amount-</PARA>
<PARA>is paid within 14 days of the date of this letter action to recover the balance of the tax payable attributable to the matters in dispute will be deferred pending a decision on the reference and additional tax accruing from the date of such payment will be remitted. </PARA>
<PARA>So in fact the Commissioner of Taxation is now asking that my constituent pay that money and if there is any alteration to the law that company may have the payment remitted. I think the matter has gone on quite long enough. It is six months since I drew it to the attention of Mr N. A. Brown. I raised it during the debate on the Estimates committtees. I have raised it by way of question in this Parliament and I raised it during the debate on the Appropriation Bills. As yet the Government has not come to me and said that it has looked at the Act and thinks it ought to be amended or even come to me and said that it is quite happy with the way the Act is and it is going to apply it as it is written. In the meantime my constituent has to spend money through his accountants and spend extra time with the appeal to the decision that has been made. Even though the company was not showing any magnificent profit, he saw fit to take on apprentices to try to help the unemployment situation in the area in which the company is situated. Because the company did this it now finds itself penalised because the promises made in the brochure are not being honoured. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), who is in charge of the Senate at present, if he will immediately draw what I have said to the attention of the Treasurer to see if some quick action can be taken. It might well be that it is in the pipeline. I would like to have an answer as soon as practically possible so I can inform my constituent. I can assure the Attorney-General that my constituent is not very happy with the actions of the Government-particularly these promises mentioned in the brochures and repeated in business journals. But when companies try to avail themselves of the offer they find there is no benefit to them at all. As a matter of fact it could be even to their detriment because the money they receive is added to their incomes which puts them in a higher income tax bracket. Will the Attorney-General make some urgent inquiries about the matters I have raised this afternoon?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly today on a subject which is of very considerable concern and interest to the people of Western Australia, the establishment of a sugar industry in the Ord River region. The matter has been very widely canvassed in the Press, particularly in Western Australia and Queensland. I will summarise the two arguments as they appear to me. The first argument is that Western Australia will not be able to sustain an economic sugar industry, that it will not be able to get it off the ground at the present time, given present market indications. The second argument is that if it does succeed it will do so at the expense of the Queensland and New South Wales industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to refer to extensive research which has been carried out on an 80 -hectare commercial scale pilot farm which was established in 1977, with 17 cane varieties under examination. Seven of these have produced weighted cane yields of more than 140 tonnes per hectare, which compares favourably with production levels in any other State in Australia and in the world generally. By comparison , the average world yield is something like 60 to 65 tonnes of cane per hectare, producing between 6 and 7 tonnes of sugar, against the 20 tonnes of sugar which is being produced in the Ord area of Western Australia at the present time. In fact, the Ord yields are significantly higher than those of Queensland. As I have said, they average something like 20 tonnes a hectare against the Queensland average of between 12 and 13 tonnes a hectare. I believe this should indicate that from a technical and commercial point of view there is no difficulty in establishing a viable proposition. In fact, I suggest that that is the very real objection to the proposal for a sugar industry in Western Australia. It is not without significance to note that of the companies and the consortiums that have put forward tenders to the Western Australian Government, two are major producers in Queensland, namely CSR Limited and Bundaberg Sugar Co . Ltd. I think that clearly demonstrates their confidence in the capacity of the Ord to support a viable sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads me to the second objection-that a West Australian industry will impinge on the markets of the eastern States producers. The Co-operative Sugar Millers Association went so far as to state in an article in the Australian:</PARA>
<PARA> Now the Western Australian Government insists that we (that is, Queensland producers) give up 5 per cent or more of our hard won market so that they can start an industry on the cheap. </PARA>
<PARA>With all respect to the author of that statement, that is simply not the case. The West Australian Minister for Agriculture has specifically stated that the Ord does not want assistance of any nature from the Federal Government. Western Australia believes it can sustain an industry in the Ord without assistance. The State Government takes the view that if financial assistance is required it will not require the industry. The State Government has said from the outset that it is looking to a self-sufficient industry, not one that will be started on the cheap. </PARA>
<PARA> The other question concerns the 5 per cent of Queensland's hard won markets, as they were described by the Millers Association. I can assume only that that figure has arisen out of a projected output of 160,000 tonnes of sugar from the Ord against last year's record Australian sugar production of 3.51 million tonnes. Last year Australia exported 3 million tonnes raw value against our basic export tonnage of 3.33 million tonnes as set by the International Sugar Council. This year, with import quotas severely restricted by the United States, that figure can naturally be expected to fall. But the point to be emphasised is that the present downturn in demand will not affect Western Australia's viability and the viability of the industry generally in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Premier of Western Australia will be announcing shortly the names of the companies or consortiums which have the most attractive development propositions for the Ord. In turn they will be invited to--</PARA>

In turn they will be invited to undertake a detailed feasibility study, which could take up to 18 months, and then proceed to the development stage. On that scenario, production from the Ord will not commence for four years. Optimistic as it may be, given the volatility of the demand and price for sugar, it is possible that production from the Ord would augment Queensland's output rather than take a share of the existing eastern States' outlets. Of course, that may be taking a fairly optimistic view of the future sugar market, but in the light of the actions of the Queensland growers, heavily financed and heavily backed by the Federal Government, it is not a view which is thoroughly unjustified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the moment, construction of the Burdekin Dam and irrigation area is under way to provide part of the infrastructure necessary for a wide range of products , the most significant of which will be sugar. Surely if the medium term view is sufficiently encouraging to warrant that expenditure, and if it is sufficiently expansionist to assume that sugar markets will be able to absorb the several hundred thousand tonnes of sugar that will evantuate from the Burdekin area, it is not unreasonable for Western Australia to establish an industry of 160,000 tonnes a year given that we already have the majority of the infrastructure required. </PARA>
<PARA> The opponents of the sugar industry are engaged in an act of political cynicism of the highest order. They claim that a Western Australian industry, though it has already been shown that its yield per hectare will be higher than virtually anywhere else in the world, will not be able to survive on its own. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not looking for it. Opponents of the sugar industry are claiming that there is no place for new production, but at the same time they are investing heavily in preparing a new production area which, when it is operational, will dwarf the very modest 160,000 tonnes proposed to be produced in the Ord. Their exercise has succeeded to the extent that the Federal Government has announced that it will abrogate its responsibilities by denying Western Australia access to loan funds which have previously been promised under the original Commonwealth-State agreement on the Ord River. However, Western Australia will not be put off. A sugar industry will be established in the Ord with or without the support of the Federal Government. The Western Australian Minister for Agriculture has made that quite clear and I repeat it here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has also been made clear that the Ord industry will be a crystal sugar industry and not an ethanol industry, as has been proposed. Honourable senators should understand quite clearly that an ethanol industry will require heavy government subsidisation to make it economic at the present time. As I have said , Western Australia is not seeking to establish an industry which will require a subsidy. It would be desirable if the Western Australian industry were to be incorporated in the orderly production and marketing system of the Queensland sugar producers. I fully endorse the comments of the Secretary of the Queensland Canegrowers Association, Mr MacKinnon, who acknowledged that an industry on the Ord was inevitable, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> We have to have a good relationship between the two States and the two industries. </PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what Western Australia wants and hopes to achieve, but the project will go ahead no matter what. The alternative would be to deny Western Australians the employment and development opportunities which this industry will bring. Sectional interest is no way to judge the future of what is potentially a major breakthrough for one of the most isolated parts of this country. I say to the Senate that this industry will go ahead. It should not be inhibited. I find it disappointing that sectional groups, for personal selfish reasons, would seek to inhibit the development of a major project in Western Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make one or two remarks about the housing industry and its prospects in Australia. During Question Time I was castigated by no less than the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) for suggesting that the Budget imposition of a 7 1/2 per cent sales tax on construction materials, as well as on home furnishings, curtains, blankets, sheets and towels, was so savage that it might affect the ability of Australians to build a house and then make it into a home with all the furnishings and normal household goods which make a house into a place of comfort for a family. It was strange indeed that it was Senator Chaney who should answer me because when we arrived here on Tuesday morning in order to hear the Government bring down its Budget I found on my desk the new Ministerial Directory dated August 1982 and I looked in vain through that document for any indication that there was a ministry of housing. In fact it transpires that in May of this year the Mr Fraser who posed on Tuesday night as the friend of the family man, the friend of the average Australian trying to build a home and to compete-</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This friend of the children who, unless they are the concern of Senator Walters's committee, should live in homes with their families, this poser, abolished the ministry of housing. As I have said, one seeks in vain in the Ministerial Directory to find who has ministerial responsibility for this most important segment of our social life, namely, the housing of Australians. But I do not suppose it should come as a shock that ordinary, average Australians are so disregarded by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). After all, despite the constant pleas in this chamber from Senator McLaren for the Prime Minister to take his Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, under control in relation to the home loan mortgage of $17,964 which was granted to the Deputy Prime Minister at a fixed rate of interest of 4.75 per cent back in 1964 and of which $15,000 or so is still outstanding, the Prime Minister has failed to take up with the Deputy Prime Minister the absolute obscenity, by way of contrast, of the Deputy Prime Minister, earning $99,200 a year in salary and allowances, paying off a $17,000 mortgage at a rate of only 4.75 per cent due to Government largesse. So it is not surprising that a Prime Minister who ignores such activity on the part of his Deputy Prime Minister should fail even to establish a ministry of housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I am really surprised about and why I continue to press the Budget provisions dealing with housing assistance is that in that Budget at page 15 we read:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to ask the Reserve Bank of Australia to consider making a release of one percentage point from the Statutory Reserve Deposits it holds from the major trading banks for the special purpose of lending for housing. Any such release would, of course, be additional to the amount of $400 million the major banks agreed to increase their home lending by earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA>My question relates to the fulfilment by the major banks of that promise given last March to release an extra $400m into housing assistance for Australians seeking loans because it is my contention that there is no evidence whatsoever that the banks have gone one iota towards fulfilling that promise. The Senate will recall the deal. The banks were given an increase in interest rates last March in return for a promise to release an extra $400m into housing assistance. That promise has not been fulfilled. One finds, for example, comment from the Housing Industry Association whose Executive Director is Mr Bill Kirkby-Jones, normally strongly supportive of the Government's initiatives in this area. On 18 March in the immediate aftermath of the Government's announcement of its home assistance scheme Mr Kirkby-Jones said that the policy would dramatically increase home ownership opportunities for ordinary Australian families and be of immeasurable assistance to the industry. But of course by 9 August 1982 he was saying:</PARA>
<PARA> From a peak of 149,160 new dwelling commencements in 1980-81 it is estimated that home building activities slumped to below 130,000 commencements in 1981-82. Even taking into account the improved deposit assistance scheme, the tax rebate and the additional $400 million to be lent by the banks, we now forecast that new dwelling commencements will not be more than 117,000 in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA>So even taking into account the possibility that the banks would keep their promise, the prediction is made that new dwelling commencements will fall dramatically. Such has been the disenchantment of the Housing Industry Association. What is the cause for that disenchantment? The fact is that the Government has failed to require the banks to honour their promise. The banks claim that their inability to fulfil the promise is due to Government decisions. What has happened since March? In the month immediately succeeding the announcement of the package, that is, April, we were told that the number of home loans approved by all major housing lenders during April was the lowest in 6 1/2 years since the Australian Bureau of Statistics had kept the relevant statistics. The immediate aftermath of the Government's housing package was to see the lowest home building period in Australia's recent history, and the bankers and home lenders blamed Government decisions for bringing that about. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two Government decisions that are relevant. First, the banks claimed that the Government had failed to bring forward legislation reducing the amount they were required to place in deposits and government securities from 40 per cent to 15 per cent. That is directly attributable to Government failure to bring forward the legislation necessary to support its package. Secondly, the Government instituted a new series of Aussie bonds. The Government raised the interest rate in such a way, of course, that whilst it served the Government's money supply goals of taking money out of circulation in the community and geting it into Australian savings bonds the fact is that as that interest rate rose so, too, householders took their funds out of the savings banks and other home lending institutions and put them into the bonds.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of two Government decisions moneys were said not to be available from the banking sector. So when the banking sector spokesman, Mr Cameron, said in the middle of June that the banks might not be able to fulfil the promise, the Prime Minister reacted extremely angrily and fiercely and said that they had to fulfil the promise. But nothing has emerged by way of Government action, whether by way of legislation to underpin the package or by way of adjusting the interest rate on Australian savings bonds to enable the banks' claims that they are unable to fulfil their part of the bargain because of Government action to be met. But whether or not the banks' claims are justifiable is something which I would like to put to one side because the fact is that the deal was done; they got their rise in the interest rate, a rise which continues to contribute to the massive profits which one finds in the banking sector. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no more profitable sector in Australia at the moment whether one takes the retail, the resources-based or the manufacturing sector, than the banking sector. The latest figures available in relation to 1981 profits show that the Commonwealth Banking Corporation made a $135m profit; the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd made $204m; the Bank of New South Wales made $165m; the Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd made $85m; the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Ltd made $44m; and the National Bank of Australasia Ltd made $103m. The major firms in any other sector of the Australian economy cannot claim to be as profitable as the banking sector. Yet it fails to fulfil its promise to make available an extra $400m for Australian home purchases-a firm promise made in March of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> What we need to obtain and what the Government must press to obtain from the banking sector is first of all an announcement of how much of the $400m extra home assistance has found its way into the economy via mortgage arrangements made to this point through the various banks right around Australia. As something like six or seven months have elapsed since the deal was made one would expect that some $200m extra would by now have reached home buyers. Has it indeed reached home buyers and then gone into the building industry with all its multiplier effects for the good of our economy? That is something which we deserve to know. In order to satisfy ourselves as to the veracity of that reply we need to know exactly how much each bank has loaned for housing in each of the immediately preceding two or three years. It is only if we know that figure that we can know whether indeed an extra $400m has been brought into the housing assistance area. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government has not been firm enough with the banks in not insisting that that disclosure take place. I believe that the various banks have said that to so reveal to the Government their individual home lending history over the past couple of years would affect their competitive position. It would be the disclosure of information which they regard as necessarily confidential and which they do not want disclosed. I would be surprised if some arrangement could not be reached between Mr Cameron of the Australian Bankers Association and the Treasurer, Mr Howard, or the Prime Minister himself, whereby those figures could be disclosed in a totally confidential context but one which would enable us to know whether indeed the major trading banks were fulfilling their part of the bargain. There is no doubt that an extra $400m provided for housing would be of assistance. The Parliament has the right to know whether the deal that was done, whereby this Government increased home interest rates for ordinary average Australians, has in fact been fulfilled or indeed has any prospect of being fulfilled. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take advantage of this first reading debate to ask the question: How should Australia react to the likely constitutional changes recently announced by the Prime Minister of the Republic of South Africa, Mr P. W. Botha? The proposals, as outlined over the weekend of 30 and 31 July 1982 to the Sixth Federal Congress of the National Party in Bloemfonteim, are clearly the most radical changes proposed to the South African Constitution this century. Not only would they demolish the existing Westminster parliamentary system but also, for the first time, they would involve both coloured and Asians in a limited form of power sharing. The system of government in South Africa is at present, of course, in the form of a single chamber of white representatives elected by a totally white franchise. A new Prime Minister is elected by the majority party, the National Party, which has ruled South Africa for over 30 years. A nominated Presidential Council, which replaced the former nominated Senate, has a purely advisory capacity. The cornerstone of the platform of the National Party has been and still is apartheid, that is, the separate development of the races.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Races in South Africa are divided into whites, coloureds, Asians and blacks. The determination of race is made at birth. Ideally, from a nationalist point of view, each race should have a separate government and, if possible, even a separate national status. Thus, we see the development of the concept of independent homelands for blacks-theoretically, to return blacks to their traditional ethnic or tribal lands, to put a boundary around such lands, to set up a separate form of black government and then to offer inducements for the homelands to become independent and separate from the Republic. But the homelands may in fact be pieces of land scattered over a wide area, such as in the case of Kwazulu which consists of more than 40 different portions of land. To obtain government benefits, for example a pension, blacks must accept citizenship of these homelands, thus forfeiting status as a national of the Republic. Instead, they become a national of the independent home state nation. Ultimately and theoretically citizenship of the Republic can be limited then to non-blacks. I say 'theoretically' because it does not resolve the problem of urban blacks. </PARA>
<PARA> The South African Government, however, has always had a particular problem with coloureds and Asians, who cannot, of course, be easily allocated to homelands to accommodate their separate development. The Government has encouraged the development of the Coloured Council and the Indian Council. That has not, however, settled easily within the concept of apartheid and has been a thorn in the side of the Government for a long time. Further, in recent times the Indian Council in particular has become more vocal in its demands for power sharing; thus the Government has decided to move. What does the Government now propose? Basically, it proposes to establish a three-chamber parliament-a white chamber, a coloured chamber and an Asian chamber. There would be a new position of executive president, the occupant of that position being elected by means of an electoral college chamber with membership in the ratio of 50 whites, 25 coloured and 30 Asians. That would be a likely ratio based on the size of each chamber. Each chamber would be elected by the franchise of its own race. The executive president would determine his Cabinet and thus the national government. The executive president would also decide whether a legislative matter was of a nature common to all chambers, in which case, if the chambers were in dispute over the matter, it would be settled by the new president's council, which would have binding authority. The new president's council would be partly elected by the three chambers in the ratio of 20 whites, 10 coloureds and five Indians, with the president himself appointing the remaining 25 members. </PARA>
<PARA> What does this mean? It means the continuation of apartheid, of separate races electing their separate representatives. It means continued entrenchment of white rule in that whites will control the election of the president and the composition of the president's council. However, it does not mean that coloureds and Asians will, for the first time, have a voice in the national legislature. It means that for the first time there will be a possibility of there being coloured or Asian Cabinet Ministers. It does mean that there is just the slightest possibility that the Progressive Federal Party may, in the future, win seats at the expense of the National Party and may one day join with the coloureds and Asians to elect other than a National Party president. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that. More than 70 per cent of the population of South Africa is black. That is the critical point. How do they fare under the new package? The answer is, of course, that they do not fare at all. The National Party envisages no place for the black majority in the National Government or parliament. The National Party remains committed to government for blacks within their homelands. The only mention of the black majority in the package was that the Prime Minister would, in November, call a summit meeting of heads of government of the independent homelands to devote further attention to the principles upon which the envisaged confederation of southern African states would be based. Thus, the black states would combine with the minority coloured and Asian states in a form of federation for certain purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The development of the homelands is a fiction which has been created to further the principle of apartheid. In practice, the homelands are not limited to one tribal or ethnic group. The methods adopted to induce blacks to resettlement within the homelands have been an international disgrace. The concept of thousands of blacks being bused and trained out of the homeland every day, often literally with hours of travelling each way to work in the urban areas, is totally socially disruptive. The concept that the homelands can become truly independent is a sham. One only has to raise the subject of defence and the defence responsibilities and rights of the homelands for that to be obvious. If the homelands are a sham, the proposed confederation of independent states must be equally a sham. To Australia, the forced separation of the races is immoral. There is little in the new package which corrects that immorality. For the South African Government even to acknowledge that there should be some minimal role for coloureds and Indians in central government is a dramatic step and, therefore, I suppose some credit should be given. There is a danger if we fail to recognise small change. There have been similarly considerable moves in the integration of sport. I sometimes feel that we have erred in not acknowledging the change that has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> A few weeks ago in Johannesburg I witnessed the running of the annual Nashua Johannesburg marathon, a multiracial event won by the brilliant black athlete Vincent Rakabaeli, to the wholehearted support and encouragement of many thousands of white spectators. As is often the case in sport, there was controversy, but it was about whether professionals should be allowed to run against amateurs, not whether whites should run against blacks. Change is occurring, perhaps to us ever so small, but to many in South Africa ever so great. Those who are advocating and supporting change deserve and should receive our support. A solution of the racial problems of South Africa is difficult to find. To some, such as President Comrade Mugabe in Zimbabwe and President Kaunda in Zambia, the answer is simply full adult franchise and majority rule. To white South Africans this would be seen as the destruction of their society. White government in South Africa has a major preoccupation with white security. </PARA>
<PARA> South Africa is a rich and powerful country. One is often reminded that the per capita income of blacks in South Africa is higher than that of blacks anywhere else on the African continent. To black nationalists this is a consequence of the immense natural resources of the country and the exploitation of cheap black labour. That is true, but there are also other countries in Africa with both natural resources and abundant cheap labour. The distinction has been that South Africa has had a white population of great determination, rigidity and a work ethic that has enabled utilisation of resources to the benefit of all. The failure has been in the inadequate distribution of the rewards, based upon a belief that the blacks are not only less advanced by white standards but also racially inferior. Fortunately, this view is changing but the concept of black majority rule terrifies the whites because of the anticipated backlash, which they believe would destroy all that they have built and achieved. Thus, whilst we must philosophically and conceptually advocate the principles of democratic majority rule for all nations, including South Africa, it may be unrealistic to expect this to happen in the Republic without offering the white minority some form of security which may be unnecessary in a society such as ours. </PARA>
<PARA> Some will argue that Zimbabwe is evidence of the fact that there can be a transition to black majority rule without appropriation of the property or liberty of minorities. However, there are those in Zimbabwe who argue that it is now time for the second war of liberation, to finish the job, and the somewhat moderate leadership of Robert Mugabe will have to meet a significant challenge in withstanding that pressure. Thus, perhaps we should be more vocal in supporting policies such as that advocated by the Progressive Federal Party in South Africa-calling for full adult franchise with majority rule but nevertheless an entrenched protection for minority interests. That position may offer a compromise which, during an interim period, would allow blacks to achieve reasonable aspirations yet offer the white minority adequate security to accept change. Let us not only condemn the inflexible, but also applaud the moderates and recognise change. </PARA>

Mr Nixon was asked in the House of Representatives today whether he supported the establishment of a sugar industry in the Kimberleys and the consequential and inevitable damage that would do to an already dangerously sick Queensland industry.

<PARA> The hallmark of the Court Government of Western Australia, and of the subsequent Liberal Government of that State, with regard to the Ord River and associated problems has been their economic indiscipline and illiteracy. The product of their sloth and irresponsibility includes the sinking already of $ 200m, in 1980 dollars, into the Ord River scheme-for a continuing negative return and continuing drain on the Western Australian Treasury. I turn now to some associated matters. Only last year the Court Government threw away $3m on a bulk grain loading facility in the port of Broome to load the sorghum that was supposed to have been produced at Camballin but had not been produced or even planted. At the time the grain loading facility was built the company was going into receivership. I told the Court Government that the company that was supposed to be producing sorghum was going into receivership; yet it went ahead and inflicted an additional loss of $3m on the Western Australian taxpayers for a now redundant and useless grain loading facility. It makes a good pair with the equally redundant and equally useless grain loading facility constructed at the port of Wyndham by the Court Government three years earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now deal with the specifics of Senator Crichton-Browne's speech-insofar as anything specific can be distilled from the sloppy and sometimes contradictory series of assertions that he made. He referred to what he euphemistically called extensive research on an 80-hectare demonstration farm run by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture and to the fact that sugar yields equivalent to 20 tonnes per hectare had been produced. That much is correct. He then accepted the glib assumption made by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture, in its so-called study of this matter that those yields-achieved under optimum conditions on a demonstration farm-would be the average commercial yields which would follow. All experience and agricultural research has shown that actual commercial yields will be in the vicinity of 70 per cent to 80 per cent of those produced under such highly favourable and optimum conditions on a demonstration farm. The glib assumption that demonstration or experimental yield will be repeated on a commercial scale was incorporated in previous sloppy submissions by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture regarding cotton production on the Ord. We know by now what happened to the Ord cotton industry and we know how accurate were those irrational and unprofessional assumptions by that Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The additional infrastructure cost associated with the establishment of a sugar industry in the Kimberleys as detailed in the Western Australian Department of Agriculture submission, should be viewed with at least equal suspicion. The Department's submissions have an appalling and well-earned reputation for economic incompetence. At various times it has supported assertions that sugar can be produced profitably on the Ord. Those assertions date back to 1962. It has also supported assertions that cotton, kenaf and rice could be produced profitably. Now we have come full circle and we are back to sugar. </PARA>
<PARA> The well-earned and well-documented reputation for incompetence of Western Australian Department of Agriculture submissions is not restricted to the Ord River. For example, in a submission delivered to the honorary royal commission on the dairy industry it argued against the negotiability of milk quotas on the novel ground that if milk quotas were negotiable the market price of the quota would rise and therefore the administered price of milk, ipso facto, must rise. Such a suggestion would be treated with the ridicule it deserved at any institution in Australia teaching agricultural economics. This came from an official submission of the Western Australian Department of Agriculture. The Western Australian Department of Agriculture is a hired gun of the Western Australian Liberal Party and no federal institution should accept any submissions it presents, on the Ord or on any other matter, without independent and competent examination. It is only a few months since the Western Australian Department of Agriculture condoned the nonsensical belief or assertion that ethanol could be economically produced in the Ord. Even the Western Australian Minister for Agriculture, Mr Old, and Senator Crichton-Browne now recognise that that is rubbish. It is a few short months since it was being condoned by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne also mentioned CSR Ltd and Bundaberg Sugar Co. Ltd. He cited their professed interest in the Ord as evidence or proof of its economic viability. CSR is a monopolistic sugar marketer. Bundaberg Sugar is a major participant in the sugar industry at various levels. If any government is going to throw away money conscripted from its taxpayers on a sugar industry in the Kimberleys, CSR and Bundaberg understandably will be quite happy to take it. They will be quite happy to extend their monopolistic and oligopolistic control of the industry. The crucial point, however, is whether they would put up their own money. Are CSR and Bundaberg Sugar so confident of the economic viability of this proposal that they will put their own money into it? If they were so confident, actions of the Loan Council, actions of the Federal Government and even the pockets of the Western Australian taxpayers would be redundant and irrelevant. If CSR and Bundaberg Sugar were willing to put their money where Senator Crichton-Browne says their mouths are, there would not even be any need for the matter to be debated in this Parliament. I suggest that one does not have to be too suspicious or cynical to say that the very fact that CSR and Bundaberg Sugar will not put in any of their own money tells us what their real evaluation of the viability of the project is. These companies will no more put their own money into a Court pipe dream than that great advocate of private enterprise, Sir Charles Court, was willing to put his money into his pipe dream and into fleshing out his personal obsession. One would have thought that such a great advocate of private enterprise as Sir Charles Court would have been only too eager to pass the hat around among his Liberal Party friends in the Western Australia business community, notorious tax dodgers like Denis Horgan and Sid Corser, and get them to subscribe the capital. What has happened to the entrepreneurial spirit and entrepreneurial drive so venerated by Sir Charles Court? What did he do? Did he solicit private capital? No, he conscripted taxpayers' money because he knew that no sen- sible private enterprise would sink its money into a scheme with so little prospect-if one goes back to the construction of the dam itself, no prospect-of economic viability. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne referred to world sugar cycles. It is correct that over the last 20 years and probably longer there have been not entirely regular but nevertheless cyclical movements in the price of sugar associated with the expansion of the production base in various countries in response to a preceding period of abnormally high prices. Senator Crichton-Browne argued that because that was so and because there would be a four year time lag between a decision to produce sugar on the Ord and significant sugar production, there was no need for the Queensland industry to worry. As I said, although not regular those sugar cycles have been a feature of world sugar prices in the past. But there are reasons to believe that that cyclical pattern will change, if not be eradicated. For example, a new factor pointed out in a recent issue of the Queensland Sugar Journal was that for the first time the European Economic Community is producing large surpluses of beet sugar, heavily subsidised, and is dumping them at below production costs on the world market. The United States of America is producing large quantities of corn syrup, a near product and an acceptable commercial substitute for sugar for many end uses. So although it has happened in the past, especially when new and important factors or variables have entered into the question it does not necessarily follow that the sugar cycle will be repeated. </PARA>
<PARA> He then put the extraordinary and sloppy proposition that Western Australian competition would not hurt Queensland. That reminds me of Mr Anthony's statement a month or six weeks ago in defence of concessional interest rates for certain groups. He said that it is possible for certain groups to be granted loans and concessional rates at low interest without hurting anyone else. Of course, it is not possible for that to happen. It is possible for some people to believe it, providing they also believe in magic. Again one would not be too cynical to suggest that in Mr Anthony's case there may have been an element of self- interest in that statement, since he is the most notorious recipient of a low interest loan in the country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must respond to a few of the points made by Senator Walsh. I will have a close look at his speech in Hansard later and prepare a more detailed response for later presentation. The first point is that I doubt whether any of us here at present had any say in the decision to build the dam on the Ord River. But it is a fact of life. It is a magnificent dam which, at the moment, holds a volume of sweet water 23 times that of the Sydney Harbour. One of the points Senator Walsh made was in regard to what he called the wastage in building a sorghum loader in Broome. I am sure that Senator Walsh would have been the most vehement critic of the State Government if the sorghum crop had turned out as most people had anticipated and there was no facility to load the sorghum at Broome. I think that his point is totally unsustainable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne pointed out in his address that it would take four years to establish a sugar industry in the Ord River area. It can be demonstrated very clearly, and I am sure that Senator Walsh understands this point very well, that demands for sugar in the world change very quickly. Within that four years I am sure that there will be many ups and downs in world demand for sugar. In 1976, when my Senate Committee was conducting an inquiry into Australia's water resources, we received evidence from the Queensland sugar producers very strongly making the case for the Burdekin dam and using increased sugar production in that area as one of the justifications for that dam. The projections they made then for the increased demand for Australian sugar to the year 2000 have been fairly closely followed. There have been many ups and downs in the intervening period, but they have been generally followed. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last 20 years the increase in sugar production from Queensland and New South Wales has averaged about 5 per cent a year and is almost precisely what the Western Australian industry is asking for as a share of the Australian market. The 160,000 tonnes of sugar required to create a viable industry on the Ord River mentioned by Senator Crichton-Browne is equivalent to the annual increase in Australia's production over the last 20 years and is less than the best estimates in the last few years of the increase in production from now to the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting to hear Senator Walsh today and to hear Labor Party spokesmen during the fairly recent North Province election campaign, in which all the Labor spokesmen during that campaign very strongly supported a sugar industry on the Ord River. I guess that one learns to be cynical in politics, but I think that that stretches even that evaluation. Recently John Kerin, the spokesman for the Labor Party on primary industry, condemned the attempts to develop a sugar industry on the Ord River, but it is interesting that he saved those remarks until after completion of that North Province by-election. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a new factor that Senator Walsh also ignored. I have heard about it, but I have not been able to substantiate it yet. I understand that West Germany, at least, and possibly the whole of the European Economic Community, have changed their attitude and policy with regard to the subsidisation of export sugar. As Senator Walsh mentioned, there are large stocks of sugar in the EEC. The EEC refuses to sign any international agreements with regard to the orderly marketing of sugar in the world, and for that it must be roundly condemned. The EEC is the largest producer of sugar in the world and it refuses consistently to sign any international sugar agreements. I have not been able to substantiate this, but I understand that the policy has changed quite substantially and that there will be far less, if any, assistance given to the export sugar industry in West Germany. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that it will take four years to establish an industry on the Ord River . It does not need the Commonwealth's agreement to the establishment of the industry and export of sugar from Western Australia. I am not a lawyer, but I believe that a reading of section 99 of the Constitution will underline that point. All that the Ord is asking for is the equivalent of the annual increase in Australia's sugar production over the last 20 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on first reading of the Tobacco Charge Amendment Bill 1982 to express my concern about the growing unemployment in Australia, especially among young people, and the attitude of the Government, which is doing virtually nothing to help the situation. There is one area in which growth in employment can be achieved-the service industries. If we really settled down, we could keep many young people in continuous employment in the tourist industry. But what do we see? The Government is trying to do everything in its power to restrict those who run hotels and motels. In the Budget we have seen increases in tobacco and alcohol taxes. As we well know, charges and profits made in bars offset the cost of dining room or accommodation facilities. Travel in Australia is so costly today that it is impossible for many people to take annual leave, and there is simply no concern about that. The Government simply wants to milk the cow before it is in milk, and I think that is tragic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has no concern for people, of whatever age. It is concerned only to see that foreign investors come to Australia and bring their money. The Government does not want to take any initiatives to create jobs. Recently the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare investigated the problems of the homeless youth of Australia. I believe that every person who served on that Committee was appalled at the prevailing conditions. There should be a concerted effort to overcome the problems. There must be consultation with industry, with the tourist business, with hotels, with the transport industry, and with the trade union movement. That has not been done and there are no plans for it. We could employ many thousands more people. </PARA>
<PARA> Many years ago I was instrumental in bringing about a holiday service loading. This matter should be seriously examined. Many people in industry get a 17 1/2 per cent loading and some get as much as 25 per cent. Working people, indeed all people, are entitled to a holiday. There would be less disruption to families if all families were encouraged to take a holiday annually. There would be fewer family break-ups, fewer social disturbances and fewer people in hospitals. We are not looking at the unseen costs in this area. State and Federal Governments must pick up the bill when a family breaks up, and the cost of that is outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not seem to consider that it is important for a family to relax, to take time off, have a break from the worry of going to work and coming home, and all the hassles that occur in families. Because of economic circumstances many women do not get out of their homes for month after month. Is it any wonder that family traumas occur? Governments should seriously examine this proposition. We could create a new industry in this field. </PARA>
<PARA> Over 20 years ago I put up an argument that all working people should have a loading of about 100 per cent on their pay for holidays. State and Federal governments should seriously consider the possibility of setting up recreational centres all over the country for people to stay in on their annual leave. We should seriously examine the way aircraft could be chartered to fly holidaymakers from any part of Australia to other parts. With the co-operation of the tourist industry and the transport industry, we could create many thousands of new jobs, which would be well worth while. I said at that time that anyone who would not take a recognised holiday should not get the loading, and I am still of that opinion. The Government should seriously examine such a possibility. </PARA>
<PARA> We should be thinking about innovative ways of employing people. The disastrous effects of long periods of unemployment, especially on young people, are tragic. It is unbelievable that politicians in this country have no real concern about what is going on. We are simply destroying our people, and it is not good enough . We can do many things to overcome this. But there in not the consultation with all sections in the community to try to overcome this problem. That is what worries me. We think in the old traditional ways. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless we are prepared to take on innovative ideas I believe we will never get out of the problem. We are creating problems for the future which we do not comprehend. The worst thing we can possibly do is to destroy people. It is important for people to work, to feel they are wanted in the community, and to feel they have a responsibility. There is nothing worse that to not have work and to feel that one is not needed or wanted in the community. I think that is disgraceful. We can do something about it. It is a matter of the whole spectrum of people in the community, whether those people be politicians, trade unionists or business people, working together to do so. We could put this together if we really wanted to. </PARA>
<PARA> I must condemn this present Government for allowing unemployment to rise. The Government has now said openly that the rate of unemployment will increase alarmingly. Yet we still do nothing about it. This is a great country. Australia has a population of 15 million people, the majority of whom are well educated. Australians are healthy people. We have many natural resources at our fingertips . Yet we do not take advantage of them. Look at overseas countries which have teeming millions and immense problems. In comparison with those countries we do not have a problem at all. It is intolerable to allow the conditions which lead to the wasting of human beings to prevail. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that wherever one goes one sees children from very good families turning to drugs and all sorts of other evil ways. It is intolerable if we cannot think more of the family structure and if we cannot plan to have a better way of life. I believe Australia should be a showpiece for the world. Years ago in times of war Australia did all the things that everyone said we could not do. We started manufacturing from nothing. Where are the innovative ideas now? Surely if we get together and put on our thinking caps we can overcome these problems. All too often we think in the old traditional ways. As I have said, we should try to overcome these problems. It will not be an easy job. There has to be co-operation for this to happen. While governments do nothing about the situation and while they overtax some of the service industries, and take too much out of--</PARA>

What is life all about? Do we simply live for our own enjoyment or do we think something of our children? Of course we do.

<PARA> There is no need for extremes in this country. We have not had them in the past . Unless we solve the problems we will have all the violence and the terrible wrath and the feeling of hopelessness that comes out of unemployment. I do not believe this country should accept that situation. We should be showing the lead to many other countries. We do not have the problems which face many other countries. We are well endowed. It is about time we started to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and do a job that our forefathers did. They came to this country with very little finance and with their own efforts they started to put this country together. We are allowing it to fall apart. That is a great shame. We have to overcome the problem in a shorter term. We have accepted unemployment . That is what is worrying me-the fact that we are all starting to accept these figures. The figure of half a million unemployed is meaningless. But when one goes out into the real world and sees the great tragedy of what is happening to our people, especially young people, it is obvious that what we are not doing for them is unforgivable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity at the first reading stage of the Tobacco Charge Amendment Bill to make another contribution to the debate on the sugar industry. Senator Crichton-Browne, Senator Thomas and Senator Walsh have already referred to this matter. I believe it is useful to make a response. Doubtless, as a senator from Queensland, I will be considered biased in this discussion. I believe, however, that when one looks at the economic ramifications of the production of sugar in the Ord it must give us pause. We ought to be very careful about any continuing operation, development or impost of money on the Australian public to support another or a new sugar industry. I briefly outline, in distinction to what Senator Crichton-Browne said , that the sugar industry happens to be a major input into the Australian economy and not a drain on it. The industry is not supported by the Australian taxpayer. It provides the Australian taxpayer with an enormous amount of export earnings. Indeed, sugar is our fifth largest export item.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problems in the industry at present arise from a world surplus of sugar. The current figures indicate that of a world production of 97 million tonnes the most rosy optimism puts world consumption at only 90 million tonnes, which leaves us with a world surplus of 7 million tonnes of sugar being produced every year. If one takes that into consideration one has to go very quietly on this notion that there are ups and downs. There have been ups and downs in the past and there will be in the future. As an economic argument that does not hold terribly much weight. Certainly in terms of any reasonable prediction at the moment it would give anyone pause. In a moment I will refer to the reason that CSR Ltd, for example, might wish to go into the Ord River region. It would be on a commercial proposition, but there are some things tied to that which compel CSR to go into the Ord, whether it likes it or not. I will come to that in a moment. With world production at 97 million tonnes, we have to look at what other recent inputs there have been to the world market that would place the Australian industry in difficulty. I think the major recent one of those is the imposition of the United States import quotas. Despite what the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) consistently says-he consistently manages to get his sums wrong in this area-probably the most that we can look at importing into the United States market while quotas are in place will be 200,000 tonnes of sugar, which leaves us, on current exports, which I admit are at record levels, some 150,000 tonnes down. That is an absolutely massive drop. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other factors is that twice in the last six months, the international sugar price has gone through the floor. If we look at the London price, which is probably about the best indicator in this area, and if we look at the forward future market in this area, there is not much joy. Certainly anybody going into futures in sugar would need to be very careful at the moment.</PARA>

I want to give an indication of where we are actually going and why the ups and downs that we have had may not bottom out quite as rapidly as they did in the four years that Senator Crichton-Browne was talking about. The time span is not there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Prices are about 70 to 75 per cent of what they were 18 months ago. I agree with Senator Thomas on that. Having taken those aspects into consideration though, what else is a problem in the Australian market? One of the other major problems is that the innovative person in the Queensland industry, the person who really got off his backside and worked hard in recent years, because we have had excellent, record crops, sought to expand his property. But this person has now been caught in a double pincer movement, first from lowering levels of sales and, secondly, from high interest rates. That is causing a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> If one travels through the Queensland sugar area one sees sugar farms on the market and advertised in real estate agencies. that is something we would not have seen last year. Traditionally, sugar farms in Queensland have not changed hands on the open market. The sale of a sugar farm in Queensland has been an in- market operation. If a sale was coming up, people in the industry knew that the farm was coming on to the market and it was bought before anyone outside the industry got to hear anything about it. But that is not the case now. Farms are advertised in the windows of real estate agencies and they are not being sold. </PARA>

Quite frankly, that is about all that will get us out of our difficulties. That may account for an up- swing. At the moment I do not see it happening. Acts of God are very useful, but they do not come on call. My worry is that we do not have anywhere to go in the international sugar market and to be established and expanding a new industry at this time would undermine our credibility. It is a Commonwealth matter, precisely because the Commonwealth is a signatory to the International Sugar Agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me put another point. This may seem a parochial point to many people, but it weighs very heavily with the Queensland growers. The Queensland growers have been operating under quotas since 1929. They have taken less, they have planted less, for economic reasons. Those economic reasons have been in part Queensland reasons, but they have also, since 1937, been Australian reasons because of the Commonwealth-Queensland sugar agreement. There have been many occasions when the sugar industry in Queensland has had to bear the brunt, as it is doing at present, of the domestic sugar price agreement. Indeed, if we take everything into account, at the moment we are actually selling sugar in Australia at less than the cost of production. That is a cuckoo land operation and certainly cannot go on. That comes basically from a technical difficulty in the domestic sugar price agreement but I do not intend to go through that at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to those people who have been operating in the industry for a long time that I think there would be a certain amount of justice in their saying to somebody coming into the industry: 'How about coming in on roughly the same terms that we have been operating under? Don't just drop in on top'. I think an expansion at this point in time would make it extremely difficult to maintain the high efficiency of the sugar industry. I think it is beyond doubt-certainly nobody has thrown any doubt on this so far-that the sugar industry is one of our most efficient rural industries. It has constantly updated its technology. It has constantly sought new methods of efficient operation and production. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to the South Korean connection. The South Korean connection in this matter is fairly obvious and presumably anybody who knows anything about the Ord scheme certainly understands the South Korean connection. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me put a number of propositions which seem to me to be reasonable, although possibly sometimes difficult to substantiate, in order to paint a scenario as to why CSR, for example, cannot afford not to go into the Ord. First, if the Ord produced a couple of hundred thousand tonnes of sugar, which I believe is what is in Senator Thomas's mind in terms of what Korea might be looking at, certainly in its home market this would substitute our international sugar quota . Korea could also organise the price, of course, to make the investment in the Ord enterprise justifiable in commercial terms. A thoroughly flexible price exists in the internal market. There is no difficulty in Korea making it an economic proposition to grow sugar in the Ord area. If production there exceeded Korea's domestic requirements, there would be absolutely nothing to stop-indeed, the Commonwealth would have absolutely no legal way of stopping-the sales of excess production on the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA> I disagree partly with Senator Walsh. From the technical details that I have seen I am led to believe that, in terms of efficiency and quality of sugar, the Ord scheme would probably present fairly heavy competition. However, I certainly agree with Senator Walsh that the interpolation of an experimental plot into an actual commercial operation is something that one ought never to undertake, certainly not in the way that Senator Crichton-Browne did. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us say that Korea's domestic requirements fell below the Ord River's production. In that event, obviously the Ord would sell into the Australian market. In a way, they would be selling cheap sugar. The sale of this cheap sugar would render CSR's domestic milling operations uneconomic. I estimate that roughly 20 per cent of CSR's milling operation could be substituted by an Ord operation. One reason CSR has to go is to protect its own investment. Secondly, the distribution of sugar moneys between millers and growers-the CSR exercise is the one I am looking at in particular-would also put South Korea in the box seat in relation to refining and possibly also would destroy CSR on its home ground. Again, on the figures that I have seen it would be an economic proposition, so why not? Again it is a very good reason why CSR should go in and protect its own patch of the market. I think that the types of argument that Senator Crichton- Browne put up by saying that these reputable companies will not go into an operation which is not commercial is very true, but one has to look behind the industry politics to see, first, why the operation would be commercial-I think I have put at least one reasonable proposition on why that would be so-and, secondly, why a company like CSR or Bundaberg Sugar or anybody else could not afford to stay out, simply because their own impetus, their own raison d'etre for existence, is to make a profit. Therefore, companies have to look ahead, trim their markets and enter into agreements to make sure that such a potential operator in a domestic area will not seriously disrupt their production levels. </PARA>

There are also justifiable claims that Australia ought to protect its export markets in the international scheme and be excessively careful not to be seen at a time of world sugar glut to be setting up a new industry in competition with our well- established industries and selling against ourselves to our ultimate detriment.

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Tobacco Charge (No. 1) Act 1955 which was the subject of an amending Bill-the Tobacco Charge (No. 1) Amendment Bill 1982-which was introduced in the Senate on 11 March 1982 and which had its second reading on 28 April 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The amending Bill increased to 2.5 cents per kilogram the rate of charge to be paid for the purposes of meeting the costs of operation of the Australian Tobacco Board and providing funds for research. It provided for the rate of charge to be made higher or lower by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> A maximum rate of charge was not specified in the Bill. The intention was to avoid the need for further legislation at some time in the future for the sole purpose of increasing the maximum rate. </PARA>
<PARA> It has now been accepted that the principle of stating a maximum in the legislation, as has been done in all rural industry research legislation in the past, should be applied in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will establish a maximum rate of charge of 6 cents per kilogram. It will be possible for the operative rate of 2.5 cents per kilogram to be increased up to that ceiling by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The history of this legislation reflects badly on the administrative efficiency of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon). A package of three Bills-the Tobacco Charge Bill (No. 1), the Tobacco Charge Bill (No. 2) 1982 and the Tobacco Charge Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1982-one of which is being debated, was set down for debate in the Senate on 4 May. On that day I was told that amendments would be moved in the Senate and the Bills were not debated. On 5 May an altered set of Bills was introduced in the House of Representatives and, I might say, apparently drafted, debated and passed within 24 hours. This further documents the Minister's inefficiency and incompetence. These Bills increase the research levy paid by growers and manufacturers of tobacco and provides for further increases in that levy up to a maximum of 2 1/2c per kilogram to be imposed by regulation. The Opposition supports the Bills. We understand that the tobacco growers and tobacco manufacturers do likewise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Both the extent and emphasis of tobacco research fortunately have changed. The current emphasis is on reducing the usage of fertilisers and chemicals both for cost production reasons and in order to ameliorate, or in the hope of ameliorating a quite serious pollution problem which has developed in some tobacco growing areas. Research is also being directed-I do not wish to provoke Senator Elstob or touch off another slanging match between him and Senator Peter Baume-towards producing strains of tobacco which will be less injurious to health. Senator Elstob is not here anyway so I will not touch off anything. </PARA>
<PARA> There is very strong evidence that money generally spent on agricultural research is money wisely invested. Even in the purely economic sense, although one can never be certain in advance of whether any particular research project will pay its way, the aggregate of the evidence that is available from agricultural research supports very strongly the view that money spent in that research is money wisely invested, and that at least to some extent further money spent on agricultural research will also be wisely invested. In this case, apart from the economic reasons for increasing research expenditure, which is largely funded by industry but also funded to some extent by the Commonwealth, other than purely economic objectives are being pursued and, it is hoped, can be achieved. The Opposition supports the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am in a slightly difficult position because I have not been able to get hold of a copy of the Tobacco Charge Amendment Bill. My understanding is that the Bill we are debating is one which has replaced another Bill and one which now picks up the criticisms which the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills made in its fourth report and acknowledged in its seventh report. The original Tobacco Charge Amendment Bill permitted the making of regulations to increase charges. It was thought that removing the ceiling on amounts that could be specified in regulations might be an inappropriate delegation of legislative power to the Minister concerned. I understand-I take this on trust-that the Bill we are debating does indeed pick up the criticisms which were made in the Committee's report. In that sense I thank the Government for having noted those recommendations and having acted in accordance with them. The Bill is now at hand and I see that the regulation power is indeed different. I think it accords with the recommendations of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On this rather piecemeal approach to family law reform, I understand that I have five minutes to talk before the Senate by agreement will move to other business. Last night I reached the stage, also after a very short period, of looking at the matrimonial offences which existed under the old Matrimonial Causes Act as grounds for divorce. I commented upon the fact that grounds have been extended to cover separation. Whatever matrimonial offence was used as the ground for divorce, the status of the parties nevertheless came to be separation because of the fact that the offence could not be condoned if the action for dissolution was to be successful. It was therefore to me a small step to remove ''matrimonial offence'' and to look solely to separation as evidence of the destruction of the fabric of marriage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a practitioner under the old Matrimonial Causes Act and a witness of the bitterness, the hatred and the hunt to prove guilt, with the public record of matrimonial misbehaviour, and the apparent detrimental effect upon parties and children, I have little doubt that the changed legislation was the correct road to take. The question remained, however, as to what period of separation was necessary to show irreconcilable breakdown. The Parliament could have decided on a period of two years as is the case in Great Britain and which is still advocated by some sections of the community. I recognise, however, that there are some cases which involve a totally innocent spouse who should have every entitlement to terminate the legal tie of what has been an intolerable marriage. I do not see why that spouse should have to wait two years to take action. In Britain such a party would, of course, be covered by the additional matrimonial fault provisions but I would be equally disappointed to see a backward step in that direction. There are few professionals who would say that there is a reasonable chance of reconciliation after a period of separation of one year and I therefore believe that the Parliament of Australia earlier reached the right conclusion. I am pleased that this Bill does not propose to alter that situation . </PARA>
<PARA> It is impossible to evaluate with certainty the effect of the changes to the 1975 Act. I recognise that on its face it is the innocent who appear to have been aggrieved by its provisions. It is not always easy-in fact, it is generally difficult-to apportion guilt and innocence in matrimonial breakup but clearly in some cases there is a totally innocent, deserving spouse. That spouse may not only feel wronged within marriage but also could now have the marriage brought to an end by the guilty party after a relatively short period. I cannot, however , attempt to evaluate the psychological advantage or disadvantage to a spouse, on the one hand being able to prove publicly himself or herself wronged and, on the other hand, to hold out at his or her discretion for a period of five years against the interests of the guilty party. I cannot weigh that against the hurt of prolonging the period of time before the dissolution is reached, the period during which time such hurt is often nurtured. More dramatic, however, is the fact that we have now legislated for easy divorce. It is argued by some that divorce is now so easy that it tends to destroy the status of marriage. In other words it is argued that the law has failed in its responsibility to bastion the basic social institutions. It is an important charge deserving of serious consideration. It is a charge that I shall deal with on a future occasion. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that this report has probably stirred more interest in the academic and business industries than any other report for some considerable time. It has been part of the conference grist for the mill operation and has probably spawned its own little industry which hopefully will be good for business. I would like to make some comments about the types of assumptions that are made in the report and raise what I believe are some of the concerns that are being expressed, particularly in universities around Australia where business management has traditionally taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> Can I say at the outset that the report is not only limited to those institutions which are currently mentioned in it because many other institutions , not only universities but also colleges of advanced education, have a considerable stake in this area in one or the other. It is made very clear, of course, that the report does not deal with very large areas such as educational administration. Rather, it deals specifically with the direct notion of business education. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to turn to what I see as some of the major limitations of the report. First of all, I do not understand, and there is in fact no good reason given in the report, why management education should be considered only a post- graduate phenomenon. I think the report ignores-certainly the section of the report which deals with small business indicates that-the growing volume of generalist and functional undergraduate programs in the United States of America , Europe, Britain, Canada, South Africa and also Australia. Those generalist, functional types of operations are an innovative program and as such I believe ought to be fostered and continued particularly in respect of small business. I would refer here to much of the excellent work being done by the University of South Africa in relation to this phenomenon. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The major thrust of the report is one of organisation. It is concerned with the organisation of business management and makes a number of assumptions. The assumption to which I am referring is that this is a post- graduate phenomenon. It seems to me that is not an argued proposition; it is an assumed proposition within the report. I am putting a counter proposition that it should not necessarily be assumed that management education is a post- graduate phenomenon. I am pointing out how elsewhere in the world there has been a considerable increase in the undergraduate area, to a very effective level, I believe. This goes back to the point that small business requires in this area not only undergraduate but also diploma or non-certificated courses because people cannot really afford to do the higher level course. If we are considering only big business, presumably one might be looking only in this area. That is a further point that I wish to make later. In many of the masters programs that are being suggested, the emphasis seems to be very much on very large management operations and that we need management education right across the board in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, there is an assumption, in fact an assertion and some recommendations , that people cannot get an M.B.A., certainly a high quality M.B.A. at least, on a part time basis. I think that is a highly questionable assumption, and I wish to refer again to overseas courses in terms of innovative approaches and alternative systems. There are weekend executive programs where a person comes in for a weekend and then may not appear again for six to eight weeks for another weekend. These programs are geared very much to the idea of someone who is operating in the field but who needs additional support from an institution. At last count I was able to ascertain over 60 such programs are now in operation in America. I think it would be rather absurd if we were to go in the opposite direction from the extremely prestigious business schools such as the ones in Houston, Texas and Chicago. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the notion that there has to be some type of critical mass of students is a very attractive one on the surface, and presumably it would be attractive to government in terms of the amounts of money it is going to spend. However, a critical mass operation applied to other professional facilities in Australia would, I suggest, lead to uncontrollable operations. Indeed, when one suggests this in relation to other professions one sees the rather threadbare types of arguments and support that can be applied in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Another set of problems that I merely point to relates to an underestimation of the need for funding doctoral programs at a regional level. I believe that this ignores the reality of universities. If we are going to build a top class business school in one or two areas-the additional area outside Sydney as suggested in this report is Melbourne-then we will be in for a running down of our regional schools. There is no way in the world that we will attract a top class person to teach only undergraduates. The Government should not ignore what is a fact of employment life in universities. A top quality person will not put up with teaching only undergraduates. He will go to where he has doctoral students. It is a necessary gravitation. Such a proposal would kill off regional schools, thereby killing off the opportunity to do part time operations, to do in-house operations, and to have flexible delivery systems of the type that I have briefly referred to. Therefore, I think the notion, attractive though it may be as the central proposition in this report, that there be a national school has died. It is something out of the 1950s or the 1960s. Yes, it was good at that point. That is what we believed was really on. That was what we needed. We do not need it now and business does not need it now, except at the very top levels, and if it is at the very top levels people will probably be paid to go to Harvard, Chicago or Houston anyhow. That is what happens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I will acknowledge that so that it can go into the Hansard . The break between undergraduate and graduate education which the report suggests is, I believe, fundamentally at error in the university scene. I do not know how it came about, but it is in there. I think anybody who knows anything about the way universities operate and how we get quality post-graduates will realise there has to be continuity. This goes back partly to staff, partly to equipment, partly to the relationships between the institution and the outside society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The last point I have time today to make is a vital one. Although I hope that we can have a fuller debate on this because it is an extremely important issue. The ability of the universities or the colleges of advanced education to provide effectively in this area requires them to be integrated as fully as possible with the business they are serving. Therefore we need not massive national schools but quality schools in regional areas. One national school, I agree with . I do not think we need any more. We need quality regional schools that are linked in every State with their management, and it is the management which will provide the quality and the practical experience to the staff. Indeed, many colleges of advanced education and universities around Australia are using people from industry on a part time basis. I would like that idea to be promoted , and I hope that at some future stage we will be able to have a longer debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is my third attempt to continue the piecemeal discussion of family law reform. A little while ago I had reached the stage of the important problem having accepted that we legislated for simple and easy divorce, whether in doing so the legislature has failed in a social responsibility to support marriage. I support the responsibility of the community and the laws reflecting that responsibility to work against marriage breakdowns. Although the number of divorces has risen considerably now that the procedure is easier, I can find no evidence to show that the level of marriage breakdowns is rising. It may well be that in the past there were as many breakdowns of marriage but that the legal tie was not so often broken. I can see no reason why a marriage which is not a marriage should be supported by the law simply for the sake of preserving statistics. It may well be that the parties are separated or, even if they are not legally separated, living in an environment that is totally unsatisfactory to the well being of their children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The scheme of the Family Law Act is basically to deal with a situation in which a marriage breakdown has occurred and then to provide a humane, compassionate and effective forum for resolving matters between the parties and dealing with the future of the children. To claim that it is a function of this Act to bulwark the institution of marriage is to give it a role that was never envisaged. This misunderstanding, I believe, is at the root of so much of he criticism of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said that the community and the law have this responsibility to support the institution of marriage and the family. However, it is not the role of legislation designed to deal with a situation of resolving problems after a breakdown. It is true in some cases reconciliation may be possible and the Act must be flexible enough to allow for those few cases, but they will be rare exceptions. In the vast majority of cases when the parties commence proceedings under the Family Law Act and irreconcilable breakdown has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who condemn the Act as causing breakdown would do better to look to other ways in which the community and law can support marriage and the family-for example, in the encouragement of and, if necessary, financial assistance to, voluntary counselling organisations, in finding ways to overcome the stress of unemployment and in seeking ways to overcome the damage caused by financial pressures. Those who condemn the Act would do better to look to the income tax laws and ask whether those laws sufficiently recognise and support the institution of marriage. Quite clearly, to parties who are financially better off unmarried, they do not. The churches and social groups must recognise their support responsibility where much greater contribution can be made than in advocating technical changes to an Act dealing with the dissolution of marriage. Strengthening community support takes more than changing a law. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the Family Law Act principally concerns events after an irreconciliable breakdown. Therefore, the ones who most often suffer in such circumstances are the innocent, the children. Whether they suffer in addition by the severing of the legal tie is highly problematical. The community and law have a responsibility in relation to the innocent victims of marriage breakdown and divorce. Thus, it demands that simply because the parties have dissolved their marriage, they should each still have a responsibility for care and maintenance of the children until a court determines otherwise. In other words, the parents will retain joint custody. Obviously there are some circumstances in which one parent should have custody to the exclusion of the other. In some cases, the conduct of one party evidences a total failure of responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> In all cases, however, the primary consideration must be and is, in fact, what is in the best interests of the child. I am satisfied that, generally speaking, it is in the best interests of children if litigation is avoided. However, the community has a responsibility to satisfy itself that any agreement reached between the parties is in the best interests of the child. I believe the court should be able to order separate representation for children when it deems it appropriate. Similarly, if it is concerned as to the suitability of both parents , it should be able to include, as a party to the proceedings, an appropriate child welfare officer. The court should always take into account the wishes of the child. They should be weighed in the light of such factors as age and maturity but the court should not be bound by those wishes. Bearing in mind in particular the strength of parental influence, it is the court's overriding responsibility to make the decision on behalf of the community as to what is in the best interests of the child. </PARA>
<PARA> In matters of custody, parents should be able to bring proceedings before the court as soon as the separation occurs-again, the overriding consideration being what is in the best interests of the child. The behaviour of parents should be taken into account to the extent that it affects their suitability as parents and custodians. Therefore, in my opinion it is relevant to take into account behaviour which destroys a marriage or a stable family life because it may be relevant to whether or not the party is able to meet the responsibilities of a parent. Thus, evidence of promiscuity or cruelty appears to me to be relevant. It might run against the scheme of the Act but where the interests of children are concerned, those interests must be paramount. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be remembered that access is the right of the child, not the parent, and so similiar considerations apply. Courts should be able to vary custody and access orders when it is in the best interests of children to do so. Obviously it is better to get the correct decision in the first instance but mistakes do occur and circumstances change. Matters of custody and welfare of children should have priority over all other Family Court matters. On the death of a custodian, custody should not revert automatically to the other parent. The Court should be given greater guidance as to matters to be taken into account when deciding what is in the best interests of children. </PARA>
<PARA> I do, however, briefly raise a fundamental question which does not appear to have been addressed by the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act, and that is, the question of whether, in a helping situation, a legally qualified judge is best qualified to determine the major social matters involved. Although I am of the opinion that in every dispute concerning children there should be a thorough evaluation of the circumstances by a social worker who should report to the court, I still have reservations as to whether someone who is trained to determine questions of fact and to apply legal principles to such answers is best qualified to determine what is in the future best interests of the child. I would support contested custody cases being determined by a board consisting of a judge and two other persons who perhaps have experience in such fields as social welfare and child psychology. I recognise that increased costs would be involved but I see that as the price in the community must pay in best intersts of its children. </PARA>
<PARA> Questions of maintenance of the children also must be decided. In this case I believe both sides should be obliged by the community to meet the responsiblity to maintain their children, even if their marriage has broken down. As this is an obligation the community should impose, it should be enforced by the community not by the other spouse. The contribution of maintenance may be in personal service or it may be a monetary contribution according to the circumstances of the parents and according to such questions as where the child is primarily living. If the parents are unable to maintain the child the community as a whole must meet that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I find the subject of spouse maintenance more difficult. The Act, of course, provides for a limited obligation for a spouse to maintain the other, even in marriage. I see there is a strong argument that upon a dissolution not only should the spouse have a right of action to support maintenance but also the community should be entitled to bring that action to protect its financial interests. In marriage, often by mutual agreement the capacity of one party to maintain fairly himself or herself is detrimentally affected. If, through no fault of that person, the marriage is dissolved he or she may be considerably worse off. Therefore, it does not seem unreasonable to me that the other party should contribute to maintenance of the parties whose position has been financially detrimentally affected by the marriage. It is a decision, however, that should be made by the Court in all the circumstances. Thus the conduct of the claiming spouse must again be relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major area of dispute concerns property. As a general principle, I believe that property accumulated during a marriage should be shared equally at the dissolution of that marriage. Such a principle of community of property does not presently exist in this country although there have been trends in the courts in that direction. I would like the Court, however, to have greater guidance to that end. I have no objection to the parties to a marriage contracting questions of property but I still think the Court should have an overriding discretion. This would particularly be so when the interests of children might be affected by the contract. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other matters to which I wish to refer briefly. The first concerns injunctions. I believe there must be a power in the areas of custody, maintenance, property and principle relief to protect both the property interests and the physical wellbeing of the parties and children. Therefore, procedures for injunction must be continued. The second matter relates to reconciliation and conciliation. As I mentioned earlier, the unfortunate truth is that by the time the parties reach the Family Court the opportunity for reconciliation generally has passed. Court counsellors, because of the pressures of duty and the environment of the Court, may not be suitable reconciliators in any event. Therefore, I believe they must have a close working relationship with the marriage guidance councils, churches and other social groups which have the time to contribute and are prepared to contribute in this area. On the other hand, Court counsellors must work as conciliators with the aim of lessening the bitterness and distress where possible. They must work towards a sensible resolution of the interests of the parties, particularly of children, during the course of the divorce. The role of the court conciliators should be separate and distinct from that of welfare officers advising the Court. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area is in relation to the court's appellate jurisdiction. There has been considerable criticism of the frequency of conflicting decisions. It would appear that the range of judges in the appellate court is too great. I believe that if the current single judge court is to remain the appellate court should be more limited in number. If appeals are to be on questions other than law I believe that appellate judges should have the continuing experience of sitting at first instance. If my suggestions in relation to a broad sitting in contested custody matters were adopted I see no reason why there should be an appeal from such decisions on questions of fact. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth aspect concerns joint application. I recognise that legal purists and supporters of the adversary system in family law matters argue against such applications. However, I believe that their view is outdated, that where parties are in agreement and the period of separation has taken place they should be able jointly to initiate an action to bring the marriage to an end. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth area concerns what is misleadingly referred to as divorce by post. It is, of course, not divorce by post. It differs from current procedure only in that if the respondent has no objection the applicant need not attend in person or be represented by counsel. The determination is still made on the same evidence, that of the application and the supporting affidavits. The advantage is stated to be a saving of court time and costs. It makes divorce easier only to the extent that it saves counsel fees if counsel is, in fact, to be engaged. The position of the respondent is protected in that the court must still be satisfied as to the basic facts and, in any event, the respondependent can object to the procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> I found this a difficult question to decide, particularly when children of the marriage are involved. In such circumstances I believe that the applicant, or counsel, should appear. I say that notwithstanding that I recognise that under section 63 of the Act the court must nevertheless be satisfied as to the circumstances of the children before the decree may become absolute. If in such circumstances a report by a welfare officer as to the arrangements for children being satisfactory, were submitted I would be less concerned. When questions affecting children are not involved and there is no objection by the respondent I see no real reason why the change recommended by the Joint Committee, one which is in operation in Britain, should not be supported. However, I believe that the court should specify a date on which the matter will be considered so that evidence of certainty will be retained. I have considered the contrary arguments advanced, such as respect for the solemnity of the situation, but cannot see that the failure of counsel or applicant to attend the final stage makes any difference whatsoever. It might be argued that it makes divorce just a little bit easier but, as I have indicated, I believe that is attempting to place upon the Act a responsibility which is not its obligation. </PARA>
<PARA> Sixthly, ideally I prefer closed hearings on family law matters. That may well be a prejudice which I developed in witnessing abuse under the Matrimonial Causes Act. However, it is consistent with my earlier argument that the community has an interest in seeing whether the obligations that it imposes on parties, as to maintenance, custody et cetera, are carried out. There has often been criticism that the court is not meeting its obligation to the community. Therefore, I am prepared to accept that some scrutiny is wise and, accordingly, to accept the recommendations of the Joint Committee as a fair compromise. </PARA>
<PARA> The seventh point concerns costs. The jurisdiction obviously requires considerable financial support by the community. Therefore I accept that, as a general proposition, costs should not be ordered. In some cases children require representation and it is more important that they be represented than that the costs involved should be raised. I would like to see left to the court discretion to issue orders for costs in cases of vexatious and unmeritorious litigation and appeals. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there is the subject of the Family Law Council and the Institute of Family Studies. I have argued today that the need for support in the prevention of marriage breakdown is paramount, but this can be better achieved by extending our knowledge in such areas as family stress. Therefore, I wholeheartedly support the concept of the Institute of Family Studies and the work that it is doing. There should be a continuing review of the court and other instrumentalities in the field and, similarly, I support the Family Law Council and its contribution in most difficult areas. It is within the scheme of this speech that, at the Committee stage, I will approach the question of individual amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I take the opportunity to bring to the attention of the Senate the major findings of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare, as set out in its report entitled 'Homeless Youth'. The report comes at a time when there is strong interest and concern in the community about unemployment, poverty, family breakdown and the basic fabric of society itself. Our report covers all these areas, but it is important to realise that our terms of reference concerned matters affecting homeless youth and not the community at large. Therefore, the findings and recommendations of the Committee do not come up with a blueprint for an overall community strategy to deal with these problems, rather a strategy to deal specifically with the question of homeless youth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this regard the Committee has developed a 12-point strategy which it urges both government and the community-which includes families particularly-to acknowledge and recognise. Later I will seek permission to have those 12 points incorporated in Hansard. In assessing the nature of the problem it was apparent that a large proportion of homeless youth come from broken families or families facing crisis. This seriously concerned the Committee. Is it that the stresses and demands of modern society, coupled with economic hardship, are placing unprecedented pressures on the family unit or, rather, that today the family unit is not coping with the pressures as well as it did in the past? It appeared to the Committee that the answer was a combination of both of these factors. Family conflict and breakdown, unemployment, low socio-economic background, little education, lack of skills, emotional problems and social inadequacies are all factors which seem to typify the situation of the majority of homeless youth who use the available services. It seems to the Committee that it is most likely to be the youths who have already been socially disadvantaged, who have missed out throughout most of their lives, who will end up homeless, not the young people who have enjoyed a fairly stable family life and a fair share of life's benefits. If this is the case, the Committee felt that it was important to try to identify these youths before they became homeless, to adopt as far as possible a preventive approach. The school, because of its wide-ranging yet relatively personal contact with young people, is perhaps the best place to perform this role. </PARA>
<PARA> When it came to an assessment of the extent of the problem the Committee found the statistics to be so unreliable that it hesitated to refer to them at all. The Committee felt that until such time as a properly conducted survey is undertaken, with adequate supervision and control, there will contine to be only conjecture as to the actual extent of the problem and whether it is increasing. However, this does not mean that the program should be delayed until such time as the full extent of the problem is known. I believe that in recent times one of the major factors bringing the plight of homeless youth to the attention of the public was the establishment of the Commonwealth-State funded youth refuge scheme, which commenced on 1 July 1979. Under this jointly funded program 68 agencies have been funded. They have been able to offer 86 separate services. In all, these have provided some 750 beds for emergency accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was favourably impressed with the work of some of these refuges. However, they are not the solution to the problem of homelessness. The Committee believes that the most effective response to the problem would be to provide medium and long term supportive accommodation. Nonetheless, the Committee has recommended that the Commonwealth-State funded Youth Services Scheme be continued, but with a substantial upgrading of accommodation facilities in most youth refuges. </PARA>
<PARA> As already indicated, without uniform and reliable statistics, it is most likely that policy initiatives in this area will be of an ad hoc nature. The Committee has therefore recommended that a properly financed and managed statistical collection must be undertaken and this should form part of an ongoing Commonwealth-State youth services scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I now move on to what I regard as the major findings of the Committee's inquiry into homeless youth. What is urgently required is access to appropriate medium to long term housing and for many young people this should be of a supportive household type. The long term housing needs for youth, however, must be considered in the context of the needs of all other disadvantaged groups. Bearing this in mind, the Committee has recommended that part of the general low cost housing shortage could be alleviated by more effective utilisation of existing stocks of Commonwealth and State dwellings. Too many government-owned properties are lying idle at a time when there is a growing demand for low cost accommodation. The Committee believes that the Commonwealth and State governments need to monitor closely the utilisation of all public housing stocks and adopt a more flexible approach to the leasing and renting of such dwellings.</PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to specific housing programs for homeless youth. The Senate would already be aware that the Commonwealth Government announced on 30 September 1980 that it was providing $10m over three years under the Homeless Persons Assistance Program for specific capital projects. Even though some of this money has already been allocated, the Committee has recommended that part of the remaining $10m be made available to community-based management groups to help establish supportive youth households in areas of demonstrated need. The Committee has strongly recommended that this money be made available to renovate , refurbish and modernise existing dwellings that are currently lying idle within a number of regions. This in effect would provide assets many times greater in value than the contribution made. The Committee believes that this approach, rather than the general advertising for housing proposals, will result in a greater utilisation of resources and less likelihood of duplication of facilities within regions. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the Committee has gone further and suggested that preference for Commonwealth funding be given to those proposals which aim to provide more than basic shelter for their clients. If such schemes can demonstrate that they are able to provide a supportive household environment, then the Committee strongly believes that both Commonwealth and State governments should give further consideration to providing additional funds for such schemes under the Housing Assistance Act 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Committee is strongly committed to the development of medium to long term supportive households, the Committee nonetheless believes that homeless youth should not become isolated from the rest of the community. Therefore, the Committee saw a great deal of merit in the introduction of universal bond insurance and/or bond and rental assistance schemes. Such schemes would help homeless youth whose only barrier to successful independent living is one of limited financial resources. The schemes would also be of assistance to youths who are ready to move from a supportive household to full independent living. </PARA>
<PARA> By far the most difficult area to tackle was the area of income security. As already mentioned, the Committee was very mindful of the fact that it needed to consider issues as they specifically affected homeless youth. The issue of unemployment benefits was far broader than the terms of reference of this inquiry and the Committee therefore found it difficult to isolate the issue of homelessness and income security from the general issue of income security. </PARA>
<PARA> It would seem that the present philosophy of the Government with regard to the junior unemployment rate of, as it was, $36 is that it is only meant to support those 16 and 17-year-olds living in the parental home. The economic and social factors on which the junior rate was set six years ago have altered significantly and it is therefore important that the Government make clear the basis on which the junior rate is determined and what that rate is expected to cover. Not only would it be impossible for anyone to live independently on $36 a week, but in the case of a number of other unemployed youth, that amount of money would not be sufficient to support them in the family home, particularly if the parents are unemployed or are in receipt of a pension. While I am encouraged by the recent Budget announcement to lift this rate by 11 per cent to $40 as from November 1982, it still does not lessen the concerns I have just raised. </PARA>
<PARA> Bearing in mind the current level and duration of unemployment and in particular youth unemployment, coupled with the medium to long term employment prospects, the Committee has recommended that an allowance equivalent to the difference between the over 18 years of age unemployment benefit rate and the junior unemployment benefit rate should be made available to certain unemployed youth under 18 years of age. These would include, firstly, those who have had to establish themselves for one reason or another away from the family or statutory home and, secondly, those whose families' financial circumstances are such that the additional benefit would enable the family to remain together as a unit rather than the young person being forced into possible homelessness. Apart from special instances, this allowance, we believe, should be paid directly to the hostel or supportive household which is accommodating the young person, after an appropriate application has been made on his or her behalf. This allowance would be regarded by the hostel or household as a significant proportion of that young person's full board and lodging. </PARA>
<PARA> What I believe has to be taken into consideration by the Government is that the recommendations put forward by my committee are a package and that the success of each recommendation is very much dependent on the Government adopting all the recommendations. We have been very mindful throughout our report of the current economic conditions and the many other competing groups in the social welfare area for the limited available resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I believe that the recommendations made in our report are both practical and sound and certainly cannot be regarded as extravagant in the current economic climate. There is no easy formula which neatly divides the areas of responsibility for homeless youth among the various levels of government, the family and the community at large. I believe there needs to be a minimum level of service provided nationally which can be supplemented at the State or local level depending on the particular needs within each region. If governments provide the necessary resources to enable homeless youth to cope with their immediate problems of food and shelter and to help them to become productive members of the community, the immediate cost is likely to be far outweighed by the long term social and economic benefits. Failure to address the problem of youth homeless in the short term may in fact nurture a potential skid row population. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I wish to express my personal appreciation to my fellow Committee members for their contributions during the inquiry and during the deliberations which followed. I should also like to record the Committee's gratitude to a former member of the Committee, Jean Melzer. (Extension of time granted). She made a valuable contribution not only to this report but also to many previous reports of the Committee. In addition, I should like to record the Committee's gratitude for the co-operation and assistance received from State governments and many departments, organisations and individuals throughout the inquiry. Our thanks go also to the Committee staff, to our own personal staffs and to the various specialist staffs of the parliament for their ready response to our many and varied needs during the inquiry. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to have the 12 points to which I referred earlier incorporated in Hansard.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That families have a legal and/or moral responsibility to support and shelter their children up to at least 18 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. That when family support breaks down irretrievably or is non-existent both government and the community have a clear responsibility to provide the necessary support for the young person until such time as he or she is able to make the final transition to full independent living. Indications for intervention at any other stage by government are not at all clearcut and therefore it cannot be taken that assistance will be automatic and unconditional . Care must be taken that government does not usurp the responsibility of parents under most family situations. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. That young people have obligations and cannot expect that the community will unconditionally support them if they wish to become independent without first being able to establish appropriate living skills and secure full-time employment. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. That family breakdown and youth unemployment are major factors which are associated with youth homelessness. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. That there is no perfect substitute for a strong supportive family network and full-time employment, and therefore any youth housing programs and income support schemes must be second best. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. That homeless youth programs should not isolate homeless youth from mainstream society. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. That homeless youth are individuals and the delivery of any program to assist them must acknowledge that personal needs of each participant may vary considerably. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. That homeless youth are an integral part of our community and their rights to public housing should be recognised. However, the needs of one group should always be seen in the context of the needs of all other groups. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. That greater utilisation of social welfare resources can only be achieved by greater co-operation between the many well-established agencies and newly emerging groups. There is a need for greater co-operation rather than competition. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. That government sponsored youth housing programs should endeavour to make full use of all existing dwellings before new capital programs are approved. There are many hostels, institutions and houses that are either lying idle or grossly under-utilised. Every effort should be made to assist schemes which can bring these types of accommodation up to an acceptable standard for homeless youth. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. That Commonwealth Government funds for homeless youth programs be made available only to community groups and organisations, who have fully costed their proposals and have laid down clearly identifiable standards, goals and objectives and are willing to submit necessary data to facilitate the planning of services. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. That Commonwealth Government funds for homeless youth should be made available on the basis of a demonstrated need in a particular region or district . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This being the first published document of any Senate standing committee with which I have been involved, I feel a certain proprietary interest in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare and welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate. The quality of the report-its summary of the large amount of evidence provided, its inclusion of a large amount of factual information and statistics that were provided and which have since been obtained-I believe, is a credit to the Committee and its Chairman, and certainly to the secretary and his staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the tone of part of the report is somewhat moralising, tends to be value-ridden and includes a bit of pop psychology. I wish to dissociate myself from that particular aspect of the report. I have been concerned all along that the families of homeless youth have been portrayed to a degree as being culpable , of being inadequate and of being to a degree responsible for homelessness among the young. It is also invidious that a Committee which includes two career women should be seen to be publishing remarks about working women in this society and, at least to a degree, laying some responsibility on them for failure to be competent mothers. It seems to me that the families of homeless youth are every bit as much victims of a society which cannot cope with its problems as the young people themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations are a useful approach to the problem in many respects and include a number of principles which I hope will be followed through and in better times expanded upon. It is good to see that we have come to conclusions which acknowledge the need for more financial support, not just for young homeless people but for their families as well, in an attempt to forestall the set of circumstances which often causes a family to rupture, to part company and to result in the homelessness of its adolescents. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also excellent to see in this report recognition of the fact that the $36 unemployment benefit, even increased now to $40, for 16 year olds and 17 year olds is totally inadequate. When it was introduced as a benefit for 16 year olds , it constituted 22.5 per cent of average weekly earnings. The $40 now available , since the Budget, for these young people in this age group represents only 12. 5 per cent of average weekly earnings. We have seen a recognition in this report , too, of the need for medium term and long term accommodation. The need for this is clearly expressed. The reasons for it are given with considerable emphasis. There can be no doubt in the mind of any government that is concerned for its young people that this should be a matter for immediate and urgent action. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also seen recognition of the fact that many of the workers in youth hostels and crisis centres are working for much less than award wages. The phenomenon of the 'burnt out' worker was described to us on a number of occasions. One of the recommendations of the Committee is that the form of funding for the Community Youth Services Scheme be adequate so that salary scales could be established for youth refuge workers that would be consistent with other rates of pay in the social welfare area. This cannot be done by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission unless there is an application from one of the parties. Recent developments in the industrial area have led us to believe that the current Government is not prepared to take that sort of initiative. On the contrary, it has opposed the efforts of the Australian Social Welfare Union to obtain a national award to make sure that these workers would not continue to be exploited. </PARA>
<PARA> However, my further disagreement with the report is that it fails to address with any efficiency at all the real causes of homelessness. I suggest that these are the sheer grinding poverty and the stress which accompanies it, which is consequent upon the current level of unemployment, and the criminal depletion of stocks of welfare and low cost housing. In December 1981 there were nearly 100, 000 people in Australia waiting to be housed. This has been one of the most important causes of households finding that they simply cannot accommodate their growing young people who in previous times would have been able to contribute to those households, who would have been out working and who would not have been blamed for creating the stresses that have developed. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I go to the first of the 12 points referred to by Senator Walters. It states that families have a legal and/or moral responsibility to support and shelter their children up to at least 18 years of age. To the extent that the Family Law Act 1975 lays down a legal responsibility for the material support of young people up to the age of 18 where this is practicable, one cannot possibly disagree. There is no doubt in my mind, however, that the moral responsibility for this particular problem should be clearly laid where it belongs-with the policies of the Government that we have had over the last seven years. Those policies have done nothing whatsoever to ensure that households are able to survive in dignity, that they are able to cope with the normal stresses and strains of living. The Government has done everything to deplete the stock of welfare and low cost housing. That is where the moral responsibility belongs and it is high time that something was done about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak only briefly about this report by the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare and to echo some of the sentiments expressed by Senator Giles. The subject was not an easy one for the Committee to investigate and the report was not an easy one to write, not only for some of the reasons alluded to by Senator Walters, such as the great difficulty of getting any accurate statistical information about just what is happening in the area of youth homelessness. It was also difficult to write because of the difficulty in defining the problem and the boundaries of the problem to which the Committee could and should address itself, because of various circumstances which surrounded the writing of the report and because the commitments of many members of the Committee limited their contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At one stage Senator Giles and I even considered writing an alternative report or writing alternative opinions into the report. Circumstances prevented us from doing that. I share her qualms about some of the language used in the report, particularly some of the glib explanations as to the role of families in the situation of youth homelessness and what seemed to be a tendency to make moral judgments about the position of families in the community. We had many a friendly battle about the wording which should have gone into the report, and maybe Senator Giles and I did not win as often as we thought we should have done . But in the end we felt better that the report should come out. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are saying is that basically we agree with the recommendations in the report, as general as they are. We were not in a position to make judgments on financial matters, not being part of the Government and not having the information available that the Government has in making specific recommendations , as, for instance, to the amounts of money people should get. But we were glad that the whole Committee and everyone who gave evidence to it recognised that the present sums paid, for instance, to those under 18 on unemployment benefits were ludicrous and derisory. I suggest that they still are, even after the Budget. There was recognition of the need to provide some assistance, either by direct payment or through other means, to enable young people in this situation to get into accommodation and to acquire the living skills necessary to live independently. As Senator Giles says, this is only one aspect of a very broad economic and social problem which faces Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The best way in which we can improve the youth homelessness situation is to provide jobs, training and assistance, not only to the young unemployed, who make up the vast majority of this homelessness group, but also to their families . We need to get their families out of the grinding poverty which leads to young people being placed in this situation of homelessness. It is this poverty and lack of support by the community which has led us to the present situation, which all the States recognise as a very serious problem. Until we as a Parliament and as a community face up to this we will continue to have youth homelessness at the level at which it now exists. That level will continue to increase. All the moralising and blaming the families for their difficulties and for the so-called breakdowns which face them will not solve the problems of youth or society. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the report at least makes some of the more conservative people in our society realise, firstly, that there is a serious problem and that it exists in every State at an unacceptable level. Secondly, I hope that the report makes people realise the inadequate level of support we are giving to those members of our society whom we will not provide with a job or with an alternative to work. There is a need to give them far more assistance than we have in the past. Thirdly, there is a need for more public housing in general. More mid term and long term accommodation is required for this group in our community, and this aspect was alluded to in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there is a very real need to sort out the legal responsibility in our society for those children aged between 14 years and 18 years. The responsibility not only of the parents of those children but of society has to be defined so that people in this area can work with some certainty, knowing just where they stand, where these young people stand, and where the responsibility lies. It should not be a case of glibly saying, as is so often the case in this Parliament and outside of it, that it is all the fault of the parents, whether they are suffering grinding poverty, unemployment or social disadvantage. From that point of view I believe the report will be a useful one. I hope that the Government will take it seriously. With the riders that both Senator Giles and I have mentioned, I recommend that all honourable senators take note of the report and gain some realisation of the very serious problem which faces this community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare I wish to speak briefly to the report entitled ' Homeless Youth'. Whilst I note that it is a unanimous report, I am a little surprised at some of the criticism that has been made. Perhaps the criticism, call it what you will, relates to how a person sees the family situation, and I will touch on that in a moment. As honourable senators have indicated, the Committee on Social Welfare for its report on homeless youth put in considerable time in the various States of Australia and the Northern Territory reviewing the various programs and other factors that affect homeless youth. I believe it is true to say that all members of the Committee would have been surprised, perhaps as horrified, as I was at some of the situations we found throughout the country , particularly in the industrial cities. We saw many young people ranging from a very young age up to their twenties. In many of the places children aged between 11 years and 12 years were on the streets because they no longer had a home. On very many occasions children of this age and slightly older, but particularly children under 18 years of age, were living in very harsh conditions. In fact, they were on the street, and we found many who did not have even a semblance of a home. I remember that in Victoria we saw large industrial rubbish tins placed on the sides of the streets, and children were using these large containers in which to sleep at night, out of the weather. We saw children using empty houses, empty cars, anything where they could get out of the weather. As for eating, they had to live by their wits. In doing this, naturally they came up against the law. They were living on their wits and they stole, used any means whatsoever to enable them to live. This is a vast problem, but it varies to quite a degree through the different States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not a case of saying in the Senate that the family is responsible for all these situations. There should not be any bashing of the family, if one wants to express it in that way; far from it. I believe the problem does commence with the family, but the family is not to blame. I hasten to say that it is not always the family in the lower social scale and on lower wages where these problems occur. The fragmentation, the breakdown of families, children leaving home, occurs in families with a wide range of incomes. It is a fact that these days families are under considerable pressure and stress, whether for economic or other reasons. This has meant that in very many cases the family has been fragmented. The father has left and gone to somebody else, or the mother has left and has gone with somebody else, or for various reasons the child has been forcibly kicked out of the family home. For many reasons such as those the child in the family is unwanted-unwanted perhaps by the other partner, unwanted perhaps because that child was just another mouth to feed, or because the family did not want the responsibility of the child. So the child, either forcibly or through mental abuse, has been pushed out of the family. It is a very sad situation. </PARA>
<PARA> When describing this situation today it may be thought that it occurs only at one or two places in a suburb or perhaps once in a street. One of the difficulties we faced was in acquiring accurate statistics regarding the immensity of the problem. It has been shown in very many areas that the problem may be immense. I believe it is. Because of this, something has to be done. Various councils around Australia have provided houses for homeless youth and I congratulate the councils for taking such an interest; but much more has to be done by the Federal Government, State governments, and the third level of government-local government. Councils have assisted tremendously the various organisations in the community. It is somewhat horrific, and I do not think that is an exaggeration, to go into some of these broken down homes that were empty and are now used to house homeless youths. The houses themselves are in very poor condition. To see the grouping of these young people together, endeavouring to give each other company and support and to see people in the community endeavouring to help them is something that frankly I think most people should experience so that steps can be taken to overcome the problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman of the Committee, Senator Walters, has worked long and hard on this report. She has had the co-operation of the Committee and the co-operation of many other people to bring down this report. I believe it is an invaluable report. A vast number of reports come in from the community Australia-wide these days. When they first hit the desk of the Senate, they cause some interest or some alarm. But many of the reports gradually gather dust. Whilst it may be said that a particular report is a fine report and something should be done about the matter with which it is concerned, because of the immensity and pressures of government, on many occasions nothing is done. In these circumstances, in a situation where we have a percentage of the youth of Australia at risk, it is our responsibility as individuals, as members of families and as members of government to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to note in the initial statement by the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, that in these days of the Budget sitting, he has made some mention of homeless youth. He has said, amongst other things, that long term measures for help in this area will be considered in the light of the recent report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare on the problems of homeless youth and in the light of the final evaluation of the Youth Services Scheme. I note also that the Government is moving in these various areas for the training of youth. But there are many aspects of the training of youth and while in the context of some of these reports we are perhaps thinking of apprenticeships and matters such as that, I would suggest that there is another type of training also that has to be brought about, that is, assistance to help young people learn how to live in a family atmosphere which they have missed from their younger days. It is a sad and serious situation and I would hope that we have the support of everyone, not only in government but also in the community, to do something for these young Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In tabling the report on 27 May 1982 I briefly outlined it. There were two major problems. One was a failure by statutory authorities to produce reports when required by statute to do so under a mistaken belief, apparently, that they were entitled, when in existence for only part of a year, not to bother reporting for that year and then could put in a combined report for a period in excess of the year, that is, for the period of one year together with the full part of the next year. The second problem was that a Minister who was then the Minister in charge had apparently acquiesced in that approach being adopted. The point that the Committee would most want to make is that it hopes that statutory authorities with a reporting obligation understand that a statutory obligation is a statutory obligation which ought to be complied with. I think that summarises the Committee's report and I have nothing further to add.</PARA></TALK.START>

This was the sum question which the Committee examined-the composition and appropriateness of these charges. The particular matter in question had far-reaching ramifications. The issue which was under examination by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, Senator Peter Rae's Committee, affected a relatively small group of producers. But the underlying principles had a far wider effect and although the honey producers will, we believe, benefit considerably as a result of his astuteness, his intervention and his and the Committee's actions, it can also have far-reaching implications so far as the levying of charges are concerned on a whole range of authorities throughout Australia. I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating the Committee for examining this matter. I think this is one area where the Senate has demonstrated its power of review and its ability to question certain actions of the Executive in the interests of ordinary producers, be they large or small.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; This Bill, the Constitution Alteration ( Fixed Term Parliaments) Bill 1981, is complex, with rather obscure objectives. The apparent objectives conceal the real ones because this Bill, despite its title, is not about fixed term parliaments or about 4-year terms. It really sets out to destroy the Senate with a great degree of subtlety. It also seeks to restrict the reserve powers of the Governor-General. In looking at this Bill we have to go back to the origins of the Australian Labor Party dogma in relation to upper houses, not only the Senate but all the upper houses in Australia. The Labor Party's doctrine, of course, relates to the concentration of power, the infallibility of Caucus and all those central accumulative goals it has to put power in very few hands. It was a dogma of the ALP-until its conference in Adelaide in 1979, for over 60 years-that the Senate be destroyed. Of course there was an example in Queensland in the 1920s where the upper chamber was destroyed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A Morgan gallup poll was taken in 1980 which showed that only 22 per cent of the people in Australia wanted the abolition of the Senate; but 78 per cent saw the need for checks and balances on the legislature. They saw the need for a States House, they saw the need for a review chamber; above all, they saw the Senate as a place where the rights of the minorities in this country could be preserved. In an inarticulate way the average person in Australia knows that the Senate is his last buttress, the last bastion against the legislative excesses of a House of Representatives. While he cannot talk about the legalities of the Senate he knows intuitively that the Senate is an important part of his freedom as a citizen. That is why the people of Australia overwhelmingly support the retention of the Senate, with the powers it has at present. That is why this Bill will fail, why it will get nowhere and why it should not get anywhere. </PARA>
<PARA> I am rather interested in the way Senator Evans has suddenly changed from a position of absolute aggressive opposition to the existence of the Senate to a degree of deceit and deception in putting up this Bill. For the benefit of the chamber I quote a few statements made by Senator Evans in the past, which I do not doubt he will not want to hear. An article appeared in the Canberra Times of 2 July 1978 headed: 'The way to abolish the Senate or at least muzzle it is to white ant it from within'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it was changed to a policy of deceit and deception in character. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one believes as I do along with all good Labor men and women true, that the role of the Senate ought to be abolished or at least deprived of its capacity to destroy properly elected governments there is surely no better forum in which to promote these insidious heresies than the institution itself. </PARA>
<PARA>What a hypocritical statement from someone who is prepared to sit here and accept the title of senator, to serve in this chamber, when those are his sincere and genuine beliefs. I again quote what the good senator said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate has by all accounts always been a silly and pompous institution but now it is obvious to most people that it has become a very dangerous one as well . </PARA>
<PARA>I can imagine people thinking it is a silly and pompous place if they have to listen to many of Senator Evans's speeches. With those views-views which I believe accurately reflect the views of the Australian Labor Party-it is no wonder that in my State for over 42 years the Australian Labor Party has never won a Senate election. At least in Queensland people have some common sense and can see through the deception and fraud that the Labor Party puts forward in saying on the one hand that it wants the Senate abolished and on the other hand that it wants people to vote for senators in the Labor Party. Let me go to Senator Evans's maiden speech lest it be thought, as Senator Evans was suggesting a little while ago, that the article in the Canberra Times was a temporary lapse, an aberration, of his suspect cerebral processes. In that maiden speech quite a few anti-Senate statements were made, but one is worth quoting. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> If this House does have a useful role to play in the legislative process it does not lie in menacing or threatening a properly elected government with the power of life or death based on some spurious conception of the Senate's position as a defender of States rights or federalism. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a clear statement of intent. I am surprised that from a lawyer there should be a statement about the speciousness or spuriousness-I am not sure of my own writing here-of the concept. I would have thought the concept of the Australian Constitution--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans has had enough to say on the subject. Irrespective of whether it is a specious or a spurious concept, I would have thought that even to a layman like myself the intent of the Australian Constitution was quite clear with respect to the powers and the place of the Senate. As recently as 14 August 1980 Senator Evans's revered leader, Mr Hayden, in my State, in Mackay, made the following statement about the Senate:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are committed to its virtual elimination. </PARA>
<PARA>That, in a nutshell, is the position of the Labor Party, with respect to the Senate; that, in a nutshell, is the intent of this Bill-the elimination of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I have given enough time to the arguments of Senator Evans. I would like to move away from his dogmatic party lines and look at the matter on the basis of what is best for the State that I represent, looking at the interests of all Queenslanders and looking at the Bill from the point of view of what is best for all Australians. Both individually and collectively the proposals embodied in this Bill diminish the accountability of Parliament to the people by making the positions of the parliamentarians more secure. If we go ahead with this Bill what will come about is the very thing that Senator Evans fears; the people he calls the Huns and the Visigoths of the House of Representatives will indeed carry the day and have supreme power in the national Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Since Senator Evans is weak on history I think we ought to go back to basics for a moment and look at how the Senate arose and why it has a place in the Australian Constitution. Before the 1901 formation of the Commonwealth of Australia we had a collection of sovereign States. They were all successful States. We have only to go around the capital cities of those States and to see the great and fine buildings that were built before Federation to realise that not only were they commercially successful but also they had a great deal of confidence in their future. Had that not been so, they could never have built the buildings they did. But when they came together they came together not as a central power but as a federation and they came to preserve their individual rights as States. In the latter part of the nineteenth century, as in the latter part of the twentieth century, the great concentrations of power were in the south-east corner, where the overwhelming number of people lived-between Sydney and Melbourne. That created an imbalance because one of the propositions of Federation was that there be a House of Representatives with electorates of equal population. Out of 75 seats in the House of Representatives, that provided 26 for New South Wales, 23 for Victoria, only nine in Queensland, seven for South Australia, five for Western Australia and five for Tasmania, when the representation was based on equivalent electorate sizes. The outlying States said that they were not going to be overwhelmed by the great population densities in Victoria and New South Wales. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is quite right. If it did we could lock up all the Laborites down there and get on with the business of developing the country. But the balance of power was put in an upper House as a check and balance on the population excesses in the south.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to say something about the people who created the Constitution. There seems to be a myth around that the people who put the Constitution together in the 20 years before Federation were woolly-minded academics who knew nothing about politics at all. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth because the people who put the Constitution together were practising politicians and most importantly they were practising politicians from bicameral legislatures, legislatures which had an upper House. They came together to form a Senate which would have equal representation from all the States irrespective of the population. Furthermore, they gave that Senate powers to see that their aims of creating a House with a check and a balance on the excesses of a lower House would be fulfilled. So they gave this upper chamber powers that probably no other upper chamber has. It is quite wrong to compare the Australian Senate with either the American Senate or the House of Lords. The Senate was created for a different purpose. It is most important to remember that the people who created the Australian Senate knew full well what they were doing. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also deals with the reserve powers of the Governor-General. I would like to quote Mr Justice Evatt in his thesis 'The King and His Dominion Governors'. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> Parliament is the parliament for the time being only and it does not necessarily reflect the will of the electorate for all purpose and for all time.</PARA>
<PARA>To suggest that the the right of appeal to the Governor-General can be removed makes the government of the day the judge and jury in one fell swoop. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also deals with the fixed term parliaments, the proposition that the Parliament runs for a set calendar period. Circumstances change and attitudes change. The internal affairs of a country change, and external affairs and international relationships change. Personalities change; people die and are replaced at by-elections. People leave parliament. We are dealing with a dynamic system; we are not dealing with a static system. It is quite reasonable to have some degree of flexibility in our legislative program. There is nothing at all immoral in saying that a parliament can run for a period less than a statutory calendar period. Senator Austin Lewis so eloquently developed the theme that if we have a fixed term parliament it becomes very difficult to control the Executive. In the extreme case we could have an Executive that was quite incompetent, inadequate or even corrupt. One could do nothing about such a situation because the Executive could go on governing until the statutory period was over. </PARA>
<PARA> The thing that I find so amazing is the suggestion that there is something immoral in a government going to an election before the end of its term. We compete for the treasury bench, for the position of governing this country. We have our political ideals and our political philosophies and objectives. But we also compete for government and government is the goal that all political parties seek. I find it completely illogical that anyone could suggest that a government that puts its reputation on the line and its hold on the treasury benches on the line by going to the people early is in any sense doing an immoral thing. Such a government is asking for a judgment on its ability to continue governing. I find that the high watermark in a democracy-not in any sense at all something to be deplored or something which is in any sense immoral . </PARA>
<PARA> There has been talk about life of Australian parliaments being too short. Australia has grown up since Federation with a statistical average life for a parliament of 2 1/2 years. This has had certain effects on the country but we have coped with it. The suggestion that we would be better served by a longer running parliament has not been proven at all. The proposition that we go to a four-year parliament, which is a different concept from the fixed term parliament, is a rather specious argument. The populist theory that is put forward is that somehow or other we will get a courageous government, that the Budget in the first year of a three-year parliament will do unpleasant things to the electorate, the Budget for the second year will do moderate things and the Budget for the third year will do things that ingratiate the government to the electorate. It is argued that if we have a four-year parliament somehow or other we will get two years of hard labour, one year moderate and one year easy. I do not believe that because the crucial issue here is courage of the parliament itself, and courage is a factor that is independent of time. If we have a government that does not have the backbone to take a long term view of what needs to be done, particularly in relation to the economy, irrespective of how long the term is-whether it is three, four, five or seven years-we will still have a non-courageous government. It is the quality or the character of the people in that government that determines whether the right thing is done for the country, not the period that a government serves. </PARA>
<PARA> There are side issues here and one that particularly interests me is defence. Things like defence extend beyond the life of any parliament. Weapons systems and financial support for these systems cannot be measured in terms of a three, four or five-year parliament because one often looks at systems which run for 20 or 30 years. I return to the point about management of the economy and of doing difficult things. I lived in Britain for quite a while and I have also lived in the United States of America. I am not aware that the economic performance of Britain, which has a five-year parliament, has been any better than that of Australia. In fact I think Australia with three-year parliaments over a considerable time-30 to 40 years-has done immeasurably better than the United Kingdom with its five-year plan. </PARA>
<PARA> I oppose this Bill in all its intent because it sets out to remove the powers of the Senate completely. I think that Australia will be badly served if this Bill is supported in any way at all. I am quite confident it will not be because I think there are enough people with enough common sense in Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania to ensure that it never sees the light of day. On that point I rest. </PARA>

There was a time when I would have agreed very much with Senator MacGibbon and that was when the Bill was in its original truly outrageous form in which it would virtually have rendered the Senate powerless and valueless simply by having this rather curious little system of joint sittings that Senator Evans tried to get away with. I do not know what he thought the rest of us were to put an idea like that in front of us. However, that has gone under the bridge, we hope, for ever. I hope the Australian Labor Party is not contemplating any such ridiculous idea in the future. Of course, that proposal would, among other things, merely have meant that the rather heavy expense of maintaining this House would have been of no value.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YJ7">Senator MASON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very attractive point of view. But what remains of Senator Evans's Bill is still of great importance because what we are looking at now is the extent to which the Senate should recommend to the people of Australia changes in our powers. It is rather important that we should be here with the hair shirt on recommending our own destruction or in some way the diminution of our own powers. That is not an improper point of view. In many ways, perhaps, it is a respectable one. But I hope to mention a little later that it probably is unwise and not the best way in which things could be done. I suggest that the mere fact that diminution of power of the Senate is recommended by the Senate would influence some people to some extent towards accepting that. They might say: 'These guys do not think they can handle it the way it is now. Maybe we ought to go along with them.' I would have thought that that is not quite the right way of doing it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In other words, if there is going to be any question of Senate reform I would like to see it come from a constitutional convention, a genuine populist convention. I am sure that Senator Evans will agree, although we have some difference of opinion over that adjective. That populist convention should include all sections of the community. I believe it would be more beneficial even if it originated in the other place or was debated there first before being debated here purely because that would be perceived, rightly or wrongly, justly or otherwise, as a more impartial point of view. I certainly cannot see any great hurry over this matter and there is a good substantial reason for the lack of haste. I personally think I could vote at any time for the concept of fixed term parliaments during the Committee stage of the Bill. I like that idea. I think it has worked well in other countries and I personally can see very few reasons against it. But there are some other matters on which I still have some reservations. </PARA>
<PARA> I will vote for the Bill at the second reading stage not because I agree with all areas of it-very far from it-but because it will allow consideration of what is an important subject to go on to the Committee stage. Of course, even more importantly, a constitutional amendment of this kind, as Senator MacGibbon has mentioned, cannot be finalised by us or by the Parliament in toto. It is a constitutional amendment. All we are doing is considering a proposal which would be put to a referendum for the people to decide. It would also, of course, have to pass the House of Representatives. I doubt that would happen, the Government having indicated its opposition. Of course, the Constitution does say that the Governor-General may put the proposal to referendum if one house of parliament has passed it. I think the word 'may' is very significant. I doubt whether that discretion of the Governor-General is anything more than a fiction. In fact, in cases where the word 'may' is used, I think he would need to be advised by the Government unless there were some very strong reprehensible situation-</PARA>

We as a party are dedicated completely to the idea of consultation with the people. Of course that is what we are talking about in this Bill. I think Senator Evans is to be commended very much for the simple fact that he is trying to do something about the Australian Constitution in toto .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Constitution is a blatant anachronism and needs revision. Indeed, I am one of those people who believe that it needs complete revision. A completely new document would be the best way of proceeding and probably in the long run the most economic way in terms of time and effort, rather than going to the Australian people to change a bit here and a bit there. It would be better to try to get a completely new Constitution and then try that out on the people to see what they wanted and be guided by the decision. </PARA>
<PARA> There are those who see a traditional value in the Constitution simply because it does date back to the turn of the century.

A document prepared, for instance, when there were no aeroplanes is not a particularly suitable basis for regulating the aviation industry, and of course there have been difficulties over that. That is only one area which has caused problems. One of the catch-22 provisions of the Constitution relates to the provisions for its own reform. I think that is the most important part of the problem. I would like to hear Senator Evans on this at some stage. He can help me on this matter. I think debate on this Bill is fairly academic because if the Bill is to pass the Senate it next has to pass the House of Representatives and then it would have to be put to a referendum of the Australian people in the form of suitable questions that can be answered yes or no.

I would much rather have a situation in which we would have a variety of options and the people themselves could decide what those various elements were. I am sure you would agree with me on that, Senator Evans, although it is in the ideal area. We cannot do it but surely you would agree it is preferable to have a set of options on constitutional reform, and indeed reform of the Senate, being put to the people rather than a single Bill to which they would answer yes or no. That is one of my great worries about how good this consultation would be with all the best motives, because of that one factor alone, that is, how it would be regarded by people who are just being called on to say in respect of a total package: Do I approve of it or do I not approve of it?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not yet, but we will. Speaking of the Australian Democrats, as Senator Evans has raised this point, there is no real problem. I think that originally the driving force behind this Bill was the events of 1975. Nobody in the Labor Party or elsewhere has any reason to worry because the Australian Democrats have given solid undertakings that the Senate will not create that situation of bringing down a government as the Whitlam Government was brought down in 1975. It simply will not happen while there is a Democrat balance of power here and I predict that will be for some little time yet to come. Meanwhile I do not think we have to worry about that situation and that motivation being a problem for the time being.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While I am on that point, speaking personally, I see some difference between my saying or the Australian Democrats saying we would never use our vote to block Supply in the Senate, that being the one proposition, and supporting another situation in which the powers of the Senate were restricted in that way for all time. I suggest that is an important distinction for those of us in this place. In the first case we are providing for circumstances we ourselves can assess and control. In the second case we are trying to influence the far distant future in which conditions and events, quite inconceivable to us, may occur. I think that is the strongest possible reason against any restriction on or change in the present powers which after all do not have to be used. They are there to be used if necessary but not otherwise. So for that reason alone I have yet to be convinced of the wisdom of clipping the wings of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree that it would be good to see a total revision of the Constitution by some means. I think very many people in the Australian community want that but it seems unlikely in any real terms since Bills like this one from Senator Evans arise from a sense of frustration, a desire to improve at least some areas and I think that is part of the problem. Hence I will vote for the second reading so that the Committee stage can proceed. At that stage I think we should more properly look at the detailed matters which Senator Evans has brought forward including his new black typed sections which I will look at with very great interest. My reasons for giving the Bill a second reading at the moment are that I approve of fixed term parliaments and I would not wish to obstruct any reasonable process of consultation with the people. I think it is our responsibility to allow a matter like this if possible to go through to the people. Indeed, it is a matter that they might properly wish to decide on. They are my only reasons for voting for the Bill at the second reading stage. </PARA>

Those were the thoughts which I was next coming to, which were then going to lead into the point I wanted to make that these questions are being considered and debated in other places. Reports and results will be produced which, I believe, will enable further debate on the subject. The two bodies to which I wish to refer principally are Standing Committee D of the Constitutional Convention-Senator Evans and I are the Senate's representatives in relation to the issues contained in this Bill-and the Constitution Bicentennial Review Project, which has been established with the assistance of the New South Wales Law Foundation. I believe there has been considerable misunderstanding as to the nature of that project and the nature of its membership. I emphasise that it is called not a reform project but a review project, and that it consists of a wide cross-section of members, some with differing views from within the same party. I think Senator Missen might agree with me on that point. People from the community also are involved. I believe it is an extremely worthwhile exercise in attempting to distil where some of the areas of unsatisfactory operation of the Constitution may exist, where some of the areas which are in need of review exist, and what are some of the arguments and possible alternatives. That is the sort of approach I have to the New South Wales Law Foundation project.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator PETER RAE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Missen asks would the project want us all to go dead on reform in the meantime. I can only say that I imagine that, as is so in relation to a large cross-section of things discussed by the consultative committee for that project, there would be a wide cross-section of views. Some members of that Committee, and I am delighted that this is so, were the most vocal defenders of the Senate position in relation to the proposal for the simultaneous election referendum in 1977. Two people who were the spokesmen for the no case are on that committee. I do not think it is therefore possible to categorise the members of the committee as solely having one type of view or another, and I think that is a highly desirable situation. I will not go through some of the other membership, but I support entirely the existence of that committee, the value of the work which is being done, and the value of the role which it can play in educating the Australian population as to the sorts of questions which arise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come then to the point that whilst there is little use in this Bill being passed by this chamber, even if it were going to be passed, if it is then going to lead to a referendum immediately, for the reasons which I have mentioned. I believe that it is useful to have some debate extending in the various ways, but I am curious that Senator Evans should place debate in the chamber ahead of the report of the Constitutional Convention Standing Committee D, for instance, or even ahead of the initial publication from the New South Wales Law Foundation project. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had rather hoped that the production of those reports would have given a better basis for debate in the chamber. I approach this matter as someone who has a view which is that the Constitution is not a sacred document but is an important document. It is a basic document. It is not a document which either ought to be or can be tinkered with with monotonous regularity. I think that, of necessity, the objective in preparing constitutions is that thereafter as few amendments as possible should be made. However, I do not want to go through the various areas where I think it is demonstrable that consideration needs to be given to some sort of change. One such area is the use of section 96 grants and the financial relationships between the States and the Commonwealth. It may be something that would not lead to a change in the Constitution being recommended, but at least it is something which needs a lot more thought and consideration and discussion. There is a wide variety of other points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree that we need, for instance, to change the provision in relation to double dissolution and the blocking of Supply, but I do not think it should be changed in the way proposed by this Bill. There are very strong arguments, and Senator Evans and I have been involved in them in other places, in relation to what is necessary to ensure that the situation cannot arise where this House can force the government of the day to an election without itself also facing the people in its entirety. It is inexcusable to allow that situation to continue to exist; but how we overcome that problem is another question. I hope that the publication of the report of Standing Committee D, including the dissenting report, will enable debate to be clarified more readily. I hope it will say what I do not have time to say this afternoon. We need to preserve the power of the Senate to force a recall of government by the people acting through, in this case, the House of review-the watchdog-as their agents, but it has to be on that condition, the condition that those people cannot exercise their powers without subjecting themselves at the same time to the judgment of the people who have elected them. </PARA>
<PARA> I prepared a document on another occasion when Senator Evans and I were involved in what was a less direct debate on these questions. I refer to a hearing of the Royal Commission into the Constitution Act 1934 in Tasmania, which reported recently. Two of the invited witnesses to that Royal Commission hearing were Senator Evans and me. We gave what might be regarded as the classical different approach cases, although there were many areas of agreement. In order to put my case more quickly and cover a lot of points, I seek the indulgence of the Senate in approaching with some liberality the Standing Order which deals with honourable senators reading speeches. I think that I can make my points quickly if I read the relevant parts of the submission, which is my own composition. Under the heading 'Australia 1982 and Beyond-Democracy with Responsible Government', I stated:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. I still hold to the perhaps quaint notion that it is possible to enjoy responsible government even in a society as complex as the post-industrial society which is Australia today. I also hold to the quaint notion that the rights of the States as entities should be preserved and that they should enjoy effective workable democratic Parliaments with responsible government. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. With the growth of the bureacracy, the relative demise of responsible government has been witnessed in Australia. This is not a desirable tendency and is one which needs to be positively resited, other-wise we shall arrive at the situation where the bureaucracy runs the country totally, using the Ministry as the mouthpiece and the Parliament as the imprimatur. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. I believe democracy as we know it, and as most Australians would wish to enjoy it, is not, and should not be, a paternalistic system, but rather a system of checks and balances. The ultimate power must remain in the hands of the electors. This applies not only to the Australian National Parliament, but to the Parliaments of each of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. I believe that Queensland, having no Upper House, is an aberration, which does not truly reflect modern desire of the average Australian. The Queensland Parliament lost its Upper House as a result of a number old matters which no longer apply . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Those matters include the fact that it remained anachronistic during the period of major change. It endeavoured to continue to operate upon a basis which was unacceptable to the notions which had been accepted throughout Australia, i.e. of a movement towards the adult franchise, removal of special property rights and qualification, elected rather than nominated membership . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I referred to other matters which were so contentious during the latter part of the last century and which have now been removed entirely from the Houses of Parliament of the Australian nation. The bicameral system which has been continued and refined by the Commonwealth and each of the States is a matter upon which there was a great deal of debate at the time of the Constitutional Conventions on the creation of the Constitution. It was the clear preference of the majority of the delegates that there should be a bicameral system. However, that system is not one which ought to remain static. The change that has come about since 1900-it has taken into account some of the matters to which Senator Mason and other speakers have referred-has shown that it is possible within a constitution-within a bicameral system-to embrace change and development. </PARA>
<PARA> I point briefly to the complete change which has taken place in the role of the Senate with the development of the committee system. The committee system as such-I emphasise the word 'system' to distinguish it from the ad hoc opportunity which existed previously-has, in the past 10 or 12 years, changed quite dramatically the relationship between Parliament and Executive and Parliament and the people. That is the type of change that can take place, notwithstanding continuation of provisions which previously were not used to provide that sort of opportunity. In many States they are still not used. Therefore, the continuation of the bicameral system gives the opportunity for development and change. It does not have to be destroyed or semi-destroyed for changes in the balance of powers, or whatever the proposal might be to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> For reasons to which I will now refer, I do not advocate any loss of powers on the part of the upper House. It is possible to distinguish completely between that and what has been to me one of the totally unacceptable developments in Westminster parliamentary history. I refer to the curtailment of the powers of the House of Lords, as the upper House, rather than change in the nature of its constitution. I think we can say that whilst many people may object to an upper House in which hereditary right is the basis for membership, that argument cannot be applied to a body which does not present that objection. The removal of the property rights forms of privilege, the paternalistic approach, which had been apparent in so many upper Houses in the last century and for part of this century, puts completely out of court the sorts of arguments and emotions generated by many in relation to the Australian Senate. Such arguments should bear in mind the distinction between the situation of the Australian Senate and that of the House of Lords and the Canadian appointed Senate and between our Senate and the sort of situation which was objected to in New South Wales, Tasmania and other States and which resulted in change to the upper Houses there . I repeat, those arguments and concerns cannot appropriately be applied to the Australian Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to our system as being not paternalistic but rather one of delegation, with checks and balances. The importance of that is that the checks and balances are provided by an upper House acting as a House of review. If we do not have the sort of paternalistic system which used to exist as the basis of a balanced democracy, as people used to call it-a term about which there is considerable confusion-we must have a system of checks and balances and a very independent and powerful House of review to provide them. If we neuter the second House, the House of review, we destroy the capacity for providing checks and balances. I believe that as long as the House of review is directly responsible to the people we will be able to have the best of both worlds. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, I believe that to be effective a House of review needs the power to give to electors the opportunity of making the ultimate decision. It must have the power, in the ultimate, to call the executive government to account. As we have witnessed recently, giving the people the right to make a decision by way of referendum is not always an adequate means of solving a problem. I am referring to the Tasmanian constitutional deadlock between the two Houses over a referendum which did not give the people the opportunity to vote on the question that was most concerned with the argument taking place within the community. Any provision for disputes between Houses to be resolved by referendum is still limited by the fact that the government of the day can rig the referendum questions and thereby distort the result without managing to solve the differences which existed between the Houses. The nature of the question does not necessarily reflect the issues which the people and possibly the parties or individual members or would-be members of parliament, would wish to have made the subject matter for decision. A far more effective means is to have the deadlock broken by a mechanism whereby the decision as to who shall be in government and who shall be in parliament is resubmitted to the people. By this means the people make choices according to their own view of how those individual delegates will carry out their function as delegates of the people. In order to ensure that there is an adequate review of the operation of government with the ultimate determination in the hands of the people, it is necessary to have a House of review which can, in an extreme situation, force a government to the people on the basis that it too is accountable to them and up for judgment at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA> I also think that a consideration of money Bills is relevant. In my submission to the Royal Commission into the Constitution Act 1934, I said. </PARA>
<PARA> A particular point which is, I believe, often overlooked in relation to the debate on the powers of an Upper House in relation to money Bills, is that the original concept of the rights of the Lower House with regard to taxation and the determination of expenditure, derived from the position where there was an objection to the powers of the non-elected Upper House against the powers of the popularly elected Lower House. </PARA>
<PARA> That argument no longer prevails. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument now must be related to the efficiency of government and accountability in government. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal reasons for ensuring that the powers to impose taxation and to decide upon expenditure remain with the Lower House are nothing to do with its popular election, but rather are to do with the fact that elections for the Lower House are intended to be taken upon the basis of the people selecting the policy and program of a party which will be in a majority in that House and will thereupon proceed to form a government and implement policies of taxation and expenditure which it has outlined in its manifesto and for which it has an electoral mandate. </PARA>
<PARA> In my submission that situation should remain unchanged. </PARA>
<PARA> The questions now relating to money Bills and the powers of the two Houses should relate to effective and workable government; what is a proper role for the house of government and what is a proper role for the house of review in a fully elected bicameral Parliament?</PARA>
<PARA> The provision that the house of review should not have the right to initiate money Bills (other than appropriations with regard to the operation of the Parliament, and in particular of its own House) are sustainable. I don't stay to debate the question of whether there should be any power to initiate money Bills but rather to stress that there should not be cause for the initiation of money Bills in the house of review. It is not a particularly important power to retain for an effective Upper House. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the power to reject money Bills or to request amendments is of fundamental importance for the reasons which have been outlined . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the House of review cannot carry out adequately the role for which it exists, namely that of review, scrutiny and the provision of checks and balance, unless it has the power to reject and the power to request amendment. My submission continues:</PARA>
<PARA> There must exist both the capacity to enforce the scrutiny and accountability of the executive and also the power to make requests for the re-consideration of the proposed expenditure of public funds. It is for at least those two reasons that the full power to reject or request amendment should be retained.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to go on to talk about a number of other matters but, as I have mentioned, many of them have been covered. I adopt the views which have been expressed by Senator Lewis in relation to fixed term parliaments. I commend the views which are expressed in a paper which will be published by Standing Committee D in relation to the problem of the definition of 'ordinary annual services' and the absolutely essential nature of any amendment to the provisions for changing the position with regard to supply to include the consitutional definition of 'ordinary annual services'. Otherwise so much of what is proposed by Senator Evans would become vague and subject to so much possibility for abuse that his amendments would be of little effect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate and I thank Senator Evans. I had no doubt that he would not go back on his word. I appreciate the opportunity to speak again. Since I last spoke on this subject Senator Hamer has criticised the case which I made against the Constitution Alteration (Fixed Term Parliaments) Bill. This gives me an opportunity to respond to Senator Hamer's criticism. In my view his criticism is based on some errors of fact and some confusion about the Bill and what I had to say about it. There are errors and confusion right throughout his speech, but I intend to refer only to what I think are the most significant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first sentence on the substance of the Bill in his speech contains a misconception. He said that the Bill deals principally with two quite separate issues-fixed terms and the Senate's power over money Bills. In fact, the provisions dealing with the Senate's powers are not confined to questions of supply but potentially cover all types of legislation. In my paper on the Bill which I incorporated at page 1000 of the Senate Hansard of 18 March 1982 it can be seen that I identified some six major changes to the Constitution. In my book , Senator Hamer has not addressed himself to some of the very important aspects of the Bill such as, for example, the provisions dealing with the Governor- General's powers, in which provisions I have pointed out some radical defects. Senator Hamer then said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am very surprised that the biggest advantage-that it solves the problems of holding simultaneous elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives- has not yet been mentioned in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA>Again that is not true because I dealt with simultaneous elections in my paper, which was incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Missen points out that he dealt with the matter. So, again, Senator Hamer is not telling the Senate what is the true situation. In any case, it is not true that the provision for fixed terms solves the simultaneous election problem. Fixed terms as such would have no effect on simultaneous elections in the absence of further changes to the Constitution. The Bill brings about simultaneous elections by altering the terms of senators. Senator Hamer seems to favour Senator Evans's second proposal, which I think he has put as an amendment; namely, to have a House of Representatives elected after an extraordinary election continue only to the end of the term of the previous House. In fact, neither of these proposals has any necessary connection with fixed terms for the House of Representatives, as Senator Hamer seems to imagine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Hamer scoffed at my quoting Walter Bagehot on the grounds that Bagehot wrote a long time ago. He later asserted that Bagehot wrote in 1850. In fact, he did not write in 1850. He did write a long time ago but I suggest that longevity does not invalidate the things that Walter Bagehot said about the Constitution. I suggest to the Senate that a person of Senator Hamer's age should be very careful about falling for the cult of modernity and youth in relation to who he quotes. The publishers of Bagehot's book keep publishing it because it is so popular. The people who write an introduction to it, such as Mr Norman St John Stevas, refer to it as being continually relevant to today. Just three days before our recent Governor-General, Sir Zelman Cowen, finished his term I heard him refer to the book. I made a note of his words; he was on a talkback program on the radio-a very modern thing for a Governor-General to do. He referred to Bagehot's book and said: 'It has a peculiar modernity and relevance to today'. Yet Senator Hamer scoffed at me, referring to the quote without bothering to deal with what I was talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> I go a step further. Incredibly enough, we find a book recently published called The Constitutional Challenge: Essays on the Australian Constitution. In it there is an essay by Senator Hamer. He talks about 'towards a valuable Senate ' and, guess what, who does he quote but Walter Bagehot. Yet the honourable senator scoffed at me for quoting Bagehot. It is unbelievable. I used the quotation to demonstrate that the ability of the Government to appeal to the electorate is a means-Bagehot points this out-of ensuring responsibility on the part of the House of Representatives. A right of the Government to appeal to the people should not lightly be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hamer points out that under the present constitutional arrangements it is possible for the Government to be changed without an election. I suggest to the Senate that this does not invalidate the point which I made, contrary to what Senator Hamer appears to believe. The point is that a government overthrown or in danger because of developments in the House of Representatives has the right to go to an election if it chooses to do so. I refer to the events of 1975 . There is no doubt that Mr Whitlam, as the Prime Minister in 1975 when Supply was being blocked in this place, had a right to go to the people. He chose not to exercise that right, but he had the right to go to the people. No one would have questioned him had he done so. Subsequently he was replaced by Mr Fraser and, notwithstanding the fact that the House of Representatives passed a vote of no confidence in Mr Fraser as the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser took the issue to the people. </PARA>
<PARA> A vital point for the House of Representatives is that a government in that House should always be able to take the question to the people of Australia and let them decide. Senator Hamer did not bother to apply his mind to that quotation and the purpose of what I was talking about. On one occasion, in 1925, a Governor-General in Canada, Lord Byng, was severely criticised and held to have acted contrary to constitutional usage. That was because he refused a dissolution on the ground that, as he was saying, an alternative government could be formed. I suggest to Senator Hamer that before he makes dogmatic statements about these sorts of matters he has a good look at the constitutional history of federations. </PARA>
<PARA> I made certain statements about Watergate, and I do not resile from any of those statements notwithstanding the fact that Senator Hamer says:</PARA>
<PARA> Almost every statement there is false. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Hamer said that because I had mentioned that it was four and a half years before the people of the United States got an opportunity to throw out the Republican Administration. Senator Hamer scoffed at this and said that it was false because there was an election within six months of Watergate. Of course there was. Did he think I did not know that? But the point was that the people of the United States did not understand what Watergate was all about when that election took place. I suggest that far from my being false, Senator Hamer was dissembling when he made that statement to the Senate that there was an election within six months of Watergate. </PARA>

Senator Hamer went on to say that President Nixon was forced to resign-indicating to him an exercise in power on the part of the United States people and Congress. In my view Senator Hamer has completely misunderstood both the events in the United States at that time and the point I was making. As I stated, it was not until the next presidential election four and a half years later that the people had the opportunity of expressing a verdict on Watergate by removing the Republicans from the White House. The fact that President Nixon resigned in the middle of his term merely reinforces what I said. The effect of that resignation was simply to install in the presidency President Nixon's nominated Republican successor.</PARA></TALK.START>

It was President Woodrow Wilson who said that one of the great disabilities of the American Constitution was the fixed term concept. At a time when Senator Evans is proposing to the people of Australia that Australia should look at fixed term concepts, the political experts of the United States, as a result of Watergate, are looking at the reverse and saying: 'Look at the advantages provided in the United Kingdom and in Australia'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hamer seems to accept that fixed terms for the House of Representatives necessarily involves fixed election dates. I pointed out in my paper that it is possible to have fixed terms with flexibility of election dates . That is why I discussed fixed election dates as a separate proposition. It is true that Australia seems to have been, fortunately, free of internal troubles and external threats, but we cannot presume that this will continue. I have not yet heard one supporter of the fixed term proposal give me any reason why we must also have fixed election dates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Hamer scoffs at the possibility of a minority faction in the House of Representatives keeping a paralysed government in office and believes that this is 'so unlikely that it is scarcely worth providing for'. But Senator Hamer does not bother to apply his mind to the fact that in recent history the Scullin Government in 1931 found itself precisely in that position-being kept in office as a minority government. We all know that there was the party split in the Australian Labor Party and the emergence of the Democratic Labor Party. The ALP was not in office at the time, but it could have been so. Some of us are suspicious that in the middle of 1975 there could very easily have been a split in the ALP and that the government of the day could have been kept in office. But we are not privy yet to Caucus secrets to ascertain whether that might have been so. However, I suggest that it is very brave people of Australia who believe that there would not be a party split at some stage in the future, in any of the political parties existing in Australia. Senator Hamer's remedy for party splits is a beauty, too. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Government could declare any Bill a vote of confidence. </PARA>
<PARA>If that means what it appears to mean, it is patently absurd, because that would destroy what is alleged to be the major advantage of fixed terms-the removal of the threat of dissolution which Prime Ministers are alleged to use to cower the House of Representatives into supporting every government proposal. I referred to that matter at the beginning of my paper on the subject. Senator Hamer asserts:</PARA>
<PARA> It must not be thought that elections following government loss of control of the House are likely to be frequent. This happened only once in our 82 years history-in 1929. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not correct. Again I refer to the example of the Scullin Government, which was forced to an election in November 1931 by loss of control over the House of Representatives. Finally, Senator Hamer said that I was 'on very shaky ground indeed'. I have said enough to indicate that it is Senator Hamer who is on very shaky ground, rather than those of us who oppose the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to the Australian Labor Party. As part of its platform, the ALP proposes-and this I believe to be a quotation-</PARA>
<PARA> . . . to ensure that the Senate has no power to reject defer or otherwise block money Bills; to provide that the Senate may delay for up to six months but not reject any other proposed law. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans has made it clear in public debate and in this place that he is promoting this Bill as part of his party's long term proposals which I have just quoted. I seek leave at this stage to incorporate in Hansard a paper by Dr Neal Blewett, a former professor of politics at Flinders University and now Federal ALP member for the seat of Bonython. This paper was published in Labor Forum, Volume 1, No. 1, in the autumn of 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Dunstan shows the way in constitution reform</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia was designed by a group of mostly conservative, colonial politicians. However radical the concept of a new nation, the institutions of that new nation were intended to serve conservative interests, secure conservative ends, and support a conservative society. And the judges of the High Court have gone even further-the most extravagant of their interpretations enshrining so-called 'private enterprise' as a constitutional principle. Thus socialists have been expected to give loyalty to a constitution which proscribes their ideology. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore not surprising that every reforming Federal government in Australian history, let alone every Labor Government has been entrammelled and frustrated by the constitution. To the detriment of the nation and at enormous cost in time, energy and money reforming ministers have sought to evade, circumvent and change the crippling net cast by the founding fathers. One of the most promising features of the Whitlam Government was the ingenuity it displayed in circumventing the artificial constrictions of the constitution. Great gaps may yet open in the rigidities of the constitution as the tortuous logic of defensive constitutional lawyers is turned against them by their radical fellows . Nevertheless the weakness of this approach is that it further emphasises the legalism of the Australian policy, a legalism that has served to undermine the responsibility between governors governed, that has helped to alienate Australians from their political institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand efforts at popular change have been almost uniformly unsuccessful. Of the 36 amendment proposals put to the Australian people in 77 years only eight have been successful. And we have now reached the nadir of absurdity where an overwhelming affirmative vote of the Australian people for simultaneous elections has been frustrated by narrow majorities in Queensland and Western Australia and by the constitutional paranoia of the Tasmanians. Respect for the states may be a necessary feature of our constitution; denial of so overwhelming a popular verdict merely ridicules our democratic pretensions. </PARA>
<PARA>The South Australian Experience</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, lessons for national constitutional change may be drawn from the South Australian experience of the past decade. Environmentally South Australia seems little different from the rest of Australia. Whatever fashionable pundits may say the polls suggest that South Australians are neither more nor less conformist than other Australians, neither more nor less radical than other Australians, neither more nor less politically adventurous than other Australians. Yet South Australia has, in the past decade witnessed a constitutional transformation unparalled in modern Australian history. Admittedly the task of tackling a state constitution is a more limited and less cumbersome exercise than tackling the national constitution. But even if the scale of the enterprise is more daunting, those who would embark on national constitutional reform can learn much from the South Australian transformation of the past ten years. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1967 South Australia possessed a bicameral parliamentary system structured to serve the conservative cause. A gross malapportionment of seats-the notorious Playmander-had enabled the Liberal Country League to dominate the House of Assembly, despite infrequent popular majorities, for all but two years of the preceding generation. The Upper House, the Legislative Council, was an even more solid conservative bastion, a Labor majority never having been glimpsed there. The restricted franchise, the rural bias of the Council districts, and the voluntary enrolment and voting had ensured that Labor representation had never been more than a negligible minority. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1967 the House of Assembly consisted of 39 seats: 13, or one-third, from metropolitan constituencies; 26, or two-thirds from non-metropolitan, mainly rural constituencies. These proportions almost exactly reversed the population distribution in South Australia, with approximately two-thirds of the population living in greater Adelaide, one-third outside. On average, metropolitan seats contained three times as many voters as non-metropolitan seats. In the crucial election of 1968, the ALP, with 52.0% of the vote, won nineteen seats; the LCL, with 43.8% of the vote, won an equal number of seats and was restored to power on the vote of the single independent. Such was the democracy endorsed by the conservative constitution of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, the timing of redistributions was dependent on the whims of the politicians and, more accurately, for most of the time on the whim of a single politician, Sir Thomas Playford. And any such redistribution was totally subject to the self-interested scrutiny of the politicians. </PARA>
<PARA> In a single decade this perversion of democracy has been swept away. The present House of Assembly consists of 47 members, 33 from the metropolis and 14 from the non-metropolitan areas. This reflects accurately the population distribution in the State, and has led to the creation of virtually equal electorates. Moreover, redistributions are ensured at least every six years should the seats depart from equality; the decision on which is made by a permanent commission not by the government. The redistribution proposals themselves are not open to political finagling, but may be challenged by ordinary citizens. (This provision was grossly abused during 1977 by ostensibly independent citizens acting as defacto agents of the Liberal Party in an effort to delay the implementation of the new distribution. Competition in hypocrisy was keen; between 'independent' citizens protesting the new dispensation after having tolerated the Playmander without a murmer for years; and the Liberal hierarchy with its Pilate-like stance on the appeals). </PARA>
<PARA> In 1967, a mere ten years ago, less than half the adult population of South Australia was on the Legislative Council roll. The boundaries of the five four- member Council districts were so drawn that the effective Labor vote was bottled up in a single district, Central No. 1. In 1967 the Council consisted of 16 Liberals and 4 Labor, a division which had survived with only marginal modifications for fifty years. A body so entrenched could savage Labor legislation with little fear of the consequences. Between 1965 and 1968 the Council rejected or laid aside eleven bills, including some of the major measures of the Walsh-Dunstan Ministries, and successfully inserted major partisan amendments to at least twelve other bills. Such mutilation of Labor measures was simply a continuation of the traditions of half a century. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, in 1977, all this has changed. The constitutionally preserved bastion has gone. There is now full adult franchise for the Legislative Council, voters participating in Council elections having doubled between 1973 and 1975. There is now a single state-wide electorate for the Council, thus preventing gerrymandered boundaries. A list system of proportional representation now operates, guaranteeing representation to any group which can secure some 8% of the vote. The composition of the Council is now Liberals 11; ALP 10; and it is likely that in the 1980s Labor will have a Council majority for the first time in South Australian history. The Council now treats the legislation of the Labor regime with much greater discretion, recognizing that any false step might well bring its fragile majority to a premature end. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus these ten years represent the most sweeping constitutional and institutional transformation in South Australian history, possibly in modern Australian history. What lessons are there here for Australian reformers?</PARA>
<PARA>Goals for Reformers</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> First, Federal Labor needs to advance a clear and attractive statement of the major goals of constitutional reform. This statement should be sufficiently clear and attractive to mobilise widespread support, yet not so detailed as to prevent tactical flexibility in the pursuit of these goals. </PARA>
<PARA> South Australian Labor had a simple and compelling constitutional goal; the creation of an institutional system fair as between the major parties. This goal appealed to a distinctive trait in the Australian political culture-the ideal of fair play summed up in the phrase 'fair go mate'. Thus the goal aided the mobilisation of the non-political, while at the same time it destroyed the unity of non-Labor, for the ideal of fair play seduced the progressive elements in the Liberal party. Yet the goal was sufficient to permit tactical flexibility, as in the dramatic introduction of a list of system of proportional representations for council elections. </PARA>
<PARA> A much more complex set of issues face Labor when contemplating reform of the antiquated national constitution. Let me state without detailed argument a set of major goals-</PARA>
<PARA> 1. A modern constitution in that the autocratic pretentions embodied in the powers of the Governor-General will be eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. A democratic constitution in that the methods of election for the governing institutions will be direct and equal. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. A popular constitution in that the popular and representative house shall have unchallenged authority over the executive. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. A unitary constitution in that indisputable legal authority will be vested in a popularly elected national legislature. </PARA>
<PARA> Only one of these major goals is likely to arouse real controversy as distinct from partisan opposition-the issue of the unitary state versus federalism. I merely outline here the overwhelming case against the maintenance of the present federal system. Elected national majorities and the pursuit of the national interest are constantly frustrated by the diffusion of power under a federal system. Witness for example, the way in which the anti-Australians, Court and Bjelke-Petersen, have frustrated national majorities of whatever political hue. This frustration is wasteful, and its negativism is essentially supportive of established vested interests. Federalism is excessively legalistic, with the result that judges, not elected majorities, are decisive. And this legalism permits those with economic resources as, for instance, the wealthy multi- national companies, to exploit the legal loopholes and unsupervised gaps in the system. Moreover Federalism inhibits national economic planning. Australia's tardy recovery from the economic recession has little to do with the unions, much to do with the fact that federalism has deprived Australia of the central economic weapons possessed by nearly every advanced industrial society. And the problems ahead will merely highlight the inadequacies of Australian federalism. As Hugh Stretton writes in</PARA>
<PARA>Capitalism, Socialism and the Environment</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> To distribute environmental costs and benefits with deliberate justice and to restrain inflation by any but the most reactionary means, quite complicated long term policies have to be carried out under coherent central direction with co- ordinated action by executive, legislative and local arms of government. Such coherent action is just not possible under Australian federalism. </PARA>
<PARA>Clear and Attractive Goals</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The basic constitutional goals need to be stated in lucid and attractive language. Labor needs to maximise the use of the 'hurrah' words in our political vocabulary in order to mobilise community support and to split its conservative opponents. A democratic egalitarian appeal must underwrite Labor opposition to Governors-General, judges, gerrymandered electoral systems, and an unrepresentative Senate. The appeal to Australian nationalism must offset the conservative preference for State parochialism. Labor must stress the commitment to the Australian nation against the lesser loyalties to Western Australia or Tasmania. Labor must corral the symbols of Australian nationalism, because there will be critical elements in what is in many ways a cultural battle. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor needs to advocate protective measures particularly for the fainthearted and timid who see federalism as a guarantee of participation and liberty. For this reason, if for no other, it is necessary to include in the package a bill of rights as a guarantee for all those who fear the sweep of Australian democracy or the claims of Australian nationalism. </PARA>
<PARA> Federal Labor needs, too, an imaginative and elaborate plan for regional government which, while not encumbered with nonsense about local sovereignty, will assure decentralisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, as in South Australia, the ALP should avoid spelling out the goals in minute detail, so that the party leaders can seize the opportunities of the moment to advance the basic strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> These proposals are long-range, but not utopian. Unless the major goals are stated and popularised, unless a basic strategy is adopted, Federal Labor will go on making, for the next twenty five years, all the tactical errors of the past quarter century. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite advances made at the Perth Conference, the present Federal Platform fails to spell out clear constitutional goals in language designed to rally popular support. No coherent strategy is set down; rather there is a mixture of long range ambitions and short-order projects; a melange of strategic goals and minor details. Nor is there much sense of priorities. Moreover, the constitutional policy is embodied in language which only occasionally rises above the banal. </PARA>
<PARA>Constant Repetition</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The second prescription is that once the goals are established they demand constant reiteration. In South Australia, Labor publicity and Labor speakers pressed relentlessly and tirelessly the constitutional themes. In every parliamentary session in the late 1960's Labor introduced a one vote one value bill into the Assembly; in every session in the early 1970's Labor introduced a measure to provide adult franchise in the Council. These ritualistic exercises were not designed to change votes inside parliament, but to mobilise popular support outside. </PARA>
<PARA> By contrast the referendums of the Whitlam period were handed to a populace unprepared and unmobilized. The sudden prices and income referendums were an unplanned, almost accidental response to economic difficulties, presented as a kind of afterthought. The clutter of referendums at the double dissolution of 1974 were offered at relatively short notice, went unargued by most Labor politicians, and were unavoidably lost in the issues of the first double dissolution struggle. </PARA>
<PARA>Unity and Change</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The third prescription is that constitutional reform is impossible without unity. There were undoubtedly party differences in South Australia, particularly over tactics, above all over the best reform plan for the Legislative Council. But the differences never became public. They were resolved in the party room. Party members were prepared to compromise, to abandon pet projects, for they knew that any public breech would imperil constitutional reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The reverse has too often been true at the national level. State Labor parties have played a state's rights card to ruin national Labor referendums. And in 1973, political and industrial Labor were split on the prices and incomes referendum. Such divisions are a guarantee of failure. </PARA>
<PARA> Seizing any Opportunity</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, Federal Labor must seize any opportunity that will serve the long term goal, even if there are short term political gains to the enemy as a result . In South Australia in 1969 the Liberal government of Steele Hall proposed a major reform of the Playmander, a new redistribution which while it would not right, would at least partially correct, the imbalance between metropolitan and rural representation. It was not an ideal plan; and would bring kudos and credit to the Liberal Steele Hall. But it was a major step towards Labor's strategic goals; and Labor supported it despite short-term benefits for the Liberals. It was a wise decision. All of Labor's future gains were founded on Steele Hall's reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus Federal Labor should judge every initiative on constitutional reform in relation to Labor's long term goals. Any proposals which contribute to Labor's strategy should be accepted, however soiled their initiators, and however much Labor's opponents may gain in the short-term. </PARA>
<PARA>Dramatising the Issues</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly it is necessary to dramatise and personalise constitutional issues, which too often leave the elector bored, apathetic and negative. The great mass rallies in South Australia in early 1968 compelled even the Liberals to constitutional reform. Dunstan's public histrionics during the crisis with the Legislative Council in June 1973 invested the rather dreary debates in the legislature with the drama of high conflict, thus turning a parliamentary occasion into public theatre. </PARA>
<PARA> Federal Labor needs to think seriously about dramatizing constitutional issues. Sir John Kerr has already made a spectacular contribution: the progress from Yarralumla to Parisian exile, a shambolic shuffle from high tragedy to low farce . </PARA>
<PARA>A Symbolic Event-Remembrance Day 1975</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Kerr brings us to the sixth prescription-the need for an event as a symbolic focus for the constitutional struggle. In South Australia this was provided by the election of March 1968, in which Labor with a clear popular mandate was yet ejected from office. The election became the symbol of the denial of democracy to South Australians. Dunstan did not present the election result as a case of ' we wuz robbed', but simply as an affront to the democratic values of all South Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The constitutional perversion of November 1975 is on the way to becoming the symbolic event on which the national constitutional struggle can focus. Remembrance Day 1975 serves superbly to bring home to a wider range of Australians than ever before the absurdities of the Australian constitution. It highlights the worst features of the constitution-its formal absurdities, its autocratic pretensions, its gutted democracy, its conservative bias. </PARA>
<PARA> The events serve too to endanger the whole conservative order. When next the conservatives prate of law and order, remind them of their law and order in late 1975; when next they prate of constitutional propriety, remind them of their constitutional impropriety in late 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> As Dunstan used March 1968 as the focus for constitutional change in South Australia, so let Federal Labor use Remembrance Day 1975 as the symbolic focus for mobilising Australians for constitutional change. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I refer briefly to some aspects of this paper . Dr Blewett says at the beginning:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . every Labor Government has been entrammelled and frustrated by the constitution . . . One of the most promising features of the Whitlam Government was the ingenuity it displayed in circumventing the artificial constrictions of the constitution. Great gaps may yet open in the rigidities of the constitution as the tortuous logic of defensive constitutional lawyers is turned against them by their radical fellows. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw the attention of the people of Australia to that statement, which was a clear exposition back in 1978 by Dr Blewett of the ALP as to what he is proposing if the ALP ever gets into office. By tortuous logic the ALP would turn the constitution wide open to enable it to institute its changes and its platform. It is clear that Senator Evans has these ideas in his mind because he has made reference to what he could do with the constitutional power in relation to bilateral agreements in foreign affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to other aspects of this paper. Dr Blewett made it clear that 'one of the long term goals of the Australian Labor Party would be a unitary constitution in that indisputable legal authority will be vested in a popularly elected national legislature'. I hope that people understand what that means. He is saying that the ALP wants to vest all control in this Parliament in Canberra. In effect, the State governments will wither away in the old Marxist principle. We know that the Labor Party wanted to introduce regional arrangements because it tried it in 1973 or 1974 during its term of office. It wanted to set up regional arrangements financed from Canberra in place of the States. I ask the people of Australia to think about the ultimate result of that. Do they really think that Western Australia would remain a part of Federal Australia if the whole of the power was concentrated in Canberra? Honourable senators heard Senator MacGibbon this afternoon. Do they think that the people of Queensland would put up with being controlled from Sydney and Melbourne? The ALP fails to think through its policies. It is a question of applying our minds to the ultimate result of these proposals. They sound all right to airy fairy professors of philosophy-I am sorry, Dr Blewett is a professor of politics-but when one applies one's mind to the practical results of these things one sees their deficiencies. I do not understand why members of the ALP do not stand up and say to these academics: 'Go home and let us run the country in the way it ought to be run, that is, as a federation. Do not give us all this political nonsense and garbage'. </PARA>

<PARA> Labor needs to maximise the use of the 'hurrah' words in our political vocabulary in order to mobilise community support and to split its conservative opponents. </PARA>
<PARA>The hurrah words! What has happened is that we have changed and now talk about buzz words. We all know what he is talking about. He is not talking about sensible, logical explanation and understanding an argument, but about using buzz words that get people excited without allowing them to think about what they are doing. We also need 'to appeal to Australian nationalism'. I ask honourable senators to look at a party which has the Australian flag on its banner and on everything else. The ALP badge is decorated with the Australian flag. Yet it is part of its platform to do away with the national flag and the Australian national anthem. Dr Blewett said that we have to appeal to Australian nationalism to achieve our changes to the Constitution. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the ALP should avoid spelling out the goals in minute detail, so that the party leaders can seize the opportunities of the moment to advance the basic strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>That is right. We do not want the people to know what we are on about! Senator Mason said to Senator Evans today: 'What do you intend to do in your proposed constitutional reform?'. Senator Evans really said: 'We will not spell it out in detail. All we will say is, ''Do you agree to the passage of this Bill?''. The less the people know about it the more likely we are to get it through'. Dr Blewett strongly recommended to the party that it constantly reiterate its proposals. The second prescription stated that once the goals were established they demand constant reiteration. Dr Blewett went on to point out:</PARA>
<PARA> In South Australia, Labor publicity and Labor speakers pressed relentlessly and tirelessly the constitutional themes. </PARA>
<PARA>He also gave a warning about unity and change and said:</PARA>
<PARA> There were undoubtedly party differences in South Australia . . . but they never became public. </PARA>
<PARA>He strongly urged that the union movement and the Australian Labor Party get together to make sure that their differences in relation to constitutional reform never became public. This is all part of freedom of information so that the people of Australia know what is really happening in the nation. Dr Blewett went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, Federal Labor must seize any opportunity that will serve the long term goal, even if there are short term political gains to the enemy as a result . </PARA>
<PARA>He pointed out that Mr Steele Hall proposed a major reform of what Dr Blewett called the Playmander in South Australia. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It was not an ideal plan; and would bring kudos and credit to the Liberal Steele Hall. But it was a major step towards Labor's strategic goals . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Then he said:</PARA>
<PARA> All of Labor's future gains were founded on Steele Hall's reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus Federal Labor should judge every initiative on constitutional reform in relation to Labor's long term goals. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very interesting observation. He went on:</PARA>

<PARA>Again, it was a case of 'let us get the people excited; let the people not apply their minds to what they will do; let us get them excited and dramatise the matter'. Finally, Dr Blewett recommended a symbolic event-Remembrance Day 1975. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Kerr brings us to the sixth prescription-. . . the need for an event as a symbolic focus for the constitutional struggle. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Blewett stated here what we know has happened since 1978. The ALP has adopted 1975 as a symbolic event so that it can again get the people excited about some changes in the Constitution. They will not notice what is proposed-that we will end up with an elected government which is supreme in Canberra and that the legislature of Australia-that is, the House of Representatives and the Senate- will become totally ineffective and we will have a totally elected dictatorship in Australia.

For now, in reply I simply want to summarise where I think we are at in this debate, summarise what the Bill is trying to achieve, indicate what I perceive to be the major objections to it in both its unqualified and qualified form, and indicate the general nature of the answers I would make to those objections. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the Bill was introduced into this place on 11 November 1981. I also remind the Senate that on 18 March I foreshadowed a number of amendments to the original Bill, which amendments have not yet been formally moved or tabled in this place. Those amendments were circulated to honourable senators on 6 May, and it is to the Bill as proposed to be amended in that way that I now speak. For the convenience of honourable senators, yesterday I had circulated to everyone outside this chamber a memorandum, kindly prepared by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, showing how the Constitution would look with the consolidation of the original Bill and the proposed amendments constituting changes to it. I believe that that particular memorandum will considerably ease what might otherwise be a rather complicated process in the Committee stage of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> In dealing with the arguments about the Bill I think perhaps the best way to proceed is to start by summarising the basic fixed term concept and explaining the two major and quite distinct justifications for it. I shall then go on, after that basic treatment, to indicate the major objections to that basic concept and show how the Bill, as it is proposed to be amended, meets those objections to that basic concept and what the relevant answer to the objections is. The basic concept can be stated very simply in a sentence. It is to provide that elections for the House of Representatives be held on a fixed constitutionally determined date, and not, as is the case at the moment, at the whim, essentially, of the Prime Minister of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> The two basic rationales for this idea are as follows, and they are distinct and separate. The first of them is to introduce stability and predictability into the electoral cycle, to meet the situation that has prevailed since Federation and which has been particularly the case since the last war, when the average term of the Parliament, as I understand it, has been two years and four months only; to correct the situation where there is acute uncertainty, often beginning very early in the life of a Parliament as to how long that Parliament will last, uncertainty which does create problems for rational planning in both public and private sectors. It is a much more stable and sane environment, particularly in the context of times of economic uncertainty, for Governments to come and go according to a pre-determined cycle, rather than coming and going according to the whims and opportunism of the political masters of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, there has been very little dissent around the chamber to that basic proposition that, other things being equal, it would be desirable for us to have that extra degree of stability and certainty in our election cycle. The objections have been rather as to whether the disabilities, as they are claimed to be, with that concept outweigh that advantage. But the fact that it is an advantage or would be an advantage to have that stability and certainty does not seem to have been seriously contested. </PARA>
<PARA> The second basic rationale, and the one which in many ways has been much more controversial, is the argument that a fixed term concept would produce a solution to the problem, and many of us in this country would argue that it is a problem, involved in the instability of our whole democratic system flowing from the existence and the potential use of the Senate's power to force a government to the polls by blocking Supply in a situation where that government retains its majority in the lower House-in other words, the problem of 1975, and of 1974, for that matter; the problem which continues to exercise the minds of political commentators and political practitioners of all parties. The fixed term concept is essentially an indirect solution to that problem. It does not involve the direct head on attack on the notion of the Senate having those powers, which some perhaps more directly or adventurously minded constitutional reformers have argued as the preferred approach. It is an indirect solution to the extent that it is simply a consequence of reforms, that is, the introduction of the fixed term system, which are valuable for their own sake and for other reasons, namely , the reasons of ensuring a greater predictability and stability in the electoral cycle. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument is that, as such, since it is an indirect solution and not one that involves anybody in particular having to choke on words they may have uttered in political times past, it is a more potentially politically palatable solution for certain parties and individuals in the political process than would be other more direct solutions to that problem. That political judgment may prove to be quite unfounded. I acknowledge, as Senator Peter Rae says, that the initial response of the Government to the suggestion that the fixed term parliament offered a useful way through the problem of Senate power has not been an encouraging one. I remain forever optimistic, however, that the process of rational debate in this place and outside it will in fact over time encourage a change of view. I certainly think it is worth while for the Senate, being the institution, after all, most immediately affected by any such proposed change, to express its view upon it. </PARA>
<PARA> That then is the basic concept, put very simply, and the rationale for it being put equally simply. But there are a number of objections to that basic concept, some of them thoughtfully put in the course of this debate, some of them much more dogmatically put. I believe those objections need to be answered, although not in the degree of detail that will be appropriate in the Committee stage. Perhaps we can usefully at this stage at least draw a map of where the main objections are coming from, what they amount to, and the broad nature of the answer to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I say at the outset that I readily acknowledge the force of a number of objections that can be put to the fixed term concept in its absolutely unqualified form, and indeed I have built into the Bill and the amendments that I propose subsequently to move to it answers to some of those objections. In the real world that we inhabit it is only a relatively qualified form of the fixed term concept that could, politically or constitutionally, make any sense. But let me not draw those sorts of distinctions. Let me try systematically to identify the major categories of objections first of all and then the particular objections within each of those categories. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there are perhaps five categories of objection overall. In the first place, there is the objection that the fixed term concept removes the opportunity for getting rid of governments which should be got rid of. The second category of objection is that it removes the opportunity for a government to renew its mandate in circumstances where, it is argued, it is desirable for it to have that opportunity. The third category of objection is that, if there are any qualifications to the fixed term concept at all, it is not really a fixed term system and the whole thing is a mirage or a chimera and not worth pursuing. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth category of objection is that the fixed term proposal will not, in fact, solve the problem of the Senate's powers, to the extent that people perceive that to be a problem. The final category of objection is that to the extent that the fixed term concept, as put forward in legislative form, does solve the problem of Senate powers, vis-a-vis the House of Representatives, then it is destructive of the Senate as an institution. I think those five categories pretty well broadly summarise the range of themes that emerged in this debate and in external commentary upon this issue, of which there has been a good deal. I will endeavour to deal, as succinctly as I can, with the basic objections put in each of those categories. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, I deal with the arguments around the general theme that the fixed term concept makes it impossible to remove a government which ought to be got rid of. Objection No. 1 within this category is as follows: It is said there must be a provision for an election to be held when a government in the House of Representatives loses its majority and no other government can be formed which has the confidence of the House of Representatives. The answer to that objection is: Yes, of course. The fixed term concept must be qualified if we are to retain a Westminster parliamentary system of the kind we are all familiar with, to accommodate that particular contingency. The Bill makes provision for that in terms of the no confidence procedure which is there set out. Whether the details of that particular drafting of the no confidence formula are sufficient to satisfy everyone that the problem has been effectively met, is something we can again debate in the Committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Objection No. 2-this, I think, came most prominently, as did many of the objections, from Senator Lewis-is as follows: It is said there must be an election whenever a new government is formed, and that the Bill is deficient to the extent that it does not allow for this. This is the notion that somehow the system of responsible government demands that there not be new governments formed simply by the ebb and flow of majorities within a chamber but that whenever a government loses the confidence of the chamber for any reason, then without waiting to test whether some other government can be formed with a majority, an election ought to be held, and that to the extent that the fixed term parliament concept, as it is drafted in my proposed Bill, would rule that out, to that extent the fixed term concept is a bad interference with the principles of responsible government. My answer to that kind of objection, as I think was Senator Hamer's, is that, true it is, the Bill does not provide for any mechanism to deal with that situation; in fact, on the contrary, it makes provision for a new government to be formed, after the old one loses the confidence of the House of Representatives, without an election being held if that new government can win a confidence vote in the House of Representatives. I would simply argue, as defenders of this proposal would argue, that it amounts to a misunderstanding of the Westminster system of responsible government to demand more than that of this proposal. It is a misunderstanding of the system of responsible government as it has always operated to require that an election be necessary in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Objection No. 3 is a trickier one and one that will, I think, demand some more thoughtful and careful response from this chamber. That is the argument, again put with considerable passion by Senator Lewis and also I suppose by Senator MacGibbon that the fixed term concept as has been advanced here makes no provision for the removal of a government which is grossly misbehaving itself. Senator Lewis put it another way by referring to this being a kind of charter for elected dictatorships. This sort of objection overlooks, of course, that this is pretty much exactly the case at the moment under our system of responsible government. So long as a government has secure majorities, particularly, of course, if it has them in both Houses, there really are no practical limits on what that government can do. There is, however, a possible argument, which I readily acknowledge, that if a government is, to put it at its highest, behaving in a way that amounts to a gross and patent breach, not only of the law in some way but also of the constitutional system itself, then there is perhaps, it can be argued, a constitutional convention which would allow the Governor-General a reserve power to dismiss in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> As to that argument, I would simply say this: The existence of that power is highly controversial and highly contentious. It has never been exercised in modern times in the United Kingdom under the constitutional monarchy as it there operates. It could only be thought capable of operating, I suspect, in the Australian rather bastardised system of constitutional monarchy that we have developed through the Governor-Generalate and the governorships in the States. It has never really been used in Australia, with the possible exception of the Game case in 1932, although what was involved there remains highly controversial since it was simply an illegality that was claimed and nothing really higher than that on the part of the Lang Government. It is difficult to argue that that is what was involved in 1975, although defenders of Sir John Kerr will undoubtedly argue that that does constitute a further precedent of some weight for the existence of such a convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it can be argued that it is a power which surely, given the difficulty it has caused in the past, is unlikely ever to be used again. It also can be said in general terms that if there is any prospect of a dictatorship being exercised by anyone in our democratic system on first principles, as unhappy as any dictatorship might be or any behaviour tending in that direction, it is rather more appropriate that that misbehaviour be on the part of an elected government rather than an unelected officer, however high that officer's status might be. To the extent that there is some ultimate sanction which might be argued to be needed here-I understand this is the sort of point that is worrying Senator Martin-I acknowledge there may be some case for giving consideration to perhaps a constitutional impeachment procedure of a kind that is available in the United States of America in its fixed term system against the elected Executive, the presidency. That is something about which I have fairly profound reservations but I acknowledge that a serious argument can be conducted on it and I think the appropriate place to have it is in the Committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The next category of objections that I identified relate to the notion of a renewal of mandate-that a government ought to be able, for one reason or another , to renew its mandate before its term expires, if it feels that to do so would be to the advantage of either it or the country. The first objection under this heading-let us keep them numerical and call this one No. 4-would be cast in these terms: The government of the day would need to be given the opportunity to seek a double dissolution if it were being obstructed in its ordinary legislation-let us leave aside money Bills-by a hostile Senate. As to that and the concept of a renewal of mandate in that situation to overcome the possible hostility of an upper House, I simply say that I agree and that the Bill as now proposed to be amended does make provision for the retention of the double dissolution provision in its present form. That retention creates some other difficulties for other aspects of the proposal, but we will come to them in a moment. So in the sense of renewal of the mandate in the context of upper House obstruction, yes, that is accommodated. </PARA>
<PARA> Objection No. 5, however, puts the point another way and focuses purely on the situation within the lower House itself. This objection is that the opportunity is needed for the Government to renew its mandate if it has some controversial measure that it wants community support for or if it is drifting in a kind of limbo situation without having, on most of the measures that it puts up, the support of the House of Representatives but not being in a situation where anyone is prepared to move a no confidence motion in it. This scenario, implausible as it might be thought to be in practice, was one that, of course, again was pursued and pushed with some vigour by Senator Lewis. As to that, I answer that it is true that there are not the same opportunities under this proposed scheme for the Government to call an early election for reasons of this or any other kind. The answer has to be here that this is simply the price that one pays for the other advantages that are involved in the fixed term concept and that on balance it is a small price given the magnitude of the other advantages in terms of stability and predictability of the electoral cycle, not to mention the potential advantages in terms of the relationships between the two Houses. In other words, I put the point-it is a confess and avoid sort of answer I suppose, as lawyers would describe it-that yes, that is one of the situations that can arise in a fixed term parliament concept, creating an incapacity for a government to renew its mandate as a result of real or imagined difficulties within the lower House itself, but in practice that is a situation relatively unlikely to arise as long as our party system operates the way it has done. To the extent that it does arise, that is just one of the prices-probably the main price-that we would have to pay for having all the other improvements that would be involved in this change. </PARA>
<PARA> The next category of objections-in my list it comes out as No. 6-is this: If we have any qualifications at all to enable an extraordinary election of the House of Representatives or to enable a double dissolution in the circumstances of upper House disruption that we have postulated, we no longer have a fixed term parliament system. The objection is put a little less formally than that by saying that it is not really a fixed term system as long as the government of the day can manipulate these kinds of exception provisions to its own advantage. One way it could do so, it is suggested, is by passing a no confidence motion in itself in the House of Representatives as a purely formal device to get itself to the polls on an earlier date. Another much more practically likely possibility, it is thought, is that-</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Chipp" NAMEID="3V4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what is said and what is argued. I think that would be wildly implausible as a practical matter, at least on the first occasion that that device was sought to be used. It might be easier to do it subsequently and claim that it is simply a technical device to get an early election. But one would look a damn fool doing it for the first time. I would hate to have the task, even with Senator Chipp's public relation skills, of persuading the public that I was fair dinkum, wanted their support and demanded their confidence, having just moved a vote of no confidence in myself. Nonetheless, that is an objection that is seriously put and I think it has to be seriously answered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The more serious objection, I think, is that the double dissolution provisions can be very easily manipulated by a government of the day simply by throwing up to the Senate some manifestly unconscionable proposition and using the Senate's obvious rejection of that manifestly unconscionable provision as a trigger in the hands of the House of Representatives government to be used any time it pleases to get, not just a dissolution of the House of Representatives at a politically opportune time, but the whole of the Senate out as well. How do we answer that kind of objection? As I said, the first scenario involving a no confidence motion moved by a government against itself is probably pretty fanciful but the second one is much more realistic. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there was a problem in the first version of this Bill to the extent that there were no real disincentives built into the mechanism to operate against the system being used, or rather misused, in that way. But the amendment that is proposed-all of these amendments have been, I assure the Senate, a product of an awful lot of discussion around the place-makes provision for an early election that is held for any of these extraordinary reasons to produce a government which holds office only for the duration of the original cycle. So it is that if one is two years down the track and one decides that the electoral scenario 12 months hence is likely to be a little hot and that one would rather have an election right now, one does not derive any advantage from pushing the double dissolution button or pulling the trigger that one has already created some time before to give oneself that conveniently timed election. There is no point whatsoever in doing it because the government that would be thus produced would hold office only for the duration of the cycle; in other words, until one year hence. I think for all practical purposes that is likely to amount to a pretty massive disincentive to the artificial use of these extraordinary election provisions in fact to get an election on at a time of the government's own choosing. </PARA>
<PARA> The final category of objections we come to are the implications of all of this for the Senate. There are two distinct objections-Nos 7 and 8 in the list respectively-so far as the Senate is concerned. Objection No. 7 is of the following kind: The fixed term concept will not solve the problem of Senate power. The way this argument is put is as follows: There is nothing to stop the Senate blocking Supply just because of the basic fixed term rule being in the Constitution. There may be double dissolution Bills already in existence of which the Senate can take advantage at the time it blocks Supply, in exactly the same way as occurred, of course, in 1974 and 1975. There were, fortuitously, double dissolution Bills already in existence. We did not have to wait for the three-month double dissolution process under section 57 to work itself out. </PARA>
<PARA> It is further argued that the Senate could block Supply on the basis that it insisted the House of Representatives resolve the impasse thus created by passing a vote of no confidence in itself. In other words, the argument is put that one could not just assume that the Senate would take the view in those circumstances that there was nothing it could do to force the House of Representatives to an election. The Senate would fasten its beady collective eye on that provision which says that a government can go to the polls early if it satisfies the formal requirement of a no confidence resolution being passed in it in the House of Representatives. The Senate could demand, it could say to a House of Representatives: 'You have a means of holding an early election; we will block Supply and create an awful lot of difficulties for you but you can resolve those difficulties by going to the polls, by using the technical device of passing a technical vote of no confidence in yourself'. </PARA>
<PARA> The further argument-and it is a more worrying one-is that the Senate might block Supply, not with the intention of forcing the government of the day to the polls but rather with the intention of forcing concessions from the government of the day as far as the Budget was concerned, forcing actual changes to the Bill rather in the way that occurs in the United States at the moment. The Senate cannot force anyone to the polls by blocking a Budget and it knows that compromise ultimately has to be achieved if the nation is not to collapse on the rocks. But it also knows that its mere ability to block, and all the delay power that goes with that capacity to block, gives it an enormous amount of bargaining power vis-a-vis the other chamber and it is bargaining power, of course, that it constantly uses. Therefore, all those arguments amount one way or the other to a proposition that merely by putting in place a fixed term system does not in itself solve the problem of Senate power. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the answers to that? One possible answer is that these are theoretical options only as far as the Senate is concerned, that the Senate just will not block Supply as a matter of practical political dynamics; if it cannot force an election by doing so it will not risk the hostility or political obloquy that would be involved in doing so. The other practical argument is that the House of Representatives will be careful in future to avoid creating double dissolution triggers to avoid just that possibility of the Senate taking advantage of a fortuitous section 57 trigger being in place.</PARA>
<PARA> But I am not sure that those answers are really good enough. I acknowledge that there are problems in relying simply on these kinds of dynamics. I acknowledge that there are real problems in the potential development of greater Senate power with respect to Budgets than exists at the moment if one has a fixed term system but keeps the Senate Supply power absolutely intact. Thus the Bill contains a provision to amend section 53 to remove its powers with respect to major money Bills. That amendment is in a substantially modified form in the terms of the proposed amendments which are before the Senate at the moment. I have suddenly realised that I have only 30 minutes in which to debate this matter. I was working on the basis that my speech would take about 35 minutes. May I have a few extra minutes to finish off my speech, Mr Acting Deputy President?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am on my second last point. I was trying to put the whole thing in a proper context. I am saying that I think that ultimately the only way in which one can cope with those sorts of arguments is simply to say that the Bill must contain a provision to amend section 53 so as to remove or limit the powers of the Senate with respect to money Bills. We can debate the details of that formula later. But unless we do that we have a whole lot of problems in terms of the relationship between the two Houses created by the fixed term mechanism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, the objection is of a quite different kind but is still related to the Senate. To the extent that the fixed term parliament concept will solve the problem of Senate power with respect to money Bills, it is inconsistent with the credibility and status of the Senate as an institution for its powers to be limited in this way or its status to be changed in this way. My answer is simply this: It is a confusion to think that questions of formal power with respect to money Bills will necessarily impinge upon and necessarily reduce the status, the prestige, the clout of the institution. It is a mistake to think that those things are inextricably intertwined. I do believe that the Senate has a major and useful role to play as a House of review and that its status in that respect will be enhanced rather than reduced if its powers with respect to doing the things that we have been talking about are in fact removed. </PARA>
<PARA> I make it clear in answer to Senator MacGibbon that while it was once my position that this place ought to be abolished that is no longer the position of the party nor is it my personal position, having thought very carefully through the realities of this situation. I think there is much that this and other upper Houses can do in improving legislation, scrutinising the Executive, monitoring the bureaucracy, initiating and generating ideas. None of those functions will be impinged upon in any way if the powers of the Senate in these very formal senses we are talking about are in fact reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a long argument. There is not time to have any more of it now, I readily acknowledge. I am grateful, Mr Acting Deputy President, for the indulgence of the Senate thus far. I simply make the point that there is enough in the argument now for the Senate, I think, to support a second reading of this Bill although there is much more that needs to be debated in a reasoned way at the Committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I apologise. I was not aware of the situation; I should have been. But I do think it important that I should, if I may, take some moments-and I will be as brief as I can-to state the position following the debate itself and particularly following Senator Evans's summary. This private member's Bill seeks to make some very radical changes. Should those changes be carried within the Parliament, in both chambers, put into referendum form and carried in referendum-a very unlikely result-they would make great changes indeed in the nature and character of both Houses of this Parliament, and that should be kept in mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have to say at the outset that the Government is opposed to the Bill and will oppose the Bill in this chamber, and should it proceed elsewhere it will be opposed elsewhere. If I may comment very briefly, the nature of this Bill goes to the very heart of and seeks to change the very structure of the parliamentary institution as it was formed, as the convention debates envisaged it and as over the years the various communities and States have enshrined it. The fact is that the people of Australia, in their six separate State parliaments, in giving some fixed sovereignty to the Commonwealth and setting up a Commonwealth Government while withholding the residual powers themselves, were determined that there should be a bicameral system of a very specific nature. Indeed, the very existence of a Commonwealth parliament depended on one fundamental thing-that the rights of the less populous States should be preserved and therefore they should have within themselves at all times the power to be able to resist being overrun by the two more populous States. Therefore, fundamentally this Parliament was constructed in two ways. The House of Representatives was modelled on the House of Commons and the Senate was modelled upon the Senate of the American Congress with a similar geography, a similar size, a similar equality of States and with an identical attitude towards the placing of a finance power. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to direct my attention fundamentally to the senators of the four less populous States. These States said: 'If we do not have the power to resist money Bills, if we do not have the power in fact to bring the lower House to account, then we, as four States, will have no voice at all in the Commonwealth Parliament'. Fundamentally we are getting right to that. The populace of the four less populous States should keep in mind that this attacks the very nature and structure of this parliamentary system as it was seen to be formed. I have no doubt in the world that should it by mischance ever be put to referendum by a future government it would not be acceded to in the four less populous States, or I think in the other States. </PARA>
<PARA> The arguments that have been put bear a little testing. It was said that we need to have a fixed term for the House of Representatives; otherwise there is some destabilising element and some unpredictability. Indeed, reference was made to destabilising speculation in recent days. That was aimed by Mr Hawke to destabilise Mr Hayden. That was the reason for that and it would have occurred whether there was a fixed term or otherwise. But I want to say that it is an interesting situation. I think there is a confusion of argument here. There is confusion between the length of a term-a three-year term, a four-year term, a five-year term or otherwise-and the concept of stability. It may well be that those who think that a three-year term is too short see some instability in a term of three years or less. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to remind the Senate that if Senator Evans's arguments are correct then the House of Commons has been wrong for centuries- because quaintly enough the Mother of Parliaments has always, even though it has had a five-year term, believed that a fundamental of a lower House should be a fixed maximum term and that the government should go to the people when it wanted to go to them, and it has been doing that. Does anyone say that the United Kingdom has been unstable and that there has been unnecessary speculation over the years because of this? Again there is a quaint belief that there is something wrong in going to the people before the end of a term. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental principle of democracy is the right of the electorate to recall those who are temporarily governing it and to submit them to the jury system. When this Senate was set up it was given the power, particularly in terms of the four less populous States, to bring people to the test of the ballot box. What is wrong with that? What can be fundamentally wrong with the test of the ballot box? The very first proposition I put is: If indeed we are talking about fixed terms for the House of Representatives there may well be some who think that the tenure, the maximum term, should be longer than three years, but if there is instability it has not occurred in the centuries of experience of the House of Commons. That, I think, is the strongest argument that one can put in this regard. Secondly, of course, all honourable senators must understand that implicit in this Bill which was brought in on 11 November-I ask honourable senators to bear that date in mind because it has been referred to-is that the money power of the Senate, which is the real target of attack by the Australian Labor Party, should be removed ultimately so that, in fact, the less populous States would no longer have a voice. It is no good having other kinds of voices. It is no good our getting up here like a high school debating society if in fact the very reason for the existence of the bicameral system has been destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> Every honourable senator in this place from those four less populous States should, before committing themselves to this legislation, go back to the conventions of the Constitution. They should then go back to their own States and ask the people in those States whether they are willing to take away the rights of the smaller States to say to the House of Representatives: 'No, you will not overrun us. If you attempt to overrun us we will have the right of recall.'. They would not have the right of recall in three or four years' time when more and more damage could have been done but would have the right of recall with immediacy. The great reason that there has been a federation in this country is that that reserve power has lain there. Again, I want to say that this Parliament, using the powers of the Constitution, brought about a dissolution of Parliament in November 1975. The Parliament, acting within the powers of the Constitution brought about that dissolution. The Governor-General simply acted within the Constitution. It does no one any good to say otherwise. Indeed, the result at the ballot box in the subsequent elections has made that clear. If the proposal to have a system of fixed term parliaments itself is indeed right, the experience of the House of Commons has been wrong. Nobody has suggested that. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply want to sum up by saying that arguments may be put at constitutional conventions for a longer term of Parliament and there may be arguments that if the Senate is to seek the recall of the House of Representatives the Senate itself ought to be pulled out so that both Houses can be submitted to the jury. The alternatives are that if this policy were adopted in its totality, the Senate would have no real cause for existence. Make no mistake about that. If that were the case the Senate's fundamental power of being a States' House and of making sure that it is speaking for the States would have gone. Its ability to recall would have gone. That is the fundamental point. I cannot believe that any honourable senator could go back to one of those four States and say: 'I am advocating a change in the teeth of the constitutional conventions drawn up in the late nineteenth century. I am in fact supporting a situation which would place those States in a vulnerable position in the other place. In fact, it would be three or four years before we could even have a say at the ballot box to rectify this.'. That seems to me to be the height of insanity within a federation. I thank the Senate for the opportunity to speak in this debate. I would have liked to deal with this Bill in more detail but I am not able to now. I thank the Senate. I indicate that the Government will oppose this measure. </PARA>

There is nothing more I want to say on this subject at the moment. I do not believe anyone in the chamber wants me to say anything more on the subject. I do not believe there was anything in the tired old cliches advanced by Senator Sir John Carrick which demands that I say anything more by way of reply. I think it is important that I simply stake a claim, as it were, for a genuine right of reply to be vested in those honourable senators who introduce private members' Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It may have well been a result of a misunderstanding or whatever on Senator Sir John Carrick's part that he sought to speak in this debate after I had sat down, having exercised my right of reply. I suspect his motive was rather less elevated than that and that his contribution was motivated by desire at the last possible moment to remind his troops as to what the Government's position was and to intimidate them to that extent. I hope that they will not look at his contribution in that spirit. Such a crude tactic does not deserve being treated with any respect at all. I do not think Senator Sir John Carrick's contribution was consistent with the constructive spirit which, for the most part, has pervaded this debate and which is necessary if we are to have rational discussion on matters of constitutional reform. It is only by bipartisan consensus that this will happen. Since Senator Hill has to catch an aeroplane I will sit down now, having made that point. I hope I have made it very forcefully . </PARA>

<PARA> That this resolution of the Australian Senate be conveyed to Archbishop Josef Glemp, Primate House, Warsaw, Poland, being a person who is concerned for the welfare of Mr Walesa and who is also in communication with General Jaruzelski.</PARA>
<PARA>As honourable senators will appreciate, the course of history has affected the relevance of some of the wording of my original notice of motion. On 26 November 1980, more than 20 months ago, when I first gave notice, we were all fearful of an imminent Soviet invasion of Poland. That invasion did not take place but instead, on 13 December 1981, almost a year later, martial law was declared. The independent trade union, Solidarity, was suspended; many thousands of people were detained; curfews were imposed and numerous civil liberties were suspended. Despite the release of some detainees last July, the Solidarity leader, Mr Lech Walesa, and an estimated 1,500 people or more, are still detained for their opposition to martial law. </PARA>
<PARA> The last overnight curfew appears to have been lifted but the continued detention of Mr Walesa and many other trade union activists, intellectuals, journalists and members of KOR, apparently without any trial, is intolerable. There have been many false rumours that Mr Walesa was about to be released but the release has never taken place, except for a brief occasion when he was permitted to see his new-born daughter. It is said that Mr Walesa is presently being held at a prison camp at Alarmowo near the Soviet border which, by its very location, has ominous overtones. We cannot just forget about these brave people. The second anniversary of the Gdansk agreement of 1980, which gave birth to Solidarity, will occur on 31 August. The remaining underground leaders of Solidarity have called for peaceful demonstrations during August. I might mention that two representatives of Solidarity will be in Australia at the end of this month and the beginning of next month. </PARA>
<PARA> My original resolution called for this matter to be raised in the International Labour Organisation and the United Nations. In fact, the matter was raised in the ILO last June, when a Solidarity leader took the floor and, not unexpectedly , all Soviet bloc delegates walked out of the meeting. It was also raised earlier this year before the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations. On 10 March that body voted to call on the Secretary-General to appoint a body of inquiry to investigate the alleged abuse of human rights in Poland. It was the first time since the establishment of the Commission in 1946 that it had been called on to investigate developments in any East European country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Polish events have produced strong feelings from quite diverse sources. For example, I remind honourable senators that on 29 December last the Praesidium of the Socialist International issued a statement denouncing the 'brutal repression of human rights' in Poland and calling for the release of all detainees, the restoration of Solidarity's right to act in freedom and the ending of martial law. The Australian representative at the Human Rights Commission meeting quoted the strong words of the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, on 26 January 1982 and called for the lifting of martial law and the release of detainees. </PARA>
<PARA> I am confident, therefore, that this motion will attract support from all quarters. I have taken the unusual step of including in my reworded motion a request that, if the motion be adopted, the resolution be conveyed to Archbishop Josef Glemp. The significance of this is that while Solidarity might have been suppressed in Poland, the Catholic Church, which is keyed to an appreciation of the Polish situation, has not been suppressed. I have no illusions that the resolution will produce an immediate release of Mr Walesa and the other detainees but it, together with other expressions of solidarity and support from other areas of the world, must remind the Polish authorities that the outside world continues to remember what has happened and is concerned for the welfare of the brave people who were attempting to exercise rights which we take for granted. I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion put before the Senate this evening by Senator Harradine. I do so because there is no doubt that the Polish people continue to suffer a repression which is quite unjust and which denies to them the rights of all workers, in particular, and peasants to organise in societies and associations of their own creation in order to advance the conditions of their working lives and, indeed, of their whole lives within Polish society. I have pointed out to the chamber before the many links between Poland and Australia. Many Polish refugees came to the shores of my home State of Tasmania-indeed, it is the home State of Senator Harradine-after the Second World War and found arduous employment in the hydro-electric camps which dotted the Tasmanian landscape at that time. Of course the flow of refugees to Australia from Poland has not ceased, as people seek that freedom which they are unable to obtain under the regime of the Communist Party and the military dictatorship which has latterly displaced it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Further than that, we have a link which goes back in history. One recalls that in 1794 Kosciusko, the great American revolutionary hero, returned to his native Poland in order to lead a rebellion against Russian repression and occupation of his country. Kosciusko's troops armed themselves with scythes attached to long sticks or branches, which were taken up as a symbol by the Rural Solidarity in its marches of protest in 1980-81. Of course that link between Australia and Poland is memorialised by the naming of our highest peak after Kosciusko, that revolutionary hero of the Polish people who failed, regrettably, to remove the Russian occupation and suppression of his people back in the late 18th century. </PARA>
<PARA> There is more to our relationship than the mere naming of our most noble peak after that Polish revolutionary hero and I am quite sure that the motion moved today will commend itself to the whole of the Senate. It provides a way in which the Senate can express in a definite way its support for and solidarity with the great mass of the people of Poland. The motion mentions that the Polish workers are seeking bread, peace and freedom of association enshrined in International Labour Organisation Convention No. 87. Earlier this year that Organisation attempted to condemn the present authorities in Poland for their denial of those basic rights of organisation and association. It should not be forgotten that the International Labour Organisation is perhaps the only organisation in the world which has the mechanism available to it to investigate the conditions of workers in the states which are party to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Such an investigation was carried out and the conference committee on the application of conventions and recommendations did condemn the Polish Government 's actions in respect of the enforcement of martial law which denied its citizens the right to organise in associations of their own creation. When that resolution from the conference committee was taken to the plenary session of the ILO, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, its satellite states and other countries subservient to USSR foreign policy prevented the report of the conference committee being adopted by boycotting the plenary session and thus disabling it from operating for lack of a quorum. Thus only in that way was the International Labour Organisation prevented in plenary session from condemning the Polish martial law authorities for their repression of the rights of workers and peasants in Poland. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pleasing to note that the Australian Labor Party is under no such constraint and passed a resolution at its national conference, held in the first week in July this year, which supports the workers of Poland. I would like to read that resolution into the Hansard record. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Conference supports the right of the Polish people to determine their own future free from external interference and pressure. Therefore it condemns the imposition of martial law in Poland and the accompanying restrictions of political, civil and trade union rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Conference urges the Polish Government to release all political prisoners and restore civil liberties. In recognition of the close relationships between a stable economy and political freedom in Poland, Conference urges western governments to provide economic assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Conference calls for the granting of exit visas to all Poles who wish to be reunited with their families living in Australia. We urge the Federal Government to apply all diplomatic pressure within its means to achieve this end. </PARA>
<PARA> This resolution to be conveyed to the Polish Embassy, Solidarity in Australia, and the Committee for Polish Family Reunions. </PARA>
<PARA>There we have a resolution of the national conference of the Australian Labor Party which is in direct line with various resolutions passed at the various levels of the Labor movement in Australia, whether the industrial movement or the political wing. As Senator Harradine pointed out, it is in line with resolutions passed by the Socialist International with which the Australian Labor Party is affiliated. It articulates in formal terms the Australian Labor movement's point of view regarding the events in Poland which have so tragically befallen that country. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that many Australians, seeing some weeks ago on television the release of some numbers of detainees, may have thought that there was some loosening up of the strict regime under which the Polish people have been suffering these past months. Indeed, that is not so. Repression continues. Those who are found to be organising in support of Solidarity continue to be imprisoned and of course we have had the spectacle of thousands flocking to Victory Square day after day in order to recreate the cross of flowers which adorns that square, despite the fact that the troops of this martial law regime desecrate that cross by removing it during the early hours of each morning. </PARA>
<PARA> That cross, which was originally intended as a memorial to the late Polish Primate, Cardinal Wyszinski, has become a focus of opposition to martial law. I think the symbol of a cross of flowers is very significant. It is a symbol of the faith of the people, which is the source of their values and which they cherish and which gives life to, and sustains their strong yearning for, self- determination in their working and social lives. The delicacy of the flowers is also significant because to me it symbolises the very vulnerability and fragility of the human spirit as it strives to be free. Apparently that can be so easily suppressed and bruised by those who use brute force. But that cross of flowers is restored day by day, just as surely as the authorities try to suppress the expression of freedom of the human spirit which we see in Poland.</PARA>
<PARA> This motion, which, as I say, I am confident that the whole Senate supports, expresses our view as free parliamentarians in a democracy in support of the revolution which is occurring in that particularly vital country in eastern Europe, where the ordinary people have withdrawn their allegiance on such a large scale from the state and the Communist Party in favour of that organisation which was illegal, was allowed to flourish for a matter of months, and then was declared illegal again and has been supressed ever since. This revolution in Poland commands our support. It has an evidently democratic basis. It is democratic in that it is obviously really based in the will of the people, as tens of millions flocked to its banners. But it commands our support even further because of its evidently non-violent character. It is one of those revolutions against repression which has the characteristic so marked in the revolutions and social change brought about by Gandhi and Martin Luther King. Once again, in Lech Walesa's movement, we see that non-violent social change is the way eventually which forges the new society. </PARA>
<PARA> The spectacular impact of Solidarity throughout the West, and of course within the Iron Curtain countries, has been that the people attempted to form these free trade unions, both among the industrial proletariat and among the peasants in Rural Solidarity, against the will of the party. They exercised free will against the will of the Communist Party. They exercised the right to associate against the will of the Communist Party. They did so with tremendous courage. The party, of course, is unable to grapple with this phenomenon, because paradoxically it proves one of Marx's hopes-namely, that working people can take control of their destiny, can humanise their place of work, can humanise the whole of society by themselves exercising their freedom rather than being subject to the power of capital or of the bureaucratic Communist Party, which purported to express their hopes for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The claims of the Communist Party have been stripped bare and have been reasserted only by the imposition of a military dictatorship which at present controls the destiny of the Polish people. But as with the restoration of the cross of flowers day by day in Victory Square, I believe that the Polish people and their spirit, evidenced so often over recent years, will bring about a completely new society in Poland which will have much to teach both those who presently suffer behind the Iron Curtain and those of us in our presently organised mixed economies in countries such as Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, there are many links between the Australian and Polish people. They are expressed in the naming of our most noble peak after the great revolutionary hero, Kosciusko. They have been expressed in other notices of motion in the Senate concerning humanitarian aid, submitted by the Labor Party but supported by the whole of the Senate late last year. I believe that this motion is very timely. I hope that when it is conveyed to the Archbishop Primate of Poland, he will give it circulation so as to lift the spirits of the Polish people and to confirm the hope with which they carry out their struggle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to associate the Australian Democrats with the motion. We have heard the situation in Poland expounded with passion and with great discernment by Senator Harradine and Senator Tate. I do not want to try to add more to what they have said, except to say that too seldom do we have debated in the Senate matters of this kind of great concern outside Australia. This is a motion of which all honourable senators would want to approve, and I commend it to the Senate. I do so particularly in this case, concerning a country such as Poland, which has a tragic situation, in which its history has been dictated to it over decades and centuries by its geography, so that we have there people who, through no fault of their own, are subject continuously to the kind of pressures to which they are subject now. It seems to be a perpetually recurring theme in their history. If only there were some way in which the world could organise itself so that this did not happen-so that people were not hostages perpetually to history, continually being damaged and destroyed by it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This particular movement in Poland is of the greatest importance, probably to the world, because it is, after all, an expression of freedom of a kind, the freedom to live and work and do things as they wish, within a communist country. This is of great importance. I am one of those who believe, and I always have believed, that it is useless and ridiculous to look at a monolithic communism throughout the world as something which must be attacked and destroyed. That seems to me one of the most ludicrous and ridiculous ideas that ever was expressed, yet for a long time it was expressed by very many people. Fortunately , what would have been the consequence of their expression never came to pass, and I hope that it never does so. But it is of great reassurance, I think, to any student of history and international affairs to see what is happening in Poland. I think that every one of us must feel deeply for everyone concerned with that movement. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with Senator Tate that the movement is the more striking and the more important because of its basically non-violent nature. For this to occur within a communist country is of great moment to the world-although it is not surprising that the country within which it occurs is Poland. So the Polish people do not want to be satellites, mere pawns in the games of international politics. One wonders whether the Russians might, in the case of Poland, be thinking back to the lesson of China. Perhaps this might happen. Right back to the beginning of the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party, it is notorious that the Russians did not support Mao Tse-tung and the party which eventually created the communist republic. Far from it. They saw this as a radical diversion from communism-a group of mere agrarian reformers who had to be discouraged. Nevertheless, there of course the situation was not controlled by the Russians. The People's Republic of China developed into the sort of country, I think, which is very different-I have not been in Russia but I have been in China, and I have spoken to people who have been in both countries-where there is a very different view of things, yet all are embraced within the basic communist ethic. On that basis it behoves us to support the motion and we must commend Senator Harradine for bringing it forward. The Australian Democrats will certainly support it. I commend it to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; As a Liberal senator, I very much support the motion that Senator Harradine has brought to the Senate. It goes to the heart of my own political philosophy and the philosophy of so many in South Australia who have expressed themselves on this totalitarian action in Poland. It is not just the people from Poland and the now very well established range of Polish communities across all the States of Australia who are concerned about this matter. It is not just the immigrants from eastern Europe who have come at various stages, particularly after the Second World War, to gain freedom in Australia-from Romania, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union-and those ousted from their own countries of Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, and from other eastern European countries. It is also those other refugees, from Vietnam and other places of disturbance in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not only these refugees who have in their own lifetime experienced so directly the challenge to freedom and their necessity to escape to a free country, Australia. I believe that it goes very deeply to the hearts and thoughts of all Australians that there is a contest in Poland, a battle for freedom. That is why there has been such unanimity in Australia in expressing support for the call for a return to true freedom in that country. I know that General Jaruzelski and others in that dictatorship would contend that their actions were conducted with the noble intention of saving Poland from a Soviet invasion or that they were to save Poland from anarchy, disarray, disorder or civil war. In my mind these justifications are not plausible or compelling. They are excuses which bear careful consideration but they are still wanting. I believe people in Australia who have analysed the situation and those who have preceded me in speaking in the Senate are not convinced by these contentions. We have seen an odious denial of freedom to the people of Poland by a totalitarian dictatorship. The apparent excuses that it may use are not in any way a justification for this action. </PARA>
<PARA> What has Mr Lech Walesa done to deserve detention? What crime has he committed? He has sought to represent the people of his country. He has sought to bring them material, social and political gains. It is a blot upon the history of Poland that this present dictatorship has made a martyr of him by denying him his freedom and keeping him in detention. </PARA>
<PARA> An even worse odour surrounds the totalitarian system of the Soviet Union. I know that the people of South Australia were horrified this past week to read in our newspapers that the tragic attempt at the assassination of the Pope has, with substantial evidence, been traced to the Bulgarian secret service and beyond to the KGB in the Soviet Union. Whilst these sorts of conspiracies and plots always leave some doubt in the minds of those in Australia capable of sensible analysis, the evidence does appear to be substantial. I do not easily jump towards conspiracy theories about the Central Intelligence Agency or the KGB being behind all sorts of actions such as this around the world. But if that substantial evidence is all the more confirmed as the weeks go by the intensity of the odour that surrounds these secret totalitarian instruments in the Soviet Union and in Poland will increase. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion and its appropriate words will be directed from the Senate to Archbishop Josef Glemp, who represents not only the church but also the vast majority of freedom loving people in Poland. I assume and accept that a copy of this motion will also go directly to the attention of the Polish Ambassador in Australia and to the Polish Government. I had thought to seek an amendment to the motion so that it would have been specifically directed in that way as well as to the Archbishop and the people of Poland, but I rest in that matter because the Government of Australia, through very clear statements of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) has already directly protested through the Ambassador and conveyed to the Polish Government its abhorrence at the denial of freedoms in Poland and it has called for redress . I am assured that there is no diminution in the Australian Government's position in this matter. I conclude by quoting from a statement by the Prime Minister on 26 January of this year. Amongst many statements that he made at that time he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Because they dared to try to obtain for themselves some small part of the freedoms which we take for granted, the Polish people are now suffering appalling hardship and repression under martial law. </PARA>
<PARA>A short time afterwards at the thirty-eighth session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights Australian representatives concluded their submission in the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia calls for the lifting of martial law, the release of detainees, and an early return to the circumstances in which the people of Poland can be left free to find their own solution to their internal economic and political difficulties on the basis of consensus and reconciliation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Had I not spoken in the debate I would not want it to be suggested that I did not support the motion. I rise merely to say that the problems in Poland are difficult and need to be resolved in the interests of the great majority of the Polish people, if not all of them. I could find fault with some aspects of the motion. For example, I am not sure that we are correct in suggesting that the treatment of Mr Walesa is necessarily something that ought to be condemned even though I condemn the fact that he is imprisoned and has been in detention for such a long period. Nevertheless, I think the overall direction of the motion is one which can be supported by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not necessarily agree with all that has been said during the debate. I find myself closer to the views that have been expressed by Senator Mason. I believe there are different motivations and objectives which we seek to apply to the circumstances that exist in Poland. To that extent it is a question of understanding the evolution that is taking place in some countries. The contribution that Senator Mason made about not regarding these countries as monolithic monsters needs to be examined a little more closely by people who are listening to this debate or speaking in it. The Polish people have a long history of struggle for freedom. They have been oppressed by old imperial Russia , by the Germans. Some people will assert that they have been to some extent persecuted by the Soviet Union. That is a point of contention. The Polish people are notorious for their desire for independence, freedom and the right to determine their own affairs. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator GIETZELT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, maybe it is. That strong feeling of the Polish people is one that we should support. Very few people who value liberty, freedom, the right to assemble and protest and to establish their own form of democracy would disagree with those objectives. I do not believe that we can contain in any part of the world the struggle for democracy, human rights and the desire to establish a better society. In the circumstances in Poland today there is enough evidence to show that the people still want to retain a socialist form of society. The Solidarity movement has made that plain on numerous occasions. The people do not want to return to a capitalist form of society. They want to retain the public ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange. But they want to do it in their own way. I think that is the point on which they are in conflict with the Soviet Union and with other countries of the Eastern bloc. I think what we are seeing now and what we have seen, and I think to that extent what the government and the conservative members of the Parliament have failed to understand, is the slow but sure democratisation that is taking place and the breaking down of the monolith concept of communism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many forms of christianity exist and there are many forms of socialism, and, for that matter, there are probably many forms of communism. It is a question of understanding the aspirations of the Polish people. It seems to me that they are really in the forefront of the struggle to democratise their socialist regime. They want to retain a system under which they own the means of production. They want to move into areas of self-government and self-management. If one reads the intellectual views that are being expressed inside Poland, albeit sometimes by the underground Press, there is no doubt that the Polish people are impressed with the Yugoslav experience of self-management of its productive processes. I find it difficult, for example, completely to condemn the martial law that has applied in Poland now for such a long time. It may well have been that if the Polish authorities had not taken the steps that they took, they may have been involved in a much more dangerous exercise from the point of view of the Polish people. For example, an invasion by the Soviet Union would have been disastrous. It would have created a flashpoint in world relations and I doubt whether that would have contributed towards the normalisation that we want to see in that part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the super-powers have a tendency to regard certain areas as spheres of influence. For instance, the United States of America regards Latin America as a sphere of influence and therefore any movement towards democratisation and a greater say by the people in the management of their own affairs, even if they want to establish a form of socialism, is being denied to them. Similarly, the Soviet Union regards Eastern Europe as its sphere of influence. I cannot accept the fact that any of the major powers can establish, for their own purposes, for their sovereignty or for the protection of their interest, that other countries must occupy a subordinate position. That is an unacceptable position from the point of view of those people in Australia who regarded themselves as of the Left. It is not a position that we accept as being tenable or acceptable. For my part I want to see the establishment of the rights of people, wherever they are in the world, to determine their own affairs and to establish the form of society of their choice, even if they want to go to the degree of completely repudiating any influence of capitalism in the way in which their society operates. It is for each country to determine the form of society that it wants. That is why I took the strong stand that I did in respect of Timor and why I believe in our membership of organisations such as Amnesty International. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we have to put ourselves in the forefront of the struggle for human rights and the right of political dissent-the right for people to take views different from that of the majority view or even the view of the government of the day. Of course, we are pretty notorious for that in our own country. We spend all of our time opposing the government of the day. At this time we are in opposition against the government of the day. If elections are held and the government changes, then the conservative parties will take the view that they are entitled to campaign against the government of the day. If I accept that as a basic principle, and I do extend to all countries, to all peoples, to all groups, that same right and obligation to participate in the process of democracy. My only reservation about the motion is whether, in condemning martial law in Poland, that helps or hinders its development. But rather than being construed as being in opposition to the basic principle that no country should be forced to go through the torture and travail that exists now in Poland , I am prepared at least to lend support of the principles of normalisation in Poland and to express the hope that the trade union activists, the intellectuals , the journalists and the various dissident groups in Poland will ultimately be able to reach an understanding with the authorities, with the government, and with, as it turns out to be in this particular case, the communist leadership. That is the way in which this issued will ultimately be resolved in the best interests of the world and the Polish people. </PARA>
<PARA> I think if we look at this matter objectively, we will see that the Catholic Church, which is a very strong influence in the country, has taken a somewhat temperate position. It has not allowed itself to be manoeuvred into a position of opposition. It does not see itself as a rival centre, but rather as a conciliator, as a force in Poland that will try to bring together the different points of view in the country with a view to obtaining the normalisation which is so essential in Poland, and for that matter, in that part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I regard the rights of the trade unions in Poland and their leader, Mr Lech Walesa, as an important step in that process of reconciliation and, finally, normalisation. I appreciate that there are different motivations in this debate but I find it just a wee bit difficult to appreciate the attitude of some members of the Government and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). He lends support to the trade union movement in Poland. However, in the time that I have been in this Parliament, there has not been a period of more than three or four months in which we have not had legislation introduced by the conservative parties which was designed to restrict the rights of trade unions and curtail the normal and proper functions and activities of the trade union movement. So I find a certain amount of hyprocrisy in that attitude. The Prime Minister is prepared to suggest to the authorities in Poland that they should have all the rights of normal trade union activity. But so much legislation passed here in the Parliament at the behest of the conservatives had as its motivation and its objective restrictions on the right of normal trade union activities and interference in trade union affairs. I know that Senator Harradine would concede that point. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to make up one's mind about the destabilisation issue which was raised by the last speaker. I cannot say whether the KGB is involved in this or that particular activity in the world or whether the Central Intelligence Agency is involved. But I can understand the fear that exists in the minds of the leaders of the super-powers in relation to these matters. It is notorious that these organisations play a role of destabilisation, maybe in the belief that it is in defence of the interests of the countries that they represent. It is certainly notorious that the CIA plays a considerable role in Eastern Europe. Of course, it is this fear that accentuates the problem. It magnifies the problem and creates the antagonisms that we want to see resolved in countries such as Poland. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, let me say that I do not believe that any ideology, philosophy, institution, party or movement can prevent the struggle for more democracy and the extension of the rights of people to determine their own affairs. I am certain that the martial law situation in Poland can only be a temporary phenomenon. It cannot exist permanently because ultimately the rights of the people to determine the form of society they want and the institutions to govern them will in fact prevail over the role that the authorities are playing in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> Only when there can be this reconciliation and give and take between what I suppose can be described as the forces of dissent and the authorities, only when they finally find a means of understanding one another's concepts, will we then have the sort of bread, peace and freedom which is suggested in the motion. </PARA>

It is fairly obvious that unless one watches the Notice Paper and is fully aware of the business that comes before the House, one could suddenly find that a proposition has been put before the Senate and supported when it ought to have attracted some criticism and some opposition. I find myself somewhat at variance with the proposition before us because I do not believe it is helpful. It is certainly not helpful to the Polish people who have suffered destabilisation over a number of years. Caught in a buffer situation between the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics and the Western democracies, the Polish people have come under the influence of conflicting forces.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The history of the Polish people has been tragic. The conflict between these major forces has led to the virtual destruction of large parts of Poland, including the city of Warsaw, and led to the death of millions of Poles. One must have tremendous sympathy for them. What has emerged over the years is that the people and the economy of Poland have come under pressure both from the West and from what I might term the East. That has resulted in great damage and has led to the imposition of martial law. One must understand this before one condems the Polish people and, for that matter, the Polish Government in its endeavours to recover from a situation in which the country, because of Western influences and pressures, has found itself bankrupt. One must understand that the Polish Government in the past has been guilty of corruption and has not applied the principles of socialism as they ought to have been applied: It was difficult to apply those principles because socialism was never allowed to develop as it could have due to Western influences and the influences of the church. As a result, great poverty and great tensions developed. Many of the people moved from the country to the cities and subsequently were not able to be fed because collectivisation rationalisation of production in the countryside was not permitted to develop by one of the powers within the Polish economy-the church.

At the very time that we are critical of what the Polish Government is doing, the Queensland has declared a state of emergency, has stood down workers, and is prepared to imprison them under the new security legislation because they seek to improve their conditions.

One stays to improve those conditions which one believes to be prohibitive and oppressive. It is no use the honourable senator coming forward with an idle interjection of that nature. I am concerned about this proposition because I believe it should be debated. It is said that considerable debate has taken place; and perhaps so. I add to the debate and I add my reservations to the debate. I am concerned that we do not have a proper understanding of the events which led to the Polish situation and to the restriction of Walesa. I regret that, and my record is clear. Many a time I have supported the underprivileged and the oppressed; just as this afternoon I supported the Palestinians and their right to exist in the face of the Israeli assault. I am not afraid to be branded anti-Semitic because I attack the Israelis and their actions in Lebanon, especially around Beirut. I am prepared to do that, I am prepared to support the Polish workers. But I am also prepared to understand the circumstances which led to the position in which Walesa finds himself. We are not without blame. All we are doing here is adding to that blame because we do not properly understand. We look at the Polish situation through capitalist eyes. I am suggesting that from time to time we ought to look at it through socialist eyes because that is the form of government which those people are prepared to accept. The real problem in Poland is that socialism is not allowed to be applied. That country came under tremendous pressures.

<PARA> The Government's attitude towards recent developments in Poland remains basically that which the Foreign Minister (Mr Street) outlined in his public statement on 19 January 1982, following Cabinet's consideration of the matter. Since that time the Polish authorities have given us no cause to modify or retract our condemnation of the gross violations of human rights and civil liberties which martial law has inflicted upon the Polish people. No credible sign has come from the Polish leader General Jaruzelski that he is prepared to honour his earlier undertaking to allow a genuine restoration of reform in Poland. For that he bears an increasingly heavy responsibility, not only to his own people, but also to the international community, for which the continuing imposition of martial law poses potentially grave consequences for East-West relations and for international stability in general. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia continues to join with its Western allies in calling for an end to martial law, the release of detainees and a resumption of the process of reconsiliation based on consensus and restraint. The people of Poland must be left free to resolve their internal political and economic difficulties in accordance with their popular aspirations. Martial law is denying them that freedom. In response to martial law in Poland, the Australian Government has said and done a number of things. It has joined Western allies in calling for an end to martial law, the release of detainees and the resumption of genuine dialigue. It has conveyed its condemnation of martial law to the Polish and Soviet Governments. It has told the Polish authorities that in present circumstances we are not prepared to conduct normal bilateral relations with them. It has continued to defer a Polish request for further economic assistance and indicated to Warsaw that the roll-over provisions of a current Government- guaranteed credit facility are dependent upon the prompt payment of accounts as they fall due and that the option to cancel or suspend those provisions remains open to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It has supported Western moves to condemn martial law in international forums, such as the International Labour Conference and the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. It has told the Soviet Union that its role in the Polish crisis reinforces the need for Australia to keep in place the post-Afghanistan measures limiting bilateral relations. It has consulted carefully with allies in order to support Western objectives arising from the Polish crisis. It has decided to accept an increased number of refugees and migrants from Poland, as announced earlier this year by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, and it has supported the sending of private humanitarian aid to the people of Poland. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has had no cause to reconsider these measures. The Government took careful account of General Jaruzelski's speech to the Polish Parliament on 21 July which announced the relaxation of certain martial law restrictions and the separate announcement of the release of a number of detainees. Despite these steps, martial law itself remains in force and a considerable number of individuals, including Lech Walesa and other prominent Solidarity leaders, remain in detention. Recent demonstrations in Poland and their dispersal by the militia have underlined the wide gulf between the authorities and the Polish people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has made clear that, notwithstanding its strong condemnation of martial law, it will do nothing to impede the flow of private humanitarian aid to the people of Poland. In support of Australian community efforts in this regard, the Government made a cash grant of $1m to the national 'Help Poland Live' Appeal, of which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is also patron. Through the Australian Embassy in Warsaw, the Government has sought to monitor the flow of Australian private aid and to ensure that such aid is reaching the people who need it most. The Government is well satisfied with the assurances it has received in that regard from the Polish church authorities who are responsible for distributing private aid. Australian private aid is much appreciated by the church authorities in Poland and in Rome and has contributed significantly to the overall humanitarian relief effort. The measures the Government has taken will stay in place until the Polish authorities give us cause to reconsider. </PARA>
<PARA> We continue to condemn the role of the Soviet Union, whose persistent pressure upon the Polish people and interference in Poland's internal affairs have been a major factor in what has occurred. The Soviet Union has lent its active support to the imposition of martial law. It has once again acted in breach of its international obligations, as it did by invading and occupying Afghanistan. The Government calls on the Soviet Union to end its interference in Poland's internal affairs and, in concert with its Western partners, Australia recognises the importance of bringing home to the Soviet Union and the Polish authorities the seriousness of Western concern about what is occurring in Poland. In this regard, I draw to the attention of honourable senators the recent meeting between General Jaruzelski and President Brezhnev which suggested that the Soviet Union is continuing its support of the suppression of the people of Poland. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be recalled that the measures Australia introduced to curtail its bilateral relations with the Soviet Union in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan are wide-ranging and sustained. They include the suspension of scientific, academic and cultural exchanges; suspension of officials' talks at foreign ministry level; suspension of fisheries co-operation; suspension of Soviet cruise ship operations and a number of other things which have been made clear from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's policy in response to martial law in Poland accords with and supports the position of our Western allies as expressed in the important North Atlantic Treaty Organisation declaration of 11 January this year and at the later Summit meetings at Versailles and Bonn. We remain in close consultation with our allies about the implications of what is occurring. Poland was discussed during the recent ANZUS Council meeting in Canberra. The communique of that meeting noted that the imposition of martial law in Poland demonstrated that the Soviet Union retained ambitions outside its own borders which could not fail to lead to a deterioration in the climate of international security. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also appropriate to recall the Government's warning that Soviet intervention in Poland would pose the most serious risks for East-West relations and for international co-operation. No country could remain immune from the consequences of such action and the Government sincerely hopes that the Soviet Union would remain mindful of the grave responsibility it bore in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the imposition of martial law in Poland, the Government had made clear, both publicly and to the Soviet Union and Polish authorities, its belief that Poland should be left free to resolve its internal difficulties without the threat of external coercion or interference. The Foreign Minister conveyed these sentiments to the Polish leadership during his visit to Warsaw in November last year. Strongly implicit in the Government's stated concern was a call that the Polish authorities themselves should desist from using force against the Polish people. It is a matter of deep regret that this call-echoed by many other countries-went unheeded. In taking this firm position, the Government at an early stage joined with other Western countries in recognising the dangerous consequences for Western security and for international stability in general should the Soviet Union intervene in Poland. </PARA>
<PARA> In the period since the Solidarity movement took root, the various groups within Poland and the Polish authorities themselves had demonstrated an admirable capacity for restraint and conciliation in attempting to resolve Poland's internal difficulties. We had hoped that that spirit of restraint and conciliation would continue, but our hopes were dashed by martial law. The Poles had to contend with their difficulties in the face of excessive public and political pressures from the Soviet Union and other members of the Warsaw Pact, notably the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia. The Australian Government rejected such pressure, including adjacent military exercises, as unhelpful to the Poles and called upon Poland's neighbours to show restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> There would be benefit in our view in the Senate expressing its condemnation of martial law. This would serve to reinforce the position the Government has taken and reflect also the keen interest of the Australian community in what is occurring. It would also support the views of other Western parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that an important factor of constraint to date against Soviet intervention in Poland is the firm position most Western countries have taken, supported by strong expressions of community and parliamentary interest in those countries. For that reason the Government welcomes the sentiments in Senator Harradine's motion. It is a further, important expression of this Parliament's close interest in developments in Poland and lends weight to the firm position of the Government which I have described. I suggest, too, that the actions of the Government thus far have already met most of the recommendations in the motion. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion refers specifically to the International Labour Organisation. In that context, the Government can say unequivocally that Australia has been and continues to be prepared to join with the international community in protesting against martial law in the strongest possible terms and in whatever international forums may be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The International Labour Conference at its 68th session in June 1982 considered the issue of Poland in the context of freedom of association which is protected by ILO Convention 87, to which Poland is a party. The report of the Committee on the Application of Standards, which monitors the implementation of ILO conventions, included a special paragraph highlighting Poland's departure from Convention 87. At the insistence of several East European delegations, votes were called at the Committee and Plenary stages, resulting in the adoption of the report. The Australian delegation firmly supported the inclusion of a special reference to Poland in the report and also made a statement on Poland during debate in the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> On the aspect of human rights, Australia has also been active. The 38th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in February and March this year provided the international community with the first occasion within the United Nations context to take up the issue of martial law in Poland. The resolution on Poland adopted by the Commission, which Australia firmly supported, expressed deep concern about human rights violations under martial law. It sought an early end to current restrictions on civil liberties, affirmed the right of the Polish people to conduct their affairs free from outside interference, and requested the Secretary-General, or a person designated by him, to undertake a thorough study of the human rights situation in Poland. This report is to be submitted to the Commission's 39th session in February next year. The Australian delegation also made a statement expressing the Government's serious concern about developments in Poland. The Commission's next session should therefore have before it a comprehensive report about Poland. This report should provide a further opportunity for the international community to urge the Polish authorities to restore human rights and fundamental freedoms. Australia will support any such moves. </PARA>
<PARA> From this it will be apparent that Australian representatives have placed Australia's views on Poland firmly on record in international fora, including the International Labour Organisation, and have lent their full support to initiatives aimed at improving the circumstances of the Polish people. The Government will continue to explore further multilateral avenues to press its views about what is occurring in Poland. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's only concern, Mr President, is with the specific wording of the motion and particularly that it be conveyed to the Polish Primate, Archbishop Glemp. As I have mentioned, an important part of Western policy on Poland is that a genuine dialogue be restored between all the main elements of Polish society. We recognise, of course, that the church is of fundamental import- ance in the present crisis. But the Government questions the appropriateness of addressing the terms of a motion such as this to the church alone. We have no reservations about addressing it to the church. But we would prefer to try to bring the terms of this motion to the attention of all the main elements, including the Polish martial law authorities who, we continue to hope, have not become entirely insensitive to expressions of international concern. The Government would be pleased to arrange for this to be done by the Embassy in Warsaw. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Harradine can see fit to add to his motion words to the effect that we also express our concern to other appropriate bodies I would be pleased to have that matter attended to by the Embassy. We do not question the motive behind his particular thought with regard to the Polish Primate, Archbishop Glemp, but we feel that other appropriate steps could be taken which might widen the expression of this motion if it is carried by the Australian Senate. I ask Senator Harradine whether he would concur in widening that part of his motion to include such a sentiment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Since the beginning of this week there have been a number of media reports relating to my ex-husband Donald John Maher and allegations that he has received privileges from the prison authorities in Queensland. My name has been connected with these stories by reference to the fact that he is my ex-husband, and there have been references to events involving me which occurred more than 10 years ago. The matter has been raised in a political context and I think it is necessary for me to put the record straight so that there can be no misunderstanding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I separated from Donald Maher in September 1969 and sought a divorce which was granted in October 1970. I have not seen Donald Maher since June 1972-that is, for more than 10 years-and have had no contact with him for more than 10 years. The matters concerning him which have given rise to controversy over this week involve matters which are current or which have occurred over recent years. I am in no way involved with those matters. In light of the frequent references to me in these stories, however, I propose to outline the relevant events. </PARA>
<PARA> My contact with the Queensland prison system commenced in 1965 when, in the company of other members of the Queensland Debating Union, I participated in a number of demonstration debates to assist the Debating Union to establish debating and public speaking as part of the rehabilitation program in Brisbane Prison. Donald Maher was an inmate of the prison in 1965 and participated in debating activities at which I was also present. However, there was no personal contact between visitors and prisoners at that time and no personal contact between me and him. </PARA>
<PARA> During 1965 I became involved in debating activities in Wacol prison at the personal invitation of the then Superintendent of that prison, Mr Allan Whitney. I visited Wacol Prison frequently over a period of approximately three years and as a result came to know several senior members of the prison's administration, including the then Comptroller-General, the late Mr Stewart Kerr. Donald Maher was released from prison in December 1965. I met him at a debating function in January 1966. We were married in December 1966. We separated in September 1969. I applied for and was granted a divorce in October 1970. There was some occasional contact between us subsequent to the divorce on matters relating to our property settlement. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequent to his being arrested and charged with murder in November 1971 I agreed to accept a power of attorney for him solely for the purpose of winding up his business affairs while he was remanded in custody awaiting trial. In order to close down and sell his business, it was necessary for me to obtain detailed instructions from my ex-husband since I had never worked in the business and had no knowledge of it. I experienced difficulty in gaining access to him at the prison in order to receive his instructions. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore made a request to Mr Kerr to have visiting privileges additional to the visits allowed under prison regulations, which in any event were being used by members of his family. Mr Kerr stated to me that since I had, during the time of my association with Wacol Prison, proved myself to be trustworthy and had shown consideration for the requirements of the prison system, and because of the special position my ex-husband was in-that is, remanded in custody for an extended period awaiting trial and unable to handle his own business affairs-he would arrange for me to have visiting privileges similar to that of a solicitor provided that I undertook to confine my visits strictly to business matters and did not discuss with my ex-husband any matters that were not connected with that business. I gave that undertaking and abided by it. Mr Kerr also told me that a further restriction would be placed on my visits, namely that my ex-husband and I would be under close personal supervision by prison officers whenever it was necessary for me to see him. These were the conditions that applied to all my subsequent visits to Brisbane Prison. Mr Kerr told me that he would inform the Superintendent of Brisbane Prison, Mr Roy Stephenson, that I was to have this access. During the three-week period following my ex-husband's arrest it was necessary for me to visit the prison reasonably frequently-every two or three days. After three weeks I found it necessary to visit no more frequently than once a week, sometimes less frequently. </PARA>
<PARA> On a number of visits I had difficulty with the prison officers on duty when I sought to see my ex-husband. On these occasions they claimed to have no knowledge of instructions that I had special visiting privileges. On a number of occasions I found it necessary to contact either Mr Kerr or Mr Stephenson to gain access to the prison. I have no knowledge as to whether Mr Kerr made any contact with the then Minister in charge of prisons, the late Mr John Herbert, in connection with this matter and no reason to believe that he did. I have no reason to believe that Mr Kerr was ever aware that I was a member of the Liberal Party. The subject was never mentioned in any of our conversations and at that time I was no more than an active branch member of the Party. I had no contact with Mr Herbert, whom I did not know. </PARA>
<PARA> After my ex-husband's conviction in May 1972 I visited my ex-husband under normal prison visiting conditions. To the best of my recollection there were only two such visits and they were within the month following his conviction. I have not sought entry to Brisbane Prison for any reason whatsoever since that time, over 10 years ago. A couple of months after my ex-husband's conviction I was contacted by a welfare officer who worked at the prison. The welfare officer told me that my ex-husband wanted to have music lessons and that money would be required to pay a music teacher to visit the prison to teach him. I was holding some sporting equipment which had belonged to my ex-husband. I sold it and gave the money to the welfare officer. A few months later I received a further request to purchase some music text books, which I did. I delivered the books to the prison. To the best of my recollection that was late 1972. That was my last contact with Brisbane Prison. What should be clear is that my involvement is an involvement of more than 10 years ago and that in no way could it be said to be political. I am sorry to have to take up the time of the Senate with what are basically personal matters but the matter has been raised in a political way and I felt it my duty to ensure that the record is clear. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There are no readily available estimates of the cost of production of crude oil from Australian wells and a moment's reflection will indicate that even if the resources and data were available for a comprehensive study (which they are not) major qualifications would attach to the resultant numbers.

<PARA> (1) and (2) Levy is payable on all barley produced in Australia and harvested on or after September 1980 provided the barley is delivered by the grower to another person other than for storage on behalf of the grower. The Barley Research (Levy Collection) Regulations made under the Barley Research Levy Act 1980 place the responsibility on the purchasers of barley, and growers in the case of direct exports, to pay the levy to the Department of Primary Industry. Levy is not payable on barley retained for on-farm use; no precise figures of on -farm retentions for seed and feed purposes are available but estimates suggest they are significant.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Primary Industry has carried out investigations in all States to ensure that all purchases of barley and growers of barley directly exported are known to it and that levy collections are maximised.

<PARA> The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The program for the advancement of women announced by the President of the Republic of France, M. Mitterrand, on 8 March, International Women's Day, this year, is a wide-ranging strategy for enabling and encouraging French women to take a more equal part in the social, economic and political life of France.</PARA>
<PARA> A number of the measures announced will bring French women to parity with rights already enjoyed by Australian women-for example, a free choice of careers in the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA> Some-particularly relating to rises in pension entitlements-do not translate easily into comparable Australian terms, as French pension rights unlike Australian entitlements depend on contributions.</PARA>
<PARA> Of particular interest is a projected series of laws giving enforceable rights to the wives of small businessmen and tradesmen, farmers and men in the liberal professions, where they work together with their husbands, to a choice between the status of employee, associate or partner. This status would entail all the legal rights of any other employee, associate or business partner under French law, and is a positive step towards recognition of the work performed by many women. The first of these laws-relating to trades and small businesses-was enacted in May of this year, and the law relating to farmers will be ready in 1983. Many people will be interested in the outcome of these important and innovative measures.</PARA>
<PARA> The French program aims to recognise, diversify and make visible the contribution of French women to their society. I applaud the initiatives and will examine further developments with interest.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 4 May 1982 (Hansard, page 1758) Senator Button asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Does the Minister appreciate that this is not really a matter of expense? It is a matter of a statement made by the Minister for Defence in 1980 that flying hours and Royal Australian Navy steaming time would be increased as a matter of Government policy. The question is: What has changed, in terms of Australia's strategic environment, which enables the Minister to say these things are no longer important in 1982? Let me put it also in these terms: Was the decision which was made in 1980 wrong in regard to Australia's strategic preparedness?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I refer the honourable senator to the Hansard of 25 March 1980 page 1136; the Minister for Defence said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . There will be few now who can confidently assert that, wherever favourable opportunities may occur for manipulation, subversion and interference, including the Asian and Pacific regions, the Soviet Union will not exploit them. Uncertainty and instability everywhere are stimulated by this . We cannot have the same confidence in our strategic prospects that we had two years ago. All of us, together or separately, must give evidence that those who perceive a threat to their interests are prepared to back their resolve with military strength.</PARA>
<PARA> The elements of concern stated by the Minister for Defence then remain relevant today, as was made clear by the Minister for Defence in Parliament on 29 April this year.</PARA>
<PARA> The major equipment decisions also announced by my predecessor on 29 April are a further earnest of the policy stated in March 1980, not a step back from it.</PARA>
<PARA> The statement of the Minister for Defence of 29 April 1982, emphasised that no 'planned objectives' would be abandoned, but that adjustments to the program were inevitable. These adjustments included areas such as operating costs and Service activities. Some activities such as steaming time will increase in 1982 -83 with the introduction of additional ships coming into service in that year. Other activities such as flying time will be curtailed but only in some areas. The major flying changes arise from the measures the former Minister for Defence announced concerning revised training for Mirage pilots and from the phasing out of Canberra aircraft.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 18 May 1982 (Hansard, page 2016) Senator Chipp asked me a supplementary question without notice in relation to the Four Corners program titled Argentina and the Bomb screened on 8 May 1982.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chipp asked if the Senate could be provided with the Government's reaction to the concern expressed on that program and the statements made by West German Ministers and by international experts on the question of Argentina 's nuclear capability.</PARA>
<PARA> The transcript of the Four Corners program on nuclear activities in Argentina has now been examined by officers of my Department, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, the Australian Safeguards Office and other relevant Departments. Based on their advice I believe my previous reply covered the major substantive points raised in that program. However, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following additional information which may be of interest to honourable senators:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government maintains constant vigilance on all matters relating to the possible spread of nuclear weapons and the Government strongly supports international measures to maintain a framework of controls which will ensure adequate protection against the diversion of material to nuclear weapons production or nuclear explosives.</PARA>
<PARA> Argentina is not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and does not meet the minimum requirements for nuclear co-operation with Australia. Argentina signed the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (the Treaty of Tlatelolco) in 1967, but has not taken the necessary actions to ratify the Treaty and to bring it into force for Argentina. Argentina has thus not accepted a legally binding comprehensive commitment to non-proliferation, nor has it accepted a commitment to maintain now and in the future International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards over all its peaceful nuclear activities, that is, safeguards of 'full scope'.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government understands that at the present time all known, operating nuclear installations in Argentina are covered by IAEA safeguards under separate agreements with the Agency. The Government also understands that Argentina is in the process of developing nuclear facilities which it asserts will employ indigenous technology. Argentina maintains that it has not accepted any legal obligations to place such indigenously developed facilities under IAEA safeguards. These facilities include a reprocessing plant and a pilot heavy-water production plant at present under construction. The Government is aware of the following nuclear facilities in Argentina:</PARA>
<PARA>Designation Location</PARA>
<PARA>Nuclear Power Reactors:</PARA>
<PARA>Atucha I Atucha</PARA>

<PARA> Atucha   (under construction)</PARA>
<PARA>Production Plant Arroyito   (under construction)</PARA>
<PARA>Reprocessing Plant:</PARA>
<PARA> Pilot Facility Ezeiza   (under construction)</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that Argentina does not possess nuclear weapons. The Chairman of Argentina's Atomic Energy Commission, Vice-Admiral Castro Madero, has said that Argentina wishes to retain the right to develop so-called ' peaceful nuclear explosive devices'. Argentina has also stated that it reserves the right to make use of nuclear energy for 'non-proscribed' military purposes in the future. It is possible that Argentina intends thereby to keep open the option of nuclear propulsion of naval vessels. Argentina appears incapable at present of fuelling or constructing a marine propulsion reactor from its own resources.</PARA>
<PARA> In keeping with its policy, the Government is paying close attention to Argentina's nuclear program and to the safeguards arrangements which apply to nuclear items supplied to Argentina by other countries. A number of countries have supplied nuclear items to Argentina under separate IAEA safeguards arrangements in recent years. They include Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), Switzerland, the United States of America and the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics. There have been media reports of China having supplied heavy water and enriched uranium to Argentina without requiring the application of safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA> Nuclear cooperation between the Federal Republic of Germany and Argentina involving the supply of nuclear material, equipment and technology dates from the late 1960s and there are several agreements between Argentina and the International Atomic Energy Authority applying International Atomic Energy Authority safeguards to the items supplied to the Argentina by the Federal Republic of Germany. The Government understands that there has also been cooperation between scientists from the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Centre in the Federal Republic of Germany and Argentina's Atomic Energy Commission over a number of years.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Republic of Germany and Switzerland concluded contracts with Argentina in 1979 for the supply respectively of a nuclear power station, Atucha-II, and a heavy water production plant. These transfers are subject to IAEA safeguards, but 'full scope' safeguards were not insisted upon.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia made suggestions for strengthening the safeguards arrangements for these facilities in discussions in the Board of Governors of the IAEA in Vienna in 1981 and in consultations with other governments. The suggestions referred in particular to the desirability of ensuring that nuclear facilities replicated indigenously from supplied nuclear facilities should be subject to IAEA safeguards. Australia also called attention to the fact that in the case of a country like Argentina which had not accepted the legal obligation to apply 'full scope' safeguards, the resulting safeguards coverage by a number of separate agreements resulted in fragmentation. Argentina maintained that it did not have an obligation to change the safeguards requirements which had been negotiated with the Federal Republic of Germany and Switzerland to apply safeguards going beyond the coverage of items to be specifically transferred to it by those countries.</PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with its expressed objective of independence and self-sufficiency in nuclear matters, Argentina could itself develop facilities of the kind supplied. The absence of a requirement for 'full scope' IAEA safeguards in the arrangements covering the supply of nuclear installations means that such facilities might not be placed under IAEA safeguards if Argentina decided to contend that they had been developed from indigenous technology.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government would welcome a legally binding commitment by Argentina to place all of its nuclear facilities, now and in the future, under IAEA safeguards. The Government will continue to direct its efforts towards this objective.</PARA>

<PARA> The foster parents of infants released for adoption and of other children in foster care receive a payment of $30 per child per week. In addition the Department meets approved educational, clothing, medical, dental and other approved expenses and provides the children concerned with pocket money which varies from 30 cents per week at age five years to $3.80 per week at sixteen years and over.</PARA>
<PARA> Costs for institutional care are more expensive largely because the institutions concerned must roster staff for duty twenty-four hours a day seven days a week. Although the Department reimburses institutions at a weekly rate per child the payments must include a component sufficient to cover fixed costs and enable the organisations to keep available sufficient places to cover the child welfare needs of the Australian Capital Territory. Current rates of payment to Australian Capital Territory homes are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Marymead-$127 per child per week.</PARA>
<PARA> Richmond Fellowship-$233 per child per week.</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Barnardo's Homes-$263.50 per child per week.</PARA>
<PARA> Payments to voluntary institutions located interstate are made at the lowest Australian Capital Territory rate, currently $127.00. By way of comparison payments for children in Government training institutions in New South Wales have been at an average rate of $371.25 since 1980-81.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci have been sporadically isolated world-wide since 1961. (Barber, M., Methicillin-resistant staphylococci, Journal of Clinical Pathology, Vol. 14: 385-393 (1961). Resistance of organisms to antibiotics has been a problem since they were first introduced. I am aware of the concern, not only in Australia but throughout the world, at problems associated with such resistant strains in hospital medical practice. The Federal Government is naturally anxious that any problems which have been associated with infection by this particular organism should be reduced and, if possible, eliminated.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The newspaper article referred to in (1) reports this to be so but names neither the drug nor the hospitals. If the honourable senator would provide me with this detail I would be better placed to respond to the question.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) At present the Antibiotic (Standing) Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH and MRC) is examining the question of the incidence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in Australia and has taken steps to monitor the extent of the problem. To this end, the respective State and Territory health authorities have been asked to co-operate with the Committee in establishing the extent of this problem. Various professional organisations have been asked to nominate sentinel laboratories which could report instances of staphylococcus aureus and other antibiotic resistant organisms.</PARA>
<PARA> The NH and MRC has had the problem of nosocomial (hospital acquired) infections , which now includes methicillin-resistant staphylococci, under review for some time and, as far back as 1978, recommended that Infection Control Committees or officers be appointed in all hospitals where such measures were seen as appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course this is essentially a State responsibility, the only area for which the Federal Government has direct responsibility being the Australian Capital Territory. Although the infections do occur in Australian Capital Territory hospitals, they do not present a major problem. The matter is kept under constant review by the Capital Territory Health Commission.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. On the basis of statistical analysis of medical benefit claims, my Department estimates that about 2,000 doctors have received medical benefit payments which exceed the expected income for their peer group (i.e. doctors practising in the same speciality in the same State) by $20,000 or more per annum.</PARA>
<PARA> While I am advised that the figures are accurate according to the parameters adopted, the automated Fraud and Overservicing Detection Sytem (FODS) which produced these figures is still under development. It would not be reasonable to infer that abuse is involved in each and every case. The term 'abuse' in relation to medical benefits includes both fraud and overservicing. (Fraud refers to claims for services that were not provided, and is an offence under the Health Insurance Act. Overservicing refers to the provision of services not reasonably necessary for the adequate medical care of the patient concerned.) The statistical estimating procedure used does not distinguish between fraud and overservicing-it only provides a starting point for more detailed investigations .</PARA>
<PARA> This information has been forwarded in general terms to some other Commonwealth authorities. The Attorney-General's Department is aware of the magnitude of the problem and has been instrumental in the formulation of methods to curb abuse of the health insurance arrangements. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) are also aware of these figures and of the basis of calculation, but have not been given data concerning the identity of each doctor as the Department is still working on the data. Where indications of fraud are found, the matter is referred to the police. The Commissioner of Taxation has not been given this information.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Where indications of fraud are found, the matter is referred to the AFP by my Department.

<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of Press coverage given to this topic. However with the exception of the reference to use of Woden Valley Hospital as a storage bank for foetal tissue, the matters raised by the honourable senator relate to research work being undertaken by Dr Lafferty at the John Curtin School of Medical Research at the Australian National University (ANU). My colleague, the Minister for Education, within whose portfolio responsibilities this research work falls, has provided the following information.</PARA>
<PARA> No proposal for the establishment of a tissue bank using foetuses or foetal tissues has been approved within the Australian National University. Some work on cyro-preservation of pancreatic islet tissue is planned. If cyro- preservation can be achieved successfully, it would be feasible in the future to store deep-frozen tissue for potential clinical transplantation into seriously-ill diabetics.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been no funding allocated by the Government specifically for the project. A grant of $25,000 was made to Dr Lafferty in 1981 by the University under a 'new initiatives' scheme from its recurrent funds, which are largely derived from Government allocations.</PARA>
<PARA> The University research proposal is not concerned with aborted foetuses but with foetal pancreatic islet tissue which is supplied from the Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne. In accordance with the guidelines of the British (Peel) Report and the New Zealand report on Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion in New Zealand, tissue will be accepted for research purposes in this feasibility study only from foetuses between 10 and 18 weeks' gestation. All procedures that the University follows in this matter meet proper ethical requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> The foetuses do not have to be born alive. As with other tissue and organ donation (e.g. for kidney transplants), the tissue is removed after death.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as my own portfolio responsibilities are involved, I can assure the honourable senator that no proposal for the storage of foetal pancreatic tissues at Woden Valley Hospital has been considered, or approved, by the Capital Territory Health Commission.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) What reaction has the Government taken to suggestions that changes to the licensing regulations requiring compulsory flight checks for private/business pilots will cause increased rates of attrition of private pilots because of financial and other restrictions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) What response did the Government give to questions raised concerning the changes by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association of Australia on behalf of private pilots in a letter to the Prime Minister dated 6 January 1981.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator Messner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Government has no reason to believe that the introduction of the flight review will cause increased rates of attrition of private pilots, however this aspect will be carefully monitored. Should there be any increase, the reasons will be investigated, and appropriate action taken. Any proposed action will need to be balanced against the anticipated improvement in air safety.</PARA>
<PARA> In the 1981 calendar year 3,363 new private pilot licences were issued. The net gain in current private licences between 31 December 1980 to 31 December 1981 was 1,718, an apparent lapse of 1,645 licences. However, in the same period 546 commercial licences were issued, almost all of which would have been graduations from private licences. The average apparent annual lapse of private licences for the five year period 1976-80 was 1,756. The apparent lapse for 1981 is therefore slightly less than the average for the preceding five years.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In response to his letter of 6 January 1981 the Prime Minister informed the President of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association that the review was introduced to improve the level of safety in private and business flying where the rate of accidents is significantly higher than in other sectors of general aviation. The Prime Minister also said that there would be no resultant increase in staffing levels within the Department of Transport as it then was, nor in the costs of government. The Prime Minister also pointed out that it was his understanding that, at current prices, the cost of the review to the average licence holder would not exceed $90 in any two year period.</PARA>
