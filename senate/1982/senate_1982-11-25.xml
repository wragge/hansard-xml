<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs confirm that an Aboriginal alcohol counsellor has been employed by the Central Gippsland Aboriginal Advancement Co-operative for 18 months under a special works project grant? Can the Minister explain why the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has refused to provide funding for a permanent position of alcohol counsellor at the Central Gippsland service and for full time counsellors at Shepparton and East Gippsland? Is the Minister aware that this refusal is undermining the Aboriginal health services in these areas because there are no resources to attack the major basic health problem of alcohol?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will not be surprised to know that, among the many briefs I bring into the Senate, I do not have one containing detailed information of what is going on in the Central Gippsland service. I can advise the honourable senator that, about a year ago, a very constructive arrangement was made between Victoria and the Commonwealth whereby Victoria gave up to the Commonwealth much of its States grants funding in the area of Aboriginal health. The Commonwealth then reapplied that same money to set up, as the honourable senator knows, a number of Aboriginal medical services including the service at, I think, the Rumbalara Aboriginal community in the Shepparton area. In fact, I have visited that service and seen it in operation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Negotiations as to what the staffing levels should be have involved the Victorians, the Commonwealth and the Aboriginal groups. I understood that arrangements were made which were satisfactory to the parties. Those arrangements may not have included the entire establishment that was sought but they were enough to get the services started. I also know that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, to try to assist organisations to take on board extra staff members, uses a number of other mechanisms such as special works projects to provide extra funding capacity on a temporary basis.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator asks whether the funding arrangement which she describes is in any way inhibiting the work that needs to be done in alcohol counselling in the area. I will refer that to the Minister whom I represent. I would emphasise once again that what has gone on in Victoria with the provision and promotion of Aboriginal controlled Aboriginal medical services is really a model for what is possible in other parts of the country. I will take the question on board against that kind of background, which is a background of achievement and progress.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O97">Senator ELSTOB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. The Government continually claims that there has been a 17 per cent increase in the average national wage over the past six months in an attempt to justify a wages freeze and place the burden on the wage earner. I ask the Minister: Are these figures not misleading? To illustrate my point I give the Senate the following example: A is an unskilled worker on $200 a week, B is a semi-skilled worker on $300 a week and C is a professional on $400 a week. Their average weekly pay is $300. A is the most likely to become unemployed, so the average weekly wage of B and C is $350, or a statistical increase of $50. Similarly, the employers of B and C are not paying out more, neither has their standard of living risen because of the supposed $50 a week increase since A became unemployed. In actual fact, prices have probably risen on the basis of this supposed weekly increase, so the purchasing power of wages is less. Because these figures can be manipulated, is it not dishonest of the Government to seek wages restraint and wages freezes?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; It is certainly not dishonest of the Government to seek to overcome the difficulties that many people are suffering with their employment prospects. The wages pause that has been suggested by the Government is one of the ways in which we may be able to redress the shedding of employment . What the Government said at the outset was that there should be a pause in award wages. I think we have had several discussions about the 17 per cent increase in certain wages during the year. It is acknowledged that certain wage earners have received that level of increase and others have not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have not taken note in detail of the figures that Senator Elstob produced this morning. I think there is a fair consensus around the community that the wage increases over the past year, two years or three years have meant that increasingly the profitability of employers has not been maintained or improved and they are unable to continue providing employment. I think, if there is a realistic look at the level of wages, the wage demands and the effect that they have on employment, then consideration could honestly be given to whether a wages pause for a period would be helpful. That is precisely what it is proposed will be done at the meeting of the Premiers on 7 December. I think we should await the outcome of those discussions before we go along with the proposals that are obviously attractive to the Opposition parliamentary party but not necessarily to the rest of the community.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer to the $550,000m lent to underdeveloped countries and the $80 ,000m lent to communist countries by the Western world's 31 largest international banks, most of which now have had to reschedule those debts because of the inability of those countries to meet their commitments. I ask: Is the Government monitoring this problem to ensure that Australian banks are not sucked into a global collapse of banks? What percentage of Australian banking funds are invested in overseas international banks? Are Australian banks in any way insulated against the collapse of one or more of these overseas international banks. If so, how? Is the Minister satisfied that Australian investment in overseas banks is only with banks which are owned or guaranteed by their governments? I indicate to Senator McLaren that I have given notice of the question.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Australian authorities keep a close watch on developments in the international money and capital markets and assess their implications for the depositors of Australian banks. It is not accurate to suggest that the rescheduling by some countries of their debts is likely to lead to a global collapse of banks. Each of the major Australian banks has assets in Australia considerably in excess of its deposit liabilities in Australia. Australian banks' holdings of overseas assets, including claims on international banks, are funded almost entirely by borrowings abroad. In managing their international banking business, Australian banks limit their exposures to any one international bank or borrower. As part of its prudential supervision of Australian banks, the Reserve Bank in conformity with its depositor protection responsibility consults with the banks about their management practices. Within the above framework Australian banks do not confine their placements or loans to banks which are either government-owned or government-guaranteed. Of course, it will be appreciated that not all Australian banks have a government guarantee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YJ7">Senator MASON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, concerns the Government's continuing evasion of its obligations to the people of East Timor. Did the Minister for Foreign Affairs say that it was time the international community put the Timor question behind it and looked at the future constructively and positively? Did the Minister go on to say that the best way to help the East Timorese now is to work through the Indonesian authorities? If so, what action has the Federal Government taken to persuade the Indonesian Government to help the people of East Timor or even to allow Australian assistance to be passed through to those people? Further, how does the Government justify now its complete and continuing disregard of what the Timorese people plainly want-the right to self- determination?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2784" SPEAKER="Guilfoyle Sen The Hon Dame M.G.C." NAMEID="6D7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The question started with some quotes from the Minister for Foreign Affairs. On 20 November he did comment that the Government believed it was now time for the international community to put the Timor question behind it and to look to the future constructively and positively. In this regard the Australian Government's position accords with that put recently in the United Nations Fourth Committee by a former Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam. Since 1978 the Government's view has been that, as Indonesia is in effective control of East Timor, United Nations resolutions on East Timor have been both unrealistic and impractical. The overwhelming majority of countries in the Asia- Pacific region oppose the United Nations resolution questioning Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor. Support for that proposition is now confined to less than one-third of the United Nations membership. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said in his statement of 20 November that the Government hoped that the number of countries opposing it would be increased when the resolution on East Timor was voted on in plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly this week. This in fact occurred, with four more countries voting against it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have discussed this matter in this place on a number of occasions. It has been said by the Government in many of the comments made by the Foreign Minister that the only realistic way in which to help the people of East Timor is to work through the Indonesian authorities. The Government has provided over $6m in humanitarian relief and development assistance since 1975, and the Government also attaches importance to the reunification of families separated by events in the province. The suggestions made by Senator Mason in his question I think ignore the reality of the fact that the Government of Indonesia has the responsibility with regard to the people of East Timor and that to work with it is the best way in which we can assist those people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Today's edition of the Sun-News Pictorial reports that a gallup poll indicates that 65 per cent of Australians favour a wages freeze, with 31 per cent opposed and 4 per cent undecided. The poll was conducted over two weekends this month during the period the three Labor Premiers met in Melbourne. The poll indicated, too, that the majority of supporters of the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Australian Labor Party favoured a pay freeze. In view of the poll what is the Government's attitude to the poll and what future action is contemplated by government in regard to the matter?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was no question of a prices freeze at all. The question was: 'Do you favour a wages freeze?' The result was that 65 per cent said yes; 31 per cent said no; and 4 per cent did not know. Incidentally, of those, 58 per cent of Labor voters said yes, 38 per cent said no; and 61 per cent of Australian Democrats voters said yes, 34 per cent said no. The fact of the matter is that this is overwhelming. I think that, more importantly still, one should look at the Age newspaper of this morning and the very significant paragraph which says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At a time when the average Australian is coming to realise, often through unhappy personal experience, that direct links do exist between excess wage rises, falling corporate profits and disappearing jobs, it is distressing that the nation's current alternative Prime Minister-</PARA>
<PARA>That is Mr Hayden-</PARA>
<PARA>appears unable to accept this reality or the necessary consequences that flow from it.</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hayden and the Federal shadow Cabinet are persisting with, even strengthening, their opposition to the Fraser Government's proposed wages freeze .</PARA>
<PARA>I said some days ago that there was a growing consensus in Australia that the Government's move for a wages freeze for a year was right. Nothing could emphasise that more than the very substantial support in all sections of the community-men and women, members of all political parties. Now the only people out of step in the regiment are the members of the Labor Party. I said last week how important it is that at a time when the country is losing employment, when that is being caused by high wages, there should be a consensus in Australia. In fact, for the Labor Party to be pursuing the negative attitude against the mainstream of Australians is to be destructive and, indeed, to contribute to disemployment. I once again suggest to members of the Labor Party that the sensible approach is to join with the public who want this consensus to get a wages freeze, to get on with the job, to stop the haemorrhage of employment in Australia and to get on with the job to make sure that one man's pay rise is not another man's job. That is what a former Labor Treasurer said. That is what Labor recognised in the past. That is what the people of Australia are saying now. The only people resisting this now are the members of the Opposition in this place.</PARA>

My question relates to who is responsible for inflation. I ask: Has the Government agreed to lift dairy industry equalisation levies by 5 per cent? Will this decision result in an increase in the retail price of dairy products by the same amount?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The position with respect to dairy products is that in accordance with statutory marketing arrangements the Australian Dairy Corporation, after consultation with the Australian Dairy Industry Advisory Committee, sought the approval of the Minister for Primary Industry for levy rate increases. The Government considered the recommendations of the Australian Dairy Corporation against the background of the commercial criteria which are taken into account in the determination of levy rates and hence domestic bulk wholesale prices. On that basis it was considered that the proposed increases were justified. Indeed, this is basically a commercial judgment which is made by the dairy industry. I do not believe, although I will have to check it, that any requests of this sort have ever been refused. Like other price increases, they are subject to the discipline of the market and to the fact that, if increases are excessive, of course, consumption will reduce.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Government has asked the Industries Assistance Commission to undertake an inquiry into the dairy industry. As part of the inquiry, it can be expected that the operation of the dairy industry marketing and pricing arrangements, including the procedures for the determination of the stabilisation levies and the appropriateness of the criteria used in the formulation of domestic prices, will be subject to detailed public examination.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the particular report but I am, of course, aware of the fact that the housing industry is a large employer of labour and that expenditure in that area is likely to produce a very useful employment result. It was precisely that thinking, and the knowledge that there was a predicted reduction in private investment, that led the Government to alter significantly its approach to the welfare housing industry at the time of the last Premiers Conference. Honourable senators will remember that at the time of the Premiers Conference the Commonwealth announced that this year it would make available an increase in funds to the States of some 27 per cent. In addition, it was indicated to the States that, if they chose to increase their housing effort, they could receive additional parts of the works and housing loans at the concessional rate which applies under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am delighted to say that those Commonwealth initiatives have resulted in a substantial increase in the public housing effort in Australia this year. I speak from memory, but I think that the expenditure on public housing by all governments last year was about $650m. It will be in excess of $900m this year. In Victoria, where there is the largest single increase, the offer that the Commonwealth made was taken advantage of substantially. A very large additional part of the Victorian works and housing moneys was sought and obtained at the concessional rate under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. In recent communications that I have had with Mr Cathie, the Victorian Minister of Housing , he has acknowledged that the large housing package which was announced by Victoria was made possible by the combined policies of the Commonwealth, with its increase to Victoria and its freeing up of those votes, and the determination of the Victorian Government to see an increased effort in that area.</PARA>
<PARA> The position is that, in light of the pending economic conditions that were seen in the middle of this year, additional effort was made in the welfare housing area. That has produced a welcome lift in activity in that area around Australia. It remains to be seen what success the Commonwealth will have in getting the States to join with it in the proposed wage pause. It is the earnest hope of the Commonwealth Government that by getting co-operative action between the Commonwealth and the States we shall free up some resources which can be directed into areas which will be employment creating. In that event, I have little doubt that the Commonwealth Government and State governments will give very careful consideration to welfare housing as one of the possible areas for increased activity which would have both beneficial social effects and beneficial employment effects.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I am aware of some of the comments of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures. I cannot agree with what seems to be a conclusion that it has drawn, namely, that a 12-month freeze would be too much too quickly. Unless there is some change in the way in which the employment prospects of average wage earners are being dealt with, it will not be a case of having a 12 per cent reduction in wages; it may be a loss of jobs. Some people have been saying that one man's rise is another man's job. I think it is probably reaching nearer to the stage where a rise is that man's own job, and not someone else's job. So, unless realistically we are able to get a better relationship between wage levels and profitability, employment prospects will simply worsen. If the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures has some views, no doubt they can be put and considered in the proper forum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not only manufacturing industry which would be affected by any such pause . It is hoped that any pause that occurs will reach the wider section of the Australian community, the public sector and the private sector, and not only those engaged in manufacturing. If there were some sort of decline in the level of wages, of course one would expect that that would flow through to bring about a reduction in the level of inflation. It is not sensible to look at one aspect of the economic effects of a wage pause and to suggest that, because people are earning something less than they may have hoped to earn over the next 12-month period, by virtue of that there would be an equal loss in demand. What we are looking at is the employment level. It is not a matter of saying that employment is static and that whatever one may reduce wages by will be the only effect on the economy. What we are hoping to achieve out of this is better employment prospects and ultimately a reduction in inflation. Unless one puts all those factors into the mix about which we are talking one cannot draw the conclusions that have been drawn by the honourable senator.</PARA>

I commend that opinion and I commend also the comments of the Press in this regard. I repeat that there is a very substantial consensus now in Australia that what the Government is trying to do is right. I do not know what the full text of the November 1978 article is and I would need to read it. Senator Bolkus is calling for job creation by inflating the deficit, just as in the case of the Regional Employment Development Scheme, but the Government holds the view that anything that simply seeks to create money by inflating the deficit, therefore inflating paper money, will do what Mr Hayden said it would do. Mr Hayden said that that device would create more unemployment. So I commend Senator Bolkus to a reading of his own leader's premise that we cannot solve this matter by inflating deficits. Inflation of the deficit would do the very reverse of what is being sought-it would create more inflation and more unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No matter what members of the Australian Labor Party say, they cannot get away from the fact that that was its official text in government. That was a statement made by Mr Hayden, as Treasurer, and the premise on which he brought down his final Budget. In other words, he basically said that the kind of things that he and Mr Hawke are now advocating are wrong, that they will create inflation and that they will create unemployment. So the commentators throughout the media are saying at the moment, and so they are condemning that action. What we are seeking to do-I repeat that it is now supported by the substantial majority of the Australian community and political parties-is to get wage restraint because the increase of some 17 per cent to 18 per cent in wages in the past year has been recognised by all authorities as being the main reason for the shedding of employment, the main reason that Australia's inflation today is higher than that of our trading partners, and the reason that we cannot trade outwards. That is basically being accepted as the case. We are seeking first of all to get wage restraint and then, if we get that wage restraint, the money saved at Federal, State and local government levels and at the commerce, industrial and service levels can be used to maintain and to increase employment. In other words, there would be no new creation of money by inflating the deficit; it would be the same money. Of course that would be a full acceptance of Mr Crean's principle that one man's wage increase is another man's job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As honourable senators can see, these statements which were made by former Ministers of the Australian Labor Party strongly support what the Government is now aiming to do, in the same way as the public supports what the Government is aiming to do. Quite clearly, what we are aiming to do is the sensible thing. We are not trying to create more money by inflating the deficit for this purpose. We are trying to rearrange the expenditure of money to slow down and stop the shedding of employment, to bring about a conversion of loss-making into some minor profitability which holds people in employment, and to have money to do some public works and create more employment. I would have thought that that was so eminently sane, having now been accepted by the great majority of the community, that the continued opposition by honourable senators in the Labor Party can only be regarded as utterly destructive and indeed un-Australian. When the bulk of the Australian people recognises that one man's wage increase is another man's job and the Australian Labor Party is now resisting that premise, the Labor Party is taking a negative and destructive attitude and must continue to have the condemnation of the community and of the media that is now occurring .</PARA>

I think it was yesterday during Question Time that I pointed out that a country like Australia, with an economy so heavily geared to international trade, is a country which has a very strong interest in maintaining international trade. The restrictions which are likely during periods of economic adversity are certainly not in Australia's interests. As far as that part of the question relating to the use of industrial muscle is concerned, I cannot think of anything less likely to encourage economic activity in Australia than industrial anarchy. The sort of suggestion which apparently has been floated around that there should be some form of trade union action to prevent imports seems to me to be just a form of industrial anarchy of the sort which can only damage Australia's interest and damage the employment prospects of many Australians.

Is it correct, as alleged by Professor Ford, that only about 35 per cent of Australians completed 12 years of schooling as compared with 92 per cent of Japanese and, leaving aside hairdressing, approximately only 2 per cent of Australian school leavers are apprenticed? Does the Minister agree that we should stop being complacent about unemployment and look to nations such as Japan and West Germany which have made a massive commitment to training people at all levels as examples of how unemployment problems could be dealt with? If this is so, I ask: Firstly, what action is currently being taken by the Government in an effort to educate Australian people to cope with the age of high technology?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The goals which Senator Missen has set out for education are goals which the Government shares and which it is pursuing. I have read a paper given by Professor Bill Ford at the conference of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science. I am not sure whether that is the paper to which Senator Missen is referring. It would not matter because Professor Ford makes his points in the paper he gave to ANZAAS. What he is really calling for is the development of a national pool of skills larger than that which we have at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some of the figures given by Senator Missen I think are only partly correct; certainly they need some amplification. The completion rate to year 12 in Australia is 30 per cent for government schools, 65 per cent for government schools in the Australian Capital Territory, 45 per cent for schools in the Catholic system and 85 per cent for other independent schools. So it varies between different groups of schools. It is fair to say, however, that we want a much higher rate of participation to year 12. That, in turn, would involve in the schools curriculum a variety of offerings more acceptable and more appropriate to the needs of a larger number of students. While schools concentrate unduly on an academic stream a number of students will make very sensible decisions that that is not for them and they will withdraw at an appropriate stage.</PARA>
<PARA> I must say to Senator Missen that a lot of work is going on as to how we approach this question of the best way for a Commonwealth Government, with a quite satisfactory retention rate in its school system, to try to influence its colleagues in the States who run their own systems if we think some change is needed both in the offerings and in the approach, particularly to senior schooling. They might even try to do some of the things we have done in the Australian Capital Territory with senior colleges or try other means by which a more flexible and acceptable schooling stream may eventuate.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Missen also made some comment about apprenticeships. In fact, apprenticeship has been a major area for post-secondary placement for males in Australia. It is still a quite significant area. The honourable senator mentioned a very low figure.</PARA>

I still think that something like 30 per cent of males in the age cohort 15 to 19 years head towards apprenticeship. I think the honourable senator will find that the figure quoted is unduly low.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One point to make about international comparisons, which was another part of Senator Missen's question, is that it is quite difficult in some international comparisons to know whether we are comparing like with like. The definition of what constitutes full time employment varies between countries. For example, some countries might include trade training as being in full time education. Given a certain structure of education, that might be an appropriate way of measuring involvement in certain countries. In Australia we regard trade training through apprenticeship as being in the work force. The international comparison figures therefore have to be understood and analysed with some care in order that one makes appropriate judgments and comparisons. Nevertheless, we would like to see higher participation rates in schooling to the end of year 12 and in higher education, and we would like to continue to enhance the contribution which is being made through TAFE-technical and further education- particularly in the higher technology areas, to develop the kinds of outcomes to which the honourable senator referred to his question.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I can say that the Government is concerned about the considerable losses that are occurring in the general insurance industry. In fact the Insurance Commissioner's report which was presented to the Senate last week clearly indicated the situation in the industry and gives rise to considerable concern. The major point is that insurance companies are losing substantially on general insurance business and are required to offset those losses with investment income. The point to which Senator Archer leads us is that the security of those investments is therefore paramount in retaining the stability of the insurance industry as a whole. Those matters are very much in the forefront of the Government's mind and, in particular, the mind of the Insurance Commissioner who has the duty to scrutinise and to monitor the performance of insurance companies on a regular basis.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the superannuation scheme which has been proposed, I have written recently to the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee indicating that the arrangements which it now proposes to the Government are suitable and that if it can get the arrangements in place, the scheme may well be able to begin on 1 January next year. In other words, the obstacles that existed have now been cleared from the Government side and the Government and the AVCC have negotiated an arrangement which would enable the scheme to get under way next year. We do want to have the scheme open to involvement by college academics. That will involve another series of negotiations, of course, with State authorities because the colleges are, to some extent, creatures of the States and many of the academics are enrolled in what are, I think, quite unsatisfactory superannuation schemes since they are emerging cost schemes which are not properly funded. There will be some further negotiations in that area. But there is nothing in the arrangements which will stop the schemes operating next year. The letter which I have written recently went, I think, to Professor Hancock, as the vice-chancellor responsible for the work on the superannuation scheme.

I was present at the Committee and it certainly was reported to me by a number of delegates there that improper pressure had been brought to bear on Vanuatu. I did not hear anything about Ireland, but I certainly heard about Vanuatu with regard to Mr Lance Joseph's behaviour. I reported the allegation to the head of the mission, Mr Dick Woolcott. It is necessary for me to preface my question with these remarks, Mr President. I am sorry if I seem to be taking a long time to do so. I reported it to Mr Woolcott at the time. I have not brought the matter up in the Senate because I felt far too ashamed to do so. I was quite sure that it was in the capable hands of Mr Woolcott who, I must add, treated me very well while I was there.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I have prepared a tabling statement which sets out in summary what this report is about. It concerns a complicated and, at first sight, perhaps uninteresting matter so far as the Senate is concerned. But I think that honourable senators will discover that it is a matter of great concern and importance to the civil liberties of the people of this country in cases where the Commonwealth is reversing the onus of proof and where some steps need to be taken. I seek to incorporate this statement to save time but I trust that Hansard on this occasion will print it not in a microscopic form which would discourage people from reading about this subject but in such a form that it can be properly read by persons in this place. On that basis I seek leave to have my tabling statement incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs is today tabling a report entitled 'The Burden of Proof in Criminal Proceedings'. The subject matter of this inquiry is technical and somewhat complex and at first glance may appear to have little significance outside academic legal circles. However, the issues raised in this inquiry are of fundamental significance as they affect the civil liberties of every Australian citizen. What the report is in fact concerned with is the age-old common law presumption that a person is innocent until proved guilty. This presumption is being eroded by stealth in both Commonwealth and State legislation. This erosion is occurring because of the increasing body of legislation which places upon the defendant the burden of proving his innocence. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry was referred to the Committee by resolution of the Senate on 9 September 1980. The terms of reference were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The desirability of prohibiting or limiting use of statutory provisions, including delegated legislation, imposing a burden of proof upon defendants. </PARA>
<PARA>The reference arose out of a Report by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee which, among other matters, had been considering provisions in delegated legislation which placed the burden of proof upon defendants. That Committee concluded that the persuasive burden of proof should always lie on the prosecution and not on the defendant but considered that, as this was a matter of legislative policy, it should be referred to the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee. Although some of the principles regulating the incidence of the burden of proof go back many centuries, the practical implementation of these rules has been fraught with difficulty and confusion. The confusion partly stems from the term 'burden of proof' which is used in two very distinct senses and to which a variety of different names are given. </PARA>
<PARA> The first sense refers to the duty of a party to persuade a judge or jury by the end of the case, of the truth of certain propositions. Under the criminal law this burden of proof usually refers to the general rule that the prosecution bears the burden of proving the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. However , there are two exceptions to this general rule, the first being when a plea of insanity is raised by the defendant, and the second consisting of statutory provisions which either expressly or by implication place the burden of proving certain matters upon the defendant. In both cases the standard of proof cast upon the defendant is proof upon a balance of probabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The second sense of the phrase 'burden of proof' refers to the obligation of a party to show that there is sufficient evidence to raise an issue as to the existence or non-existence of a fact in issue. If the judge is not satisfied that there is enough evidence to make the issue one sufficiently arguable to be placed before the jury, he may withdraw that particular issue from them. In order to ensure clarity and uniformity of expression, the Committee has described these two senses of the burden of proof as the 'persuasive burden' and the 'evidential burden' respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's consideration of the substantive law and of Commonwealth policy with regard to statutory provisions placing burdens on defendants has led us to make a number of recommendations both prohibiting and limiting the use of such provisions. The effect of these recommendations may be basically stated as follows. First, the Committee considers that there should be no exceptions to the common law principle that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused. Secondly, the Committee considers that evidential burdens should be kept to a minimum: they should only be placed on an accused by statute in clearly-defined circumstances, although evidential burdens placed on an accused by the common law are untouched by our proposals.</PARA>
<PARA> The primary justification raised by Commonwealth and State Crown Law Authorities for provisions imposing persuasive burdens on defendants is that they relate to information peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused. An overlapping consideration is that, in many cases, proof of the particular matter by the prosecution may be extremely difficult and expensive or perhaps even impossible to achieve. While the Committee recognises that there is a need to place burdens of proof on defendants in these situations, we have strong objections to resolving these difficulties by imposing persuasive burdens on defendants by statute. We take the view that such provisions are abhorrent to our legal system, create difficulties in explaining the varying degrees of proof to juries, prejudice the right of an accused to a fair trial, and we find no compelling policy considerations justifying their use. The Committee reached the conclusion that the difficulties faced by prosecutors could be overcome by placing merely an evidential burden on the accused. The Committee seeks to achieve this objective by recommending the enactment of legislation similar to that proposed by the English Criminal Law Revision Committee in its 11th Report. Such legislation would reduce all persuasive burdens on defendants presently existing under statute and delegated legislation to evidential burdens. </PARA>
<PARA> The adoption of our recommendation would, however, have the additional effect of making any persuasive burden of proof presently imposed by the common law on the accused an evidential one only. A major effect of this proposal would be to change the common law rule that the burden of proving insanity rests on the accused. The Committee is of the view that the present common law rule is anomalous and illogical and sees no reason why the prosecution should not prove beyond reasonable doubt the sanity of the accused, along with all other elements of the offence, once that matter has been raised in issue by the defendant. However, we recognise that the adoption of our major recommendation might confront the prosecutor with some difficulty in proving the accused's sanity. Accordingly we further recommend that if our major recommendation is adopted an accused person who wishes to raise the defence of insanity at his trial should be precluded from so doing, without the leave of the court, unless he has given written notice to the prosecution at some appropriate time before the date fixed for the hearing of his trial. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Committee reached the conclusion that there were no policy considerations warranting the placing of persuasive burdens on defendants, there are sound practical and policy reasons for casting evidential burdens on defendants. The practical difficulties occasionally faced by prosecutors in proving certain matters, and the need for effective law enforcement and an efficient administration of justice, make it desirable, and perhaps even essential, that evidential burdens be imposed on defendants. Nonetheless, we do not advocate that evidential burdens be placed on defendants merely as a matter of convenience. There are situations where the evidential burden currently rests on the accused, for instance in licence matters, where the required information can be easily obtained by the prosecution. In such circumstances, we consider the placing of evidential burdens on defendants to be inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, we make three recommendations with respect to evidential burdens. First, that as a matter of legislative policy, provisions imposing an evidential burden of proof on defendants should be kept to a minimum. Secondly, that this policy be achieved by imposing evidential burdens only where the defendant is presumed to have peculiar knowledge of the facts in issue or where proof by the prosecution of a particular matter in issue would be extremely difficult or expensive but could be readily and cheaply provided by the defendant. Thirdly, we recommend that a detailed review of Commonwealth legislation imposing evidential burdens, and in particular licensing provisions, should be undertaken to ensure that evidential burdens do not rest on defendants unless the above criteria apply. </PARA>
<PARA> The final area dealt with by the Committee in this report concerns averments. Some statutes provide that where the prosecutor alleges certain facts the allegation is prima facie evidence of the matter alleged, or that those facts should be taken to be proved unless the accused calls evidence to the contrary. Such allegations are technically known as averments. The effect of an averment is to place the onus of proof with regard to the matter averred on the defendant . It has been generally accepted that averment provisions only impose an evidential burden on the defendant since, if the accused adduces some evidence, a jury or magistrate must determine on the whole of the evidence whether the Crown has proved its case. The wide powers given to the prosecutors by virtue of averment provisions are open to, and have on occasion been subject to, abuse. Although the courts have defined and substantially restricted the use of averment provisions, the Committee is of the opinion that further restraint of a legislative character is required in this area of the law. First, we recommend that as a matter of legislative policy averment provisions should be kept to a minimum. Secondly, it is our view that Parliament should enact legislation to ensure that existing and future averment provisions are only resorted to by prosecutors in strictly-defined circumstances which we set down in the report. Thirdly, whenever prosecutors seek to rely on these provisions they should have regard to certain criteria adverted to by the courts. These criteria are specifically set out in our recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I reiterate the point I made at the outset: the subject matter of this report may be technical, but its significance for civil liberties in this country is vital. This Senate is a watchdog of liberty and I accordingly urge all senators to study the report and to press for the implementation of its recommendations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak very briefly on this report entitled 'The Burden of Proof in Criminal Proceedings'. It is a most important report because it is concerned with the fact that in many instances before any penalty is imposed on a citizen, whether by way of fine or imprisonment, or some disadvantage is suffered by a citizen-for example, he may lose the right to undertake some activity, particularly a remunerative activity-whereas normally one would expect that the Government should prove the elements of any offence which leads to those drastic consequences, we find in Australia that at Commonwealth, State and Territory levels a citizen is quite often required to prove his innocence or prove the absence of any elements of the offence, be they mental or physical.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have been faced over the years with a great increase in the number of such provisions in Commonwealth legislation which reverse the onus of proof. With the help of a computer search the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs was able to find nearly 100 instances of Commonwealth Acts which reversed the onus of proof-that is, required the accused or the defendant to prove his innocence or carry the burden of proving the absence of various elements in the offence. In the case of delegated legislation one can be sure that the number of such actions was multifold. The Committee dealt with very technical matters concerned with the burden of proof. The categories of persuasive burden and evidential burden recur throughout the report. The question is: On whom should those persuasive or evidential burdens rest-the prosecution or the defendant?</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee covered a wide range of matters in its report. But I think the core of it which would be of most interest to honourable senators would be that part of the report which deals with the fundamental issue of the present way in which burdens of proof are dealt with in criminal trials relating to insanity. Because that is the essence of the discussion, I will confine my remarks in the five minutes allotted to me to that issue. The general rule established since the nineteenth century in common law has been, of course, that the burden of proving the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt rests on the prosecution. That was stated in the celebrated case of Woolmington in 1935 by Lord Sankey as indeed being the golden thread that runs through the web of English criminal law, namely, that the prosecution must always bear the burden of proving the prisoner's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. That has always been subject to certain exceptions, some at common law to do with insanity where the accused has had to prove his insanity. Also there have been a multitude of statutory exceptions to which, of course, I have already adverted. </PARA>
<PARA> But on the rare occasions on which insanity is raised as the defence for a murder charge, whilst it is true that the prosecution must satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt that the accused killed the deceased-in other words, the physical elements of the offence-the accused has to satisfy the jury on a balance of probabilities that he is insane; that is, he bears that persuasive burden. In such a case the law requires a conviction even though the jury may be left with a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused was indeed insane. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee on reviewing this area decided that the prosecution should bear the burden of proving all elements in a criminal offence-physical and mental-and that requires, of course, that in the case of insanity, if the Committee's recommendations were taken into law by Commonwealth, State and Territory authorities, the prosecution from now on would bear the burden of proving the sanity of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt along with all the other elements of the offence. As I say, this proposal departs from the common law tradition insofar as it has had application in Australia. The fact is that we have recommended this change in an attempt to bring this area of the law into conformity with that general common law principle said to be the golden thread that runs through the web of our criminal law. In doing so we would be bringing Australian law into harmony with that which prevails in the United States of America. Mr Justice Harland, in the course of delivering the impressive judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States in Davis against the United States in 1895, said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . how, then, upon principle or consistently with humanity, can a verdict of guilty be properly returned if the jury entertains a reasonable doubt as to the existence of a fact which is essential to guilt, namely, the capacity in law of the accused to commit that crime?</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee concluded that it is only consistent with humanity that the prosecution bear the burden of proving the sanity of the accused. It recognised, however, that in the needs of justice and fairness to all parties there should be a requirement of notice that that particular defence be given before the trial. Therefore, if an accused or his legal advisers were of the view that sanity ought to be put in issue, the accused should give notice of that defence, bear an evidential burden-in other words, make the question of sanity a live issue-and adduce sufficient evidence to require the judge to say that the prosecution needs to prove the sanity of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I make a plea that it not be thought for one moment that the Committee is advocating an adoption of the United States law concerning sanity of the accused in all its aspects. We do not advocate less stringent demarcation between sanity and insanity. We do not advocate any change in the general definition of what mental states should constitute insanity as have developed and served us reasonably well in Australia. We say that the accused has to make the question of insanity a live issue by giving notice before the trial and then adducing sufficient evidence for the judge to determine that the prosecution needs to adduce evidence to prove sanity beyond reasonable doubt. That is, we say the burden of proving the mental well being of the accused in relation to the physical activities which also have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt should rest on the prosecution. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>This first report of the pesticides inquiry concerns that part of the terms of reference of the Standing Committee on Science and the Environment which refers to the possible effects on Vietnam veterans of exposure to herbicides. In the preface to the report the Committee has drawn attention to the need for an urgent response to the report by the Government. The issues raised in the report are of such importance that we, as a Committee, believe that the Government should respond by 31 March next year. The Committee has also stated that it will meet again to consider the Government's response and any further information arising from the current research and make a further report to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee realised early in the inquiry that it would be impossible to consider the potential exposure of Vietnam veterans to herbicides in isolation from other issues affecting veterans such as the nature of problems affecting their health and that of their children and their position under the repatriation legislation. The Committee has therefore taken a broad interpretation of its terms of reference and has attempted to consider all issues adversely affecting those who served Australia with honour and dignity in Vietnam. In taking this approach, the Committee considers the issue of possible exposure to herbicides in Vietnam to be only one of a number of problems affecting Vietnam veterans. While the Committee gave special consideration to herbicide exposure and exposure to the contaminant dioxin as a possible cause of the health problems experienced by Vietnam veterans, it also examined other potential causes. These included insecticides, anti-malarial drugs, melioidosis and war neurosis. </PARA>
<PARA> After examining the evidence, the Committee believes that it is impossible today to obtain a precise picture of the extent to which Australian servicemen may have been exposed to potentially harmful chemicals. Nevertheless, the Committee is of the opinion that the potential for direct exposure to herbicides sprayed by Australian and United States forces was low. Direct exposure to insecticides sprayed both by Australian and United States forces was highly probable. The Committee believes that, while possible, indirect exposure to herbicides and TCDD, through drinking water and foodstuffs, was unlikely. The Committee decided it would be more realistic to assume some exposure and, therefore, proceeded to examine the degree to which such exposure would produce the type of health problems reported by Vietnam veterans and their families. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the aspects of most pressing concern to Vietnam veterans is the possibility that their exposure to pesticides could be the cause of birth abnormalities among their children. From the evidence presented to it, the Committee concluded that it is highly improbable that the birth abnormalities reported among the children of Vietnam veterans are the result of the veteran's exposure to pesticides while serving in Vietnam. The birth abnormalities reported are primarily teratogenic in origin and, as such, are almost always produced as a result of exposure of the mother to toxic agents while pregnant. The Committee believes that there is no biologically plausible mechanism whereby the father's exposure in Vietnam can lead, years later, to exposure of the foetus in the uterus, as would be required to produce teratogenic abnormalities.</PARA>
<PARA> It became clear to the Committee during the inquiry that a great deal of confusion exists in the general community about the nature and origin of birth abnormalities. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended a public education program to help alleviate this confusion. In relation to the health problems of veterans, the Committee concluded that, on the available evidence, it is unlikely that the psychiatric disorders reported by Vietnam veterans are caused by exposure to potentially harmful chemicals whilst in Vietnam. The Committee was impressed by the striking similarities between the veterans' disorders and psychiatric disorders found among veterans of previous wars. These similarities include such symptons as the rage reaction on which the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia placed a great deal of emphasis. Although there are some similarities between the veterans' symptoms and those of toxic neuropsychiatric syndromes, the Committee believes that the level of exposure, even if at the level claimed by the VVAA, is insufficient to match the daily exposure over eight to 10 years which is found in the literature on toxic psychiatric disorders. </PARA>
<PARA> However, further research is desirable. In the first instance the Committee has recommended that the Commonwealth Institute of Health, with the co-operation of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, establish a mutually acceptable panel of psychiatrists and neurologists to examine Vietnam veterans who claim to be afflicted by chemically-caused psychiatric conditions in order to provide an independent assessment of the symptom profile commonly reported among Vietnam veterans. In relation to the Commonwealth Institute of Health the Committee noted that the epidemiologial studies may be of limited use in resolving the claims made about agent orange and other chemicals. Nevertheless, the Committee recommended that, in view of the time taken over the morbidity study, a decision be made to proceed with due emphasis being placed on attempting to establish whether psychiatric symptoms in veterans are due to a war neurosis or to exposure to harmful chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is unable to reach a conclusion on claims made about an increased rate of mortality among Vietnam veterans due to cancer. Insufficient is known about the human carcinogenicity of the chemicals to which the Vietnam veterans may have been exposed to warrant any definite statement about the likelihood of an increase in the rate of deaths caused by cancer. However, the Committee believes that there may be other reasons-for example, suicides and accidents due to psychiatric disorders-for expecting an increase in mortality. Accordingly the Committee recommended the rapid completion of the Commonwealth Institute of Health morbidity study. </PARA>
<PARA> Regarding their position under the Repatriation Act, the Committee concluded that the liability provisions of the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962 narrow the criteria by which compensation can be made to Vietnam veterans. The Committee welcomes the removal of this anomaly by the current amendments to the legislation. In addition, the Committee recommended that the proposed review of the repatriation legislation should include an examination of the evidentiary provisions, especially the reliance on information provided by departmental sources. The Committee was most impressed by the services offered through the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service and has recommended that serious consideration be given to extending it beyond 31 December 1983. The Committee also recommends that adequate staffing levels at the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service be provided to enable the collection and publication of relevant data. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee examined several other aspects of the repatriation system as it affects Vietnam veterans, including veterans in non-metropolitan areas and prisons and the relations between the Department of Veterans' Affairs and veterans. Honourable senators would be aware that the Army Office of the Department of Defence has been examining some 21,000 files held at the Australian War Memorial seeking information about the use of pesticides in Vietnam. I understand that the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) will shortly be tabling a report in the House of Representatives based on the material in these files. The Committee was anxious to ensure that the material contained in this report did not contradict the substance of departmental evidence to the Committee in relation to pesticide spraying. Following a meeting with officers of the Department of Defence, the Committee is satisfied that the main thrust of departmental evidence presented to the Committee in relation to pesticide spraying in Vietnam was substantially correct. However, the Committee did obtain from the Department of Defence specific information relating to pesticide spraying from the War Memorial files and this is reflected in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the statement on 11 November by Senator Sir John Carrick, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, that it is keenly interested in and aware of its self-imposed task to present a response within six months of the tabling of a parliamentary committee report. I believe also that the Government, apart from taking action to ensure speedier responses, should take the following measures:</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, when responses are to extend beyond six months a statement should be made to the Senate indicating when a response could be expected and the reasons why the timeframe could not be kept; and secondly,</PARA>
<PARA> committee chairmen should be provided with a copy of the Government response at least one sitting day in advance of the response being tabled. This would enable committee chairmen to make an immediate reply to the response if desired. If these measures are implemented it will place the system of responses to reports on a much more business-like footing. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another matter on which I should comment. Throughout the inquiry there have been suggestions that the Committee was unwilling to call as a witness Dr Keith Fleming, formerly the Chief Director (Medical Services) in the Department of Veterans' Affairs. On behalf of the Committee I wish to refute totally this suggestion. The Committee's decision not to call Dr Fleming was based entirely on advice from the Committee secretary following discussions with Dr Fleming late last year and early this year. Dr Fleming advised the secretary that he would be willing to appear before the Committee if requested to do so; however, he doubted whether his evidence would be of much value to the Committee. Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to table a letter from Dr Fleming confirming his willingness to appear before the Committee. In that letter he states:</PARA>
<PARA> To my knowledge, I have no information not already made available concerning toxic chemicals and Vietnam veterans. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make only a few comments in relation to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and Environment. I will then seek leave to continue my remarks. I should emphasise a couple of points made by Senator Jessop in relation to the report. Senator Jessop in his tabling statement said that this was the first report of the Science and the Environment Committee in relation to the reference that had been given to it by the Senate. I believe that is the point that needs to be emphasised. It certainly is the first report of the section which deals with Vietnam veterans. It is worth pointing out and re-emphasising that we have undertaken in this first report to seek a response from the Government by 31 March 1983. Following that response from the Government, and following inquiries and further evidence that may be gathered, a further report will be given to the Senate by this Committee. As I cannot say what the Committee will do, I cannot say whether that will be the final report. At this stage my belief is that it probably will be the final report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must say that a number of members of the Committee had some reservations about this report. However, after much discussion with and much heartburn on the part of members of the Committee, it was decided, I think rightly so, that this report should be brought down so that those people interested in it whether they be Vietnam veterans, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Department of Health or whoever, could have some time to look at the report, to discuss it and to take into consideration the points made in the report by the Committee so that if they have any further evidence or wish to make some further comment, maybe we can take that into consideration when we make the final report to the Senate. I think it needs also to be mentioned that it is fairly important that this report be brought down-because of the type of inquiry that it was and because of the amount of time that has been spent in discussions with Vietnam veterans-before any resolutions are made on the problems that face Vietnam veterans after service in Vietnam. I think it is important that this report be brought forward so that the recommendations to date can be given to test the validity of the Government's claims and to see whether it will respond to some of the claims made in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> As a member of the Opposition, I had some doubt about the Government's response to the recommendations in the report. But, as a member of the Committee, I felt that it was important that the report be made and that we undertake to give the Government a chance to respond to it. The Committee can then have a further look at the problems facing Vietnam veterans before the final report is brought down in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point that I would like to make-I want to keep my remarks short-relates to the point raised by Senator Jessop when tabling the report. He said that we had had discussions with members of the Department of Defence regarding the report that it will bring down relating to the 21,000 files which were found, I think at the Australian War Memorial. The result of that report will be known some time later. It has not been tabled at this stage. It is fairly important to note that the Committee would have had some difficulty in bringing down a final report. Whilst we had information from members of the Department of Defence, and whilst the Chairman has said that we were satisfied, I think it is reasonable to expect that the Committee should look in some detail at the report being prepared by the Department of Defence on those 21,000 files. In order to bring down a comprehensive and reasonable report, it behoves us to take some more detailed look at the report being brought down by the Department of Defence on those 21,000 files because as a Committee we may find that we need to make further inquiries following that report. We may find that that report satisfies the needs of the Committee and we will not need to go any further. However, that is a decision for the Committee and it is reasonable enough to expect that the Committee should have that report available to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point I would like to make is one of criticism. I am slightly critical of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) in this matter. I raise this matter because it happened in the course of the Committee's inquiry. I was quite taken aback by the answers given to me when I questioned a witness who was giving to the Committee a final report from the Department of Veterans' Affairs in relation to spraying in Vietnam. The submission being given to the Committee was quite detailed. It was detailed in the form in which it was given, the words used and the way in which things were described, and in the visual aids, maps and other details given by the members of the Minister's Department I asked one of the witnessess: 'Did the Minister see the submission before it was given to the Committee?' The answer from the witness from the Department was that the Minister was vaguely told about the submission-I am not quoting the exact words- but that he certainly did not see the total submission. </PARA>
<PARA> I felt that with a committee which was investigating such a very serious situation as that of the effects of pesticides on the health of Australians who have returned from Vietnam, it would be reasonable to expect that if a final submission were to be put to the Committee, that submission would have to be approved by the Minister, or at least that the Minister would see the submission in its totality. Maybe I shall stand some correction on this matter, but as a member of the Committee I was amazed that that was not so and did not happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Committee worked together extremely well. I believe that this report will allow the Vietnam veterans and the departments which are interested in the matter to look in some detail at what evidence has been given to the Committee and at some of the conclusions. I hope the Government will look at the recommendations and respond to them by the set date of 31 March 1983, and then the Committee should be able to complete its work and produce a further report following the Government's response. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave, Mr Acting Deputy President, to incorporate my tabling statement in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> On 8 September 1981, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence passed a resolution referring to its Sub-committee A, the Sub-committee on the Pacific Basin, the following terms of reference: 'Australian-United States' Relations'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sub-committee, which is chaired by Mr Stephen Lusher, M.P., called for submissions on the reference through newspaper advertisements and direct contact with interested persons and organisations in Australia and the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sub-committee has conducted a wide-ranging inquiry into all the major aspects of Australian-United States' relations, including foreign policy, security and defence matters, as well as economic and cultural relations. I would like to thank those individuals and government departments who spent time and effort in preparing written submissions and who gave oral evidence before the Sub-committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The focus of the report is Australia's long-standing security relationship with the United States, as embodied in the ANZUS Treaty. The Sub-committee on the Pacific Basin will continue its examination of the other aspects of the reference, and these will be discussed in future reports of the Committee as appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that it is particularly appropriate that it should be considering this reference in 1982, the thirtieth anniversary of the ANZUS Treaty. As the Committee points out in the introduction to the report, ANZUS underpins the Australian-United States' relationship, which, during the last thirty years, has become increasingly complex and multifaceted, and remains Australia's single most important external relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee acknowledges that a number of Australians have serious reservations concerning Australia's close security relationship with the United States, including fears that the presence of US installations may make Australia a nuclear target in the event of war between the United States and the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> Doubts have also been expressed as to whether the United States would be willing to become involved militarily on Australia's side in the event of a regional conflict breaking out. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that these reservations over Australia's membership of ANZUS reflect misunderstandings concerning both the nature of ANZUS and Australia's expectations of the pact as a security shield. The purpose of this report, therefore, is to discuss the issues that have been raised and to clarify the Australian-United States' security relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recognises that the basic asymmetry of the relationship between the two countries is an undeniable fact-the United States is a 'superpower' with global pre-occupations, while Australia is a smaller power concerned with defining its own role as a 'middle-power' in regional and international affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> The report also discusses the extent to which Australian diplomacy is, or need be, constrained by our close relationship with the United States. The Committee believes that Australia's basic objective is to fulfil its commitment to the Alliance, with due regard to our national interest and the maintenance of our national sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 1 of the report traces the history of the ANZUS pact and examines its terms. The views of a number of scholars who have written on the Treaty are noted and discussed, as are statements made by Australian and American statesmen and officials who were involved in the negotiation of the pact. </PARA>
<PARA> In examining the legal interpretation of Articles II, III, IV and V of the ANZUS Treaty, which spell out the pact's guarantees of mutual assistance, the report notes that it has often been said that Article IV of ANZUS is not so binding a mutual guarantee of protection as that contained in Article 5 of the NATO Treaty. This is because Article 5 of the NATO pact contains the phrase 'an armed attack against one . . . shall be considered an armed attack against all', whereas Article IV of ANZUS states only that 'in case of an armed attack in the Pacific Area on any of the Parties, each party would act to meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional processes'. The report points out, however, that at the time the ANZUS Treaty was negotiated spokesmen for all the parties to the Treaty stated that the general intention of the two treaties was the same. It was explained that the language used in the NATO Treaty gave rise in the United States Senate to a debate as to whether that precise language involved any shift in the responsibility between the President and the Congress. As the then US Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, stated before the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, it seemed to him and to the other governments concerned best to not reopen that kind of debate again by using in the ANZUS Treaty language that might not be acceptable to the United States Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also points out that, as emphasised in evidence heard in the course of the inquiry, the formal wording of any treaty is only an indication of the obligation felt by the partners, and that the 'formal' or 'paper' aspects of the Alliance, especially in the case of ANZUS, are really peripheral to the essence of the relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concludes this chapter by stating that the recent significant signs of renewed US interest in the Pacific-Indian Ocean region are in accord with the spirit of ANZUS, and that it also believes there is a need for Australia to assert its position as a middle power in our own region, in addition to providing a stable base for the US Pacific Command in the Western Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. </PARA>
<PARA> In Chapter 2, entitled the 'ANZUS Security Guarantee', the Committee emphasises that no major threat has emerged, or is likely to emerge in the short term, which would test American willingness to commit its forces to protect either Australia or New Zealand under the ANZUS Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Chapter, the report discusses the significance of ANZUS in the light of past events, including the Malaysian-Indonesian 'confrontation' in the early 1960s, and goes on to discuss current Australian and American perceptions of ANZUS and its role, including the extent to which, realistically, Australia could expect assistance under the terms of the Treaty, should this country ever face a serious threat to its security. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee makes two main points: first, while Australia's security against a serious threat may ultimately depend on military assistance from the United States, Australia must be in a position to mount a national defence effort that would maximise the risks and costs of any aggression against us. Secondly, the Committee emphasises that, on a number of occasions under recent administrations , the United States has made it perfectly clear to its allies in the region, including Australia, that it expects them to defend themselves except in the case of a threat from a major power. </PARA>
<PARA> As stated in the report, the Committee considers that the mutual security provisions of the ANZUS Treaty represent a stronger assurance of military assistance in the event of an attack on Australian territory than a commitment merely to consult. The Committee believes that, in the event of a threat to Australia which proved beyond the capacity of the Australian defence force to meet unaided, US support would be forthcoming in accordance with the mutual security provisions of the Treaty. However, no such threat is visible in the near future; nor is it clear what form of assistance would be provided, should a serious threat emerge. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also points out that there are other considerations to be taken into account, including the possibly limited capability of the United States to supply support and assistance to the Pacific region in the event of a crisis which coincided with a crisis elsewhere in the world. The Committee notes that there is also the question of how the United States would react should there be a conflict in its support of Australia against a hypothetical adversary in the region with which the United States also had a security agreement, in the event that Australia and that hypothetical adversary were in conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in Chapter 2, the Committee emphasises again that current United States defence thinking in relation to the Asian-Pacific region, as well as its expectations of Australia's role within the framework of ANZUS, indicate that the United States' view of its role in the region precludes direct military involvement, except in an extreme situation. The Committee believes that the official Australian view of ANZUS acknowledges this. </PARA>
<PARA> In Chapter 3, the committee discusses the benefits and costs of ANZUS. In addition to providing reassurance that, in the event of a fundamental threat to Australia's security, it could reasonably be expected that United States support would be forthcoming, there are a number of other benefits which Australia obtains from its participation in ANZUS. These benefits are in the area of supply and support, the training benefits the Australian Defence Force derives from joint military exercises, and the strategic dialogue which the ANZUS relationship facilitates between Australia and the United States. In its submission to the Sub-Committee, the Department of Defence emphasised that this dialogue gives Australia valuable access to United States strategic thinking and allows closer assessment of global and regional developments which also might affect Australia's own strategic outlook. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, the Committee notes that there is the benefit of deterrence: in the geopolitical context ANZUS conveys to the Soviet bloc powers and potential aggressors within the region a strong signal, both from the United States and the local powers concerned, that this is not an area of low-cost, low-risk opportunities. The Committee also notes another benefit brought to the attention of the Sub-Committee, in that membership of ANZUS gives Australia an enhanced status in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> The report then looks at the question of whether the costs of ANZUS are too high in relation to the benefits Australia receives from it. Witnesses who appeared before the Sub-Committee have argued that the main costs are:</PARA>
<PARA> the extent to which the joint Australian-United States' facilities (especially those at Pine Gap, Nurrungar and North West Cape) may be nuclear targets in the event of global war between the United States and the Soviet Union;</PARA>
<PARA> loss of sovereignty, due in part to the presence of the above installations, since Australia is said to have insufficient control over, or to be inadequately consulted about certain aspects of their operation;</PARA>
<PARA> distortion of our national defence posture as a result of adopting policies better suited to the global defence strategy of the United States than our own defence needs;</PARA>
<PARA> diplomatic constraints on Australia, due to our close links with the United States, which may conflict with our foreign policy priorities as a regional power. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's report examines each of these points. On the issue of whether Australia is a nuclear target due to the presence of the Australian-United States' joint defence facilities, the Committee draws attention to the points raised in a previous report, Threats to Australia's Security, tabled in 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> That report, which was prepared by the Committee's Sub-Committee C-the Sub- Committee on Defence Matters-concluded that 'it would be prudent for Australian defence planners to assume that the joint facilities at North West Cape, Pine Gap and Nurrungar are on the Soviet target list and might be attacked in the course of a nuclear conflict between the two superpowers'. </PARA>
<PARA> However, both in that report and in the report being tabled today, the Committee points out that the part played by the facilities at Pine Gap and Nurrungar in monitoring and gathering intelligence on Soviet forces and weapon movements, their verification capabilities in regard to arms limitations agreements, as well as the important contribution made by the facility at North West Cape to United States' defences, make a vital contribution to the defences of the whole Western Alliance. Therefore, on balance, the Committee agrees with the assessment made by this and former Australian governments, that the benefits to Western defences and therefore Australia's ultimate security outweigh any risks the presence of these facilities entails. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of whether the presence of the facilities entails a loss of Australian sovereignty, the Committee draws attention to statements on the subject made by Government and Opposition spokesmen. These statements stress that Australians share control of, and participate in, the functioning of the facilities at Pine Gap and Nurrungar at all levels of operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also notes the reservations expressed by the Leader of the Opposition, the Honourable W. G. Hayden, concerning Australian control over the operation of the North West Cape Station. </PARA>
<PARA> The report states that no substantive evidence was presented to the Committee that would contradict the views of the Department of Defence (and the statements just referred to) that the facilities at Pine Gap and Nurrungar are both conducted with Australia's full knowledge and concurrence. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, the Committee concludes that, on balance, Australian access to and participation in the operations of the joint facility at North West Cape is appropriate in the context of Australia's responsibilities under the ANZUS Alliance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee therefore states that it is satisfied that there is no unacceptable loss of sovereignty arising from the presence of the joint facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also points out that, along with other features of the Australian -American intelligence co-operation, the facilities are a major Australian contribution and therefore a 'card of entry' to allied intelligence policies and decision making. </PARA>
<PARA> Next, the Committee looks at the value of the Australian-United States defence co-operation. It acccepts the Defence assessment that, overall, the exchange of intelligence information is of high quality and is of benefit to Australia, particularly in respect of those areas where Australia's own national resources can provide only limited coverage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also states that the ANZUS relationship is of such crucial importance that the partners must conduct themselves on the basis of full equality, consulting each other where major changes are contemplated in the security relationships which link them and, in particular, sounding out opinions well in advance of any likely need for commitments to be made either under the Alliance or of a less formal nature. The Committee believes that, if this is done, the future of the Australian-United States' security relationship is likely to be smooth. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, the Committee concludes that the present level of defence co-operation between Australia and the United States, is not inimical to Australia's national or regional intersts, and that it offers a measure of protection for Australia should Soviet penetrations of the South Pacific-Indian Ocean areas become a more direct threat to Australia's own interests in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also accepts that the Australian defence forces obtain a wide range of practical benefits from bilateral and multilateral co-operation within the framework of ANZUS. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in Chapter 3, the Committee looks at the question of whether Australia 's security relationship imposes constraints on Australia's own diplomacy, especially in relation to issues in our own region. </PARA>
<PARA> The report points to a lack of substantial evidence that Australia's foreign policy in the region might be adversely affected by our membership of ANZUS. The report also points to areas where Australia has openly expressed disagreement with the United States' policies on significant issues, such as the Law of the Sea negotiations. It notes that Australian policies towards the region differ from those of the present United States Administration on certain issues on which Australia has attempted to exert diplomatic influence on the United States , for example, over the issue of arms sales to Taiwan. Again, in August this year, the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, publicly criticised United States policies towards Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> As a neighbouring power of modest size with an attractive decolonisation record and anti-nuclear testing credentials, Australia is able to bring influence into Papua New Guinea and the rest of the South Pacific in ways quite unavailable to the United States, including through the South Pacific Forum, of which the United States is not a member. </PARA>
<PARA> After consideration of the available evidence, the Committee concludes that Australia's foreign policy is not constrained by its participation in ANZUS. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee points out that, in many ways, Australia's position differs markedly from that of its ally. The United States has global preoccupations, whereas Australia has its own role, including distinct regional responsibilities . As a member of the Western Alliance, Australia shares with the United States many foreign policy concerns. However, the Committee considers that Australia can, and should, act separately where our interests diverge. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also agrees with the view that Australia, as a middle power, can sometimes operate more effectively by itself, taking the lead regionally on behalf of the Alliance, for example, in the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> As stated in the introduction to the report, the basic asymmetry of the Australian-United States' relationship is an inescapable reality, and Australia should not, therefore, over-estimate its ability to influence its ally. We do not dominate their thinking and we must bear this in mind in assessing the relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite this basic asymmetry and the difficulties that have arisen from time to time, and despite the fact that the United States sometimes overlooks or ignores Australia's position, the Committee believes that the Australia-United States' relationship is, and can continue to be, mutually advantageous. </PARA>
<PARA> As discussed in Chapter 2 of the report, the United States expects Australia to pay a significant and, indeed, an increasing part in the defences of the Pacific and Indian Ocean areas. The Committee considers that in this situation our superpower ally needs more than ever to behave circumspectly and with sensitivity in all aspects of its relations with Australia. This means that the United States should take seriously Australia's views on matters of mutual concern where we may have a separate national perspective. In this regard, the Committee endorses the assessment of the Department of Foreign Affairs that the United States does adopt this position. </PARA>
<PARA> In Chapter 4, the Committee evaluates what is perhaps the most significant concern in relation to ANZUS-the future of the Alliance. </PARA>
<PARA> The complexities of the relationship between the two powers are reiterated and summarised. The Committee rejects the extreme position of withdrawal from ANZUS, as withdrawal would not only have immediate and widespread implications for Australia's own security, but any significant decrease in the US presence in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans resulting from it could seriously affect the stability of the whole region. </PARA>
<PARA> No security agreement can provide for every eventuality or satisfy every need, but ANZUS does provide an instrumentality that can be effective in responding to crisis situations, and its mere existence may keep some adverse circumstances from developing. </PARA>
<PARA> The option of redrafting sections of the Treaty was also discussed and rejected on the grounds that Australia would be unlikely to secure from the United States a more specific commitment to safeguard our security than that which already exists in the Treaty. Even if, as a hypothesis, the United States Administration were to offer Australia a guarantee of assistance in all circumstances affecting our security, an important consideration is whether any Australian government would give a similar guarantee to the United States.</PARA>
<PARA> In the Committee's view, ANZUS has assumed new importance because of the recent shift in the geo-political sphere of contest to the Indian Ocean-Persian Gulf area. The continued security of the sea lanes of communication between the Pacific and Indian Oceans are of vital importance not only to Australia's security, but to the whole economic functioning of the Western world. The report points out, therefore, that the stability of Australia's own strategic environment is linked in no small measure to the effective involvement of the United States' interest and policies throughout the region. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that differences between the United States and Australia will continue to exist, but that the management of these differences is likely to be conducted in an atmosphere which favours accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's conclusion is, therefore, that the ANZUS Alliance remains both useful and necessary, and that Australia should remain within its framework. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the report emphasises that the security links between Australia and the United States spring from shared values, compatible institutions and objectives and continuing popular support within the Australian community for ANZUS and the wider Western Alliance. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement that I have incorporated is the formal tabling statement of the Committee. May I briefly expand upon several points for the information of the Senate. I do so because I find myself in the unusual position of tabling this report this morning as the Deputy Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and as someone who has signed a minority report. Further, I am not a member of Sub-committee A. The remarks that I intend to make now are therefore a summary of the Sub-committee's report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 8 September 1981 the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence passed a resolution referring to its Sub-committee A-the Sub-committee on the Pacific Basin-the following term of reference: 'Australian-United States Relations'. The Sub-committee, which is chaired by Mr Stephen Lusher, M.P., has conducted a wide -ranging inquiry into all major aspects of Australian-United States relations, including foreign policy, security and defence matters, as well as economic and cultural relations. I wish to thank those individuals and government departments who spent time and effort in preparing written submissions and who gave oral evidence before the Sub-committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The focus of the report is Australia's long-standing security relationship with the United States of America as embodied in the ANZUS treaty. The Sub-committee will continue its examination of other aspects of the reference and these will be discussed in future reports. ANZUS underpins the Australian-United States relationship which during the last 30 years has become increasingly most important external relationship. Chapter 1 of the report traces the history of the ANZUS pact and examines its terms. In chapter 2 the significance of ANZUS in the light of past events, including the Malaysian-Indonesian confrontation in the early 1960s, is discussed as also are current Australian and American perceptions of ANZUS and its role, including the extent to which realistically Australia could expect assistance under the terms of the treaty should this country ever face a serious threat to its security. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers that the mutual security provisions of the ANZUS treaty represent a stronger assurance of military assistance in the event of an attack on Australian territory than a commitment merely to consult. At the same time, the Committee emphasises that official United States statements of its defence thinking in relation to the Asian-Pacific region, as well as United States expectations of Australia's role within the framework of ANZUS, indicate that the United States view of its role in the region precludes direct military involvement, except in an extreme situation. The Committee believes the official Australian view of ANZUS acknowledges this. In Chapter 3 of the report the Committee discusses the benefits and costs of ANZUS. The Committee concludes that the Australian-United States relationship is, and can continue to be, mutually advantageous. It also points out that the United States should take seriously Australia's views on matters of mutual concern where we may have a separate national perspective. In this regard the Committee endorses the assessment of the Department of Foreign Affairs that the United States does adopt this position. </PARA>
<PARA> In Chapter 4 the Committee evaluates what is perhaps the most significant concern in relation to ANZUS-that is, the future of the alliance. The report points out that the stability of Australia's own strategic environment is linked in no small measure to the effective involvement of United States interest and policies throughout the region. The Committee believes that differences between the United States and Australia will continue to exist, but that the management of these differences is likely to be conducted in an atmosphere which favours accommodation. The Committee's conclusion is, therefore, that the ANZUS alliance remains both useful and necessary and that Australia should remain within its framework. Finally, the report emphasises that the security links between Australia and the United States spring from shared values, compatible institutions and objectives and continuing popular support within the Australian community for ANZUS and the wider Western alliance. </PARA>
<PARA> There are features of this report which I and other members of the Committee who signed two minority reports find unsatisfactory. Both of the minority reports relate to matters canvassed in chapter 3 regarding the benefits and costs of ANZUS. These matters are covered on pages 95 to 99 of the report. The first relates to the question as to whether the joint installations in Australia involve an unacceptable loss of Australian sovereignty. In general, we would agree that the installations do not involve an unacceptable loss of Australian sovereignty in their operations. Nevertheless, the Committee has cited a number of instances in the past when Australian governments have been unpleasantly surprised as a result of their ignorance of operations and developments involving the installations. In particular, we are concerned that the operations at North West Cape do involve an unacceptable loss of sovereignty for Australia. Currently it is impossible for the Australian Government to determine when the installations are being used to relay messages that are related to military actions. This holds the possibility of Australian involvement in conflict without our consent. We believe it is possible to extend the agreement on consultation achieved by the former Minister for Defence, Lance Barnard, and the then United States Defence Secretary, Schlesinger, in 1974 related to operations of installations to overcome this problem. It is our belief that the Government should initiate efforts to ensure that this happens. </PARA>
<PARA> The second dissent relates to the question of whether Australian policy has been constrained by our participation in ANZUS. We hold the view that whilst Australian foreign policy need not be unacceptably constrained by ANZUS as it has been in the past and may be in the future, these constraints have not arisen as a result of United States policy. I make that point clear. The United States Administration has invariably been prepared to countenance a higher degree of independent Australian initiative than Australian governments have displayed. The constraints have been self-imposed and have been a result of false assessments of what was important to maintain the ANZUS alliance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has cited two examples, one arising from Australian participation in the war in Vietnam. In that instance, Australian governments argued that the commitment of forces to the conflict was necessary as advance payment on the United States alliance. Few other allies of the United States arrived at the same conclusion. Most assessed the war as a dangerous and debilitating distraction for the United States. So strait-jacketed were Australian governments by the fear that less than 100 per cent undeviating support would jeopardise our security that they were even unable to use Australian participation to give us a say in the process by which the war was resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> The failure to analyse the Vietnam war for its impact on Australian-American relations is a glaring omission from this report, made even more obvious by a lengthy and excellent analysis of a lesser problem for the alliance, that being the diplomacy surrounding the Malaysian-Indonesian confrontation. The same sort of self-imposed constraints have caused excessive secrecy about the purposes of the joint installations in Australia. We still rely for most of our information on American sources of a semi-official nature gleaned by Australian academics. Unless these tendencies in Australian foreign policy making are acknowledged and dealt with, Australian governments may find themselves unnecessarily constrained in the future. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This report of the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations on the Australian Loan Council is another demonstration of the intensity with which the Loan Council is presently being scrutinised. It is probably fair to say that the Loan Council is being more closely scrutinised now that at any previous time since its establishment in 1927. Apart from this major report with which we are dealing today we have had, of course, the paper of Professor Russell Mathews presented back in January 1982 to the Australian Institute of Political Science summer school in which he urged that the role of the Council be broadened into what he described as a federal fiscal council, which contribution sparked off a very considerable national debate. We also have a situation where quite intensive internal scrutiny is going on, insofar as the Loan Council is concerned, by all the participating governments. This follows the decline which has been perceived by a number of commentators and indeed is objectively the case so far as the role of the Loan Council is concerned. One way of making clear that decline is the following statistic that, whereas in 1953-54 some 80 per cent of State, local government and authority capital funds were raised by the Loan Council, by the latter half of the 1970s this proportion had fallen to less than 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACIR report gives a number of other figures of a comparable kind which demonstrate the extent of the decline. The report states, for example, that the Loan Council's borrowing program in the mid-1960s amounted to approximately one- half of gross fixed capital expenditure by the public sector but this dropped to just over one-third by 1980-81. It stated further that in 1980-81 more than 90 per cent of Commonwealth payments to the States were interest free, non- repayable grants compared with only 60 per cent in the mid-1960s while over the same period the ratio between Loan Council approved borrowings and gross domestic product fell by one-third. In addition, there is the evidence of the June Loan Council this year when electricity authority domestic borrowings were removed from Loan Council control-another demonstration of the declining influence and role of the Loan Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACIR report is a serious-minded attempt to come to grips with the issues posed by this state of affairs. It endeavours to identify a role for the Loan Council to enable it to contribute more usefully to the labyrinth of Federal- State financial relations. At the very least it is a highly informative document pulling together a mass of material on the history, the mode of operation and the economic significance of the Loan Council and identifying options at the same time for changes to the present system. I make it clear that I do not agree with everything in this report. As a member of the Council at the time the report was being compiled I dissented from some of its recommendations. But certainly I and members of the Australian Labor Party welcome its appearance and we believe that the Parliament should do so too. </PARA>
<PARA> I think those responsible for its production, especially the ACIR research director, Mr John Jameson, ought to be congratulated for the huge amount of effort and thought that has gone into it. The kinds of questions one needs to ask in analysing or contemplating the role of the Loan Council can, I guess, be summarised roughly as follows: Should the jurisdiction of the Loan Council be varied to give it a greater or a lesser role with respect to borrowing and capital funding? Should the Loan Council have expanded powers of investment appraisal and allocation decisions? Should the Loan Council have a role in the area of macroeconomic policy formulation or at least macroeconomic advice; that is, with respect to overall economic management? Then again, what are the implications for the structure, the organisation, the voting powers and the mode of operation of the Loan Council if any one of these sorts of changes are made?</PARA>
<PARA> At first sight it would appear to be the case that two broad approaches, two differing approaches, could be taken to the future of the Loan Council. One could take the view that the Council should go on doing what it is doing now, but doing it better. For example, with more precise criteria for infrastructure borrowing and with little, if any, changes in the structure, the voting arrangements, the voting powers and so on of the Council. Alternatively, one could take the view that the Loan Council ought to significantly change its character so as to become a key central instrument in overall investment planning and co-ordination with significant changes arguably then following so far as structure voting arrangements, mode of operation and so on are concerned. The ACIR report falls somewhere between these two stools. It does not recommend any fundamental changes to the structure, the voting arrangements or the mode of operation of the Loan Council, but it does recommend a significant expansion of its functions with the establishment of a secretariat to reflect that expanded role and also a name change to match, with the Loan Council becoming the Federal Financial Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the ACIR's recommendation in this respect can perhaps be best summarised by referring to recommendation 21 in the report which appears at paragraph 363 and reading that in conjunction with paragraph 298 of the report which identifies the existing and proposed new functions of the Council. The existing functions of the Loan Council are describable as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to determine the volume of public sector borrowing;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to distribute public sector borrowing limits between States and between types of authority;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) to determine the terms and conditions of loans;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) to determine priorities for different types of loans (e.g. infrastructure program);</PARA>
<PARA> (e) to develop orderly marketing systems for government securities;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) to co-ordinate the approach of governments to overseas capital markets;</PARA>
<PARA>Not all of those functions have been performed with an equal degree of vigour in recent years, but that is basically what the Charter of the Council in the past has provided that it should do. It is now proposed by the ACIR that those functions should be added to with the following additional functions:</PARA>
<PARA> (g) to advise on development policy and allocate funds for special development and infrastructure projects;</PARA>
<PARA> (h) to examine and review from time to time the necessity for, and extent of, controls over public sector borrowing;</PARA>
<PARA> (i) to review the financial terms and conditions for specific purpose grants,</PARA>
<PARA> trends in financial transfers, the balance between different types of transfers and the implications for the Commonwealth and the States of changes in the patterns of transfers, and--</PARA>
<PARA>Finally and more controversially-</PARA>
<PARA> the effects of policies relating to such matters as tariffs, exchange rates, monetary aggregates, wages and taxation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I, and I suspect the Australian Labor Party on the preliminary consideration that we have given these matters, generally take the view that most of these additional functions ought to be supported with the major exception, however, of the last one I mentioned; that is, giving macroeconomic advice, and playing a consultative role in relation to those macroeconomic management matters in the areas of tariffs, exchange rates, monetary aggregates, wages and taxation. That is a position that is made clear in paragraph 361 of the report, that there were dissenting voices when it came to the question of giving these macroeconomic functions to the new proposed Federal Financial Council. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe, and I think I can state that the Labor Party believes, that while it is appropriate for the Loan Council to take account of macroeconomic considerations in its decision making it should have no specific consultative or advisory role in this area. That role is better played by what the Labor Party has been constantly proposing; that is, the establishment of a National Economic Planning Advisory Council which would have representatives not only from the Commonwealth and the States, but also from local government and from trade unions, business and consumer interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The general approach of the Labor Party, then, is to take the view that the Loan Council should be retained in basically its present form but to acknowledge that there needs to be a major review of the causes and consequences of the declining scope of its influence, a review that obviously will be much assisted by the presentation of this report. It would be our view that there needs to be an increase in the effectiveness of its co-ordination of major public works and, in particular, a more effective role for it in relation to investment appraisal and allocation decisions. Even if it has no specific advisory role in relation to macroeconomic matters, we certainly believe the Loan Council should work in close co-operation with other bodies, particularly this proposed economic planning advisory council, with responsibilities in that area. We welcome the appearance of this report and hope that an early opportunity will present itself for a fuller parliamentary consideration of it. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's proposal to sell the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation to the private sector was made back in 1979 and it was reaffirmed as part of the recommendations of the Review of Commonwealth Functions. This annual report refers to a number of the factors operating in the insurance industry as it relates to this publicly owned insurance corporation which has to be regarded as one of the real success stories of public enterprise. The organisation was established during the Menzies period. I am sure that Sir Robert Menzies would turn over in his grave if he knew that the proposal of this Government-this very tory Government-is to sell off such an important public instrumentality which was established by a Liberal government for the purposes of protecting home owners and providing a service-and a competitive service indeed-as each year's report shows. Therefore, it is another example of the ideological position taken by the Government as it attempts to sell off to the lowest bidder all the public enterprises which conservative governments as well as Labor governments have set up. In the post-war years this country has been ruled by conservative administrations, and numerous public instrumentalities have been developed in that period. It is a matter of grave regret that this Government is hocking them off to the lowest bidder. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government announced its intention of selling HLIC to the private sector in July 1979. In April 1981, the Government reaffirmed that decision following its Review of Commonwealth Functions. In June 1981, registrations of interest in the purchase of HLIC were invited through the press. Expressions of interest were evaluated in 1981-82 and the drafting of an invitation to bid completed. Formal offers from selected registrants were sought in July 1982. At the date of this Report, offers were under consideration by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>Not only the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation but also the Belconnen Mall and a number of other important public endeavours, instrumentalities and corporations are under threat of sale. It seems to me that a time of economic downturn is the wrong time to sell off public enterprises. Clearly, we are not in a period in which we can realise the potential of those enterprises. The Government is not proceeding with the tenders that have been received because it is finding that it is not able to realise the potential, even according to its own philosophical position. As a result of that decision, this organisation has been under a cloud for three years or more. It is somewhat symptomatic that the organisation suffers as a result of government policy. So, with the future of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation remaining unclear, and in the general downturn which can be attributed to the direct financial policies being pursued by this Government, it is a matter of considerable concern and regret that this organisation faces the Government's propositions with some degree of wonder and concern as to its future. This is just another example of the complete failure of the Review of Commonwealth Functions which, in the presentation of its argument a couple of years ago, promised that the sale of government instrumentalities would result in savings to the general public and revenue to the Commonwealth of some $600m. Nowhere near that amount of money has been realised. Whilst the Government took the ideological decision, it has found that it is not able to realise the objectives it set itself. So again we find ourselves in a game of ideological bluff with this Government, which is attempting to convince the Australian public that it will make a revenue gain whereas in fact, of course, it will have a major loss, even if it persists with the sale of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that the insurance of home loans is the main business of the Corporation. It is a very important safeguard that exists for those who use the facilities, largely those persons involved with the war service organisation that provides a great deal of assistance to serving servicemen and ex-servicemen . What the report shows, and this is another example of the failure of the Government's economic policies, is a reflection of the drastic downturn in the home building industry. The report points out that loans insured under full cover fell by 35 per cent in number and 31 per cent by amount in 1981-82. It draws attention to the fewer loans that were insured and then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Despite a general expectation that claims against mortgage insurers might have risen under the pressure of rising interest rates, HLIC's total claims for 1981- 82 were 11% lower than in 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA>That situation is not any reflection upon the organisation. It arises because of the general state of the home ownership market. The Corporation is further instructed to look at the drop in the home loans insured in recent years. Here we find that there has been a considerable fall-off in one year. In 1981 there were 55,495 insurers. In 1982 that figure dropped to 38,550, which, of course represents almost a 40 per cent drop. So that we might have some understanding of what is really happening in the home ownership area, particularly as it relates to this organisation, I seek leave-I have not had an opportunity to discuss it with the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume)-to incorporate in Hansard the table contained on page 4 of the document that we are considering . </PARA>

In 1976 the number increased to 56,059 and it continued to increase at a fairly high rate during the years 1980 and 1981. However, in 1982 the number of loans insured was only 38,550. As I have indicated, that decrease is a reflection not on the organisation's ability but on the state of the building industry throughout Australia. I think that the Corporation is to be commended for its efficiency, profitability and the service that it renders to those who use the services of the Corporation.

<PARA> 2. BAPS was established as Australia's part in a world wide network of stations designed to study the composition of the atmosphere and so, through observations over a long period of time, attempt to determine the consequences of human and other activities on the atmosphere. There have been technical and other difficulties and delays in the establishment phase of this activity and the initial reports of the work of the station having been slow in preparation. The Committee was concerned at this delay and at the possible effect of contracting out the day to day operations of the station. Accordingly it recommended that the annual report of the station be tabled in the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. It is, of course, intrinsic to the operation of the station that its results should be published and made known widely to the scientific community. There is no formal obligation for the station to produce an annual report since it is only one element of the whole departmental operation. Its activities are and will be reported in the annual report of the Department of Science and Technology which is now responsible for the station and that report tabled annually. Preparation and dissemination of the research and observational results will be an important part of the contract arrangement and the reports will continue to be issued at appropriate intervals. However, unlike departmental reports which generally relate to activities the BAPS report is in the nature of a scientific, technical report and is designed for a specialist audience. Accordingly whilst accepting the need to report the work of BAPS in a detailed and timely fashion the Government does not consider it appropriate to table it formally in the Parliament apart from that reference to it in the annual report.</PARA>

<TITLE>Australian Balloon Launching Station (ABLS)</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> 4. The ABLS was originally established at US expense to launch moderate sized balloons for monitoring radiation levels in the stratosphere. After the program terminated in 1974 the equipment was transferred to Australian responsibility on the understanding that the Department would continue to provide a service to local and overseas scientists. Attempts were made subsequently to interest a range of local and overseas users to develop a cost-effective facility. In the event the US National Science Foundation contributed one third of the cost and Australia met the balance.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. During the 1970's there was a trend to flying larger balloons, 1 000 000m3 in volume with payloads up to several tonnes: in addition most users wished to fly from Alice Springs rather than Mildura and some facilities had to be established there.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. The service was criticised by both local and overseas users and it appears that a substantial investment would be needed to bring the service to a satisfactory standard. This combined with the very few local users meant that the research programs were very expensive for Australia and at the same time were not rated of sufficiently high priority to justify the further substantial investment needed. There appeared also to be too small a total workload to maintain a first class launch team trained to the high degree of skill required. Accordingly the Government decided to close the station down but to permit overseas teams, e.g. from the USA to use the facilities at their expense if they so desired.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. The Committee believes it is important for Australia to maintain such a facility and has recommended that this take place. It was also recommended that the Government reactivate the idea of an international consortium to operate the facility, or attach a trained team to a suitable organisation in Australia whichever is the most cost-effective.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. The Department of Science and Technology has approached overseas countries to contribute to an international consortium so far without success. Nevertheless it would be prepared to consider any reasonable proposal. Discussions are still in progress with the appropriate agencies in the U.K. and the USA. However, the Department doubts that a sufficient workload can be developed to maintain an efficient launch team and considers that the most practical solution is for Australian scientists to take advantage of visiting overseas launch teams. Accordingly the Government does not intend to maintain the facility in view of the very small number of local users but is prepared to consider a consortium, which will not require the use of departmental manpower if a feasible proposal is submitted.</PARA>

<TITLE>Funding for CSIRO</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> 9. The final matter referred to the funding of CSIRO. The Committee believed that it was essential that an organisation such as CSIRO should critically examine its research policies and activities to ensure that they are relevant to Australia's needs but expressed its concern that the work of CSIRO may have been harmed by restraints on staff numbers and funds. The Committee was concerned that CSIRO was being forced by resource restrictions to reduce and abandon significant areas of research and recommended that its operating appropriation be initially increased at the rate of the increase in the Consumer Price Index. The Committee recommended that the Government should then investigate claims that the cost of conducting scientific research increased at a rate greater than the increase in the CPI and that, if substantiated, recommended that the CSIRO operating appropriation be increased by at least that rate.</PARA>
<PARA> 10. The Government recognises the important contribution CSIRO is making to Australia's scientific and technological development. However, the issues raised by the Committee need to be considered in the context of the Government's expenditure determination processes which recognise a wide variety of influences , including price indexes, which have to be balanced against the need to pursue particular economic objectives. In recent years expenditure restraint has been a fundamental aspect of the Government's budgetary approach and CSIRO has not been alone in being required to adjust its expenditure programs in line with the limited resources available.</PARA>
<PARA> 11. Acceptance of the Committee's recommendations would imply a preparedness, on the part of the Government, to place CSIRO in a privileged position compared to other Departments and Authorities. Acceptance would also establish precedent for the treatment of other programs which would seriously limit the Government's flexibility in determining outlays to meet particular Budgetary requirements. Despite the importance of science to Australia's development I would not believe it proper for the Government to take such an approach.</PARA>

<PARA>No.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>1.</PARA>
<PARA>Baseline Air Pollution Station (BAPS)</PARA>
<PARA>In view of the proposed contracting out of BAPS, the Committee believes it is important that the annual report be continued, and that it be produced with a minimum of delay. So that the Parliament can continue to monitor the operations of BAPS after contracting out the Committee RECOMMENDS that its annual report be tabled in Parliament. (Para 2.15)</PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted.</PARA>
<PARA>However, observational results will still be published and the Departmental Annual Report will include reference to the work of BAPS. The work of BAPS is only one of a great many programs whose results are published in the normal way but which are not tabled in the Parliament. The latter process is reserved for major reports, e.g. from Departments or Statutory Authorities.</PARA>
<PARA>Scientific Balloon Launching Facilities</PARA>
<PARA>2.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee believes it is important that Australia maintains a facility for the launching of scientific balloons including large balloons and RECOMMENDS that this take place. (Para 2.45)</PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted.</PARA>
<PARA>A facility such as ABLS is only required to launch medium and large balloons. Small balloons can and are launched by ad hoc teams. There are insufficient users for the medium and large balloons to maintain a viable launch crew and for Australia to bear that expense.</PARA>
<PARA>3.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Government should examine the options of reactivating the international consortium proposal or attaching a trained balloon launching team to a suitable organisation in Australia and implement that which is found to be the most cost effective. (Para 2.57)</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government will consider any proposition for a consortium.</PARA>
<PARA>CSIRO Operating Appropriation</PARA>
<PARA>4.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee is dissatisfied with the level of resources supplied to the CSIRO. The Committee RECOMMENDS that the CSIRO operating appropriation should initially be increased at the rate of the increase of the Consumer Price Index. The Government should then investigate the claims of the CSIRO that the costs of conducting scientific research increase at a rate of two to three per cent greater than the increase in the CPI. If in a wider study for the years beyond 1978-79, the CSIRO claims are substantiated the Committee RECOMMENDS that the CSIRO operating appropriation should be increased by at least that rate. (Para 3 .19)</PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted.</PARA>
<PARA>Expenditure restraint has been a fundamental aspect of the Government's budgetary processes in recent years and all Departments and agencies have been required to adjust their programs in line with the limited resources available. The proposal would put CSIRO in a privileged position compared with other agencies and limit the Government's flexibility in developing annual budgets.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to make a few comments about the statement. Earlier today I suggested that, when tabling a committee report, the Government's response to such a report should be provided to the Chairman of the committee at least a day before the tabling of the Government's response in the chamber. I said that for a very good reason. I received the Government's response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment about an hour ago and I have not had a chance to examine it in any great detail. I think that in future it would be most helpful to committee chairmen if such a procedure applied. It would enable us to respond far more effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> I note from the Government's response that only one of our recommendations has been accepted. It deals with the facilities for launching scientific balloons. We recommended that the Government examine options of reactivating the international consortium proposal for attaching a trained balloon launching team to a suitable organisation in Australia and implement that option which is found to be most cost effective. The Government has said that it will consider any proposition for a consortium, but I believe that we need a better response than that. The Government ought to examine the options and come forward with a more positive statement. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the rejection of our other propositions is concerned I can only say that one in particular is a modest request. I refer to the Committee's recommendation that research funds for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ought to be increased at least at the rate of increase of the consumer price index. The Government has rejected that recommendation, maintaining that it would put the CSIRO in a favourable position compared with other departments. I suggest that with respect to research work in Australia it is most important to recognise that we cannot afford Australia's research effort to lag behind. We are in a position to lead the world in many areas of research. This is important both from an international point of view and an Australian point of view. I stress that the Committee made what we believe to be a responsible recommendation that research funding should be increased at least to the level of the consumer price index. Further examination of the importance of research work being undertaken and the need for further funding should be considered as a matter of urgency in the near future. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek leave to make a ministerial statement relating to the Government response to the report on Australia's forestry and forest products industries and to have the statement incorporated in Hansard. The statement also comments on reports of the Industries Assistance Commission on wood and articles of wood and the Forest Products Industries Advisory Council on Australia's forest products industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I wish to report to the Senate on the Government's responses to the Senate Standing Comittee on Trade and Commerce (Senate Committee) report on Australia's Forestry and Forest Products Industries; the Industries Assistance Commission's (IAC) report on Wood and Articles of Wood; and the Forest Products Industries Advisory Council (FPIAC) report on Australia's Forests Products Industries. </PARA>
<PARA> In June 1978 the Senate referred to the Senate Committee, the matter of 'all aspects of Australia's forestry and forest products industries' for investigation and report. The Senate Committee held many public hearings, conducted extensive inspections and considered a large number of submissions. The final report is comprehensive and contains recommendations covering a wide range of issues. The report was tabled in November 1981 in this place by Senator Archer, the Chairman of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The FPIAC report discusses the influence of long-term factors on the development of the forest products industries and presents an industry view of the desirable course for future developments. The report examines each sector in detail and makes a number of recommendations, some of which are directed to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The IAC report covers the major forest products industries with the exception of pulp, paper and furniture. Part of the reference to the IAC called for a report within 60 days on assistance to certain wooden louvred goods. That report was received by the Government and in December 1980 it announced that it had accepted the IAC's recommendation that no short-term assistance be afforded the local production of louvred goods. The IAC's final report was received by the Government in August 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> In October 1981 the Government announced that a decision on the IAC report was to be deferred so that it could be considered along with the Senate Committee report and the FPIAC report. The deferment would allow long-term policies for the industries to be formulated after full consideration of the proposals and recommendations of each of the three reports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has now examined all three reports and I would like to mention briefly some of the major issues which are explained in more detail in the Government's responses. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Senate Committee's recommendations deal principally with forestry and the forest resource for which State governments have the prime responsibility. However, there are some topics covered by the report which involve Commonwealth responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> These include recommendations on public financial assistance to private industrial forestry, taxation treatment of forestry, assistance to the local production of wood and articles of wood, trans-Tasman trade in forest products, Commonwealth departmental responsibilities for forestry and forest products and Commonwealth training in wood technology. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Committee and the FPIAC in their respective reports have brought into sharp focus the special characteristics of the forestry and forest products industries which have important implications for the Commonwealth Government in its development and administration of policies for forest product industries and for the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Both reports point to the necessity of careful forest planning to ensure that timber availability neither markedly exceeds nor falls below the market demand at any given time, which they consider would result in a misallocation in the nation's resources or a lost opportunity for the nation's development. </PARA>
<PARA> To help achieve this purpose the Government has decided that the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Primary Industry should work with the States, private growers and the forest products industries to establish a framework which facilitates improved cooperation and coordination within the forestry and forest products industries. </PARA>
<PARA> As a starting point the two Ministers will consult with the States, private growers and the forest products industries on the establishment of a single representative body to advise the Commonwealth Government on forestry and forest industries matters. It is envisaged that this body would replace the advising and coordination activities of the two major existing bodies providing advice to the Government, namely the FPIAC and the Australian Forestry and Forest Industries Conference (AFFIC). The major charter of this new body would be to facilitate a coordinated national cooperative approach to forestry and the development of the forest products industries. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government believes it is important that individual authorities and companies take decisions on such matters as planting, and timber production and utilisation in the light of their own commercial assessments. The basis of this commercial decision making will be enhanced in a climate of improved cooperation and coordination. The longer term assistance arrangements decided by the Government following consideration of the IAC's report on Wood and Articles of Wood will provide an important part of the future operating framework for the forestry and forest products industries. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important for realistic forestry planning that all parties have access to regularly updated comprehensive information on wood supply, demand and price trends and forecasts, domestically and internationally. This need has been recognised at Commonwealth, State and industry levels and initiatives have been taken to develop progressively a much improved flow of such information. The input is being provided by the States, the Commonwealth and by industry. The Government will continue to support this cooperative work. The new body, which the Government proposes, will have an important part to play. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the forest products industries it is not only imperative that the raw material supply be adequate and competitive, but also that the end-use industries strive for improved efficiency and competitiveness, compared with other countries, to ensure that Australia's forest resources are utilised to their optimum. It was in this context that the Government examined the form and level of assistance to apply to the goods covered by the IAC's report on Wood and Articles of Wood. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Government has considered the IAC's recommendations together with more recent information provided by interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has taken its decisions on the IAC's recommendations and these will be announced shortly when the Administrative arrangements to implement them have been completed. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the FPIAC has indicated it is in broad agreement with the conclusions and recommendations of the Senate report. However, there are some important differences. </PARA>
<PARA> The FPIAC does not agree with the Senate Committee's view that the rate of softwood plantation establishment should be sharply reduced. The FPIAC believes the Senate Committee overestimated the future supply of saw logs from Australian forests and under estimated demand, particularly export potential. </PARA>
<PARA> The FPIAC was also concerned that the Senate Committee did not lend other than qualified support to the need for the establishment of a national forestry policy. Another important area of disagreement was with the Senate Committee's recommendation concerning the responsibilities of the Departments of Industry and Commerce and Primary Industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, issues relating to the Administrative Arrangements Orders raised by the Senate Committee are under consideration by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, in conclusion I would like to say that the Government recognises the importance of the forestry and forest products industries and has welcomed the opportunity to respond to these reports. The responses which the Government has made and the decisions which are to be implemented have all been given careful consideration. I am satisfied that these decisions are the best possible , given that a balance needs to be reached within the framework of existing Government policies, between the interests of forestry and the forest products industries, the users of the products and the community. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are a number of areas covered by the recommendations, particularly those of the Senate Committee, where the Commonwealth Government has no direct jurisdiction. The Government has therefore suggested that the State Forestry authorities and the Australian Forestry Council give these particular recommendations their careful attention and consider the Government's comments. </PARA>
<PARA> Details of the Government's responses to the Senate Committee report are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON TRADE AND COMMERCE ON AUSTRALIA'S FORESTRY AND FOREST PRODUCTS INDUSTRIES</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>1. Recommendations primarily involving Commonwealth responsibilities</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Government administrative and consultative arrangements</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Commonwealth departmental responsibilities Recommendation 14 (Para 96)</PARA>
<PARA> The functions presently performed by the Department of Industry and Commerce in respect of the forest products industries be transferred to the Forestry Branch of the Department of Primary Industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Issues relating to the Administrative Arrangements Orders raised by the Committee are under consideration by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 15 (Para 96)</PARA>
<PARA> Consequent upon acceptance of the previous recommendation, the staff and facilities of the Forestry Branch of the Department of Primary Industry be expanded commensurate with its increased responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Advisory and consultative bodies Recommendation 16 (Para 97)</PARA>
<PARA> Industries and interest groups take the initiative in reducing the number of advisory bodies at the federal level. </PARA>
<PARA>Following the re-organisation of sub-committees of the Standing Committee of the Australian Forestry Council (AFC) which resulted in the formation of the Australian Forestry and Forest Industries Conference (AFFIC), there are now only two bodies besides the AFC itself tendering policy advice to the Commonwealth relating to forestry and forest products industries i.e. the Forests Products Industries Advisory Council and AFFIC. The FPIAC provides its advice on the forest products industries to the Minister for Industry and Commerce while AFFIC reports to the Minister for Primary Industry and State Ministers responsible for forestry, through the AFC. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has decided that the two Ministers should consult with the States , private growers and the forest products industries on the establishment of a single representative body to advise the Commonwealth Government on forestry and forest industries matters. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Statistics Recommendation 20 (Para 106)</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Forestry Council investigates the compilation and dissemination of statistical information in respect of the forestry and forest products industries, having particular regard to</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the information requirements of government agencies and private industry;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the appropriate agencies responsible for the collection and publication of such information. </PARA>
<PARA>Information requirements can be viewed as falling in two separate but related categories. The first comprises the statistical information needed by industry and government agencies for making decisions on current and short-term issues. Current adequate and reliable statistics are needed for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>The second category comprises the supply/demand forecasts and trends analysis required for longer term planning. The studies required to develop that kind of information also depend heavily on the availability of adequate and reliable industry and trade statistics covering lengthy periods of time. </PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth and State Departments and industry are currently reviewing their requirements for statistics on forestry and forest products with a view to ensuring that the information needs of Governments and industry are met. </PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Training Recommendation 21 (Para 109)</PARA>
<PARA> The National Timber Industry Training Committee, in concert with the Timber Industry Training Committees and Technical and Further Education authorities in each State, reviews the adequacy of courses offered in wood technology with a view to establishing, in suitably located technical colleges in all States, a course which has a common syllabus, is appropriate to the industries' needs and is recognised by the Institute of Wood Science. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 22 (Para 109)</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Forestry Council reviews the facilities available for the training of forest technicians throughout Australia with a view to encouraging the establishment of suitable training facilities in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA>Establishment and development of formal course content and common core curricula are primarily matters for Technical and Further Education (TAFE) Authorities. Changes within the industry and development of its training needs require that course content and facilities made available to this industry are constantly monitored. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1982 the Government made available $100,000 under the particular purpose recurrent grants program of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission's Technical and Further Education Council to foster co-operation between two or more States in activities such as curriculum development and making Technical and Further Education programs more accessible and relevant. </PARA>
<PARA>The National Training Council has considered a submission from the National Timber Industry Training Council and will be seeking approval for a training development grant to facilitate industry-TAFE liaison for development of common core curricula in wood technology. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Government funding of forestry Recommendation 1 (Para 20)</PARA>
<PARA> In any future agreements between the Commonwealth and the States for the funding of forest development, preferential consideration be given to the public financial assistance of private industrial forestry. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsequent to the Review of Commonwealth Functions the Government decided to discontinue Commonwealth expenditure on forestry upon termination of the programs authorised by the Softwood Forestry Agreements Act and the Tasmanian Native Forestry Agreement Acts in 1981-82 and 1982-83 respectively. </PARA>
<PARA>Should further consideration be given in the future to Commonwealth participation in the public funding of forestry development, proposals for assistance to the private sector would be evaluated in the light of government policies and circumstances at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Government assistance to the forest products industries</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Tariff assistance Recommendation 17 (Para 99)</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the present difficult economic conditions facing the mouldings and wood based panel products industries, and recognising that structural adjustment is presently taking place in the industries, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs defers for a period of 5 years any reductions in tariffs applying to mouldings, particleboard, hardboard and plywood. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government deferred the decision on the Industries Assistance Commission ( IAC) report on Wood and Articles of Wood to enable it to be considered with the recommendations of the Senate Committee and the FPIAC reports. </PARA>
<PARA>Details of the Customs tariff changes and other related changes arising from the Government's decisions will be announced shortly when the administrative arrangements to implement them have been completed. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Import competition from New Zealand Recommendation 18 (Para 100)</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Trade and Resources</PARA>
<PARA> (a) investigates the extent of the New Zealand Government's financial support of that country's exports of forest products to Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) determines if such support is consistent with the terms of the New Zealand/ Australia Free Trade Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is fully aware of the Australian forest products industries' concern at the current trading relationship between Australia and New Zealand in respect of forest products including New Zealand's use of performance based export incentives and its import licensing system. </PARA>
<PARA>On 10 November 1982 the Government announced that it had approved new arrangements to govern trans-Tasman trade between Australia and New Zealand which will enter into force on 1 January 1983. These arrangements, inter alia, make provision for completely eliminating New Zealand's import licensing by 1995 at the latest and halving performance based export incentives for trans-Tasman trade in 1985, with further reductions of 25% in 1986 and 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, an industry which feels it is being injured by dumped or subsidised imports has recourse to the procedures, including anti-dumping and countervailing action, available under Australia's anti-dumping legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The New Zealand Government's support of that country's exports of forest products is not inconsistent with the New Zealand/Australia Free Trade Agreement as the use of export incentives is not specifically prohibited. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Taxation Recommendation 19 (Para 103)</PARA>
<PARA> Within six months of the tabling of this report the Treasurer initiates an examination of all aspects of taxation as they apply to the forestry and forest products industries, having particular regard for</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the long-term nature of production forestry;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) taxation disincentives to the management of private forests for wood production in perpetuity;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the allowable deduction of forest expenditure from assessable income for taxation purposes; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) sales tax on equipment used in forest operations. </PARA>
<PARA>Examination of the taxation treatment of the forestry industry could only be meaningful if done in the context of the taxation treatment afforded other industries. In this regard, certain taxation provisions for industry generally were only recently reviewed by the Government following receipt of a report by the Industries Assistance Commission on Certain Budgetary Assistance to Industry . </PARA>
<PARA>The BAE is currently examining a number of taxation matters applicable to this industry. Upon completion of the study the Government will consider the need for further action. The Government has also received a submission on the matter from Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA>2. Recommendations primarily involving State Government responsibilities</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Self-sufficiency Recommendation 2 (Para 30)</PARA>
<PARA> The rate of new softwood plantation establishment, both plantings and replantings be reduced to the extent that the average annual rate for the years 1976-1990 does not exceed 20,700 hectares, as recommended by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 3 (Para 30)</PARA>
<PARA> Decision about future Commonwealth funding of softwood forestry be consequent upon further reports by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics on the desirable rate of plantation establishment. </PARA>
<PARA>The goal of achieving net self-sufficiency by the end of the century achieved wide support during the 1960's under circumstances very different to those which prevail today. Now, there is in the forest and forest products sectors considerable questioning of and outright opposition to a goal of net self- sufficiency; views are being expressed that Australia's export potential in forest products should not be underrated. </PARA>
<PARA>AFC has rejected the goal of net self-sufficiency as being irrelevant to the practical commercial planning of production levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 4 (Para 33)</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Forestry Council conduct a thorough review of the management of Australia's efforts to achieve net self-sufficiency in wood production, having particular regard for:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the co-ordination of softwood plantation development with the installation of adequate processing capacity;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the future role of the private sector in both softwood plantation development and softwood processing. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government supports the view that decisions on forest planting, wood production and utilisation are best undertaken by individual authorities and firms in the light of their own commercial assessments. </PARA>
<PARA>Individual decision makers do need, however, to base their decisions on the best available information on current and future supply and demand. To that end, work is progressing within State and Commonwealth Departments and elsewhere on improving demand forecasting procedures and towards publishing consolidated State wood production plans and demand forecasts based on common methodology. The Government considers that availability of such information will assist that State and private forestry interests in determining planting rates appropriate to their individual commercial circumstances and will facilitate the co- ordination of Australia's wood production with the output of forest products. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will continue to work through the proposed new body which has already been mentioned with the forestry and forest products industries and the States to facilitate such a co-operative approach aimed at ensuring that planning and development decisions are consistent with sound economic principles and the efficient allocation of resources in the overall national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Forest service accounting and royalties Recommendation 5 (Para 45)</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Forestry Council examines and makes recommendations to the State governments in respect of</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the most appropriate accounting procedures to be adopted by the forest services;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the classification and treatment in the forest service accounts of all aspects of income and expenditure, having particular regard for the separation of the costs of forest management for commercial wood production from those of other forest service functions. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government supports the aims of the recommendations but points out that these are matters for determination by the individual States. The Government commends the recommendations and the principles underlying them to the States.</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 6 (Para 47)</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Forestry Council strongly urges the forest service in each State to adopt as its method of royalty determination that recommended by the Finance Panel of the Forestry and Wood-based Industries Development Conference. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 7 (Para 49)</PARA>
<PARA> The royalties applying to rare and valuable tree species, such as Huon pine, red cedar and their equivalents, be increased to reflect their true cost of production and rarity on a national basis as compared with the more numerous and productive eucalypt species. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 11 (Para 58)</PARA>
<PARA> The margin between royalties applying to rainforest species and those to other species be increased to ensure that rainforest timbers are used sparingly and only for purposes where other timbers and other materials are not suitable substitutes. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Forest management planning Recommendation 8 (Para 54)</PARA>
<PARA> Each State forest service publish at regular intervals, a forest management plan. The plan should:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) be formulated with the benefit of full public comment on its intentions;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) describe the detailed management regime to be adopted for each and every area of forest under the service's control;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) be explicit in its requirements so that those responsible for its implementation are in no doubt as to their responsibilities;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) be binding for a specified period. </PARA>
<PARA>Although State forest authorities generally make available to the public, statements of management policies and information on State forests, publication of 'forest management plans' would provide both the forest products industries and the general public with access to a wider range of forest planning and management information and practices than is presently the case. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government supports the concept of providing information to the public on forest management. It notes that this would be consistent with the principles underlying its environmental assessment policy and would allow more informed debate on environmental and resource use issues. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Rainforests Recommendation 9 (Para 57)</PARA>
<PARA> All areas of rainforest in Australia be conserved, maintaining the characteristic diversity and vitality of the original forests. </PARA>
<PARA>Conserving Australia's rainforests has national implications, reflected in the Commonwealth's decision to develop a National Conservation Strategy for Australia jointly with the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 10 (Para 57)</PARA>
<PARA> Where publicly-owned rainforests are managed for timber production, management prescriptions must include as a minimum standard</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the attainment of sustained yield as a high priority;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) selective logging;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) canopy retention provisions appropriate to the rainforest type;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) marking by forest service staff of each tree to be removed;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) tree marking to ensure the maintenance of the species mix of the forest in its original proportions. </PARA>
<PARA>These matters are the direct responsibility of State Governments. However, the Government generally supports these two recommendations in so far as they are consistent with the principle of sustained utilisation of natural resources which underlies the proposed National Conservation Strategy for Australia. The recommendations also give recognition to the highly significant environmental values of rainforests. </PARA>
<PARA> (e) Harvesting Recommendation 12 (Para 60)</PARA>
<PARA> Forest management specifications containing environmental protection prescriptions should be regarded as a mandatory minimum requirement to be augmented where required at the discretion of the forestry officer on the spot; and without real incentive or control, forest management practices for environmental protection will operate at a minimum standard. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 13 (Para 81)</PARA>
<PARA> The State forest services maintain strict control of removals from Crown land to ensure that logs destined for woodchip mills are indeed being directed to the highest value end-use. </PARA>
<PARA>While the management and control of public forests is the direct responsibility of the states, the Commonwealth has powers in respect of export woodchips. </PARA>
<PARA>Consequently, there is a direct Commonweaalth responsibility for environmental assessment where forest operations within the states are associated with the export of woodchips. There is close consultation between the Commonwealth and individual states concerned on environmental protection and resource aspects of such operations. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government supports the continuation of the existing co-operative arrangements to ensure the observance of conditions in Commonwealth export approvals relating to environmental safeguards and the source and nature of the pulpwood to be exported. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>I have had an opportunity to have only a very brief look at this statement but I believe that the response is less than we had hoped for and is, in some respects , less than adequate. The main thrust of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce on Australia's forestry and forest products industries was aimed at better planning and better development of the industry for the future. The fundamental area that that involves is the necessity for timber supply and the use to which it will be put. The question of net self- sufficiency-that is, what we produce, plus what we buy, less what we export-is, of course, paramount. I was somewhat surprised to find that on page 5 of the statement it is said that the question of self-sufficiency is irrelevant. I do not see how the fundamental point of the production of a product of this nature and the planning of what we will use and what we will save can be treated as irrelevant to the whole industry. While we have that thinking behind the industry generally it will be very hard to plan for the economics in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> The production of timber and the planting of trees has been under considerable discussion for many years. It comes back to a choice of planting native timbers or exotic timbers-mainly radiata pine. The amount of planting has been questioned for a long time. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics has undertaken intensive studies. Conference a few years ago made an intensive study of this aspect. When the Committee recommended that plantings should be adjusted to the demand, we again received the reply that our figures did not mean anything and that they were not accepted. But while we have been told that the figures were not accepted, we were not told what figures may be accepted. I believe that we are entitled to be told where our figures are wrong. The Committee put in two years' work on this report. I believe that the information that we used was the best information available. We have certainly not been given any information to the contrary. In fact the statement that we have just been given states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Senate Committee overestimated the future supply of saw logs from Australian forests and underestimated demand, particularly export potential. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe we are entitled to be told why that is believed to be the case. We only have to look at the present situation to see that we have difficulty in competing with imported timbers, let alone exports to other countries. I believe other countries will have a marked influence on the trading of timber world-wide . I do not think Australia is going to be one of those countries for many years. The exotic timbers have to be used because of their rate of growth. They are not like the eucalypt which can wait 100 years in a situation of oversupply. I believe that if we are to expect the local industry to make a meaningful input into the planning and management of forestry, it has to be provided with the best information available. This has to be hard information and not just general assertions such as those we have been given. </PARA>
<PARA> The report says that there is going to be a better flow of information and I am very pleased about that. I am just wondering when this flow of information will start. I have been waiting for 12 months for information on the matters that we have been discussing. If I were involved in the forestry business I would need my information within 12 months. I really do not see how forestry organisations, be they large companies or private foresters, can make judgments and how they can do the best possible job for the Australian industry without those figures. The only comment in the report on this matter is that the Government believes it is important that individual authorities and companies take decisions on such matters as planting and timber production and utilisation in the light of their own commercial assessments. But those commercial assessments must surely be influenced by the provision of the best information available to the industry and I do not see how reasonable judgments can be made without those facts. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not told from where the export potential about which the report talks will come. I believe, again, that to enable the long term planning of the industry, we need to have this information which will have an enormous effect on the price that will be paid to the producers of private timber. We have to know whether there will be a market before we go ahead and plant large areas of timber. We do not want to prop up the industry with subsidies. It should not be necessary to do this. All sorts of concessions should not have to be paid. However, a judgment has to be made as to how much timber is going to be supplied and what sort of price will be paid. I do not think that the response dealt adequately with the questions we raised in respect of training, private forestry funding and various taxation measures. I hope that we are able to get some better information in the near future. I seek leave to continue my remarks later . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Like Senator Archer, I too am concerned about the Government's response but unlike Senator Archer I have had very little time at all to look at that response. However, I would like to refer to that part of the response which deals with the import of timber from New Zealand. I have spoken in the Senate on quite a few occasions about this problem . In my quick reading of the Government's response in regard to import competition from New Zealand, I note that the Government says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is fully aware of the Australian forest products industries' concern at the current trading relationship between Australia and New Zealand in respect of forest products including New Zealand's use of performance based export incentives and its import licensing system. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> On 10 November 1982 the Government announced that it had approved new arrangements to govern trans-Tasman trade between Australia and New Zealand which will enter into force on 1 January 1983. These arrangements, inter alia, make provision for completely eliminating New Zealand's import licensing by 1995 at the latest and halving performance-based export incentives for trans-Tasman trade in 1985 with further reductions of 25 per cent in 1986 and 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, an industry which feels it is being injured by dumped or subsidised imports has recourse to the procedures, including anti-dumping and countervailing action available under Australia's anti-dumping legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The New Zealand Government's support of that country's export of forest products is not inconsistent with the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement as the use of export incentives is not specifically prohibited. </PARA>
<PARA>The Softwood Forestry Council spelt out in detail in a submission to the Bureau of Customs what it thought were the problems in respect of incentives being given to New Zealand timber companies. In brief they were: That New Zealand timber producers do not pay to the New Zealand Government anywhere near the amount of royalty which is paid by timber producers in Australia; New Zealand producers are given a very high level of export incentive to export their timber ; and on top of that, they are given very good freight concessions. If we add these three factors together we can see that New Zealand exporters have a distinct advantage over Australian timber producers. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about the problem-I speak about my own State although this is prevalent in other States-of the very great downturn in employment and production of timber products in the south-east of South Australia. The timber industry is the main source of income in this area. I would have thought that this Government would have taken some action in respect of this great problem and not just fallen back on NAFTA which was the subject of an inquiry by a committee of which I was a member when I first came to this place. However, the Government cannot fall back on this agreement when imports are coming into this country to the great detriment not only of timber producers and people employed in the industry but also of small business people who are going down the drain at a rapid rate. This Government should take immediate action. I join with Senator Archer in criticising the Government for its lack of action. When this matter is again debated in the Senate I will have some harsh words to say about this matter if the Government does not take some action very shortly to try to eliminate the problems that exist in the south-east of South Australia in the softwood industry. I note that Senator Martyr from Western Australia is grinning and laughing about this matter. However, this is a matter of serious concern. Senator Martyr, a Government senator, shows that he has no concern for the people in the south-east of South Australia who, if they are lucky, are now working a four-day week. Others, who do not have a job, are losing their homes. Small businesses are losing income. They, too, are putting off employees because of this Government's inaction to prevent the import of New Zealand timber. </PARA>

<PARA>That the Senate, further to its Resolutions of 23 September and 14 October 1982-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Directs the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), representing the Acting Attorney-General, and the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), representing the Treasurer, to deliver as soon as possible to the Hon. Sir John Minogue, Q.C., of 13 Millicent Avenue, Toorak, Victoria, formerly Justice (1962-70) and Chief Justice (1970-74) of the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea and Victorian Law Reform Commissioner (1977-82), copies of the papers relating to tax avoidance and evasion identified in sub-paragraphs (i)-(xiv) of the Resolution of 23 September 1982, subject only to the deletion from such papers of the names and identifying characteristics of persons to the extent necessary to satisfy the requirements of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Requests Sir John Minogue to edit such papers, after appropriate consultation with the Solicitor-General and the Crown Solicitor, so as to ensure the deletion therefrom of any material the publication of which would in his opinion prejudice the outcome of legal proceedings which have been, or may be, instituted against those alleged to have been involved in tax evasion or avoidance schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Directs Senators Chaney and Dame Margaret Guilfoyle to lay on the Table, as soon as possible, such papers in the form in which they have been edited by Sir John Minogue. </PARA>
<PARA>The effect of my motion, of course, is to direct the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) and the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) to deliver certain papers to Sir John Minogue, Q.C., to edit those papers for subsequent tabling by Senators Chaney and Dame Margaret Guilfoyle in the Senate. The papers in question relate to the Government's consideration of legal proceedings against people involved in bottom-of-the-harbour and similar tax avoidance and evasion schemes. This is an appropriate curtain raiser for the resumption of the debate on the bottom-of-the-harbour recoupment legislation because it does focus attention squarely on the background to that legislation and, in particular, on the issue as to whether that legislation would ever have been necessary if the Government had acted in accordance with the law and in accordance with proper practice in the mid 1970s to take legal proceedings against these people when these schemes first came to its notice. </PARA>
<PARA> The papers that are in issue and described in this motion are essentially those that were described at greater length and subjected to previous debate on 23 September and more specifically on 14 October. They may be described very briefly as falling into two broad categories. In the first place there are legal opinions from Queen's Counsel and other documents of that kind showing strong reasons for believing that legal action, both criminal and civil, was available against those promoting and participating in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. The second category of documents in the 14 sets of documents listed is a variety of documents, papers and other memoranda which will show equally clearly that the arguments against the availability of such legal action were feeble, insufficiently documented and insufficiently argued. That is our suspicion as to what those papers might contain, based on a description of some of them by Mr Costigan in his report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and based on the way in which they have also been described by the Treasurer, Mr Howard, in his successive statements on this general subject area. We cannot, of course, know precisely what is in them and just how devastating they are to the Government's case in this whole area until we see them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is because the Parliament has a proper role in scrutinising Executive behaviour and administration in these matters that we seek to see the papers to find out once and for all where the fault lay for this extraordinary scandal in Australian public administration which resulted in the loss of hundreds, possibly thousands, of millions of dollars. The papers in question were not included in the so-called telephone book which was tabled some weeks ago now for the obvious reason, it appears, that the Government is profoundly embarrassed by their content. There is no other reason why they should not be tabled and put into public domain, provided some appropriate sterilisation process occurs to ensure that there is nothing in the papers, in the form in which they are finally tabled and published, which could in fact prejudice the effective prosecution of proceedings against those involved. This, of course, is what this motion seeks to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Arguments for the procedure spelt out in this motion are essentially the same as those which were dealt with at some considerable length in this place on 14 October both by me in advancing a motion on that occasion and by Senator Chaney in resisting it. As a result I do not believe there is any necessity to prolong debate by repeating any of those arguments here today. I anticipate that if this motion is passed and if the Government persists with its opposition to it we will be met next with some formal claim by the Government of Executive privilege as a ground for refusing to deliver the documents in question to Sir John Minogue. That is something which, if it happens, of course will have to be debated and resolved by the Senate. I do not believe, however, that it is appropriate in this debate today to enter into the issues for and against Executive privilege. I understood Senator Chaney, from something he said in the course of the debate on 14 October, to agree with me in that respect. In essence , the debate today is simply a rerun, with a slightly different cast, of the debate that we had on 14 October and for that reason it need not be prolonged. </PARA>
<PARA> It remains only for me to draw the Senate's attention to the specific terms of this motion. It is, of course, in three parts. The first part of the motion is a direction by the Senate to Senator Chaney and Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. They are singled out, of course, because of their respective responsibilities in this chamber, as representing, in the case of Senator Chaney, the Acting Attorney-General, and in the case of Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, the Treasurer. They are the Ministers over whom the Senate has jurisdiction. The requirement of this part of the motion is that those two Ministers deliver the papers which are under their respective control to the Judge who is designated in a subsequent part of the motion but to deliver the papers only after preliminary sterilisation of them has occurred by way of meeting the requirements, such as they are, of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. There has been much argument about just what section 16 does require by way of secrecy and an awful lot of nonsense has been talked in recent weeks and months about it. However, it is undeniable that section 16 does in fact require that the names of individuals and other presumably identifying characteristics of individuals be deleted from material within the possession of the Australian Taxation Office before it is disclosed or produced to persons other than those with a duty, of an immediate kind presumably, to receive it. There may be an argument as to whether section 16 applies at all in the case of a Senate request , but that is not an argument that I seek to run on this occasion. It is appropriate I believe and the Senate believes--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is above the law; is that your point?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. It is a question as to the nature of the proper interpretation of section 16 and whether or not the Senate can properly be regarded as having a duty to deal with material of a kind which would in fact exempt it from the operation of section 16. That is not an argument that I seek to pursue. Since what is in issue is not the treatment of particular individuals but the basic legal and policy matters underlying it, I believe it is appropriate for the documents to be edited in a preliminary way for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of section 16. There may be some suggestion that the Senate cannot require the delivery of papers to anyone other than itself- that there should be no third party. Should that point be taken, I draw the attention of the Senate and of Senator Chaney to ample precedent in the United Kingdom for select committees of the Westminster Parliament vesting in third parties the power to inspect documents on the Parliament's behalf.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second part of the motion is a request to Sir John Minogue to act in the role of filter or editor of these documents. That follows references earlier to Mr Costigan playing that role and possibly also to a judge of the Federal Court designated by Sir Nigel Bowen. For one reason or another those earlier proposed arrangements have not borne fruit. In the motion that was passed on 14 October it was foreshadowed that a retired judge of Supreme Court status or above be given this role. When it became clear that the co-operation of the Federal Court was unlikely to be forthcoming, it was a matter of seeing who among the list of retired judges of that status might be available and willing to take on the task . I have had only sufficient conversation with Sir John Minogue to establish with him that he would not be unwilling to consider favourably the terms of this motion, if passed today. </PARA>
<PARA> I can tell the Senate that Sir John Minogue is an entirely appropriate person for this task. He has had a very distinguished career both at the Bar and on the Bench. He was appointed by the Menzies' Government to the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea, subsequently assuming the Chief Justiceship of that Court. He subsequently came back to Australia and was a Hamer Liberal Government appointee to the Motor Accident Board of Inquiry and was subsequently the first Law Reform Commissioner in Victoria. I suggest that he is a man of great distinction and enormous experience, someone in whom the Senate and this nation can well repose the trust of doing this difficult job. </PARA>
<PARA> The final part of the motion is a direction to Senators Chaney and Dame Margaret Guilfoyle to table the papers, once edited. There is no need to pursue here and now the implications of any failure by them to observe the various instructions set out in the text of this motion. It is sufficient to say that the motion is in a form whereby the Ministers in question are brought squarely within the potential operation of the privilege and contempt jurisdiction of the Senate should they be minded to act against, without some other legal justification, the terms of this motion. I hope that despite the course of events so far, which have demonstrated a massive unwillingness on the part of the Government to co-operate in this process, the Government will not now resist the course of action that is here proposed. Certainly there can be no rational justification for it doing so. The truth of the matter is that the proposed filtering process will ensure that there is no conceivable risk to the administration of justice involved in the tabling of these documents and that the Government is resisting disclosure only because it has something to hide. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note the interjection from Senator Haines about Alice in Wonderland and I share the views contained in that interjection. The Government opposes this latest sally of Senator Evans in his attempt to obtain certain legal opinions and to have them tabled in the Senate. Senator Evans has completed his claim that the refusal of the Government to produce these documents in some way indicates a cover up. I must therefore address myself again to the substance of the matter. This is a matter which I ask the Senate to consider very seriously. Important questions of public interest and of the interest of the Senate are involved. I do not believe that public interest or the interests of the Senate will be served by the sort of confrontation which Sentor Evans is seeking to engineer on what I regard as quite specious grounds. I can understand that Senator Evans hopes to gain political advantage by pursuing this matter. I suggest that that is neither a good nor a sufficient reason why the Senate as a whole should lend support to the motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The simple reason that the Government has indicated for not believing that it should follow the course which has been suggested to it by Senator Evans in his series of motions is that we believe that this is an area where we have a responsibility to protect the public interest, in particular the public interest in the carrying-forward of prosecutions and other proceedings which relate to the contentious tax matters which have recently occupied so much of the time of the Senate. As indicated by my amendment to another motion a little while ago, it is the view of the Government that we should be engaging in debate on the substantive legislation before the Senate rather than on this side-show of Senator Evans's. I remind the Senate of what we are talking about in regard to this motion. We are talking about a series of documents which the Solicitor- General has indicated might prejudice important legal proceedings. I cannot go into detail with respect to legal proceedings which have already commenced because in no way do I wish to prejudice the proceedings which are being brought . </PARA>
<PARA> I inform the Senate that the documents referred to in items (i), (ii), (iii), ( v), (xi), (xii), (xiii) and (xiv) of the resolution of 23 September all relate to the Perth matter which was referred to in chapter 3, volume 1 of the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. The Perth matter referred to in chapter 3 is the Stirling court matter in respect of which proceedings have now been commenced against Messrs Brian Maher, Lloyd Errol Faint and Wilfrid Henry Tolhurst. Warrants for their arrests were executed on 29 October 1982 and bail has been granted. The charges in question are for conspiracy under section 86 (1) (b) and (e) of the Crimes Act to defeat the enforcement of a law of the Commonwealth and to defraud the Commonwealth. With respect to the list of documents that I have just particularised, we have the opinion of the Solicitor-General, the senior law officer of the Commonwealth-after the Attorney-General-and a man whose independence, legal skills and integrity have not been challenged, that it could prejudice the proceedings before the court. Those are proceedings in which one would have thought there would be a wide public interest that no prejudice should occur. The documents in items (iv) and (vi) on Senator Evans's list relate to a matter on which counsel has been briefed to advise with a view to the possibility of proceedings being taken. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter dealt with in item (vii) has been referred to the Special Prosecutor . With respect to the Special Prosecutor I suggest that the Senate should note that Mr Roger Gyles has been appointed. In less than two months he has established four investigation teams and two further teams will begin operations soon. About 20 tax investigators have been allocated or are in the course of being allocated to the Special Prosecutor. Twenty-three police officers have been seconded or are in the course of being seconded. The Special Prosecutor plans to launch court actions against major scheme promoters over the next two years. It is estimated that over 40 people are to be investigated. Police seconded to the Special Prosecutor travelled to Brisbane and were involved in the arrest of Mr Maher. The document in item (vii) relates to concerns which are presently being pursued with proper vigour by the Special Prosecutor. </PARA>
<PARA> The opinion referred to in item (x) deals with issues that are relevant to proceedings or possible proceedings to which I have just referred. That is really central to the Government's attitude, which has been stated by me not just today but also in the debate on 14 October last, that the Government considers that it should not table documents which have not been cleared for that purpose by the Solicitor-General or the Commissioner for Taxation because they would be harmful to the administration of justice and because of the secrecy provisions contained in section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the overriding concern of the Government to bring about appropriate legal proceedings in a situation where there is widespread and proper public concern about the activities of tax evasion and avoidance. As I said a few minutes ago, we have a Special Prosecutor who has been appointed to deal with bottom-of-the- harbour promoters. Proceedings have been commenced in one case. Four investigation teams have been established by the Special Prosecutor and two further teams are beginning operations. We have produced a vast amount of material which shows the timetabling of what was done by government which has amply exposed to public debate the Government's consideration of these matters. The only material which is being withheld is material which the Solicitor- General-whose position has not been challenged in this matter, whose integrity, independence and legal standing has not been challenged-has said might prejudice proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> The third alternative which is now offered by the Opposition is that we should forgo the view of our senior professional adviser in favour of getting some opinion from a retired judge who, on my understanding, retired in 1974, who is 73 years of age and who has not been a judge for eight years. I just wonder what will be the next option which is pulled out of the hat by Senator Evans. I simply indicate that for the reasons which I have detailed in previous debates the Government does not believe that it is appropriate to transfer its responsibilities in this area to any other third party outside the Solicitor- General. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with one thing that Senator Evans said. I do not believe this is an appropriate time to canvass possible claims of Executive privilege. That may be a matter for a debate at a later time on another day. I regard the approach of Senator Evans in this matter to be one of irresponsibility. That is clearly illustrated by the cavalier way in which he has treated the considerations which the Commissioner for Taxation raised in a statement which was brought down in this place in a previous debate on 14 October. That statement related to a report of a senior investigation officer to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Perth. The statement pointed out that the tabling of that document would be even more damaging than the tabling of legal opinions. It pointed out that a great many people are aware of the particular case dealt with and that in these circumstances any deletions from or alterations to the document to conceal identities or persons would not solve the problem presented by the resolution to the obligations of secrecy imposed by section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. In other words, once the parties are known the sort of deletion which is suggested would be meaningless. It is unavoidable that any information at all provided in a so-called sanitised version would offend against section 16. No attempt is made to address that problem. Whatever Senator Evans might say, its terms require a sanitised version of the document to be prepared and passed not by the custodian of the document but by the Minister representing the Treasurer- the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle)-and a third person named in the motion. That third person does not come within any of the exceptions contained in section 16. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not propose to canvass again the constitutional issues which Senator Evans described as the high constitutional road taken by the Government. But I believe that there would be very few in the community who would not understand the simple point which is removed from any question of a high constitutional road and that is that the Government has a responsibility to bring proceedings in a proper way before the courts and that when we have the opinion of the Solicitor- General that material should not be disclosed then that is an opinion that we should be prepared to respect and to act on. I make no comment, and I do not wish anything I have said to be a comment on the worthiness of the particular person who has apparently after some conversation agreed that he might not be unwilling to be considered in the event that something happens. I simply say that that is obviously a very strange way to go about the serious business of ensuring that proper proceedings are brought before the court without risk of prejudice. I hope that on this occasion the Senate would reconsider the attitude which it adopted in previous votes on this matter, that it would cease what I regard as a by-play and get back to the serious business of legislating to avoid some of the difficulties which have occurred in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the first opportunity of being engaged in this debate which has been a saga in the Senate while I was overseas and since. Unfortunately, I did not get the opportunity to speak on the statement that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) put down on 14 October either. I regret that and I will make a comment or two on it. But that is not essential to the major issues today. I do not understand the persistence of Senator Evans in pressing as he does for this type of action-in going from one failure to another-and now endeavouring to resurrect a retired judge from Victoria, of whom I am aware, to serve a purpose which, as I will point out shortly, is an impossible purpose and one that should never be imposed on a person. I have noticed that, in fact, what the Government did in September was to table some 85 documents-a very substantial number of documents. As the Minister then pointed out in his statement of 14 October these were documents:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . which even on the most generous interpretation of what might have been tabled in the fullest freedom of information legislation would not normally have been available. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Government had certainly gone beyond any requirements of freedom of information in making available those documents. The Government has taken views in regard to the danger which would be involved in fair trials of persons' actions, by their refusal to enter into the courses which Senator Evans has suggested one after another. The document which was put down by the Minister on 14 October is one in which naturally I, as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs for some six years, am very interested. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that I do not go along with some of the more whimsical extensions of the idea of separation of powers which, I think, would be suggested as denying this Senate the right to do certain things, the right to scrutinise and even the right to ask people to do certain things, such as is suggested here in the motion. I do not challenge that right; I, in fact, was here in the Senate in 1975 when the Senate insisted on bringing to the Bar of this Senate certain officers of the Government and questioning them. I am only sorry that what we did not do subsequently was adopt the minority report of that time on that investigation. If we did not get answers from them we could have taken action. I think the rights of the Senate should have been enforced in those days and should have been at least insisted on. </PARA>
<PARA> I still stand by the rights which I believe the Senate has. So far as that is concerned I do not accept some idea that by the separation of powers this Senate has not a very considerable right to scrutinise and busy itself about what happens in Executive government and whether Executive government is properly enforcing the laws of this country. That is one thing which the Senate has of right. The other thing-the more important thing here-is the insistence on this rather ridiculous scheme which now comes forward from Senator Evans. The same thing applied, of course, in the knockbacks which he had from Mr Costigan and from the Federal judges. In this motion the Opposition insists that the Government should send away the papers to a person who has no responsibility for Executive government in this country but who, in this case, is a retired judge. I do not want to say anything unkind. He is a retired judge who presided over, I suppose, the most peaceful little exercise in law reform in the last five years in Victoria. Very little of importance came out of that. But he may be quite capable of looking at documents. What is Senator Evans suggesting that he do? He will, in fact, be something like a special prosecutor. </PARA>

It is giving away an executive function to a person who has no Commonwealth responsibility and insisting that all these things be made available to him. It is a ridiculous and preposterous thing for the Senate to continue to persist in this way. Executive government has demonstrated that it is proceeding with prosecutions and that these matters, on the advice of the Solicitor-General, ought not to be disclosed. I suggest that it is mere arrogance and pretence on the part of Senator Evans to persist in trying to find some person who might, if pressed, now take up this responsibility. The Government is quite right in its decision to resist this move.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take advantage of the opportunity presented to the Senate by the debate on the Cotton Levy Bill and the Cotton Research Bill to draw the attention of the Senate to the consequences for Australian women of the Fraser Government's economic policies. Those consequences have been a deepening of disadvantage for Australian women and a serious rise in the level of inequality in our society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most pressing problem for women in Australia today is poverty. This problem is exacerbated by the high rate of unemployment amongst women, the lack of income security for women and an unfair share of the tax burden falling on women . Cutbacks in government services, implementation of the so-called user-pays principle in areas such as health and the withdrawal from vital areas such as women's emergency services by the Federal Government all have contributed to what sociologists now call the feminisation of poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us pay some attention to the effect on women of income and taxation measures. Figures published as a part of the 1982 Budget Papers give comparative taxable incomes for males and females for 1980-81. They show that, while 13.2 per cent of male taxpayers earned less than $7,000 per annum, 29.8 per cent of female taxpayers had income under the $7,000 per annum level whereas, at the other end of the scale, 37 per cent of men had incomes over $15,000 per annum and the comparable figure for women was 13 per cent. The source of these figures is Budget Paper No. 11-Income Tax Statistics. These figures show clearly that women are concentrated in the low income brackets.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is in these low income brackets that the largest increases in taxation have occurred under the Fraser Government. For those people on 75 per cent of average weekly earnings-currently that figure is $13,440 per annum-the proportion of income paid in tax since 1975-76 has gone up by 4.3 per cent. Since 1975-76, for those on average weekly earnings, which are currently $17,920 per annum, the proportion of income tax paid has risen by 2.2 per cent. But for those on twice average weekly earnings-that is, on $35,840 per annum-the comparable rise has been only 1.1 per cent. For those on the massive salaries of around six times average weekly earnings-that is, about $112,000 a year-there has actually been a reduction of 2.4 per cent in the proportion of income tax paid. So it is very clear that the Fraser Government has pursued taxation policies which shift the burden of taxation towards low income earners. Of course, the point of what I am saying today is that that shift is a shift towards women earners because the majority of women fall into the low income earning category. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And work harder. I wish to make some comments on the Government's current fad for salvaging our economy, namely, the wages freeze. One of the many criticisms to be made of this proposal is that a wages freeze, proposed in isolation as it is by the Fraser Government, would have a disproportionate impact on women. By itself, a wages freeze would have the same impact as a fierce hike in taxes and these virtual tax increases would have a regressive distributional impact-again on those on the lowest incomes. The majority of women workers are in that category and they would face the biggest increase. At the end of a 12-month wages freeze which started from now, a wage earner on 75 per cent of average weekly earnings would sustain an effective tax increase of 52 per cent. For a person on average weekly earnings, the effective increase would be 45 per cent. But, of course, for a person on three times the average weekly earnings, the effective tax increase would be only 24 per cent. So, clearly again, this proposal of the Federal Government, ill considered as it is and really an economic fad, is one which if implemented would be extremely regressive and thus extremely harsh in its effect on women wage earners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Regressive policies-policies which push the poor further into poverty- constitute an attack on women. The Australian Labor Party is committed to achieve equality within our society and in particular to improve the disadvantaged position of Australian women. Policies such as a wages freeze, which would have a discriminatory effect on women and of course on all low income earners, will not be supported by the Australian Labor Party. It is worth pointing out also that the effect on women in the home of the proposed wages freeze would be disastrous. Women who are trying to manage to feed, clothe and generally cater for their families would of course be in a situation in which the housekeeping costs would go up every week but the income would be fixed and so the family would fall even further behind and in many cases, of course, that would mean that they would fall below the poverty line. The Labor Party also believes that a wages freeze will not work; it will not achieve the Government's stated ends. By reducing real spending power by over $6 billion in one year-that is an amount equal to two months retail sales nationally-a wages freeze would have a severely contractionary effect. By depressing demand, a wages freeze would be likely also to depress employment. It should be pointed out what the effect of this would be on the retail industry which is an area of high employment for women. The level of unemployment for women would rise catastrophically if such a proposal were implemented in the terms in which the Government seems to be interested in implementing it. </PARA>
<PARA> So, the proposed wages freeze is really just a desperate attempt by the Government to rescue its bankrupt Budget. The Budget, although brought down only three months ago, contained estimates for unemployment benefits which are now running over the original estimation by $600m-a figure confirmed, I believe, by the Treasurer and Acting Prime Minister, Mr Howard, just yesterday. If a wages freeze depresses employment, this figure could go much higher. When it is also considered that a wages freeze will depress government revenue-thus the Government will have less money with which to stimulate the economy-the whole proposal is revealed as totally self-defeating. </PARA>
<PARA> The rate of increase of women's unemployment, which slowed slightly earlier this year, has taken off again in the last quarter. The October unemployment figures show female unemployment at 10.6 per cent of those looking for full time work, in seasonally adjusted terms, compared with the rate of 7.4 per cent for males. As I have often said in this place, women make up the bulk of the hidden unemployed; that is, those people not shown up in the unemployment statistics because they are not eligible for unemployment benefits. In the 15 to 19 year age bracket, the gap between males and females is even wider with unemployment rates of 23.2 per cent for females and 17.7 per cent for males. At this stage, that means about one in four teenage girls are unemployed and looking for jobs. The 1981 census figures showed that almost 185,000 families in Australia have female breadwinners and a much larger number of women make an essential contribution to family incomes. Despite this, the Government has taken no steps to address the record high levels of unemployment amongst women. </PARA>
<PARA> Another indication of the extent to which women live in poverty is the percentage of female pensioners and beneficiaries. Sixty-six per cent of recipients of social security pensions or benefits, excluding unemployment benefit, are women. The vast majority of single parents-97 per cent of recipients of the single parent's benefit-are women. Faced with this catalogue of disadvantage suffered by Australian women, the Fraser Government has consistently failed to pursue policies which would assist women to break the cycle of poverty and move towards a position of equality in our society. If it were not for the diligence of the Senate, the Fraser Government would have gone ahead with even more disastrous policies for women-for example, its attempt to introduce tertiary education fees, which would restrict women's access to tertiary education, and the introduction of a series of new sales taxes on household goods which would have further eroded the position of Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> As it is, this Government has, at the same time as it increased the tax burden on women, withdrawn from the provision of services vital to women. The Government has withdrawn from its funding responsibilities for women's emergency services, such as women's refuges. The provision of these services is now left to State governments, and in those States with unsympathetic State governments services have been dropped. The erosion of family allowances under this Government is well documented, and the family income supplement introduced in the August Budget, though welcomed by the Australian Labor Party, is means tested so severely that the vast majority of families will not be eligible for this benefit. This Government's total dismantling of the Medibank health insurance scheme has been another blow to women, who, because of their child bearing and child rearing roles in this society, are much greater users of the health system than are men. The 80 per cent increase per item in patient contribution to pharmaceutical benefits which was introduced in the August Budget can be expected to hit women hardest, especially in relation to prescribed oral contraceptives. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the greatest failure of this Government is the failure to provide well- considered job creation and training programs to ensure women's access to the job market. It should be pointed out that the Government's major training scheme , the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training Scheme for training apprentices, has a take-up rate of over 90 per cent males. Because the scheme is tailored to meet the needs of traditional apprenticeships in the building and trades areas, areas to which women have very little access, this scheme is virtually useless for providing training opportunities for women and girls. I stress this because employment is the most important determinant of income, and while women's unemployment continues to rise and women continue to be denied training for areas in which employment is available, the financial and social position of women will continue to deteriorate. Without specific measures to improve the opportunities for women's employment, the unconscionably high level of unemployment amongst women, especially young women, can only increase. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have time at this stage of this debate to put forward the Federal Australian Labor Party's proposals to overcome the economic and social disadvantage suffered by women. However, I point out that the Federal Labor Party has recently released a comprehensive policy, 'The Australian Labor Party and Women: Towards Equality', which contains a broad range of commitments in line with our policy of achieving equality for women in our society. These commitments include anti-discrimination legislation, based on the Bill that I have introduced into the Senate, which would give women equal access to areas such as education, employment in the public and private sectors, accommodation, goods and services, and clubs. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also committed to upgrading the administration of policies affecting women within the Commonwealth Government by returning the Office of the Status of Women to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. We are committed to a new and expanded children's services program, with priority for areas of greatest need. We will resume Federal funding for women's emergency services and we have plans to extend those services to areas of greatest need, which, of course, are the areas which have fewest of them. We draw attention also to the new health insurance plan which would be funded by an income-related levy, which would mean, in effect, a great practical improvement in women's access to health services. We have a whole program for changing a broad range of benefits and taxation measures to ensure more equitable treatment for women. The introduction of employment generating programs-a concept which even the Fraser Government is now forced to consider-is a matter of great concern to the Labor Party, and we will ensure that all employment generating programs are so structured as to ensure access by women and girls, as well as by unemployed males. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the effect of the Fraser Government's policies on women has been a serious deterioration in the economic and social conditions of women. Despite much good advice from its own Office of the Status of Women and from the National Women's Advisory Council, the Fraser Government has continued to formulate and implement policies which work to the detriment of the majority of Australian women. I believe that Australian women are demonstrating their response to the Fraser Government's policies at the ballot box. There has been a consistent move in the women's vote away from the Liberal Party and the National Party towards the Australian Labor Party. I believe that the women's vote will be a significant factor in electing a Labor government at the next Federal election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the course of an informal meeting during this week between some women parliamentarians and the National Women's Advisory Council, it was observed that probably many senators and members of Parliament are unaware or only vaguely aware of the Advisory Council's existence , let alone its activities. It seemed useful to use this occasion of the first reading debate on the Cotton Levy Bill 1982 to refer to a report that was introduced into this Parliament, but not debated, last week; that is the annual report of the National Women's Advisory Council. The Council's current composition, under its convenor, Quentin Bryce of Queensland, is probably more accurately reflective of Australian women than at any time since its inception in 1978, bearing in mind that over 40 per cent of women are in the paid work force. It is unfortunate that, along with a reduction in the size of the Council from 14 to 12 members, there is currently no Aboriginal women member, nor is there a replacement for Kath French, who so ably represented women of Perth and the south-west of Western Australia until recently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Council, obviously, is well attuned to the position of women in Australia. Major issues which are included in a list of specific representations to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) cover a wide range of concerns. These include inadequate representation of women at international meetings and conferences, such as the United Nations Conference on the Ageing and international fertility control programs, the threatened removal of the women's unit from the Australian Development Assistance Bureau, and the long-awaited ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. National and domestic issues which have been the subject of direct representation to the Prime Minister through the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh) over the last 12 months include the need for representation on a wide range of authorities and committees of inquiry, concern about funding levels for crucial programs such as family planning and child care , and the long-promised and long overdue anti-discrimination legislation promised for the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Issues raised in correspondence and at meetings provide a comprehensive catalogue which should leave no doubts about the necessity for the existence, in one form or another, of this Advisory Council, without which official atention may never be directed to such matters as a full range of opportunity in education for women and girls, the effects of unemployment and underemployment on women and girls, the vulnerability of women with young children, premenstrual tension, the effect of taxation policies on women on low incomes-which was so ably referred to by my colleague Senator Ryan a few minutes ago-community of property, domestic violence in migrant communities, the situation of Muslim women, and the inclusion of the value of unpaid work by women in the national accounts, to name but a few. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to refer briefly to three extremely valuable studies which the Council is currently undertaking. The first is a study of women who are dependent on social security. Of those who are dependent on social security 60 per cent are women. Of those who receive some sort of income supplement, including the family allowance, 85 per cent are women. Very little is known of their circumstances or what difference is made by educational levels, country or urban living, employability or how they are housed. The Brotherhood of St Laurence has been commissioned to produce an accurate qualitative profile of a selected group of women dependent on Commonwealth Government pensions and benefits as an aid to policy making. It is hoped that the findings of this study will be available by November 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> The subject of another comprehensive survey is disabled women. Following a phone-in consultation with disabled women and girls which was conducted in May 1981 a professional consultant has been commissioned to prepare a report which is soon to be available on the data so collected. This annual report includes recommendations following from the 403 submissions which were received during the phone-in. The recommendations address the problems of financial aspects of being disabled, transport and access, general living, communication, personal relationships and access to professional and other services. Many of these problems, as they affect the handicapped generally, were acknowledged during the International Year of Disabled Persons. Two areas of specific concern to disabled women were the establishment of relationships with men and the situation of being a mother and disabled. The report of the Council stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Respondents discussed both the physical problems, for example lifting a baby, with lessened strength in the arms, and the social problems, such as not joining in all the activities expected of a mother of school-age children. The incidental stresses on family relationships between parent and child and husband and wife were also raised in many comments on specific problems of finance, transport or domestic help. </PARA>
<PARA>Older women are the subject of a further study to be conducted by Dr Alice Day, with two specific questions to be addressed-ones which involve older women more than older men. The first point is that older women are more likely to be living alone and the second is that older women are more likely to be caring for somebody else. Questionnaires related to this study were published in the Women' s Weekly magazine of 7 July and in other publications which are commonly read by people in this age group, such as the Australian Pensioner and Prime Time. The response has been excellent. Over 800 women over the age of 60 years had completed and returned questionnaires by the end of August. Tables in the report to which I have referred summarise some of the information which has already become available. Sixty-four per cent of respondents lived alone and 32 per cent provided care for another person. Of a randomly selected sample of the respondents, 17 per cent were married, the remainder being widowed, divorced, separated or never married. Sixty-four per cent lived in their own homes and 68 per cent were reliant upon a pension as their main source of income. </PARA>
<PARA> When asked about difficulties in budgeting, 68 per cent reported that paying for electricity and gas was their greatest worry. Other costs of common concern were home maintenance, food and medical expenses, each of which was creating problems for over one-third of the sample. A question about the quality of life at 60 years-plus brought some positive responses. Obviously some women had found having no children on their hands a liberating experience. According to the report they had:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . no family to cook for, sew for, wash for, tidy up after . . . bail out of difficulties of their own making. I can do as I like when I like, how I like and as often as I like . . .</PARA>
<PARA>However, the majority expressed the frustration, anxiety and dejection which flow from reduced physical strength and resilience, reduced mobility and, more than anything else, reduced financial means. The report lists issues for review and recommendation at the completion of the survey, but documents general issues which clearly emerge from the survey information regarding older women on low incomes, older women living alone and caring for other people, older women and informal support systems, older women and sex roles-including the difficulties in undertaking simple house repairs and fears for personal safety- and older women and social priorities. In the meantime, the report is well worth the attention of honourable senators and members who are sensitive or should be sensitive to the needs of this growing proportion of every electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxation was a separate issue addressed by the report. Social changes of the last decade or so pose serious questions about the basis of our present taxation system and its appropriateness to the fact that so many women are now earning their own living or are contributing substantially to household incomes. Of particular concern to women are the decline in real terms of the family allowance and the apparent discrepancy between the value of the dependent spouse rebate and the sole parent rebate. For example, in 1982 a taxpayer who had a dependent spouse who earned less than $3,602 received a rebate of $830. A taxpayer who had sole care of a child under 16 years or a full time student received a rebate of $580 if he earned less than $1,719. As we are all very well aware, many households which are currently eligible for a dependent spouse rebate have no dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA> In the introductory letter to the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, which prefaces this report, Dame Beryl Beaurepaire, the retiring Convenor, to whom great tribute should be paid for her dedication to the cause of equality for women and her untiring efforts over the first four years of the Council's existence, drew attention to the fact that recommendations of previous reports have had to be repeated because no action has been taken. Some of these are listed under the list of recommendations to the Prime Minster during this current 12 months. It is also regretted that some extremely worthwhile initiatives of crucial importance to women have been set in train but in the slowest of slow motion. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer here to amendments to the Family Law Act which I believe were introduced into the Senate something like 12 months ago, the debate on which has not yet been concluded; the recommendation that there be a task force on the question of community of property in marriage, which I believe has yet to be announced despite the fact that it is well over 12 months since it was announced that this task force would be formed and the problem of domestic violence and the funding of womens refuges. This matter has been the subject of repeated recommendations. The Government could give much more heed to the Council's recommendations. It should be more acutely aware of its priorities. The excellent work being done by the Council and the Office of Women's Affairs has firmly established its credentials. The Government must recognise this fact without reservation and act accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity of making some remarks at the first reading stage of these money Bills. I am prompted to do so because of claims made by Senator Carrick on 19 November that the Opposition had taken an undue amount of time in considering the Appropriation Bills. Senator Carrick claimed that the debates which were broadcast last week had attracted adverse public comment and had done no credit to the Senate. He also claimed that the debate had been almost entirely a repetition of the Estimates committee hearings and that the generally poor standard of the debate, which had been monopolised by a handful of senators to the detriment of the Senate, had also been the subject of public reaction. I know what that public reaction is. I wonder what public reaction came to the attention of Senator Carrick. Much of the public reaction which has come back to me from what I have read in the newspapers, seen on the television and heard on the radio has been absolute disgust at the enormous cost inflicted on the taxpayers' purse by two National Party Ministers. Apparently that is what got under Senator Carrick's tail when he got a bit excited. I remind him that had he been prepared to look at the time taken for the Appropriation Bills this year as against last year he would have seen that this year 17 hours 49 minutes were taken up in debate at the second reading and committee stages of both Bills. Last year the debate took 20 hours 57 minutes. So this year we got through the Appropriation Bills in 3 hours 8 minutes less than it took last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We should consider the amount of money appropriated in these Bills. An amount of $7.163 billion was appropriated in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and $1.178 billion was appropriated in Appropriation Bill (No. 2), making a total of $8.341 billion of taxpayers' money. Yet we have Senator Carrick complaining because honourable senators wanted to examine those figures. I make no apologies for the time that I took because, as I have said before, I religiously attend to my duties on Senate Estimates committees, particularly on Estimates Committee C of which I am a member. I go to every other committee when my Committee is not sitting to pursue matters that I feel are of some import. Senator Carrick knows that honourable senators cannot be in two places at once. If we cannot attend other Estimates committees to get information then we have to raise these matters-it is our right and it always has been-in the Committee of the Whole. In my case, a lot of time was taken up in complaining about the fact that I had waited exactly two calendar months from the time I sought information at an Estimates committee hearing until the Senate came to consider the Appropriation Bills. Two months after I raised those questions the answers were not forthcoming. Those questions were in relation to legal expenses of the Aboriginal Development Commission. Another week has gone by and still the answers have not been provided. I have been waiting for the answers now for about 10 weeks. The Hansard shows that I spent nearly half an hour of the time I took on the Appropriation Bills trying to get that information. It is still not here. Some of the other time that I took up was used to seek information about the way National Party Ministers have cost the taxpayers a lot of money. </PARA>
<PARA> I did an exercise last Saturday on the time taken on the second reading debate of Appropriation Bill (No. 1). I spent 30 minutes; Senator Walsh, 30 minutes; Senator Foreman, 25 minutes; Senator Evans, 23 minutes; and Senator Childs, 16 minutes. But two Government senators also took a fair amount of time. Senator MacGibbon spoke for 27 minutes and Senator Hamer for 22 minutes. If we look at the Committee stage, spread over 9, 10, 11, 16 and 18 November, we find that I spoke for 74 minutes and the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), who was in charge of the Bills, also spoke for 74 minutes. I have made from the Hansard a complete list of the time taken by each honourable senator who spoke in this debate. So Senator Carrick is completely wrong when he makes this claim. I say again that the reason he is upset is that his National Party colleagues have been exposed for what they have been up to.</PARA>
<PARA> I was very disturbed on Saturday when my attention was drawn to an advertisement that appeared in the Canberra Times, on Saturday, 20 November 1982 , headed 'Private Sale Hughes'. The advertisement stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Owners sadly selling long-time family home . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to give all the details. The asking price is $105,000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He will be making about $89,000 profit. I was hoping to ask a question at Question Time today but I could not. That does not matter because I can ask it now. I was going to refer to the advertisement and in particular to the fact that the owners were sadly selling their long-time family home, at an asking price of $105,000. I was going to ask Senator Messner, who represents the Minister for the Capital Territory, whether this long-time family home is owned by the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, and whether he purchased it from the Government in 1964 for $18,910 with a deposit of $946, the difference being financed by a Commonwealth home loan over 45 years at a fixed interest rate of 4 .75 per cent. I was further going to ask Senator Messner: If this home is owned by Mr Anthony, how can he rightfully advertise it as a long-time family home when he has repeatedly claimed when questions have been asked about his home base that his home has always been at Murwillumbah and at no other place? So there we have it. Mr Anthony, when under attack about his home base, claimed that Murwillumbah had always been his home base since he had been a Minister, and now he is advertising his home as a long-time family home. I have placed a series of questions on the Notice Paper and I am hopeful that we will get the answers next week. On 19 November I asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) What was the 'home base' designated by each Liberal/ Country Party/National Party Minister to the Department of Administrative Services for each of financial years 1975-76, 1976-77, 1977-78, 1978-79, 1979-80, 1980-81 and 1981-82 . </PARA>
<PARA> (2) What change in 'home base' designation was made by each of the Ministers in the years mentioned in (1) above. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) What were the dates of change in each financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) Can this information be made available before the Senate rises at the end of the 1982 Budget Session. </PARA>
<PARA>It is no great hardship to get information about those changes from the Department of Administrative Services because they would all be listed. I suppose it would take less than 24 hours to get that information. But it has not come in here yet. I hope that we will get it next week because Mr Anthony now finds himself in a very curious situation because he has publicly claimed-in Parliament, too, as I said during debate on the Estimates-that his home was always at Murwillumbah. Now, his home is advertised as a long-time family home. It could be a case that the Trade Practices Commission could look at, in regard to false or misleading advertising. He cannot have it both ways.</PARA>
<PARA> This matter is of great concern to the people of this nation. It is all very well for Senator Carrick to criticise members on this side of the chamber for taking some time in the Parliament to try to seek out information. Information in relation to this matter was first given at about this time last year, when we had to postpone examination in Committee of the estimates of the Department of the Capital Territory to drag out the information. I was grateful to Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle for getting the information and bringing it forward. From then on I have presented to this Parliament a whole series of petitions on behalf of concerned citizens. So the people outside, as I have said, are very concerned that this Minister, who bought a house for something over $18,000, can advertise it for $105,000, and then repeatedly go on television and into the Press and claim for wage restraint from the workers. It is all very well for him to say that when he purchased a house at a flat interest rate of 4 3/4 per cent in 1964 and he has paid about $3,300 off the principal. Now he is going to sell it and purchase for himself, so the papers say, a luxurious home unit at Telopea Park for something like $210,000. There we have the principles of National Party Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer people to the cartoon in today's Canberra Times of the Minister for Defence, Mr Sinclair, sitting down with a calaculator and a pen, and asking his wife as she pokes her head around a corner: 'Which home did you say we were in?' He is trying to work out how much travelling allowance he is entitled to. Of course, he was at the top of the list. I have referred to the examples of two National Party Ministers. One of my colleagues passed a note to me the other day saying, as Mr Anthony has often prided himself on being a pig farmer, that not only do they have their snouts in the trough; they seem to be eating the trough as well. There will be nothing left for the taxpayers of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people have come to me and expressed their grave concern that some of the highest paid people in the land can avail themselves of taxpayers' money while people are out of work and some people are required to work a shorter week. People cannot get jobs, and the announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) this morning was that nearly 550,000 people will be on the dole very early next year. So these are the types of people who frame the Budget; these are the types of people in charge of the economics of this country. It is no wonder the country is going down the gurgler. </PARA>
<PARA> The people on low incomes are suffering and those on high incomes are getting the cream on the cake; they are eating the icing all the time. They could not care less about the work force or the lower paid or unemployed people in this country. It is high time that something was done to rectify all these problems. It must be a great embarrassment even to Senator Carrick to sit in this chamber when he knows what is going on. It must be a great embarrassment to him and to the Government that he leads that almost every day the Senate meets people are petitioning the Parliament so that they can get roofs over their heads on home loan conditions similar to that which has been given to a National Party Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony. When he goes out into the country areas he claims that he is concerned about the welfare of primary producers and country residents. He has no more concern about those people than his predecessor, Mr Bob Menzies, had when he was Prime Minister. He has no more concern than has the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). </PARA>
<PARA> If I had the time I could give full details of what the Prime Minister cost this country-the very person who claimed, when he was Leader of the Opposition, that the then Labor Government was wasting taxpayers' money. One of his party's election planks was that Australia did not want a tourist for a Prime Minister. He said that he would stop all that. If we look at the figures-my colleague, Senator Walsh, who is the shadow Minister for Finance has gone through them-we are able to ascertain that Mr Fraser is the most expensive Prime Minister that this country has ever had. I even had people ask me the other day: 'Did he get his $145 a day travelling allowance while he was hospitalised in Melbourne because his home base is at Nareen?'. I also ask the Government: Was the Prime Minister paid while he was hospitalised? That is something we have to look at. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many questions which the Government has to answer. It talks with a forked tongue. It wants the work force of this country to exercise restraint in all forms. It wants people to go without homes. The banks are beginning to close on those poor devils who have fallen behind in their home loan repayments because they are out of work or are on short time. Last week I mentioned the case of the Ericksons in Adelaide who are at their wits' end trying to hold on to a home which they have built. They are now faced with the prospect of selling their home, trying to rent a property for 12 months and applying to the Savings Bank of South Australia for a home loan to buy another home. What a terrible situation these young people with three children are facing. They have to get out of their home because of this Government's policies. This Government is not doing anything to create employment. If we look at every aspect of industry right across the spectrum we see that it is running down. So much for the mining boom which was talked up month by month by Senator Carrick in this chamber. So much for the Rundle shale oil scheme which he talked about and bragged about in this chamber and about which we now never hear a word. If we go right back through the Journals of this Parliament to the time that this Government was in opposition we see statements about what it was going to do prior to its coming into government. This Government came to power under very unsavoury circumstances in the first place. We see also statements it has made ever since 1975 always telling the people what a great government it is. But the people already know what sort of Government it is. It has taken them a long time to wake up to the fact. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said yesterday, as soon as the hip pocket nerve pinches people start to squeak and take a bit of notice. Unfortunately, many people will suffer between now and the next election. We must get a government in office in Canberra that will try to rectify all the ills that have been created in this country since 1975. This Government has had seven years to rectify the problems which it told the people existed prior to the 1975 election. What has happened? Unemployment figures are getting higher and higher and the inflation rate is now higher than at the time the Australian Labor Party went out of government. It has been quite noticeable over the last few weeks that Senator Carrick has not referred to the Whitlam days. People now know that the Whitlam days were much better than the Fraser-Anthony days. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. I hope that the people outside this Parliament will take note of what I have said today, in particular the way in which Liberal and National Party Ministers get their snouts into the trough and have all the pickings-money that should be available for the lower paid work force in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity of the first reading debate on the Cotton Levy Bill 1982 and the Cotton Research Bill 1982 to mention once again matters relevant to the Tehran Embassy embezzlement, particularly in light of the fact that the Senate is shortly to adjourn for the year. In my view , many aspects of this issue remain unanswered nine months after I first raised it. I wish to relate briefly what happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 25 February this year I asked a question about an alleged embezzlement at the Tehran Embassy. A few days later the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Street , sought to assure me-I suppose that that is the correct term-by way of a telephone call and subsequently by letter that his Department was unaware of any embezzlement. On going through my files, thinking about the matter, and looking at subsequent correspondence and answers to questions, et cetera, I am totally convinced that the head of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Mr Henderson, was the man who put that answer in the letter ultimately signed by Mr Street that was sent to me, I believe, in order to start what has become quite an extensive cover-up by Mr Henderson and Mr Street of Mr Henderson's long time friend, Mr Bowden, which caused, without any doubt whatsoever, Mr Street to mislead this Parliament. Subsequent information passed to the Minister by other Foreign Affairs Department officers leads me to that conclusion about information which detailed aspects of both Mr Henderson's and Mr Bowden's conduct concerning the embezzlement and cover up. That included claims for the nanny, false entertainment claims, payments to Mr Bowden's children and so on. At least two of these officers have in effect been sent to Coventry by Mr Henderson because of their honest and, in my view, correct behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> My inquiries have led me to the view that Mr Henderson and Mr Bowden have been friends for many years-in fact, since their school days. There is nothing wrong with that. I guess that all honourable senators in this chamber have friends of very long standing. But in my view there is something wrong with a relationship when it leads to one person covering up and giving false information to questions asked in this Parliament when Australian taxpayers were-they may well still be-being bled for tens of thousands of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> On further examination of the answers given on this issue by the Minister I have come to the conclusion that an investigation of this matter by the Australian Federal Police and the Department of Finance has been largely influenced, if not orchestrated, by someone very high up in the Department of Foreign Affairs-possibly Mr Henderson. Mr Street's long statement on 26 August was so full of errors, such as the alibi relative to Mr Bowden and the fraudulent conversion of a $8,700 cheque in Hong Kong, as to lead me to that view. I confirm my statement to the Senate on 9 September in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> As I told the Senate last week, new evidence is continually forthcoming concerning Mr Bowden. One example of this evidence concerns a small businessman who has told me that Mr Bowden took him for a four figure sum a couple of years ago with the assistance of other senior public servants. I expect to be able to provide fuller details on that matter shortly. Even the dogs in the corridor of the Department are barking to the effect that further evidence is around implicating both Mr Bowden and Mr Henderson in further acts of embezzlement of Australian taxpayers' funds. I renew my call that both these men be suspended from duty while a completely impartial body investigates the issue-something that certainly has not happened thus far. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week in this place Senator McIntosh incorporated in Hansard a letter from two former members of the Tehran staff, namely, Messrs Witheford and Henne, which very cogently sets out to prove that Mr Henderson had lied to Senate Estimates Committee D on 10 September. If any honourable senator wishes to refer to his evidence it is to be found on page 2343 of the Senate Hansard of 17 November. By means best known to themselves, Foreign Affairs security officers obtained a copy of that letter before Senator McIntosh incorporated it in Hansard. I ask: Does this mean that parliamentarians' offices are under surveillance by the Department of Foreign Affairs? As a result of that little exercise the same security officers put one of the signatories to that letter, namely Mr Henne, under the griller-without success, I must add. In my opinion Mr Henderson has time and again, either through the Minister for Foreign Affairs or before Senate Committee D, misled this Parliament, yet neither Mr Street nor the Government seems to care one iota. I ask: Who is protecting whom and for what reasons? If Mr Street, along with the Government and Messrs Henderson and Bowden , are living in the hope that the rising of this House will allow the matter to wither on the vine, I can assure them that they are mistaken. Neither threats of intimidation to Foreign Affairs officers nor threats of legal action against the Press and me will gain them those ends. </PARA>
<PARA> I once again call on Mr Street, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to suspend both Mr Henderson and Mr Bowden from duty pending a full impartial inquiry into this matter, otherwise he may well find himself down the gurgler with both of them. I said last week and I said here today that the dogs in the corridors of the Department of Foreign Affairs are barking. People are coming out of the woodwork wherever they may be. I have today placed on the Senate Notice Paper a series of questions concerning one other ambassador, namely, a Mr Loveday, who was Ambassador to Bonn. The indications of the information which has come to me would suggest that Mr Loveday may be following in Mr Bowden's footsteps in relation to the embezzlement or the misuse of Australian taxpayers' funds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take this opportunity of using the first reading of the Cotton Levy Bill and associated legislation to talk about a matter which I think is important. It illustrates, first of all, the inflexibility or rigidity of the Government in its interpretations of one section of our social security legislation. But also, in general, it illustrates one aspect of the many problems which are faced by disadvantaged people in our community in dealing with the bureaucracy and, indeed, in dealing with the appeals provisions which we have built into the social security system, and in particular the problems which face the most disadvantaged group in the community ; that is, our Aboriginal community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As we know Aborigines face many problems. These are caused, amongst other things, by prejudice against them because of their race and their colour; psychological problems which arise out of this prejudice and which arise out of years of being treated from childhood through to adulthood as second-class citizens; problems caused by illiteracy or lack of education, leading to a lack of capacity to deal with the bureaucracy in the systems that we have developed; problems faced because they live in isolation either through living long distances from our centres of government and centres of administration or, for those who live in our cities, by being isolated by living in what are, in fact, ghettos. To illustrate these problems I would like briefly to talk about the difficulties faced by two Aboriginal families in attempting to get a double orphan's pension. The double orphan's pension is available to those who are caring for a child or children where both parents are dead or in special circumstances. Section 105A(2) of the Social Services Act states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . where one of the parents . . . is dead and-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the whereabouts of the other parent are not known to the claimant;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the other parent has been convicted of an offence and sentenced to imprisonment for life or for a term of years, being a term not less than 10 years, and is serving that sentence at the time of the claim; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the other parent is, at the time of the claim, a mental hospital patient and the Director-General is satisfied that he will require care or treatment, whether in that hospital or in a similar hospital, for an indefinite period,</PARA>
<PARA>In those circumstances the other parent is deemed to be dead. Under those circumstances the double orphan's pension can be paid. It is in the interpretation of this section of the legislation-in particular, section 105A(2) (a); that is, 'the whereabouts of the other parent are not known to the claimant '-that the difficulty is often created. In our normal white society it is often difficult, as we know, to find the whereabouts of a parent, particularly a husband, who has left a family. In the Aboriginal community this difficulty can be aggravated considerably. If this definition is rigidly adhered to in a legalistic way enormous difficulties can be created. We have seen an illustration of the results of the rigid legalistic interpretation of social security legislation recently in the interpretation of what is called income when sickness benefits are being considered. </PARA>
<PARA> I will talk about two families in order to illustrate the problems associated with the double orphan's pension. The first case came to attention in my office through an appeal to the Administrative Appeal Tribunal, the Tribunal which was established to ensure that people had the right to appeal against bureaucratic and administrative decisions. It concerns a Mrs Kickett who is an Aboriginal grandmother with only one year's schooling and who virtually cannot read or write. She is, essentially, functionally illiterate. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walsh" NAMEID="TJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Where did she come from?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This case comes from Western Australia; I think the other one does too. Mrs Kickett applied for a double orphan's pension in January 1981, having looked after two children of a son who had died in 1975. She had received the double orphan's pension but when she applied for back payment to 1977-which was the time when the State foster payments she was receiving ceased-not only was the back payment rejected but also the orphan's pension was cancelled. There is evidence that the daughter-in-law, whose whereabouts were unknown to the Kicketts, kept in touch with her mother, a Mrs Hansen, and that the Kicketts had some knowledge of where the Hansens were until about 1980. From the evidence, Mrs Hansen showed no interest in her children. In coming to the conclusion that Mrs Kickett in fact had not done sufficient to find and notify the whereabouts of the children's mother, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, in rejecting the application, made remarks about Mrs Kickett which one can consider unwarranted- remarks about her illiteracy and her circumstances. In doing so, I believe it showed a lack of understanding and a lack of knowledge of the difficulties which are faced by people in these circumstances. For example, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal-which we must remember was established to help people in this situation and to help people overcome bureaucratic difficulties-stated that the mother's whereabouts were a matter of 'indifference' to Mrs Kickett. The Tribunal stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Implicit in the concept of the whereabouts of a surviving parent being unkown that the claimant will take reasonable steps to pursue information . . . it may require no more than to make a telephone call or to check the electoral roll. </PARA>
<PARA>That Aboriginal grandmother is doing as most Aboriginal grandmothers would do, and in fact what many people in a non-Aboriginal society would do, and is trying to care for children who have lost their father and been abandoned by their mother. To suggest that a women who can barely read or write, and who obviously would have great difficulty in coping with our system, knows how to check an electoral roll or to make telephone calls, and to suggest that that will make any difference to the desire of the mother to care for those children or make any difference to the financial burden and other burdens which are faced by Aboriginal grandmothers is unreasonable. The Minister for Social Security ( Senator Chaney) and his Department should reconsider this case despite the Administrative Appeals Tribunal's decision. If those are to be the legalistic rulings of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal we will have to reconsider the legislation, particularly as it refers to this group of people. </PARA>
<PARA> The second case involves a Mrs Eades of Cranbrook in Western Australia and also concerns her eligibility for arrears of a double orphan's pension and her ability to get a double orphan's pension in respect of four of her grandchildren who have been in her care since the death of her son in January 1980. Mrs Eades claimed the double orphan's pension in Albany in Western Australia on 23 November 1981. It was known that the children's mother was somewhere in Western Australia, probably in the Perth region. It was accepted, though, that Mrs Eades was not aware of the address of her daughter-in-law, and the double orphan's pension was granted from December 1981. But when investigations were again made into the claim for arrears of the double orphan's pension for Mrs Eades it was felt that Mrs Eades would be, to quote the Minister's words at the time:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . capable of locating her daughter-in-law by making reasonable inquiries'. </PARA>
<PARA>We can get some idea of what would be reasonable inquiries in the eyes of the Department when we consider the later letters from the Minister and the results of later representations that my office and others made on behalf of this woman. Mrs Eades and her husband live on an invalid pension. Mr Eades had had tuberculosis and needed repeated treatment-regular treatment-for this condition. Mrs Eades can neither read nor write. She has no telephone of her own, and she lives some 200 miles from Perth. It was suggested that she could have contacted the mother of the children by ringing the Perth police to see whether she had recently been sighted. I am not at all sure that such a telephone call would result in any reasonable information being given, nor am I sure that the privacy provisions in our society would allow the police to give such information even if they had it. It is unrealistic that Mrs Eades, who did not know and still does not know the whereabouts of her daughter-in-law, should have been expected to locate this daughter-in-law because, in the words of the Department, the Perth police had occasionally sighted her. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about a poor family which Mr Eades, the father of the children, had been supporting on a supporting parent's benefit. The grandmother lives in a very small town. She lives in a tin and asbestos house and has about $2,000 in debts for which local tradesmen are suing her. She has lost three sons in car accidents and she has recently been hospitalised for exhaustion. The letter she received from the Department of Social Security stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . you are no longer entitled to this allowance-</PARA>
<PARA>That is the double orphan's pension-</PARA>
<PARA> You will receive your final payment on 2 February, 1982. The authority for this decision is contained in sub-section 105A (2) of the Social Services Act.</PARA>
<PARA>Mrs Eades then travelled 50 miles to the nearest social security office to find out what it meant but the officers did not give her any explanation which she could understand. If she travelled to Perth she would have to do so on a bus and stay there overnight. To expect this woman to find her daughter-in-law, who has shown no interest in the upbringing of the children and has not tried to contact or see the children and who, the Department says, is occasionally sighted by the Perth police, and to suggest, as the Department does, that she is not entitled to a double orphan's pension because of a lack of effort to find her daughter-in -law, is, in my view, quite unreasonable and takes no account of the special circumstances of this woman. I raise these two cases very briefly to point out that although we have legislation and provisions for people to appeal against legislation, which is meant to assist people in these circumstances, quite clearly at every stage this legislation falls down in these cases because of its legalistic and rigid interpretation. I hope the Minister will consider the situation of these two cases and of many other people in the community who get caught in circumstances such as these. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a number of matters during this rather shortened first reading debate, the first of which relates to the report, tabled earlier today in the Senate, of the parliamentary delegation to the Nordic countries. That delegation was led by Senator John Martyr. When the report was tabled I missed my opportunity to make a few comments in respect of it, so I take the opportunity briefly to do so now. I was not involved in the planning of the visit, being asked to go at very short notice, but I wish to take the opportunity to congratulate those people who organised the trip and assisted in all parts of it. It was a rather informative visit to countries which I believe have much to offer Australia by way of information and example. The people involved, whether they were in overseas embassies or within Australian departments, put together a tightly scheduled trip which encompassed most aspects of those countries that we wanted to see. The report was prepared by the Secretary to the delegation, and I congratulate him for the effort he put into it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a couple of aspects in the report which I wish to highlight at this stage. The first one refers to the sale of Australian uranium to either Sweden or Finland. This point is referred to on page 19 and other pages of the report. I was able to be with the delegation when it visited the Oskarsham nuclear reactor in Sweden on 2 June. We had discussions with the director of the reactor . A number of points which came out of those discussions were of some worry to me particularly because of the assurances we had been given in Australia with respect to the use and final disposal of the products associated with uranium exported from Australia. The director could at no stage guarantee to us that there was any tight control. Specifically, we were told that Australian uranium was used at the Oskarsham plant and that, together with other uranium used there , it would be reprocessed. That remark flew into direct conflict with what the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) has often said to us. We were also told that there was no way of ensuring that Australian uranium was not reprocessed while other uranium used within Sweden would be processed. There is no way that the Swedes could distinguish between uranium from Australia and the uranium they use from other countries. Any guarantee that we have been given in respect of reprocessing our uranium could not in fact hold water. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sir John Carrick will assure us in all sorts of media talks about many things. But when one reads the fine print in what he says, one will see that Senator Sir John Carrick is rather wise enough and elusive enough to be able to give us assurances that do not stick all that tightly either. We were also told by the director of the plant that no final disposal method had been discovered in Sweden and that this discovery was some time off. That is also something which Senator Sir John Carrick would not tell us. I also took the opportunity to raise with the Finnish Trade Minister in Helsinki on 9 June the question of Australian uranium because we have been assured in this country that there is some control over where our uranium goes and that in fact none of it would go to that great terror which afflicts honourable senators opposite us in this chamber, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Uranium supplies 30 per cent of Finland's electricity needs. We have two plants operating with two units in each one, providing a total of 2,000 megawatts. One plant is operated in co-operation with the USSR, the other in co-operation with Sweden. The USSR helps with the waste from the plant it co-operates with, the waste from the other plant is stored provisionally undeground, in a hill. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister went on to say that he was not a technical person and that he could not really answer questions on reprocessing. But talking later to the person in Finland's Department of Foreign Affairs involved with organising the uranium safeguards agreement with Australia, we were told that it was obviously much more convenient for our uranium to be reprocessed in the USSR since, as we were told, it has the facility and obviously is not too far away. When I asked how long the material would be in the USSR, I was told that it might be there for a few months or a few years. That is an indication of the concern that the Finns obviously have in respect of our uranium; but more so it is an indication of the way in which we in Australia have been misled in our internal debates. In concluding my remarks in respect of that allegation, I must reiterate my thanks to all those people involved in making the delegation such a useful one in terms of seeking and obtaining information. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point to which I refer honourable senators appears at pages 32 and 33 of the report. We were able to study the operation of Statoil, the Norwegian petroleum authority, how it operates and how the people of Norway benefit from the natural resources found in their country. I quote one paragraph from page 34 of the report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> All factors taken into consideration, the development of the oil sector has undoubtedly been a great advantage to the Norwegian economy, and has allowed the Government a degree of freedom to formulate its economic policies that has been unattainable in less fortunate countries. </PARA>
<PARA>It is no wonder that they can do this, given the fact that they have an effective taxation rate, somewhere in the vicinity of 80.7 per cent, and 83.4 per cent in respect of oil produced. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I wish to raise before seeking leave to continue my remarks at a later stage is in respect of East Timor. Earlier today a question was asked in this place about Australia's attitude to the problem existing in East Timor and how we can act in the future to assist the East Timorese in their struggle for self-determination and independence. Today I also received an answer from the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. My question related specifically to what action the Australian Government had taken in pursuing the rights of the East Timorese in international forums, including the United Nations General Assembly, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and so on. What distresses me, however, is an article which appears on page 3 of the Melbourne Age this morning, written by Mr Ian Davis. In part, the article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Horta said the Deputy leader of Australia's UN delegation, Mr L. Joseph, had threatened the Vanuatu representative his country would forfeit Australian aid if it failed to vote with Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, if Vanuatu failed to vote with Australia on the East Timor question. </PARA>

I am concerned that Australia is conducting its international affairs on such a low level. I hope that the Government can explain to the Senate some time today, or some time before it rises this year, how it justifies this attempt at international blackmail.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to delay the Senate because we want to vote very quickly on this matter. The Australian Democrats vigorously support this motion by Senator Evans and the Australian Labor Party. I was impressed with the detailed arguments and the arguments of principle put forward by Senator Chaney, but I believe, as I said before, that there is a massive principle at stake here, namely, the Executive or the Cabinet versus the Parliament. If the Parliament is not allowed to see certain documents which have assumed mammoth proportions in importance, for no good reason given by the Government as far as we are concerned, then we will press for a resolution for the production of those documents, properly sanitised -I do not like that word but it is appropriate in the circumstances-in the Parliament. As I said in my speech on the tax recoupment legislation, I am not persuaded that there were not grounds for prosecution of these tax cheats without retrospective legislation. I believe that the production of these documents might well throw light on just that question. I do not know whether that is one of the reasons the Government is hesitant of producing them, but if it is, that reason ought to be exposed. We vigorously support the inititive taken by Senator Evans and the Labor Party and we commend Senator Evans for the personal work that he has done in relation to this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this is an unnecessary motion. We have, as a Parliament, set up an elaborate system for the release of government documents under the Freedom of Information Act which comes into effect next Wednesday. That Act defines what sorts of documents should be released in the public interest and what sorts of documents should not be released in the public interest. Senator Evans, the mover of this motion, played a considerable role in the preparation of the rules for the Freedom of Information Act. Further, that Act provides arrangements by which documents may be sanitised, as is proposed by this motion and, if they are still comprehensible, they could then be released. Further, it provides an appeals procedure to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal , if anyone has applied for documents and the Government has refused to provide them. That issue, raised by Senator Chipp, is the proper relationship between this Parliament and the Executive. One of the great beneficiaries under the Freedom of Information Act will in fact be members of Parliament. I think it would be sensible and appropriate for Senator Evans to apply next Wednesday for the documents he has asked for under the Freedom of Information Act. If they are as described, they would clearly be exempt documents though it might be possible to sanitise them, to use that expression. If Senator Evans is disgruntled by the Government decision, he could appeal under the Freedom of Information Act to the properly constituted and competent Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a resolution of the dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -No doubt Senator Evans will deal very briefly with the additional point raised by Senator Hamer. I only caught the tail end of what he said as I was walking into the chamber. I wish to deal very briefly with a matter which was raised by Senator Missen and one that was raised by Senator Chaney. Let me make it clear at the outset that I am supporting this proposition. I cannot see what all the argument is about. Why is there hesitancy on the part of the Government to agree to this provision? After all, the Government's first objection to it was that it could inhibit satisfactory prosecutions or the proper course of justice. I suggested that there ought to be some person qualified in the law to sanitise the documents appropriately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chaney now states that one of the problems with the documents under discussion is that it would not be appropriate to table them even if they were sanitised. On 14 October, he made a statement which I accept. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> While the Solicitor-General has advised that some of the documents in question could with sanitising and editing be tabled under the test in the resolution, he has further advised that other documents could not be tabled even under that test. Also, I have confirmed personally with the Solicitor-General that he is still of the opinion that in the case of all the documents he previously examined their tabling would be harmful to the administration of justice in the sense I referred to at the opening of this statement. </PARA>
<PARA>I accept that statement that was made by Senator Chaney on 14 October. Senator Missen then suggested that the judge concerned, presumably having been away from the area of prosecution and judicial functions for some considerable time, would not be the appropriate person to do this. However, we should consider the motion before the Senate. The motion requests Sir John Minogue to edit such papers after appropriate consultation with the Solicitor-General and the Crown Solicitor. Therefore, with reference to the papers and background information spoken of by Senator Missen, surely the Solicitor-General and the Crown Solicitor will provide such information to Sir John Minogue. That is what is suggested in the motion. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, for the life of me, I cannot see any reason why the Senate does not just adopt this motion without any further delay. If I were one of those senators on the Government side who, in opposition to the recoupment tax Bills, said that the Government ought to have been engaged in prosecutions all along the line and that those Bills were not necessary, I would feel that it would be important, in order to confirm my opinion, to have the benefit of the advice that is no doubt in the papers that are as yet to be tabled. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank all honourable senators for their contribution to the debate. I am indebted in particular to two of them. I mention first Senator Hamer for his suggestion about the use of freedom of information legislation as an appropriate line of weaponry in this matter. I must confess that I had almost forgotten about freedom of information legislation, its having taken so long to come into force and effect. But, I think that even Senator Hamer would concede that none of us has hitherto regarded the Freedom of Information Act as being the appropriate first port of call for a parliament intent on exposing the Executive to scrutiny in an area of manifest or likely maladministration. I would not have thought that that was an appropriate first line of action at all, although certainly it is a possible course of action which we do not overlook as a line of last resort in the event that this more direct approach proves ultimately unsuccessful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am indebted, secondly, to Senator Harradine largely for the very succinct way in which he exposed some of the travesties of the arguments of first Senator Chaney and then Senator Missen. Senator Chaney has adopted a much more absolutist position today than he did even on 14 October when he was prepared to acknowledge that the Solicitor-General himself conceded that, with appropriate sanitising and editing, a number of the documents in question could be tabled under the test in this resolution. I am further indebted to Senator Harradine for pointing out the way in which both Senator Missen and Senator Chaney have resolutely ignored the terms of the resolution insofar as it provides firstly for consultation and secondly for a series of filters or tests to be applied which will manifestly ensure that neither the pending proceedings nor the administration of justice will be in any way prejudiced by the ultimate tabling of these documents. I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That, unless otherwise ordered, the Senate, at its rising on Thursday, 25 November 1982, adjourn till Tuesday, 7 December 1982, at 1.45 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind honourable senators that by tonight the Senate will have sat for three weeks in a row. In the normal sequence, after a three-week sitting, the Senate rises for a week. Notwithstanding that, in normal circumstances the Senate should have finished its business this week. But I advised the Senate several days ago that because of the likely outcome of the forthcoming Premiers Conference requiring legislation, members of the House of Representatives were being notified that the other place would resume on 8 December; that therefore the Senate would have to sit certainly during the week of the Conference and possibly the following week. I repeat that the Senate will find it necessary to sit certainly the week of 8 December and possibly in the week commencing 14 December. That being so, a decision requiring the Senate to sit next week, will inevitably result in the Senate sitting for six consecutive weeks. I make it abundantly clear that that is so. Therefore, all common sense indicates that my motion should be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA> I make two points because I understand that the motion will be opposed. I have asked officers in the Records and Table Office to ascertain whether ever in the history of the Senate the prerogative of the Government to determine the pattern of sitting weeks has been challenged. I say this without any heat or qualification so that it is fully understood. The advice that I have received is that it has always been the practice of the Senate-and, I understand, the other place as well-that the determination of what shall be sitting weeks and what shall be recess weeks is the prerogative of the Government. If the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats choose to take that prerogative out of the hands of the Government, they will be deliberately seeking to obstruct the procedures of the Government in a way not seen before. That is a matter for them to judge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand the heat of Senator Chipp's interjection because he, of all people, has pleaded with me that we should always keep to the routine sitting times and that we should have recess weeks at regular intervals to ensure the health of honourable senators. Let Senator Chipp not intervene on this subject because he has made it abundantly clear that the Democrats stand for the routine sitting of the Senate. Indeed, the health of senators would demand that we would have a cyclical recess week. Opposition senators, for some strange reason, believe that they can benefit by sitting during the week of the Flinders by-election. The Opposition may enjoy breaking the long-established practice of the Senate, but it will gain no advantage by doing so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I repeat that the Government intends that the Senate resume in the week in which the House of Representatives resumes. That means that it is likely to sit during the following week also. If the Opposition with its co-partners, the Democrats, decides to compel the Senate to sit next week it will be deciding to sit for six weeks straight. Be that upon their heads. I say completely objectively that honourable senators opposite should understand that they will be establishing a precedent. That is the advice I have received from officers. They will also be acting against all the pleading and advice of Opposition and Democrat senators who have said that we should not break the rules of the cyclical sittings of the Senate. That having been said, the Government will be entirely unperturbed, except on a question of principle, if we see an attempt to break from tradition and obstruct the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Now and again I take great joy in reading what the Democrats said when they invited electors to vote for them. In many situations they said that the one thing they would not do was to obstruct in any way the business of a government that was properly elected. They said: We have said that we would not wilfully attempt to frustrate or obstruct a government that has won a clear majority of seats. Beyond any doubt at all the Government has won a clear majority of seats. We will now see whether they keep the illegitimates honest. Protocol and the Senate's decision regarding the health of senators-in fact, everything-points to the fact that a government has the right to determine the weekly sittings of a House of the Parliament. That is accepted in parliaments throughout the world. Today, as for weeks, time that should have been government time has been occupied by other business. In due course I will table in the Senate an outline of the present sittings of the Senate. It will show how day by day an attempt has been made to take up so much time that there is virtually no time left for Government Business. Honourable senators should bear that in mind. Let nobody from now on argue that the Democrats and the Opposition are not seeking wilfully to obstruct the business of the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should indicate that the Opposition opposes the motion which has just been moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick). This is the first occasion on which I have discussed with Senator Sir John Carrick, in the context of a debate in the Senate, the proposed sittings for this Budget session. Although the Leader says that he has said something about the program to every honourable senator, this is the first time that any Government spokesman has said anything to me about it. I just want to remind the Leader that he wrote to me on 19 November a letter which I still find quite extraordinary because it contains some gratuitous insults about the integrity of the Opposition and about the behaviour of honourable senators in this place. This letter has, in a sense, become a document of record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In that letter Senator Sir John Carrick stated that the Opposition had broken undertakings about giving the Government its Bills when it wanted them. I just want to put the record quite straight on that point. First of all, we indicated at the time of the Budget that we would give the Government the Bills which it specified by the end of October. We carried out that undertaking completely except in respect of one set of Bills-those dealing with taxation recoupment. We did not carry out that undertaking in respect of those Bills because they were not even introduced into the Senate before the end of October. The Leader of the Government talked about delays in programs. I should point out that 16 speakers from the Government side and 7 speakers from the non-government side spoke on those Bills when they were debated in the Senate. Those Bills were not introduced into the Senate in accordance with the Government's program because Government members could not agree about them when they were before the House of Representatives. They could not agree even when the Bills came into the Senate. We had these hours and hours of delay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator. There was an election in 1980-1979 is the full year before. If Senator Missen, or anybody else in this place, can set an arbitrary and subjectively selected number of hours in which the Appropriation Bills can be disposed of, I do not think that would be in accordance with the standards that he normally espouses, as I understand it, as a parliamentarian. As I have said, there is no communication on this question of sitting hours other than the letter from Senator Sir John Carrick which, if I may so, was ill informed as to the facts, to say the least.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Included with the letter that I received was a suggested program for the Senate for the remainder of the sitting. That suggested program contained a subjective categorisation of Bills which were for significant debate, Bills for brief debate and Bills for passage if time permitted. Included in Bills for passage if time permitted were Bills which were introduced into the House of Representatives in a rush in August as being the priority Bills in the Government's legislative program. They have now been relegated to the category of Bills for passage if time permits. </PARA>
<PARA> We agree that the Senate has a quite heavy legislative program to deal with and if the Government asks us for undertakings about the passage of legislation we will meet any undertakings which we give. We will attempt to meet the Government in respect of those issues. Some time ago allegations of delays in the Senate program led us to look at the question of when the Senate should appropriately sit to deal with an important legislative program. We are concerned that the Senate should sit next week, as we have indicated in a number of statements in the past few weeks. I find it extraordinary that Senator Sir John Carrick comes in here and says that the Opposition parties are taking away the Government's prerogative in terms of when the Parliament sits. No person knows better than Senator Sir John Carrick in this place how an Opposition majority can take away a government's prerogative. On a unique occasion in 1975 all honourable senators opposite participated in that. They took away a government's prerogative in 1975 .

Do they then want to wait until the end of that week and deal with legislation? We are told that we should come back that week to deal with legislation that the House of Representatives will have just dealt with. Do honourable senators want to come back here and sit on Friday and Saturday to deal with that legislation or do they want us to deal with it on the same day as it is dealt with by the House of Representatives?

<PARA>Dear Senator Button,</PARA>
<PARA>COMPLETION OF LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME</PARA>
<PARA> May I refer to the legislative programme for the remainder of this session. </PARA>
<PARA> Attached is a list showing the outstanding legislation and indicating those Bills which may be regarded as requiring some significant debate. The others, as in past sessions, might well be completed in a very short time. </PARA>
<PARA> It has always been envisaged that the Budget session would end on Thursday 25 November. It has always been possible, with goodwill and co-operation, for the programme to be achieved comfortably in that time without detriment to effective debate. It still remains so. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in spite of Opposition statements some three weeks ago that the Appropriation and other Budget-related Bills would be dealt with expeditiously, the plain fact is that the Appropriation Bills still remain unfinished. And this is so even though six full sitting days (the equivalent of two weeks of sittings ) have been allocated wholly to the Appropriations without the intrusion of other government business and with very little intervention in the debates by government speakers. </PARA>
<PARA> The broadcast debates of the last week have attracted adverse public comment and have done no credit to the Senate. The debate has been almost entirely a repetition of the Estimates Committees hearings. The generally poor standard of the debate, which has been monopolised by a handful of Senators to the detriment of the Senate, has also been the subject of public reaction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party when in office had frequent recourse to the application of gags in the Senate. On the other hand, my government, even during the period of its majority control, was reluctant to do so and remains in that attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that Opposition Whips have suggested that the Government should place time limits on the debates on individual Bills. If this implies the application of a gag, we would be reluctant to do so. I am not aware of the Opposition attitude to gags. </PARA>
<PARA> In past sessions effective arrangements have been made between the Whips to isolate those Bills which, by agreement, can be passed quickly and with virtually no debate because of consensus. The remaining Bills, which would be few in number, would then be allocated set times with an agreement that individual speakers would limit their speaking times. </PARA>
<PARA> If this is done, the Senate can comfortably complete its programme by the end of next week. There is absolutely no need to commit the taxpayers to the unnecessary expenditure of additional sittings. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of this, may I ask for your co-operation in the detailing of the attached list into an effective time schedule for completion at the latest by Friday 26 November. </PARA>

<PARA>19 November 1982</PARA>
<PARA>Senator the Honourable Sir John Carrick, KCMG</PARA>
<PARA>Leader of the Government in the Senate,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra, A.C.T. 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Carrick,</PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge receipt of your letter of 19 November relating to the Senate's legislative programme. </PARA>
<PARA> Enclosed with your letter is a suggested programme which you envisage might be completed by Thursday 25 November. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to comment in detail on that programme at this stage. I would point out that it is the second occasion in this session on which you have provided me with a proposed programme in a letter criticising the Opposition directly or by implication for alleged delays in the programme of the Government . </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated in the Senate earlier this week, the Opposition's position is that it is prepared to co-operate as much as possible within the normal Senate sitting hours until the programme is completed. That is still our position. </PARA>
<PARA> Might I recall that you wrote to me on 11 October suggesting a change to Senate sitting hours and expressing concern about the passage of ''Budget related legislation which the Government needed before the end of October''. </PARA>
<PARA> No changes were made to the sitting hours but I undertook in a letter dated 12 October to ensure that the legislation that you identified as necessary to be passed before the end of October was so passed. </PARA>
<PARA> This was done with the exception of the bottom-of-the-harbour bills which were not introduced into the Senate until 9 November. The fact that the bottom-of-the -harbour legislation was not introduced until 9 November and debated until this week is due entirely to government dithering over contents of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth paragraph of your letter which alleges that there were opposition statements ''some three weeks ago'' to the effect that the Appropriation and other related bills would be dealt with expeditiously is quite incorrect. You are confusing that with the undertaking I gave in my letter of 12 October relating to urgent legislation. In the programme accompanying your letter of 11 October the Appropriation Bills were not even scheduled for introduction until some time in November. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that many senators will resent the gratuitous comments in the fifth paragraph of your letter suggesting adverse public comment about the debate of the Appropriation Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not retreat from the proposition that the Senate broadcasts could be improved by a better standard of debate. I find this comment strange, however, coming as it does from a Minister of a government which has consistently put on standing orders debates on Wednesday afternoons when the Senate is being broadcast. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of the complaints made in your letter about the Appropriation Bills I draw your attention to the fact that the total time devoted to debating the Appropriation Bills this year was 17 hours 49 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year the time spent on debating the Appropriation Bills was 20 hours 57 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> The time taken this year is by no means abnormal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Appropriation Bills normally pass the Senate at this time in November. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the proposed legislative programme I would like to make the following comments:</PARA>
<PARA>1. The judgments which have been made as to which Bills require significant debate and/or ''brief debate'' are extremely subjective. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund Bill, of which the Government has made so much, should be the subject of significant debate. It provides for a new tax on fuel for road works and is subject to substantial criticism as to whether the revenue gained by this Bill will be in any way sufficient to meet the Government's claims in respect of road works which it will allegedly finance. </PARA>
<PARA>2. Similarly the Broadcasting and Television Bills involve a considerable departure from existing practice in the broadcasting system and are of vital interest to rural communities throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>3. It is an extraordinary example of the government's priorities that the Omega Navigation Facility Bill and the Defence (Visiting Warships) Bill should be regarded as Bills for passage ''if time permits''. </PARA>
<PARA> In June and July of this year the Prime Minister was describing the Defence ( Visiting Warships) Bill as the first priority of the Government's legislative programme after the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> At that stage, the Government clearly regarded the legislation as potentially divisive in the community and for that reason it became a priority. </PARA>
<PARA> It has now been reduced to a Bill of apparent unimportance. </PARA>
<PARA> Similar comments could be made about the Omega Navigation Facility Bill. In respect of this Bill the Prime Minister said that the passage of this legislation was a question of ''national credibility''. </PARA>
<PARA> Might I suggest that the best solution to the problem raised in your letter is for the Whips to confer about an orderly programme within normal sitting hours until such time as the legislative programme for the Budget sittings is completed. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the sitting times available, the Opposition will cooperate. This is all we can undertake to do because we are continually subjected to changes of government legislative plans and priorities, which have been illustrated quite clearly in your letters to me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats oppose the Government's motion. I think it is odd in a way that the question of obstruction of Senate business has been raised when in fact the Opposition parties are seeking to meet to debate Government business. It is indeed rather interesting to note that if one looks at the average number of days the Senate has sat in the last 11 years one will find that it is 71 days a year. Indeed, if one goes back to the first 10 years of Federation one finds that the average number of days on which the Senate sat was 71 days a year. As of now we have sat 64 days this year. That is the reason why in fact the Government's legislative program is not finished. If we sat every day to 16 December we would sit only 73 days this year. So it could hardly be said that we are not allowing the Government to get its business through if in fact the Government does not wish the Senate to sit to discuss its business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite clearly, what we have in broad terms is the situation that the fixed amount of work that the Senate has to do, quite apart from dealing with Government legislation, is increasing every year. Let us examine the number of reports presented by Senate committees, work undertaken by honourable senators in this place. In 1980 there were 61 such reports; in 1981, 70 reports; and in 1982 so far there have been 94 reports. If Senate committees are to meet then presumably the Senate will have to discuss their reports. Every year more and more papers are coming into this place and we have to discuss them. Last year, for example, there were no royal commissions. This year we dealt with five reports from royal commissions. At some stage I think the Senate has to look at the amount of time for which it actually meets. There was an interjection earlier that other people in this country have to work 48 weeks or 50 weeks a year. We are elected to work and it is not necessarily an easy task. The Senate will have to face up to the fact that it will have to meet, as do other legislatures around the world, for more and more weeks a year no doubt just to get through the business. At some stage we will have to come to grips with the notion that the Senate will have to meet more frequently. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sir John Carrick raised a number of points about precedents which I think the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button) has already answered. There are plenty of precedents where non-government majorities-after all, for 34 years of the 82 years since Federation the government has not had a majority in this place-have taken control of procedures in the Senate. For example, they have decided not to sit certain hours, not to sit extra days or even on celebrated occasions, such as events which occurred in 1967 and 1975, to recall the Senate during a recess for a special sitting. If that is not setting a precedent, I do not know what is. Yet, Senator Sir John Carrick came in here and talked about precedents. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been in this place for only a short period and the Leader of the Government in the Senate during all that time has been Senator Sir John Carrick. One of the things I have heard constantly from people who have been here a long time is that the previous Leader of the Government would not have been in this situation. That has been told to me by people all around the place. I can only relay it for what it is worth. From my observations of what has gone on in this place I think it is worth a lot. Indeed, we have a situation in which no group controls the Parliament. If this Senate is to operate efficiently there has to be co-operation between all groups in the Senate. Nothing else will work. Unless people co-operate about sitting times, speaking lists and which Bills will be debated nothing much can happen. There have been attempts to impose co-operation by majority votes, one way or the other. It does not work and the Government knows that it does not work. </PARA>
<PARA> Already it is Thursday, 25 November, and we are behind in debating the following Bills: Asian Development Fund Bill 1982, the five taxation Bills, the Bounty (Berry Fruits) Bill 1982, the unpaid company tax Bills-there are five of those-the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1982, the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Amendment Bill 1982 and the bank account debit Bills . We need extra time merely to clean up what is already on the Notice Paper. I believe that the Senate ought to meet to clean up those Bills so that when the Senate meets next session, in 1983, it will be able to discuss the new Bills that the Government will bring forward rather than deal with a large number of Bills left over from this year. </PARA>

Should any honourable senator collapse in the next few weeks, the responsibility will lie very much on their heads. They are doing this for petty political gain-some advantage from the proceedings of the Senate being broadcast during the week before a by-election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me speak briefly about what Senator Button in his meandering way said in an attempt to suggest that the Opposition had been disposing of Government business . 'Disposing' might be a good word for it because, judging from the way in which Government business has been dealt with, it has been dying of inaction. He said that the debate on the Appropriation Bills had not been quite as long as it was last year. Year after year the debate consists of tedious repetition. we have a system of Estimates committees, yet the gasbags of the Senate such as Senator McLaren, who are here at the expense of the people, must go back over every little issue and every little triumph they had in the Estimates committees and regurgitate the whole thing for the benefit of the public. Of course, the members of the public are not concerned with these issues. The Appropriation Bills are Government business and the debate on them was drawn out to a tedious length. The Government put everything else aside to enable those matters to come forward. All Opposition senators, one after another, were determined to repeat everything they had said before. They do not have a new idea; they have to say everything three times because then it might sound impressive. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button got away from the subject and suggested that the Opposition had not been obstructive. Senator Macklin's speech was in the same irrelevant vein, because he told us that 94 reports had been brought down this year. I tell him that the number of reports brought down in the Senate has been declining. I refer to the important reports-those of standing committees. Senator Macklin added to the list 16 or 17 traditional or ordinary reports, including those from my Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. Senator Archer's Publications Committee produces a report every week or so, which is an ordinary action. This argument about the number of reports brought down is a lot of nonsense. The Senate and its members are not producing the amount of work which might be produced. There is certainly a need for more genuine work to be done in committees and in this chamber, without the tedious repetition of debates on matters of public importance. We have those debates on the same subjects day after day and week after week because of the precious belief of some Opposition members that the great public out there will be listening to them and will be impressed by the repetition of their tedious ideas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think they may be making an impression, but they may not realise its effect. If they read the gallup polls they may get some idea of why their popularity is going in a curious direction at present after all the talk that has gone on. We have agreed upon sitting periods of three weeks followed by a week off. That has been traditional. I believe I speak on behalf of many Government back benchers when I say that they believe they have many duties outside this chamber. I would have thought that even Opposition senators who want to campaign in the by-election could not expect to attract the attention of one little bit of Victoria by the proceedings of the Senate being on the air for the whole of next week. They would be better advised to go into the streets and by-ways of Frankston to find out what the people are thinking and to impress them with the charm of their personalities and their ideas rather than to use the free airwaves to persecute the people of Australia, particularly the electors of Flinders. That is what this debate is about. Opposition senators have been sneeringly clever about this for some time. If they can defeat the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) and take the matter out of the hands of the Government, they will say: 'We will make the Government sit on the eve of the by-election. We will enjoy the benefits of being able to argue political matters all that week'. They will not be considering Government business; they will be doing what they want. They will be boring silly the electors of the whole of Australia. That is only one aspect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Has anyone considered for one moment the cost of keeping this building open for one chamber to sit for one week, with all the facilities involved? I hope that someone will do some research. I hope that one of our investigative journalists will look at the cost that these people cause the country by having all the services available for their benefit during the week while the other chamber is not meeting and while we engage in a tuppence of damn nonsense and achieve the passage of no legislation. What does it cost the country to keep this chamber here? It is an important amount. We ought to consider the cost of the humbug that we have heard today to the people of Australia. All this debate is about is some absolutely mistaken idea by the Opposition that the few unfortunate people who are listening to Parliament-I say 'unfortunate' because the standard of debate in this chamber is not good-will be influenced in their voting patterns, particularly the few people in one part of Victoria. I believe the people there will resent the greedy attitude of those opposite, particularly the Democrats. People do not send money to support them; so they think they will use the public purse as a free way to get to the public during that week. That is what this is all about. That is why they desire to take control out of the Government's hands . That is why they are trying to wreck the pattern of sittings to require six weeks of sittings, thus endangering the health of honourable senators. I hope that Senator Harradine will reconsider his attitude on this matter. I believe that what is proposed by the Opposition is destructive, is humbug and is unnecessary. I believe the Government's motion should be supported. </PARA>

I hope that the honourable senator will withdraw his suggestion. If the Senate meets next week it will do so in opposition to the wish of the majority of the Senate. The Opposition and the Australian Democrats do not have the majority in this place. So what they are doing is to block the sort of motion normally moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) in the third week of every sitting period. So in effect if the Senate sits next week it will not be because that is the wish of the majority of the Senate. Therefore, the statement made by Senator Button about the Parliament controlling itself is so much humbug. Under this circumstance the Parliament is not controlling itself because if the Senate sits next week it will do so against the wish of the majority of the Senate. I wrote down what Senator Button said. He said that some time ago the Australian Labor Party decided that the Senate would be sitting next week and that the Senate ought to sit next week. If it decided that some time ago, it kept it to itself. It told nobody else, apart from the Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>

It will cost the country more to have us come back next week when, in fact, the Bills that are before us can be dealt with within a period of two weeks. What we are going to do is to sit for three weeks to do that. That figures. Somebody said to me the other day: 'Oh, you are sitting an extra week so that means you will get two weeks behind in your work'. That is what appears to be the case. It is par for the course. I suggest that we have a look at the reason for this proposition to sit next week. The onus is now on the Democrats, who say that they are prepared to sit for six weeks straight until 16 December. I wonder whether that fits suitably with the statements that have been made from time to time by the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Chipp) in this place about the effect that that has on the health-I quote his words-and 'the tension' in this place. It will certainly make interesting broadcasting to hear debate in the last week of that six week session. It will be interesting to see how much business we get through and how much entertainment the public of Australia get just prior to Christmas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I very much oppose this proposition to sit next week for the reason that the Parliament should not meet unless it receives the majority support of all senators. I have other things to do in the electorate next week. Arrangements have been made for a large number of people to see me. I do not know whether they are looking forward to it. If we are sitting next week it will be simply a political stunt. I am not prepared to go along with that political stunt at the cost of honourable senators' health, at the cost to the taxpayer. I urge all senators and particularly the Democrats, if they are going to stick to the statements that they have made previously, to support the normal procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally-I want to make it perfectly clear-I must say that there were to be a number of Bills discussed the week after next. I thought that I would have had time to consider in detail the amendment that the Opposition was proposing to one Bill. That Bill will, no doubt, come up next week.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question which arises in relation to clause 5, which I do not believe was adequately canvassed or dealt with last time around, goes to the philosophy behind clause 5 (7) (c) (ii) which was the subject of some previous discussion. This is the provision which states that, for the purpose of determining the base amount of company tax liability for which the vendors and others are to be liable under this legislation, in a situation where one is looking to the amount of that liability immediately before the last sale time-in other words before the company in question was sold to the promoters and stripped and dumped-the company tax liability is to be assessed by reference to what might reasonably have been expected to become payable by the company during the financial year in question, not by reference to what actually did become payable by the company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This has been construed by the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle)-it has been the subject already of some discussion-as clearly establishing that the recoupment legislation will not apply where there was a pre-sale avoidance scheme which proved ultimately to be unsuccessful. </PARA>
<PARA> The question which arises-I acknowledge that this is not a recent invention in the Bill; it was there from the outset as the Minister told us last time around- is: What is the justification in principle for calculating the primary liability in this way? Why should a vendor get the benefit of a reduction in his tax liability by virtue of a scheme which proves to be unsuccessful when he sells the company to a promoter who then goes ahead and strips and dumps it and yet does not get the benefit of that unsuccessful scheme if he in fact hangs on to the company for the duration of the financial year in question and does not sell it to a bottom-of-the-harbour promoter. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation will put in a better-off position financially someone who sold a company in whatever state of mind to a bottom-of-the-harbour promoter and where that company was actually ultimately stripped. By the way in which this clause is calculated a vendor will be in a better situation than he would be if he had hung on to the company and not had anything to do with Brian Maher and people of his ilk. What is the moral of any other kind of justification for having a clause of that kind?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The provisions of the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill in this clause set out the method of determining a company's contingent tax liability which is crucial in ascertaining whether the excess consideration test in sub-clauses (1) and (2) of clause 5 is met. The excess consideration test is the legislative manifestation of the test foreshadowed by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in his announcement on 25 July, when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situations to which the special legislation will relate are those in which the shareholders in a company have together sold their shares in the company for a price that made it evident that company tax on profits that had by then arisen would not be paid. </PARA>
<PARA>The test contained in sub-paragraph 5 (7) (c) (ii) is not new to the Bill. As we have already said, it appeared in the original Bill introduced in the House of Representatives on 23 September. I make that point because I think suggestions were made that in some way it is intended to be the pre-sale counterpart of sub- clause (3) (12). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report of the Senate Standing Committee is similar in wording to the one that we discussed in April; that is, to change the format of presenting petitions to the Parliament. When we were debating the matter on the last occasion, I lodged my objection about it and I think that was the reason this matter went back to the Standing Orders Committee . I am beginning to wonder whether the petitions which I have been presenting here in the last 12 months on behalf of concerned citizens dealing with Mr Anthony's home loan have had some bearing on this recommendation in that the petitions have caused some embarrassment to some people, and that is why the Standing Orders Committee is now recommending--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps in future when we get Standing Orders Committee reports we may get the minutes with them so that we can see who moved what, who seconded it, and what the debate was all about, instead of being in the dark as we are now. As this recommendation will be carried-I shall probably be the only dissenting voice; but I shall still oppose it-I am concerned that we shall be reverting to the same practice as that of the House of Representatives which is that a precis will be made by the Clerks, as they do now, and the precis is not even in the presentation of petitions in the report. The precis made is not always relevant in the wording to the petition which one is presenting. I have presented petitions here in the last few days, and even though the wording of the petition has been altered, the precis that I have got is exactly the same when it refers to 'young couples'. In the last week or so, the petitions that I have presented have contained no reference to 'young couples'. The wording of that petition has been 'Australian couples', who are asking for the same terms with a home loan as have been granted to Mr Anthony. I have had to alter them on every occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We shall not get the opportunity to do that if we are to adopt the practice in use in the other place. I am concerned about the rights of citizens, people whom we represent in this Parliament, being taken away to a certain degree. I have looked at the recommendations. I think it is said that petitions will be referred to respective committees. I serve on two Senate Standing Committees. I find that there is hardly enough time now to do the work of those committees. We have references before the Standing Committee on National Resources and we cannot find time particularly to examine a Bill that has been referred to that Committee on plant variety rights. The time has caught up on us, and we are jammed for time to do that. We have other references at which we ought to be looking. Time is not available to do justice to the work of those committees. That is apart from Estimates committees and various select committees which take up members' time. If the petitions to be presented are to be moved to some committee to be looked at, that will involve more time being taken in committee work. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall not delay the Senate any longer, but I record again my objection to the recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee, which will take away certain rights of citizens. There are other matters in the report to which I have objected in the past and about which recommendations have been made in the Senate and agreed to. One such matter is sitting hours. Every Thursday we are in a mess. When we debated that matter I asked questions about whether the dining room staff and the people who work behind the scenes were consulted, and I was told, 'Yes, they were consulted', but when I ask those concerned I was told that they were never consulted. </PARA>

I do not think the honourable senator consulted them either.

It is not worth while. That is what he said. I just put on record again that I lodge my strong objection to having rights taken away from citizens in relation to presenting petitions to the Senate in the form that has been in evidence ever since the Senate was established. For some reason people on the Standing Orders Committee have decided to change it. I do not know what the reason is, but they seem to think that a lot of time is taken up or wasted in the presentation of petitions. If we went back over the whole period and looked at the matter, I think we would find that less time is taken up in presenting petitions than even what was taken up today in arguing about whether we ought to sit next week or whether we should rise so that Senator Harradine can spend a lot of time in Tasmania talking to constituents. Therefore, I oppose the recommendations of the Standing Orders Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not often that I find myself in a small minority in accord with Senator McLaren, but in this case I agree with him . I shall certainly be voting against this restriction of the people's power. That is what it is. This is not just rhetoric. The people of this country, as indeed people have expected of their parliaments for many centuries, believe that a petition is of some value. Petitions are brought into this Parliament and reiterated, and perhaps carefully chosen for broadcasting time, as with some that I put in last year on lead in petrol. Week after week, those petitions, signed, as they were, by virtually every parents and citizens association in Sydney, had an effect. They were listened to by other people and by the people who produced them. I think they believed, with some right, that purely by the presence of those petitions, purely by the fact that they had brought them in, they had contributed to this country's political life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us face it. We are constantly cutting back the amount of feedback that the ordinary elector can bring to the political process, anyway. Here is a move to cut it back still further and, I suggest, contemptuously, because people will continue to send in petitions on matters about which they feel strongly. If a person is prepared to stand on a hot street all day for a week and collect a thousand signatures, surely that must have some effect in this place. Surely it is worth the few seconds that it takes to get up and express the view of those people. Again, as Senator McLaren has said, many other things are done and said here that could easily be economised on rather than that. </PARA>
<PARA> From time to time we have lengthy speeches. Some honourable senators regularly speak for half an hour in this place when what they have said could easily have been said, and said better, in 10 minutes. Time and time again the time of this place is wasted. I am utterly opposed to a principle which says that we shall decide that, whatever fulminations we feel we must get out of our systems, these are more important than the only form of regular representation that the people of this country have to this Parliament. It will be a sad day indeed if this proposal passes the Senate. I implore honourable senators to think carefully about that. It is not just a matter of our time. It is a matter of the feelings of the people outside who feel themselves represented here and the extent to which they believe they can be involved in what we do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not my intention to speak at length on this subject because it is a matter that has previously been the subject of debate before the Senate. As a result of that debate, the matter was referred back to the Standing Orders Committee of which on this side of the House my colleagues Senator Robertson and Senator Robert Ray and myself, as well as the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button), are members. I say to my friend and colleague Senator McLaren that all of the members of the Opposition who are members of the Standing Orders Committee are signatories to the recommendation that is now the subject of debate in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out that the Committee gave serious and detailed consideration to the resolution of the Senate to ask the Standing Orders Committee to have another look at the matter. The Standing Orders Committee, having had a look at the matter, resolved, as everyone can see, that it should recommend to the Senate the same procedure that it had recommended before. I take argument with my friend Senator Mason from the Australian Democrats that this is an attempt to cut out the right of ordinary citizens of the community to petition the Parliament. Far be it from that; indeed, it is a modernisation of the procedure to give them a real voice in the Parliament of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Mason or other honourable senators read the recommendation, it will be seen that, if the new sessional order is adopted, the President will, as a matter of practice, have a list of all petitions circulated to honourable senators and the text of the petitions referred to the relevant standing committees so that, should those committees wish to inquire into any particular petition, they may seek a reference from the Senate to do so. That has not happened to date. We all know that what has happened to date is that a senator presents a petition to the Parliament. Then he either has the petition read, as is his present entitlement, or he presents it to the Parliament and, instead of the senator reading it, the Clerk notifies the Senate of the receipt of the petition. </PARA>
<PARA> Petitions will still be able to be received by the Senate. The only change in that respect will be that they will all be presented to the Senate by the Clerk. But, as soon as they are presented to the Senate by the Clerk, they will all, as a matter of practice, be referred to the multiplicity of Senate standing committees for consideration by senators who are members of those standing committees. Instead of the petitions that are received by this Parliament being pigeon-holed downstairs and collecting the dust of year after year they will now be the subject of reference to a standing committee. That standing committee, if it desires to inquire further into the matter, can seek a recommendation from the Senate for permission to inquire into and report upon the terms of the petition. </PARA>

As I understand it, the procedure on petitions has not changed at all from the day when petitions were first presented in 1901 when the Parliament first started sitting. Now there is a determination on the part of all members of the Standing Orders Committee to see that the voice of the people has some effect in this Parliament rather than being a signature on a piece of paper that ends up in a pigeon-hole in the table office. I am firmly of the belief that this recommendation of the Senate Standing Orders Committee should be supported at least because it is only for a sessional period-a trial period. I believe the trial period will prove the effectiveness of it. Therefore, I support the recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add very briefly to the comments of my colleague Senator Douglas McClelland on this matter. Initially, I wish to assure Senator McLaren that we had no ulterior motive in bringing forward this proposition. I find it very disturbing that this is the second time that Senator McLaren has attributed ulterior motives to the Senate Standing Orders Committee with respect to some of the propositions which it has put forward. I find it embarrassing to refer to it because of the close personal friendship which I have with Senator McLaren.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me assure him that we do have-as we have on another committee on which I serve with him-harmonious discussions in our Standing Orders Committee meetings. We work very hard. I say that without any sense of-shall we say-conceit. We spend a lot of time considering the various matters referred to us. The Standing Orders Committee meets more often now than it has done in recent years. We attempt to do exactly what the Minister and my colleage mentioned-that is, to try to modernise or to improve the Standing Orders. That is the purpose of the Standing Orders Committee. We do try, as we have done in a number of other areas , to say: 'There have been some suggestions that we ought to look at some improvements'. That is the reason we meet. We came up with a unanimous proposition that we should attempt for a sessional period to handle petitions in a different way. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLaren asked: 'What is the purpose of the proposition?' Quite clearly, it is to save time. We spend up to 45 minutes-in fact more on some occasions-on the presentation of petitions. If we use the word 'save', we have to say: 'Save for what?' What will we do with the time which we will save? The proposition of the Standing Orders Committee is that this time will be spent in debating reports, Government Business, private members' Bills and so on. It does not seem a lot but if we spend 45 minutes twice a week it represents quite a lot of time. It is not only a matter of saving time totally; it is also a matter of not spending 45 minutes on petitions in the early morning or early afternoon which frustrates the work of the day and makes it very difficult for us to get started . </PARA>
<PARA> We know that time is a problem in the Senate. We do find it very difficult to find time to do all the things that have to be done. In the debate just completed, Senator Macklin drew attention to the fact that a lot more work now comes before the Senate. We have to make the most effective use of our time. That is what we are putting forward as a proposition. It is all very well for some to say that the contribution of some members is not an effective use of time. I deny that. Every honourable senator who stands in this place-I have no doubt-prepares his or her work carefully and hopes that his or her contribution to debate in the Senate or in the Committee of the Whole is an effective contribution to the total debate. We must ask: What is the value of the reading of petitions? What purpose is achieved by having 23 or 24 petitions read out? Senator Mason has suggested that this will help the people outside and that--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With all due respect, I doubt very much whether that was the result of the reading of petitions. There was a lot of other activity, including some media coverage, which followed not the petitions-despite what Senator McLaren said-but certain comments which Senator McLaren made in another debate. Senator McLaren does not limit himself to presenting petitions. He tends to spread his interests across the various aspects of work in the Senate and to contribute to the same topic in a number of areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We think that petitions can be more effectively handled if they are handled in the way in which we suggest. I do not have to develop the argument as Senator Douglas McClelland has done to indicate that petitions can be presented and more effectively handled than they are at the moment. I make the point that the change has been made in the House of Representatives. This is basically the way that petitions are handled in the House of Representatives. I have not noticed any diminution of petitions. I have not noticed that people have stopped standing in the hot sun-I believe Senator Mason said that-collecting signatures. They still feel it is effective. I believe that we should adopt that course. I believe we will also find that it is effective. I was quite surprised to find that Senator Mason downgraded his contribution by saying that the only representation that people have in this place is by the presentation of petitions. </PARA>

I am sure I do not very often, and I am sure Senator Mason does not, go through the procedures and say: 'This is a rather gigantic con; the petitions will go down to the basement of Parliament House never to be heard of again'. It has been said that the actual reading out of petitions-it takes 30 to 40 seconds for each petition-once a week is a way for people to get direct and effective representation in this chamber. If that is all it is, it is not worth having.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although my colleagues have done so, I too defend us against Senator McLaren's allegation that maybe we have bowed to pressure from the Deputy Prime Minister ( Mr Anthony) on this matter following his campaign against Mr Anthony. That campaign reminds me of the inspector in Les Miserables. Senator McLaren, through every means possible, has doggedly brought the facts out and finally has achieved a magnificent result. I congratulate him on it. But I agree with Senator Robertson that petitions were not an essential element of that result. It was Senator McLaren's brilliant speeches in the adjournment debate, his magnificent first reading speeches to which, on occasion, I had the pleasure to listen and his very effective questioning on Estimates committees. All those things contributed to it; all those avenues are open to honourable senators. I also say to Sentor McLaren that he has had so many signatures on those petitions that if he continues to produce them here there will be some doubt as to their authenticity because I am sure most Australians have already signed them. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand the honourable senator's interjection. In other words, when this Standing Order was devised there were no standing committees. We have got to the stage where the Standing Orders Committee has reported on the matter of petitions. I agree that a valuable part of that report is the suggestion that the text of petitions be referred to Senate standing committees. However, I too believe that we should be careful about this question of not having petitions read. I think the text of petitions ought to be read. My view is that petitions on the same subject matter and with the same text ought not to be read twice. At the moment, any honourable senator can ask that a petition be read even though a similar petition has been read once already. Most honourable senators, myself included, rarely if ever ask that a petition be read if it has been read already. That is one way of getting it out of the road.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We could streamline the procedure by having the petitions lodged with the Clerk and not requiring an honourable senator to say: 'I present a petition from X number of citizens and I ask that the petition be read'. We could cut all that out and just let the Clerks state that they have a petition from a particular senator signed by so many citizens and read the text. It ought to be read out. In that sense, I wonder whether somebody from the Standing Orders Committee can advise the Senate whether that possibility has been canvassed. I am at a disadvantage in that I am not on the Standing Orders Committee, although I would have liked to be a member of that Committee and also the Select Committee on Parliamentary Appropriations and Staffing. I will have a talk with Senator Mason on that at a later stage. I ask any member of the Standing orders Committee whether that possibility was examined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I lay on the table the two consultants' reports prepared by the McLachlan group for the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania's report on Demand and Supply of Electricity for Tasmania and Other Matters. On Tuesday in this chamber I advised of my dissent to the report of the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania and I now produce the tabling statement to that dissenting report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Fourteen months ago when the reference was set up it was clearly on the issue of the Gordon-below-Franklin dam and the environment issues more than the power requirements. Firstly, the anti-dam argument then set out to question the need for more power in Tasmania within a reasonable time frame and, secondly, that the proposed Gordon-below-Franklin was not as economical as other alternatives. It would be reasonable to infer from this that the Tasmanian Government and the people were considered either incapable of, or irrelevant to, the making of their own decisions on these two fundamental matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Arrangements were made by the Committee to divide the reference into parts, considering under one heading the question of supply and demand and, under the other, matters relating to the environment, land-use and questions of Commonwealth intervention. About two months ago two additional chapters were added, contrary, I believe, to the balance of the document and the clear settlement of the supply-demand issues on which all the other matters hinged. Specifically, chapter 9, which covers archaeolgical matters, appears to me to be totally out of context, as this report makes no mention of any other environmental or land use matters at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The report to follow, which will cover those matters, will be incomplete without that material. Chapter 10 leaves the Committee open to quite justifiable criticism. As raised in the main report, the Committee, having not obtained its own legal opinion, heard not one independent legal witness, or canvassed or discussed any of the range of alternative views on constitutional and other contentious matters, I saw no reason to include such a chapter in the supply- demand area. Again, it will be obviously necessary in the second report where it rightly belongs, and there it will need to be considerably broadened. </PARA>
<PARA> It became the duty of the Committee to obtain evidence to determine whether the decisions of the Tasmanian Government to accept the Hydro-Electric Commission's projections of likely power use were reasonable and acceptable. Although some novel and interesting theories were tested, by any accepted methodology of projection the program of the Tasmanian Government has not been shaken. The determination of future demand can only be a matter of judgment, based on evidence and advice. Advice came from the HEC, Tasmanian industries, industry associations and a Government department as well as from independent people and organisations. The first group all supported the need for a major option; the others did not. The McLachlan group raised all the difficulties of accurate projection but in its bands of forecast covered the HEC estimate on the high end . </PARA>
<PARA> As the Tasmanian Government proposal involves an increased annual industrial use of 1.5 per cent only, as against recent recorded growth of 7 per cent and, as no government has any vested interest in extravagant expenditure, I am not persuaded that there is evidence before the Committee to reject or question that the HEC demand frame is inappropriate. For adequacy and economy the Tasmanian power supply is the envy of every other power authority in Australia. As to alternatives, I agree with the consultant McLachlan that there are only three possibilities of any consequence; namely, hydro-electricity, thermal power and an interstate undersea cable. For the several other interesting alternatives our consultants said on page 9, paragraph 3.8:</PARA>
<PARA> While these technologies are developing, it is not likely that they will have significant, cost competitive, reliable supply available, at least until the late 1990s. Therefore they are not appropriate as a basic or back up option for this study period. </PARA>
<PARA>I could not but agree. Quite significantly the thermal alternative is totally demolished on cost by both McLachlan and Zeidler, without considering the additional disabilities that such a scheme presents. Evidence important to Tasmania was given concerning environmental pollution. McLachlan on page 10, at paragraph 3.11 said:</PARA>
<PARA> Significant increase in capacity of coal fired power stations in Tasmania is an economically risky path to follow, compared with either the cable or the proposed hydro schemes. This path would seem to be costly compared with the other alternatives for Tasmania at present. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite reasonably, on all bases, a coal fired thermal unit is not regarded as an alternative to the present hydro-electric proposal. Our consultants raised hopes on a cable connection, but at the same time included quotations saying on page 31 of their report:</PARA>
<PARA> Sir David Zeidler concluded the cost of generation from a coal-fired thermal station was 2.86 times that of the Gordon-below-Franklin and a cable would be 2. 5 times (that cost). </PARA>
<PARA>The quotation continues:</PARA>
<PARA>In any event, the SECV has advised that firm energy is not available for importation to Tasmania from Victoria, in 'the time scale required to meet load forecasts'. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 11, at paragraph 3.13 McLachlan concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> We-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, McLachlan-</PARA>
<PARA>do not know whether Victoria would welcome a major new customer such as HEC, or whether they would prefer not to have such customers. </PARA>
<PARA>As well, on page 13, paragraph 3.22, McLachlan raises a powerful consideration, when he says:</PARA>
<PARA> Naturally Tasmania must be wary of any proposal which would bring into their power supply, industrial problems which currently they avoid. </PARA>
<PARA>Until all these unresolved matters are put to study and adequately considered, the cable cannot be regarded as a way to fill Tasmania's energy needs. The sociological and economic aspects of undertaking a development which would produce a substantial export of scarce employment has also not been adequately addressed and resolved, and is of great importance to Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, concerning the Gordon- below-Franklin, McLachlan's first conclusion states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Gordon-below-Franklin is a good hydro-electric scheme economically. It can provide 172 MW (av.) extra electric power to the Tasmania grid if used near its capacity more economically than any other hydro or coal-fired thermal options. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 34 McLachlan quotes the HEC, as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Providing proper recognition is given to the depreciating value of money, it can be demonstrated that the Gordon-below-Franklin scheme, would in all probability, be the most economic hydro-electric development ever to be built in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA>I have to regard these statements as being most significant. In spite of this, the Committee's report goes to great length to explain and develop theoretical and academic approaches to the hypothetical development of the proposal under review on the basis for which no examples could be provided, and with which it appears that no similar organisations in Australia agree. In regard to the funding of the dam, neither the witnesses nor the Committee presented a case that was convincing enough to show that the theories are acceptable in practice. Accordingly, I accept the established and accepted basis and do so with the McLachlan comment on page 57, paragraph 16, that:</PARA>
<PARA> It is apparent that there is no uniformly accepted rate for, or method of, assessing the cost of funds invested in Government bodies in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>In many areas the Committee fails to acknowledge the basic rights and responsibilities that the State not only possesses, but also for which it has to be totally responsible. McLachlan again states this very clearly on page 15, paragraph 5, when he says:</PARA>
<PARA> Whatever project and band is accepted, it is then the task of the body responsible for supply, in this instance the HEC of Tasmania, to provide electricity to meet actual demand as it occurs within the forecast band. </PARA>
<PARA>Again on page 26, paragraph 7.4, he reminds us that:</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore the supply authority has to decide on a projection, and make decisions to that projection years before a forecast demand is proven. </PARA>
<PARA>I totally support the fact that in areas where States have the responsibility to determine and provide services, they should do so, and I do not support Federal interference in such matters. The report fails to accept the summary provided by McLachlan on page 14, point 4, which says:</PARA>
<PARA> This statement adequately describes the ingredients of supply of electricity to Tasmania. These ingredients might be summarised as:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) reliability;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) lowest possible cost to the consumer;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) using Tasmania's natural resources (mainly hydro-power);</PARA>
<PARA> (4) providing employment in Tasmania for Tasmanians. </PARA>
<PARA>To go on from there I regret that the Committee gave totally inadequate recognition of this being Tasmania, not just an academic exercise. A variety of issues such as Tasmanian development and industrial policy, its employment situation, consideration of employment and the multiplier effect of suggested actions, or lack of actions, were not handled, and I believed deserved a separate chapter. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I share the disappointment that many will have in this report. The Committee did not consider or resolve the question of the dam; it does suggest that a decision be delayed three years or more. It feeds indecision and uncertainty at a time when State government policy is for action and development . It fails to recognise Tasmania's inherent problems. The physical isolation can be tackled only by endeavouring to maximise its few natural advantages, including the capacity to produce and sell power at attractive rates. It fails to realise that Tasmania's need for employment opportunities for its young people depends on Tasmania being accepted by interstate and overseas entrepreneurs as a place with adequate energy supplies and where opportunities for profitable investment exists. It is totally negative, and right through choses the worst alternative. Adherence to such a philosophy built on the report would make Tasmania's position even relatively worse than it now is. I do regret that the different approaches taken have prevented there being a unanimous decision, but because of the fundamental difference of approach this was not to be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak to the report of the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania rather than to the dissenting opinion just expressed by the Committee's Chairman, Senator Archer. It would not be an understatement to say that this was one of the most eagerly awaited reports that a Senate committee has ever presented. I am pleased and relieved that we have now reported after so many months of work and deliberation. I was naive enough to think that we could have had out an initial report-not as big as the one we have presented-by about last March or April. That did not happen, of course. We had an aim of July, as I remember then, and a definite and even announced date of September. As it happened, it was another two months again before we were able to produce the report. There was a huge amount of work to be done. We certainly could have gone on more thoroughly still but it was important that the report not be delayed any further. In the rush of ensuring that the report came out when it did, it is not as complete as I would have wanted. There was not enough time, for instance, to review its words as carefully as we would have wished. But I support its contents. I hope that interested parties will excuse us for the odd mistakes in words that may appear in the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like particularly to pay a tribute to the Committee staff-the Secretary , Paul Barsdell, the researcher, Pippa Carron, and before her David Nimmo and the staff over at East Block, and before that at the Hotel Canberra and Annette Fischer who operated the word processors and perhaps other unseen people who had the unenviable task of trying to satisfy our demands. They tolerated our reasonable and unreasonable demands very cheerfully. In passing I would also like to congratulate the Australian Government Publishing Service on responding to my suggestion of despatching copies of the report to Tasmania on Tuesday as soon as they were tabled so that they could be sold by the Australian Government Bookshop in Hobart the first thing yesterday morning. I think it is important for this to happen as much as possible so that people are able to obtain copies of important reports promptly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did Mr Gray buy a copy? Do you know?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LF4">Senator COATES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I understand Mr Gray made his comments without having obtained a copy. He may have shelled out to buy a copy but he did not ask me for one. The question of demand, as dealt with in the report, was perhaps the most important aspect. I think as a partial answer to what Senator Archer was saying it is important to emphasise that the price of Gordon-below- Franklin power would be a good price only if it were all to be sold. I think that cannot be emphasised too much. In my view, there is even more spare capacity than we refer to in the report because of a greater than necessary allowance for drought in the system on top of planned and unplanned outages. Even with the Committee's sober assessment of demand projections we conclude in paragraph 11.7:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . that construction of a major option . . . does not have to be commenced for at least three years, while still allowing the upper limit of the forecast of demand to be met. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the words 'while still allowing the upper limit of the forecast of demand to be met'. The whole basis of our response is that there ought to be flexible supply strategy, as we mention in paragraph 11.11. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee decided that a supply strategy which would respond quickly to exigencies but ensure continuity of supply while minimising the risk of having substantial capital tied up in unused generating facilities, is required. </PARA>
<PARA>We went on to say in paragraph 11.12:</PARA>
<PARA> To commence construction of a major option at this time would be inconsistent with that supply strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Archer mentioned, we also referred to the archaeological importance of the area and the legal responsibilities of the Commonwealth. I reject his view that it was unreasonable for us to go into those areas. They were areas that arose during the period of the inquiry and it was quite crucial that we devote our attention to them. We did take as much evidence as we intended to take on the archaeological area and it was possible for us to report on that. Senator Archer referred to the fact that we did not get an independent legal witness. I would like to ask: What is an independent legal witness? Is there such a body in this world? I suggest that there is not. What we did was take evidence from lawyers. It is not as though we had contrary opinions submitted to us on which we did not take oral evidence. The Committee had to conclude that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . nothing has emerged from the inquiry which should persuade the Commonwealth Government from proceeding with the listing which involves the Government in fulfilling its obligations and responsibilities under the provisions of the UNESCO Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall answer one or two other comments made by Senator Archer. It is a pity that his strong remarks came late in the proceedings. I think that the rest of the Committee members would have felt better about the matter if he had expressed as strong a statement as he made in the last few days when we were preparing the earlier chapters of the report. I think he referred to the report as being negative. His dissenting opinion is terribly negative about the comments that the majority made. I wonder why he joined the Committee in the first place and agreed to be its chairman. I think the gist of Senator Archer's response is no different from the sort of response from Tasmania over many years to Bills which seek to implement recommendations regarding hydro-electric power. There is the automatic response from some people that the Tasmanian Parliament should not interfere at all and should not change anything put up by the Hydro- Electric Commission. Senator Archer virtually takes this line and says that if the HEC says it, it must be true. In response to that, I would like to say that if one takes that attitude, why should the Tasmanian Parliament have the ability to pass or not to pass such Bills, and why should a committee of the Parliament have the ability to deal with the matter? If that was his attitude all along, why support the existence of the Committee?</PARA>
<PARA> In the couple of minutes remaining to me I shall make a few responses to the attacks made on me and other members of the Committee by the Premier of Tasmania , Mr Gray. He accused me and Senator Primmer, the other Labor member of the Committee, of taking the attitude we took because we were obliged to support Australian Labor Party policy. He suggested that we were instructed to take the line we took. I find that suggestion most insulting. I can assure him that there was no such instruction and that that sort of caucusing does not happen in respect of any members on any of the parliamentary committees. I am pleased to hear Senator Primmer and other Opposition senators supporting that comment. The members of the Committee bent over backwards to keep an open mind on the issues it dealt with and to make its decision on the evidence as presented and thoroughly dealt with by it. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Gray also made the amazing suggestion that other Liberal members of the Committee apart from Senator Archer-that is, Senator Missen and Senator Hill-did not seek any additional information on the dam from the State Government. I find that remark absolutely amazing, coming from a Premier who refuses even to recognise the existence of the Committee. The Committee wrote to him several times seeking a continuation of the co-operation that had been given by the previous Labor State Government, and he did not deign even to reply to the letters. That meant that we did not hear evidence from the National Parks and Wildlife Service of Tasmania and did not have further detailed information from the Hydro-Electric Commission that would have enabled us to fill out the report a little more. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise my strong support for the recommendations and conclusions of the Committee. I point out that, despite all the huffing and puffing of Mr Gray in Tasmania, if the scheme turned out to be an economic disaster the responsibility would inevitably fall on the Commonwealth. Tasmania would not be able to deal with it. It therefore is a Commonwealth matter and it has every right to be involved. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That discussion leaves me with very little speaking time. The report of the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania amazes me. It is most extraordinary that a group of senators from other States would tell any State that it cannot use its natural resources to expand its economy and to employ its residents at the cheapest possible cost. The area in which hydro- electric power is generated in Tasmania is very similar to the Cooper Basin gas fields of South Australia and the Yallourn Valley of Victoria. Who in this place would accept that we should tell Victoria or South Australia that they have no right to use their natural resources, that we think that those areas should be put on the World Heritage List and that they should not be able to use their natural resources for energy? The report acknowledges that Tasmania will have to build a major power station but, it states, not for three years. The three options given are hydro-electric power, thermal power or a connection with Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a Tasmanian representative in this place I tell the Senate that we are not interested in taking on any of the industrial problems which Victoria has. We already take on those industrial problems on the wharves. When there are strikes on the wharves in Victoria, Tasmania is denied its shipping across Bass Strait. We do not want to take on any of the industrial problems connected with Victoria 's coal. It has already been stated by Senator Archer that thermal power would be far more costly. I can assure Senator Coates that if he goes to the Fingal Valley he will be assured by the Fingal Valley residents that they are not interested in having a thermal power station to pollute their beautiful valley. Tasmania has no pollution of this kind at the moment and we have no intention of having it introduced to our beautiful island. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee stated that it cannot possibly establish what the costs per unit of electricity would be. However, its adviser established the costs rather conclusively, but the Committee felt that it did not like to take that angle and said that it could not come down with any method of establishing a cost per unit . Water has no increasing costs; coal has and certainly the Victorian connection would have vastly increasing costs as time goes by. To date Tasmania has the cheapest electricity in the country. I have before me a table setting out electricity consumption and income in 1980-81 in the States. I seek leave to have this table incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I know that the Senate will move in a moment from the truncated debate on the report of the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania to debate the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill which is seen, particularly by the Australian Democrats, as being a desirable method of ensuring the enforcement of the recommendations by the Committee. I support the majority decision. I will not be present during the debate and I merely want to say that if I were here I would vote for the Bill. I am not paired against the Bill. I believe that the Bill is somewhat defective but, with repair, could be used by the Government if it saw fit. That is a decision that must be made by the Government and there are other methods that can be adopted. Senator Hill will be outlining other methods. In general I understand the point of view that he will be raising. I think he would like to see the Bill deferred because the House of Representatives will not resume until 8 December and no action will take place until then. I think we are rushing this matter on to the Government and others who have not had a chance to read the report.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to open the debate by saying that the Opposition will support the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill proposed by Senator Mason, with amendments by the Australian Labor Party. This Bill represents an attempt to implement in Australia the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. That Convention was ratified by Australia in 1974 and came into force on 17 December 1975. Honourable senators may be aware that Australia has already nominated five areas to be placed on the World Heritage List established by the Convention. The most recent nomination is that of the South West Tasmanian region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Federal Australian Labor Party supported the decision of the Fraser Government to nominate this area for inclusion on the World Heritage List. We believe very strongly that a bipartisan approach to the protection of our natural heritage must be pursued if such protective measures are to be effective . We are prepared to adopt a bipartisan approach. We have in this particular case and we hope and expect that the Fraser Government will reciprocate by passing this Bill in both Houses of Parliament. I should point out that any lesser action than the passage of this Bill would seriously undermine the Fraser Government's national and international credibility in this important area. It must be made clear at this stage of the debate that the passage of this Bill would effectively prevent the Gordon below Franklin dam. That is the position which the Australian Labor Party is supporting today. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I comment on the specific provisions of the Bill and explain the purpose of the Opposition's amendments, which I understand will be accepted by Senator Mason, I should like to make some comments about the South West Tasmanian region and the responsibilities of the Commonwealth Government to protect this region. The South West Tasmanian region ranks in environmental significance with the Great Barrier Reef, Ayers Rock and Kakadu National Park. It is one of the few temperate wilderness regions left on earth. The importance of the region has been demonstrated by its listing on the National Estate and its nomination by the Fraser Government, as I have said, for World Heritage listing. Evidence given to the recent inquiry by the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania supports and reinforces these decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Committee's main task was to examine the demand for power in Tasmania and to form a supply strategy for meeting that demand. I am aware that the Senate has recently concluded a debate arising from the presentation of the Committee's report. But as well as considering the power situation in Tasmania, the Senate Committee received and considered a great deal of evidence concerning the environmental importance of the area and the Committee considered that that information warranted the inclusion of that area on the national and international registers. In paragraph 11.17 of the report the Committee points out that such an assessment of the importance of the area is warranted by the evidence submitted. The Committee concluded that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . nothing has emerged from the inquiry which would persuade the Commonwealth Government from proceeding with the listing which involves the Government in fulfilling its obligations and responsibilities under the provisions of the UNESCO Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.</PARA>
<PARA>There is an additional and I think enormously important environmental reason why this region must be protected. I refer to the existence within the region of archeological sites of amazing and, as yet, not fully understood importance to our understanding of the history of the human race. In reading the evidence given to the Senate Committee, I found that some of the most compelling evidence was that presented by Dr Rhys Jones of the department of pre-history at the Australian National University. Dr Rhys Jones, as honourable senators are no doubt aware, is a scholar of national and international repute who has specialised in Aboriginal pre-history. I must say that it is unfortunate that the information now available to us through the work of Dr Rhys Jones and also through that of his colleague, Professor Mulvaney, concerning the archeological importance of the caves in the lower Franklin region, was not available to the Tasmanian Government when the dam was first proposed some years ago-in 1979 I believe. I cannot believe that matters would have developed in the unfortunate way that they have if this archeological evidence had been available then. However, it is available now and it does create a new and very heavy responsibility on the Commonwealth Government to protect the archeological sites . I should like to quote briefly from an article by Dr Jones. Describing the Fraser cave in the Franklin region, Dr Jones writes:</PARA>
<PARA> A small pilot excavation into a bank of deposit on the site of the entrance chamber showed that this site is one of the richest ever found in Australia. Altogether out of less than a cubic metre of deposit some 80,000 stone flakes and tools and an equal number of animal bone fragments were recovered. </PARA>
<PARA>He further states:</PARA>
<PARA> Radio carbon dates now being done on these show them again to date from the period of about 16-18,000 years old. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of their age the richness and nature of their evidence for hunters living in the last ice age tundra conditions, the limestone caves of the Franklin can be compared with some of the classic Dordogne in France. They are part of the cultural heritage of mankind. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that final statement by Dr Jones makes it very clear to all of us what our collective responsibility to protect the region really amounts to. We are not talking about an area of parochial interest, we are not talking about a States rights matter, we are not indeed even talking about a national issue; we are talking about an area which is part of the cultural heritage of mankind, as Dr Rhys Jones has so clearly stated. </PARA>
<PARA> A more extensive account of the importance of these sites and the length of time that will be required by scholars to investigate them and to benefit from the information they contain can be found in the transcripts of the evidence given to the Committee. I do not have time to draw the Senate's attention to those matters now. But I point out that the assessments of Dr Jones and Professor Mulvaney have been endorsed by many other scholars throughout the world. For example, a report in the Canberra Times of 7 September refers to 24 of the world's leading archaeologists and anthropologists who had written to the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, opposing the planned hydro-scheme dam on the Franklin River in South West Tasmania. Amongst the international scholars who were named are Professor W. Howell, an anthropologist from Harvard University, Professor Grahame Clark, from Cambridge University, Mr Derek Rowe, a research director at Oxford University and Cambridge archaeology lecturer Mr Paul Melars and several others. Again, in the report in the Age of 27 September we are told that prominent British zoologist, Mr David Attenborough, and botanist, Mr David Bellamy, have asked Mr Fraser to use any powers available to preserve the region . We can only endorse that urging of those scholars at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Without trying to accommodate and discuss at this point the nature of the evidence that is available as to the significance of this site, I simply state this: In line with the Federal Australian Labor Party commitment to Aboriginal Australia we insist on the protection of these sites. Of course, that means that the dam must not be built. Clearly, both in wilderness terms and in terms of archaeological significance, the region must be protected. Over and above the force of these arguments are the legal and constitutional responsibilities which I believe have now devolved on the Commonwealth Government. There can be no doubt that the Commonwealth Government, by being a signatory to the International Convention and through its own decision to place the region on the World Heritage List, has created for itself a legal as well as a moral obligation to act. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware, the Federal Australian Labor Party is aware, of the controversial nature of this discussion of the Commonwealth's role within the State of Tasmania. We are sympathetic to the difficulties being faced by Tasmanians but we also recognise that the Commonwealth has specific and overriding powers and responsibilities in some matters of national and international significance. The South West region of Tasmania is not simply a part of Tasmania; it is a part of Australia and comes legally within the environmental responsibilities of the Commonwealth Government as a result of international instruments. The opinion from the Attorney-General's Department of 1 July 1982 on this matter has already been tabled in the House of Representatives. This opinion confirms the view I have just outlined. The Senate Committee concluded that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Commonwealth may well be obliged to act to preserve the area and has a considerable number of powers and options open to it to enable it to meet that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>At this point we must agree on two things: First, that the region requires protection by the Commonwealth; and secondly, that the Commonwealth clearly has the power and the responsibility to protect it. Why then is there any opposition ?</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to Tasmania. The Federal Australian Labor Party is extremely sympathetic to the economic difficulties that have plagued that State for some years now. We have been all too aware of the collapse of the manufacturing and the mining industry in that State, of the enormously high levels of unemployment for all age groups and of the higher cost of living caused by Tasmania's isolation from the mainland. All of these matters have been recognised and addressed at length within the Labor Party. We understand and we have some sympathy for the desperation about Tasmania's economy which led successive Tasmanian governments to adopt the idea of damming the Franklin. From the point of view of the Federal Labor Party, however, there are many serious reservations about the economic consequences of proceeding with the Franklin dam at this stage. In addition, we are committed to protect the areas for the reasons I have outlined. </PARA>
<PARA> We have studied carefully the evidence given to the Senate Committee and the conclusions of that Committee. We have concluded that Tasmania's need for the Gordon-below-Franklin power has not been convincingly demonstrated. For example, in Tasmania 18 bulk electricity consumers use 60 per cent of the State's power, but contribute only 37 per cent of the Hydro-Electric Commission's revenues at an average price of 0.9 cents a kilowatt hour. While future demand for power depends on these bulk consumers, they no longer have a significant influence on Tasmania's economic development. For example, these bulk users employ only seven per cent of Tasmania's work force. They are facing increasing economic problems. The companies affected include Comalco at Bell Bay which has abandonded expansion plans and is not replacing burnt out pots and the Electrolytic Zinc Co . of Australasia Ltd which has had to sack 350 people in July of this year. Temco has scrapped expansion plans, sacked 63 people in May of this year and closed its number one furnace and sister plant, Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd at Geeveston has delayed its plant closure by one month only and 350 people are likely to be sacked. No new bulk users have established in Tasmania for 10 years. Time does not permit me to make a further analysis of the role played by hydro-industrialisation in Tasmania's economy. </PARA>

There is simply no conclusive evidence to that effect. I suggest that Senator Harradine pay attention again to the Senate Committee's report. However, we are, as I said, extremely sympathetic to the problems of Tasmania and we believe that there must be a well worked out strategy for the revival of Tasmania's economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At this point I will describe to the Senate the steps that the Australian Labor Party believes ought to be taken; indeed, the next Federal Labor Government will take these steps for that purpose. We have developed a seven stage program for the economic development of Tasmania. Those seven stages include the following: In association with the Tasmanian Government we will explore alternative economically viable power generation projects with the aim of their funding on terms comparable to those which would have applied to the proposed South West Tasmania power generation development project, we want to ensure that total Federal payments to Tasmania do not fall in real terms-that is a commitment from our party, we want to support the proposed Tasmanian Development Corporation, we will ensure that Labor's regional, economic and industrial development policies are applied with specific attention to the special disabilities and needs of Tasmania. We will encourage the Tasmanian Government, in co-operation with the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, to establish a South West Tasmanian management authority responsible for the management of the World Heritage area extended to include the entire South West reservation area. We will provide financial assistance for capital and recurrent expenditure by the authority including payments to the Tasmanian National Parks and Wildlife Service to meet its responsibilities in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> I think a most practical aspect of our seven stage plan is that we will instigate a number of initiatives to assist Tasmania's tourist industry; in particular, we will encourage and, where possible, provide finance or generous loans for the development of man-made attractions and information audio visual facilities in co-operation with Tasmania, local governments, private non-profit organisations and the Commonwealth Accommodation and Catering Services Ltd to finance the construction of low cost tourist accommodation, we will promote cheap travel for international and Australian tourists by air and air-coach tickets which will give unlimited travel for a set period. We will examine specific tourist projects for Federal financial assistance with particular attention to projects which assist the west coast economy which, of course is badly affected by the reduction of mining production. We believe that that plan, if implemented, would lead to economic recovery in Australia and would obviate the necessity for the building of the dam. But more fundamental than that, we consider that the Commonwealth Government has to take into account the interests of this society as a whole. It has to take into account its responsibilities to the international community. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously the Government is aware of the significance of the region or it would not have taken the steps which it has taken to date. It is, I suppose understandably, in a short term political sense, loath to intervene in a situation in which some Tasmanians say that they want no intervention. But this is not a situation where the Commonwealth Government can turn its back. It is not a situation in which it can simply say that its federalism policy will apply and Tasmanians can do what they like with the wilderness area. It is a much more serious situation than that. As I said, the Federal Australian Labor Party wants to adopt a bipartisan approach to this issue. We believe, as far as environmental issues are concerned, and certainly as far as the archaeological significance of the early Aboriginal caves are concerned, a bipartisan approach is the only one that will secure long term policies which provide protection and the opportunity for maintenance of the significance of this area. </PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons we have decided to support Senator Mason's Bill. However, we found that the Bill had shortcomings in some respects. To overcome those shortcomings I foreshadow that at the Committee stage we will move two amendments. I say briefly that the purpose of the first amendment is to allow for a plan of management to be implemented in the wilderness area. Without this amendment Senator Mason's Bill would prohibit any access by anybody into the wilderness area. We are quite convinced of the importance of having management plans implemented within such areas. I refer, for example, to the success of the national park management plan in the Kakadu National Park which is, I believe, a national park of astounding beauty where wilderness aspects are properly conserved and developed with the operation of a management plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment provides powers for the Commonwealth to take action to enforce the Act. I understand that that fits in with what Senator Mason is trying to achieve. Senator Mason and the Federal Australian Labor Party are trying to achieve a long term permanent protection of an areas which is of immense value not only to our nation and our region but also to the world cultural heritage. I hope that Government senators will find it within their abilities to support this Bill. I hope that during the debate we will hear that the sound work of the Senate Committee has borne fruit in changing the view of some honourable senators who were previously convinced that the hydro-electric proposal was an appropriate one for Tasmania. It is not. It would be a tragedy if it were proceeded with. As I have pointed out, there are other ways of assisting the economy. We believe that at this stage the primary responsibility of the Commonwealth Government is to fulfil its obligations under the international convention and to take proper legislative steps for the protection of the South West Tasmanian region. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to express my position in relation to the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill 1982. I have some sympathy with this Bill. When Australia became a signatory to the World Heritage Convention it obviously indicated an intention to abide by the provisions of that Convention, and so it should. It has nominated the west Tasmanian wilderness national parks for inclusion in the World Heritage List. As such, it has identified such areas as a natural resource, a natural heritage of world significance. Again, as such, it accepts certain responibilities under the Convention. I refer to article IV of the Convention which accepts a responsibility for the protection, conservation, preservation and transmission to future generations of that natural heritage. Having said that, I understand from media reports that the Government has the matter currently under consideration. Furthermore, I trust that the Government would wish to take into account the report of the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania which was brought down only this week. I do not know what the Government proposes to do. But the passing of this Bill is only one of the alternatives that are open to it. I say in passing that there are a number of technical deficiencies in this Bill which will be covered, I understand, by the Minister for Education ( Senator Peter Baume). Apart from those deficiencies of form, I believe that a number of options are open to the Government of which this is only one. It may, for example, in the spirit of co-operative federalism, seek to negotiate with Tasmania a management scheme and offer compensation for loss of land use. In such circumstances, this Bill would not be the appropriate way in which to act. It may decide by regulation pursuant to section 69 of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act to regulate to give effect to the Convention. As the Senate would know, that Act specifically gives power to regulate to give effect to this specific Convention. In such circumstances, of course, this Act would be unecessary. Alternatively, as a third option, it might move to an acquisition, in which case there is potential for this to become truly a national park. In those circumstances this Bill would again be an inappropriate way in which to act. Therefore, I do not think that the passing of this Bill at the moment provides the best course of action for the Senate to adopt even if it is correct in form. I believe the correct procedure in the best interests of all parties is to await the Government's decision and that this Bill be deferred. If the Australian Democrats are not prepared to hold it over, I would, at this time for the reasons I have mentioned, vote against it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill introduced by Senator Mason entitled:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A Bill for an Act to give effect to the Convention for the protection of the world culture and national heritage. </PARA>
<PARA>I ought to say at the outset that I agree with Senator Hill that there are various methods by which the Commonwealth might seek to ensure that the South West of Tasmania did not have the hydro-electric development which is at present proposed. As I say, there are several ways in which the Commonwealth might wish to bring that about. I hope that those ways would always embrace consultation and co-operation with the elected State government of Tasmania. Nevertheless, the Senate has before it this Bill, and it is this Bill to which I direct my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it ought to be said initially that the Bill probably has a very tenuous constitutional base such as would enable it to succeed a challenge in the High Court of Australia. In particular, one reads in part of the preamble, in other releases and in the report of the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania on Demand and Supply of Electricity for Tasmania and Other Matters that some reliance is placed on the external affairs power to allow the Commonwealth to use legislative power to enter the field of land use which is normally regarded as the reserve of the States. It seems to me that the possibility of this legislation being based on the external affairs power is based on a very biased reading of the Koowarta decision which decided that the Commonwealth could enact certain provisions of a racial discrimination Act in a way which overrode inconsistent Queensland legislation and administrative action. But the High Court in that case made it very clear that the subject of racial discrimination had become a proper and genuine subject for international co- operation and action. That was evidenced, amongst other things, by international treaties and conventions on racial discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> It is common knowlege, for example, that apartheid is a matter of international concern and action. Therefore, racial discrimination has that status. But the mere existence of an international convention to deal with the preservation of our natural heritage does not of itself give rise to the conclusion that action of this sort envisaged by this Bill arises from a matter of proper and genuine subject for international co-operation. I am quite sure-in this I perhaps disagree with some opinions that have been circulated-that the mere nomination of an area by the national Government would give rise to the head of power. That unilateral action falls far short of demonstrating that the preservation of South West Tasmania is a proper and genuine subject matter for international co- operative action. At the very most, this Bill, if it is relying on the external affairs power, would require a definite action by a multi-lateral body to build up evidence such as the High Court would require. So it is my belief that at the very least, it is only when listing occurs that any Commonwealth external affairs power might be argued to arise. </PARA>
<PARA> I find absolutely absurd the idea floated in the report of the Senate Committee that the Lands Acquisition Act could be used. It is absolutely absurd not only on the grounds of cost. How would one cost the acquisition by the Commonwealth of that huge tract of South West Tasmania? How many billions of dollars are tied up in mineral and timber resources and the energy potential of that area? However, putting aside the question of cost, I can tell the Senate now that Tasmania is not up for grabs in the same way as was Louisiana or Alaska. There is no way in which Tasmania is going to allow the Commonwealth to acquire that huge tract of land at whatever price. I am saying quite clearly that we would secede from the Commonwealth rather than let a land acquisition of that scope occur. I accept those arguments which would have to be resolved in the High Court and which are concerned with the constitutional basis of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I direct my attention to the Bill itself which purports to carry into effect within Australia in particular Article 4 of the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. Article 4 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Each State Party to this Convention recognises that the duty of ensuring the identification, protection, conservation, presentation and transmission to future generations of the cultural and natural heritage referred to in Articles 1 and 2 and situated on its territory, belongs primarily to that State. </PARA>
<PARA>We find that the objective of presenting the natural heritage of South West Tasmania and ensuring its transmission for presentation to future generations is not provided for adequately in the Democrats' Bill. Therefore, certain very fundamental amendments are proposed by the Australian Labor Party. In other words, we accept the Democrats' Bill as a draft. However, accepting for the purpose of argument that Australia does as a nation signatory to the Convention find itself obliged to carry Article 4 into effect, the Labor Party puts certain amendments forward in order to carry that obligation more adequately into effect . </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the way in which the Democrats' Bill was originally drafted and presented to the chamber evidences their entire failure to appreciate that the debate in Tasmania is not about hydro power per se. Tasmanians are not so obsessed by the generation of pollution-free energy from a continually renewable resource that that takes precedence over all other values, although the attraction of such a method of generating energy is obvious. But for Tasmanians the debate is about jobs-the employment of the hundreds of workers who would be involved in the construction of the Franklin project and the jobs that Tasmanians believe will be made available by the users of electricity in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> One may say that Tasmanians have the wrong belief of a link between this project and the creation or maintenance of jobs. That is an arguable proposition . However, I can assure the Senate that any solution offered by this national Parliament which fails to recognise that key crucial issue which is so central to the consciousness of Tasmanians is doomed to failure because that is what explains the resistance of so many Tasmanians to the movement to stop the construction of the dam. It is not a question of resistance to aesthetic values or appreciation of wilderness values. There would be no population in any other area of Australia more aware of natural environmental surroundings than those who live in the most decentralised towns, cities and villages of Tasmania. One can take various indicators, such as the number of bushwalkers and the trout fishing licences, which all testify to the appreciation of and participation by Tasmanians in the beauty of which they are justly proud. </PARA>
<PARA> Jobs are the key to the settlement of this issue. If one looks at the current situation one can see why that is so. The October figures on unemployment in Tasmania show that some 18,600 Tasmanians are looking for full time work. That represents some 11.8 per cent of the population. Amongst 15-year-olds to 19-year -olds, 5,800 are looking for jobs at the moment. Those figures do not take into account those who will be leaving school or other educational institutions this year and coming on to the market. That is one indication of the concern which honourable senators can imagine is felt in so many households in Tasmania. That is why, as I said, any carrying into effect of a Commonwealth obligation to prevent this particular hydro-electric development in South West Tasmania must be accompanied by a concurrent plan for the creation and maintenance of jobs in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Australian Labor Party opposes this Bill as it is drafted because it does not expressly allow for the types of management and zoning plans for the South West area which we would see as absolutely necessary to have in place in order to allow human activity such as would be appropriate to the integrity of South West Tasmania. It would be intolerable if, as a result of the passage of this Bill, an elitist approach to access to the area were to prevail. It would be equally intolerable if the Tasmanian Government were not a participant in the development of such a management scheme. The Northern Territory and the Queensland State Government, for example, participate in the development of the Kakadu National Park and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. In fact, the policy adopted by the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party in relation to South West Tasmania was announced some two weeks ago. My colleague Senator Ryan adverted to that policy. Amongst other things it states that a Labor Government would:</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Encourage the Tasmanian Government in co-operation with the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Services to establish a South West Tasmanian Management Authority responsible for the management of the World Heritage area extending to include the entire South West conservation area. </PARA>
<PARA> (6) Provide financial assistance for capital and recurrent expenditure by the Authority, including payments to the Tasmanian National Parks and Wildlife Service to meet its responsibilities in the area. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We cannot try to produce Tasmanian legislation from this chamber. One thinks of the Kakadu National Park, with its personnel jointly provided by the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth Governments. In short, it would be intolerable if the preservation of this area of natural heritage from the construction of a particular hydro-electric development were to mean the exclusion from the area of other forms of development, particularly tourism, which are compatible with the integrity of the area. I should like to give as an example the management plan of the Kakadu National Park. In that area tourism, commercial fishing, buffalo raising and residences for the Aboriginal and white populations are provided but only after detailed consideration of the effect of any of these human-related activities on the flora, fauna, soil geological formations, water, land reserves and particularly Aboriginal settlements and archeological sites. The net result in the Kakadu National Park area is that a co-operative management plan is worked out which, quite apart from the commercial activity which is taking place there-activity which is compatible with the integrity of the area-provides some 20 000 visitors a year with access and facilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Commonwealth itself is not to support the construction of the dam because of certain international obligations it believes it has taken on, I see a very real and concrete obligation on the Commonwealth to provide Tasmanians with an assurance that a co-operative management plan will be developed for the South West of Tasmania which will provide construction jobs in the area by providing access facilities to the tens of thousands of Australians and overseas visitors who we are told would wish to visit the area. Then it needs to continue employment opportunities in the running of those facilities. Such a plan would take some years to develop. Here I believe lies the significance of the three- year pause which the Senate Committee has reported could be undertaken without putting Tasmania's economic future in jeopardy, even allowing for a high demand for power in the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe several obligations would fall on the Commonwealth during that three- year pause. Firstly, there should be the development of such a co-operative management plan as I have outlined and as the Labor Party's amendment to this Bill will provide. Secondly, there ought to be the provision of funds equivalent to the expenditure on the Franklin Dam for other construction-related activities throughout Tasmania. If the dam went ahead the next three years would see an expenditure on the project of some $80m in real terms. That is largely payable by way of wages and salaries to Tasmanians directly or indirectly working on or supplying the project. That $80m would be spent by those employees in support of themselves and/or their families, again largely within the Tasmanian economy. Any Commonwealth decision which effectively withdraws that spending power from the Tasmanian community must take into account the devastating impact that will have on the already very high unemployment rates that I have outlined to this chamber. </PARA>

I repeat: To implement the three-year pause so as to make this Bill in any way acceptable to the Tasmanian community, the rest of Australia which is adamantly opposed to the dam must accept the fiscal responsibility flowing from that stance. That is the position of the Australian Labor Party in relation to this Bill. If it be thought that the national Parliament has some obligation arising out of the listing, should that occur-and it has not yet-of the South West Tasmania wilderness area on the World Heritage List, and should it be held that this Parliament has the constitutional authority to enter the field of land management use in Tasmania, legislation such as this might be appropriate. I believe it is seriously defective until amended in the way in which the Labor Party has indicated to allow for human activity compatible with the area to take place, and moreover, human activity of an employment-generating kind. If the Bill is so amended, its implementation could be undertaken with the fullest co-operation of the State Government, as has occurred in the case of other great national parks in Australia such as Kakadu and the Great Barrier Reef. It is only on that basis that I find myself able to support an amended Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No one who has just listened to Senator Tate's speech can fail to understand the dilemma which must face any Australian Labor Party senator from Tasmania. The honourable senator's speech set out with some force all the reasons why he should not support the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill 1982. Both Senator Tate and Senator Ryan were having a bit each way. Senator Tate has questioned some of the constitutional basis for the Bill. Senator Tate set out some of the problems of the constitutional basis on which the Bill rests. He has questioned the cost of acquisition. He has questioned the appropriateness of the use of the Lands Acquisition Act. Of course, he should vote against the Bill. Anyone who listened to his speech would conclude that Senator Tate should be voting against the passage of this Bill for the reasons which he set out and articulated. But being a member of the Labor Party Caucus he is in fact going to support the Bill. I invite anyone from Tasmania who listened to what he said to look at how he votes and to put the two together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the other hand, Senator Ryan set out very clearly the views of the Federal ALP. By way of interjection I asked her whether those were the views of the Tasmanian ALP. She did not take up the interjection. Let us not forget that it was under the Australian Labor Party that the dam was conceived, that the project was initiated. It was under the Australian Labor Party that the legislation was introduced into the Tasmanian Parliament. I suspect that the views of the Labor Party in Tasmania do not match those of its Federal counterpart. Having said that, this Bill is not just about South West Tasmania. It is a Bill which considers every area which has been listed or presented for inclusion in the World Heritage List. It is a Bill which affects every part of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Every part which has been nominated, as Senator Harradine says. The Bill purports to give effect to the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage in Australia. That is an international treaty which Australia ratified in 1974. That Convention imposes certain obligations on each signatory party concerning a number of matters- identification, protection, conservation, presentation and transmission to future generations. That is what the Convention provides. It affects those properties situated on its territory which form part of the world cultural and natural heritage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although the Bill is promoted by Senator Mason for its political value in relation to South West Tasmania it is suggested, and I suggest, that honourable senators should address themselves to the wider implications of this Bill, to what it can mean. I start by saying that the need for this legislation is doubtful. Legislation already exists in Australia which has the capacity to protect places nominated for the World Heritage List. The inference of this Bill is that there is neither adequate legislation at Commonwealth or State level nor willingness on the part of governments to fulfil the obligations arising under the Convention. Commonwealth legislation is available. The available legislation includes the Australian Heritage Commission Act establishing the Register of the National Estate; the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act; and the legislative framework for the protection of Kakadu National Park. Those pieces of legislation exist already. The States have their legislation covering national parks and the protection of the natural and cultural heritage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill does not provide any power in relation to the Convention greater than could be available through existing Commonwealth legislation-for example, section 69 of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act provides for the Governor-General to make regulations for and in relation to giving effect to various specified international agreements, including the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. That Act is in place. That power and capacity exists. There would be little doubt that the Commonwealth already has some constitutional power to enact provisions-perhaps those which this Bill covers, although Senator Tate has put some question upon whether that power really exists. As indicated, it may require resolution eventually in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that and recognising that Australia has a federal system of government, the mere existence of legal power is not of itself a good reason for Commonwealth action on any issue unless that action is necessary. In many issues the responsibilities are more properly left to the States to administer. The States and Territories would almost certainly view this Bill as an unwarranted intrusion into matters that they consider to be their primary responsibility. The acceptance of this responsibility is implicit in their recommendation to the Commonwealth of properties for nomination under the Convention, with all of its obligations. It is the States which have nominated to the Commonwealth areas which should be nominated for inclusion in this World Heritage List. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that any person at all may bring proceedings to the Federal Court of Australia for an order declaring that an action is a breach of this Bill and seek an order to remedy or restrain a breach of the legislation. I would like to concentrate for a moment upon that point-the fact that any person may bring proceedings to the Federal Court. There is the possibility, of course, that there could be frivolous or vexatious applications to the court but apart from this the unrestricted conferring of standing before the courts could lead to pressure for similar provisions to be inserted in other Commonwealth, State or Territory legislation. The provision of standing under this legislation is very wide and I believe will not make for practical application of any Bill that is passed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's long-standing legal policy is, to put it in broad terms, that a plaintiff must show that he has a special interest over and above that possessed by an ordinary member of the public or that a plaintiff is likely to suffer damage over and above that which is likely to be suffered by an ordinary member of the public before he or she has standing in any matter. This Bill sets aside that long-standing policy and gives the very widest standing. The Attorney -General (Senator Durack) has referred the general question of standing to the Law Reform Commission for inquiry and report. The question of who should have standing is a difficult one. The Commonwealth is waiting for a report from the Law Reform Commission and Commonwealth policy in relation to standing will be reviewed when the Commission's report is received. That is not expected for some months but honourable senators should be aware that what is being proposed under this legislation is contrary to existing policy, is much wider than the standing that has generally been given and is likely to be inappropriate. </PARA>

It does not have to be included; it just has to be nominated. This aspect could give rise to a volume of litigation in that the words 'adversely to affect' are not defined in the Bill. They are capable of a very broad interpretation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills examined this proposed piece of legislation and remarked on the 'very little identification of the scope of unlawful actions' which were included and also commented on the ' absence of any list of specific offences.' Surely Senator Mason should be concerned that his colleagues in the Senate have criticised his Bill for those shortcomings. He does not seem to be concerned. But surely he should be concerned that the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills also drew attention to clause 6 and noted that this might be regarded as trespassing unduly on the personal rights and liberties of citizens. Surely that should be of concern to the honourable senator. Surely he should be concerned that legislation he is putting up is criticised in this way by a committee of the Senate. I certainly hope that he can indicate that he has taken actions to correct the drafting of this inadequate legislation to take account of and to overcome the objections from what is regarded as a dispassionate all party committee which has criticised his Bill. As it stands, and as it has been criticised, the Bill can properly be described as draconian in some of its provisions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge the interjection of my colleague Senator Harradine. The Australian Labor Party has proposed some amendments to the Bill put forward by Senator Mason. These amendments seek to exclude actions, which might otherwise under the Bill be unlawful, where these are authorised by a zoning or management plan made under the provisions of-I ask honourable senators to listen to this-the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act or other Commonwealth legislation. The amendments would also impose an obligation on the Minister to bring proceedings in the court if the Minister believes on reasonable grounds that a breach of the legislation has taken, is taking or will take place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look for a moment at the ALP amendments. The ALP amendment that exempts actions made in accordance with management and zoning plans would not cover management and zoning plans developed under State legislation for the management of areas in that State. The amendment refers only to Commonwealth legislation as making certain things lawful. Therefore, if this piece of legislation were enacted, actions proposed in accord with management and zoning plans developed under State legislation would be unlawful. For example, a maintenance access track within the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park would be unlawful even though it was otherwise made in accordance with approved plans for the management of that area. What a ridiculous piece of proposed legislation this is . It is badly drafted and full of holes. I am surprised that Senator Mason is not ashamed of it, with this kind of consequence to flow from it. It does not apply just to south Tasmania; those deficiencies apply to the Bill wherever it has application throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The obligation of the Minister to bring proceedings-which involves the other amendment by the Labor Party-in the absence of what constitutes what might be called reasonable grounds places an enormous burden on Ministers. But it must be apparent to honourable senators that this Bill, if enacted, would make it extremely unlikely that any State or Territory, knowing that this legislation existed, would ever make a further recommendation of properties for nomination to the World Heritage List. Senator Mason could be now bequeathing to Australia the end of any further nominations to the World Heritage List, because no State in its right mind would want to place itself under this kind of legislation. If that is what he is out to do then he should proceed. </PARA>

I say to Senator Chipp that I am merely pointing out the errors in the drafting, composition and construction of a Bill that has been presented in all seriousness to the Senate for consideration. Indeed, we know that South West Tasmania is the interest that people have here, and we know that it was nominated for inclusion in the World Heritage List by Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are so many implications for Commonwealth-State relationships arising from intrusion by the Commonwealth into areas which are traditionally areas of responsibility of the States that this Bill should not be supported. It is unthinkable that Senator Mason, a senator for New South Wales, could take action such as this which would make it almost impossible for another Government of New South Wales to want to nominate any other area to the list. The Bill is directed at the situation in South West Tasmania, but there are other existing means of achieving the purposes which he and his colleagues wish to achieve. While we cannot support the Bill for a number of technical reasons, which I have set out, it is not an adequate piece of legislation in the form in which it has come to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make it clear that the Government recognises that it has obligations concerning properties which form part of the world cultural and natural heritage . The Government will continue to advance, through consultative mechanisms such as ministerial councils and ad hoc arrangements, the development of a co- operative approach with the States in identifying and protecting the nation's heritage. I have indicated some of the deficiencies in this legislation. We think that it should not proceed. In the event that the Senate chooses to pass it, the situation will arise where the Senate will have passed a piece of poor legislation full of errors and producing effects which I do not think were the effects that Senator Mason was seeking to achieve. In that case, the House of Representatives would have to carry out a review role and put its mind to reviewing what is a piece of inadequate legislation presented to it from a Senate which has not considered the legislation to an adequate extent. </PARA>

I have been associated with all those matters. Ministers sit round the table. The officers of the various governments would have met the day before and an agenda would have been arranged. An unanswerable case would be put to those ministerial councils that, for the good of Australia, certain States rights ought to be released and transferred to the Commonwealth. In those situations the Commonwealth Minister, whether, for example, it be the Minister for Education or the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will consult with his Cabinet and will get some authority to negotiate. If the States are to give up some of their rights, they will need some compensation or whatever. I have sat at many of those ministerial councils where unanswerable cases for the national good, for States rights to be even temporarily forgone have been put to those councils. These pathetic little men with their pathetic little advisers say: ' Don't give up these States rights to that nasty, centralist Federal Government'. The good of Australians or the national interest is just totally subsumed in this pathetic, almost criminal, retention of these States rights that these little men hang onto.

If they want to continue their ridiculous States rights reasoning that far, let them say that . Or will they be Democrats and say that a State has the right provided it has a referendum? If the populations of Katherine, Darwin and Alice Springs have a referendum and get a 51 per cent vote to send bulldozers into Ayers Rock to crush it up for road gravel to build a road from Alice Springs to Darwin, will these people say that that project should proceed because this precious States rights authority should be retained?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. We thank the Australian Labor Party for them. We believe that the Labor Party amendments improve the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill. Unless this Parliament moves soon on this question, it will be too late. If this Bill is passed today or next week, the political scenario would then be as follows: The House of Representatives will resume on 8 December -in about two weeks time. If the conservationists in Australia, those people who believe that the Franklin River ought to be saved, write letters to every Liberal back bencher in the House of Representatives pleading with them to support this Bill and to make representations to Mr Malcolm Fraser-I suggest that they do not waste any more shot and shell on other Ministers, with great respect to them, because the final decision in this matter will be made by Mr Malcolm Fraser-I believe that we will then have a chance of saving the Franklin River. But the rapidity and the ruthless, incredible efficiency with with the Hydro-Electricity Commission is moving into this beautiful wilderness and destroying all before it have to be seen to be believed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, I believe that there is something else that can be done. For those people who are voting in the Flinders by-election on Saturday week, for whatever political party they vote-it is not my wish in this speech to try to influence them on that decision-here is a magnificent opportunity to do a write- in. One was organised in the Lowe by-election and an amazing number of people in that outer suburban area of Sydney, approximately 12 per cent of all voters, wrote 'No dams' on their ballot papers and then voted for the political party of their choice. In the ACT House of Assembly elections something like 40 per cent of people wrote 'No dams' on their ballot paper. Again, the timing of the Flinders by-election with regard to saving the Franklin River is exquisite. If we can get something like a 15 per cent to 20 per cent write-in of 'No dams' on ballot papers recording votes in the Flinders by-election that would be another factor that could assist Mr Fraser in making up his mind. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> I want to look briefly at the respective merits of the arguments which seem to me to apply in relation to those two issues in the instant case which has been discussed in the course of the debate on this legislation. I am very disappointed with Senator Peter Baume's contribution to the debate. What he was really saying was: 'Look, there are a number of technical objections to this Bill', as if there are not technical objectives to all Bills. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I follow that. If the will and the concern were there to do something about the issues raised by the Australian Democrats in this Bill the Government-as any responsible group of senators in this House is entitled to do- would have moved amendments to improve the legislation further. Of course, as Senator Baume pointed out the Government in the House of Representatives or members of the House of Representatives will have opportunities to improve the legislation if that is necessary. It seemed to me that the substance of his remarks was to ask for an adjournment on the real issues involved and to say: ' Look, there are technical objections to this piece of legislation and therefore we should not pass it, having regard to the high standards we have in this chamber on technical matters'. I understand him in a sense seeking an adjournment in dealing with the real issues in the way in which he did. But I regard it as unfortunate that the Government should adopt that attitude to what is an important piece of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With my very incomplete knowledge of the conservation aspect on South West Tasmania, I accept the views which the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania advanced at page 222 of its report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee accepts the views of these experts that the archaeological discoveries near the Franklin River are of . . . importance-</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee stated that in its view the ecological value of the area was of such national and international significance as to be consistent with the nomination of the area for the World Heritage List. It went on:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth may well be obliged to act to preserve the area and has a considerable number of powers and options open to it to enable it to meet that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to deal with Commonwealth responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> What concerns me is the alternatives to the conservation of the South West Tasmania region; that is, the development of it by the construction of a dam. The unfortunate point about the debate concerning development is the fact that the building of the Franklin dam has been portrayed as a suggested solution to enormous problems in the Tasmanian economy-very real problems about which all honourable senators should be concerned. That argument is advanced as a type of Trojan horse. If a dam is built, some time perhaps in the 1990s, Tasmania, because of low energy prices, will attract industries, and many of the problems which are now endemic in Tasmania, particularly unemployment problems, will be resolved. That is a simplistic view which seems to me to be quite wrong. I say that in no spirit of antagonism to those who hold the view, but it seems to me to be totally misconceived. If we look at what is happening to Australian industry generally, the sort of industries which might appropriately be attracted to Tasmania and the decline in demand for energy in Tasmania at present, we will see that that argument does not stand up and that Tasmania in the 1990s is most unlikely to seek the sort of energy production which the dam involves. That seems to be the essence of the argument which we have to meet. I have to say, because of the tone of the debate and interjections that have been made by Senator Harradine and others, that whilst it is all very well to say that Tasmania and Tasmanians are entitled to make decisions about these matters, we have responsibility as a Parliament to pass Budgets and to deal with taxpayers' money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. We supported those, as the honourable senator will recall. We have responsibilities in relation to those matters. I must say in relation to Premier Gray of Tasmania that I find it extraordinary for him to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The dam won't cost Australian taxpayers anything. </PARA>
<PARA>It is true that the Hydro-Electric Commission has to borrow on the market in order to build the dam, but if the projected power is not needed by the 1990s or cannot be sold profitably Tasmania would not be able to pay the bill for the dam and would not be able to repay, without Commonwealth assistance, the enormous amounts of money which would have to be borrowed. It would then be for the Federal Government-that means Australian taxpayers on the mainland as well as in Tasmania-to service the loans to keep the Tasmanian economy afloat. There is nothing new about that statement. I say it with no disrespect to Tasmania, but it is the most obvious mendicant State in Australia. Tasmania, per head of population, has relatively enormous receipts of Commonwealth revenue to assist its economy and to try to deal with many of its problems. That, of course, is within the knowledge of all honourable senators. I have no objection to that. I feel that Commonwealth money coming from mainland taxpayers can be well spent for that purpose. One of the functions of this Parliament is to ensure that as far as possible equitable economic conditions exist in each State of the Commonwealth, but that involves a large expenditure of taxpayers' money in respect of Tasmania. To that extent we have a very real interest in the loan arrangements for the dam and as to how those loans are to be serviced and repaid . The second remark which Mr Gray made is this:</PARA>
<PARA> Mainlanders should keep their fingers out of Tasmania's affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>I find that an extraordinary contribution to what should be a serious debate because the same Mr Gray is constantly visiting Melbourne, where I as a taxpayer live, and Sydney, where Senator Mason as a taxpayer lives, drumming up support for Tasmania, imploring mainland investors to save Tasmania from economic stagnation and inviting them in those ways to contribute to the Tasmanian economy. He is, of course, as a responsible Premier, putting forward the same sort of case on behalf of his State at Premiers Conferences. He does not then say that mainlanders should keep their fingers out of Tasmania's affairs. His whole campaign, recently, illustrated in his numerous public pronouncements, has been based on the notion of the mainlanders being hostile to Tasmania in some way, yet being called upon to rescue the Tasmamian economy. In February of this year he said:</PARA>
<PARA> A Liberal Government will get $500 million investment into Tasmania by Christmas 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>His concern is again illustrated by that statement, which has led to a degree of extremism in the debate about South West Tasmania, particularly when he refers to people who express passionate concern about the building of the dam as traitors and Third World guerrillas. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the legislation. I wanted to indicate in general terms why I do so and to raise one other issue, that is, the question of Commonwealth-State relations which Senator Chipp dealt with and which I, in a sense, have dealt with in the context of the support which this Parliament has to give to Tasmania on an ongoing basis. I think it is in the same category as Senator Peter Baume's technical objections to this legislation to say that the Commonwealth Parliament has no right to interfere in these matters and should leave all of these questions to State governments. Senator Chipp points out that we did not do that with the Great Barrier Reef and, as Senator Peter Baume, a former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, ought to know, this Parliament has not done that in relation to Aboriginal matters. Indeed, consequent upon the referendum of 1967, additional powers were given to this Parliament in relation to Aboriginal affairs. If today, throughout Australia, we had a referendum on the question of South West Tasmania, I believe it would be carried in every State except Tasmania. Senator Crichton-Browne, with his intimate knowledge of Western Australia, shakes his head. So I retract and say that it would be carried in every State except Tasmania and Western Australia, where Senator Crichton-Browne 's views appear to reign supreme. The important point is that such a referendum would be carried, and one would not want to have one. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I am making is simply that Australians, wherever they live, have a legitimate right to be concerned about an issue of this kind. Governments have an obvious responsibility to be concerned about an issue of this kind and I believe it to be in that spirit that the Australian Democrats' Bill was brought into the Senate and it was in that spirit that the Opposition moved its amendments to the Bill because they seemed to be sensible additions to the legislation. I do not see it as being a responsible attitude to say that this is wrong in terms of some technicalities and therefore the Senate should never pass it because what people in the Australian community are concerned about are attitudes to this very fundamental issue. I hope the Senate will adopt the Bill as amended. </PARA>

I reject totally the statement made by Senator Chipp that I am voting against matters brought by the Australian Democrats into this chamber from now until the end of the session because of the fact that we are meeting next week. That is not the situation with regard to this Bill. It certainly will not be the situation so far as one Bill is concerned which will probably come up for debate next week. I refer to the Bank Account Debits Tax Administration Bill. I will make one point perfectly clear; I thought I explained it during the previous debate. One of the consequences of the Senate's sitting next week is that I now will be unable to engage in discussions with the people who were important for my consideration of the forthcoming education legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I return to the measure before us, namely, the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill 1982. Why do I say that this Bill is a heritage Bill only in that it will trample on our heritage of rights and civil liberties? Negatively, that is so. It has been pointed out by the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Senator Peter Baume) that if this Bill goes through, there will be no Premier of any State who will be prepared to nominate any area or object of his State for inclusion on the list of the World Heritage Commission. The provisions of this Bill are absolutely draconian. The stated aim of the Bill is:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . to ensure that South-West Tasmania would be saved for future generations in accordance with Australia's obligations under the World Heritage Convention. </PARA>
<PARA>That aim is not included in the Bill itself. It is the stated aim of the Bill as expressed by Senator Mason in his second reading speech. The question of responsibility and the process of determining what the current generation wants and what the future generation may want is central to any democratic form of government. I suppose that it is central to any form of government. Governments exist to make those decisions and to determine those issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from that question, the Bill raises grave issues with regard to civil liberties. It raises the fundamental question of whether our affairs should be determined by a direction dreamt up by the World Heritage Committee in Paris. The Bill, as has been admitted around the chamber, is probably the most open- ended and confusing legislation that has ever been introduced into the Federal Parliament. </PARA>

Does the person who makes the complaint have to be an Australian citizen? The answer is no; there is nothing in the Bill to suggest that such a person has to be an Australian citizen. Does the potential villain need to have done something wrong? Again, the answer is no; the Bill makes that person liable even if he intends to do something wrong. What if he breaches an order of the Federal Court? He will go to prison or be fined. What is the penalty? There is no penalty under this legislation save, of course, for one of the worst penalties in the book-that is, for comtempt of court. The penalty under those circumstances is open-ended.

<PARA> Many attacks have been launched against Mr Gray, the Premier of Tasmania. I do not agree with Mr Gray on quite a large number of issues. But let us not forget that the proposed development in the South West was adopted by both houses of parliament in Tasmania with only three dissentient voters. Are all members of the Tasmanian Parliament troglodytes or barbarians? Do they not have to live with the situation in Tasmania? Do they not understand what is occurring or the environmental benefit of South West Tasmania? Numerous inquiries have been carried out in respect of this area. A watchdog parliamentary committee has been established. Statements made in the Senate regarding the leakage of oil are simply not in accordance with the facts of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I say in conclusion that I have only recently received a copy of the amendments foreshadowed by the Australian Labor Party. Senator Tate indicated what a horrific thing it would be to utilise the land acquisition powers for the purposes for which this Bill was designed. I agree with him. The honourable senator adverted to the cost to the Commonwealth of such a proposal. I also agree with him in that regard. But what is being proposed in the amendment is virtually the same thing as is being proposed in the Bill but without compensation. To suggest that the Australian Labor Party's amendments will improve things very much is to stretch imagination to its very limits. The amendments, in part, read:</PARA>
<PARA> Nothing . . . shall render it unlawful for a person to to do any act or take any action which is expressly or impliedly authorised by a zoning plan that has come into operation under-</PARA>
<PARA>Certain Commonwealth Acts are then set out. The section continues:</PARA>
<PARA>or any such zoning plan or management plan as may be provided under a law of the Commonwealth, including a law in respect of South West Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA>That is putting the gun at the head of the whole of the Parliament of Tasmania. It is saying quite bluntly that if we pass this heritage Bill provision will be made for the Commonwealth legislature to enact a zoning plan. Of course, no provision has been made for a veto power by the State concerned. This sort of legislation could affect my State today or the States of Western Australia and New South Wales tomorrow. </PARA>

The Australian Labor Party's amendment to the Bill does nothing to alleviate my fears of the draconian nature of the measure and its aspect of trampling on the heritage of our rights and civil liberties. It is doing that by reason of the nomination of the area to a committee in Paris.

There seems to be some misguided concept amongst some honourable senators opposite that all wisdom resides here. It is interesting how they are all equal in their own States. It is just a question of the luck of the draw as to whether a person gets an endorsement for the Senate, the House of Representatives or the Upper or Lower House in the State from which that person comes. We have all been through that process. Suddenly, once honourable senators opposite arrive here they feel they have a superior knowledge that overwhelms, overcomes and imposes itself far above that of the poor plebeians who seek to make judgments and laws in respect of their own States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As long as I have been in the Senate I have noticed that State governments and State politicians have been treated as minors, mendicants and second class citizens. As I said, frankly that is not the view that members of parliament take when they go back to their own States and when they go before their own State councils for preselection. The States and the members of the State parliaments more than anybody else ought to be sensitive, and conscious and ought to be aware of the need, the wishes, the ambitions and the aspirations of the people in their own States. If they make a mistake they are ignominiously removed from office in a very short time. I would have thought that they would be the best judges of the consequences of their decisions. They are very mindful of the needs and the wishes of their States. Primarily, they are concerned only with their own States. They are best able to make judgments on the balances between conservation and development and growth and the stifling of growth. They are accountable to their voters. </PARA>
<PARA> As long as I have been a member of the Liberal Party, particularly the Liberal Party of Western Australia, I have always understood one of its basic tenets to be a belief in the devolution of power away from Canberra, not towards it. This is another of those classic centralist pieces of legislation which are so enthusiastically embraced by the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats. It flies in the face of everything that I have ever supported as a Liberal. It seems perhaps unnecessary to remind ourselves that this Parliament had powers vested in it as a result of the original States coming together in the first place to hand over certain specific powers clearly written into the Constitution, the residual powers remaining in the hands of the States. It is a very poor excuse to use the external affairs powers to surreptitiously undermine the fundamental intentions of those powers to provide a capacity to introduce this type of legislation. I am very much opposed to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am always interested to note that in referendums on these sorts of issues the people in Canberra overwhelmingly support decisions in Tasmania or elsewhere. I suspect that a great majority of the people in Canberra are civil servants who would probably get lost once they went past Queanbeyan. I wonder how many of them have been to Tasmania to enable them to make these sorts of judgments. I wonder how many of them have been to Western Australia to see its magnificent countryside and to decide whether people in that State have the capacity and the sensitivity to distinguish among growth, development and conservation. I have no doubt that were there a referendum in Australia as to whether the Federal Parliament ought to have power to introduce this sort of legislation it would be overwhelmingly defeated not only in Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland but also in many other States. </PARA>
<PARA> I note with some fascination that very often the difference between conservation and development is the difference between the haves and the have- nots. With due respect, I am referring not to those in this Parliament who are making such determinations but to the community at large. Those who seek employment or who have employment in growth industries very rarely are the ones who call for conservation. It usually comes from those people who are secure on middle income salaries which they draw as a result of somebody else's profits, endeavours or capacity or who are drawing on the taxpayers for their form of income. Invariably we find that those who seek to make their own way in life rely on their own capacity and that those who rely on those sorts of people for employment oppose these sorts of proposals. I conclude by saying, as I said at the outset, that I am opposed to the proposition. It is the sort of legislation that would have no support whatsoever in Western Australia. I would rue the day when this sort of proposition was ever put in any part of Western Australia. </PARA>

That point has to be acknowledged.

That said, I think the only contribution that I want to make to this debate is one that is motivated by some comments on the Commonwealth's constitutional power and, in particular, the external affairs power to support legislation of this kind.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Comments that have been made by others in this debate and in particular by my colleague Senator Tate. A variety of powers with potential application to support legislation of this kind has been canvassed-the trade and commerce power, various financial powers, the implied nationhood power of the Commonwealth and so on. But it is clear that primary reliance is being placed on the external affairs power in the text of this legislation; that certainly is the particular power that has attracted the most lively comment in this and other contexts. I think it is clear that there is a great deal of wishful thinking evident in a lot of circles around this country since the Koowarta case about the scope of the external affairs power. It is certainly true, as my colleague Senator Tate very cogently pointed out, that mere participation by Australia in some treaty or the mere taking of action by Australia under some treaty to which it is a party cannot itself necessarily give the support necessary constitutionally for legislation which purports to give domestic force and effect to Australia's treaty obligations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But that said, I think it is appropriate perhaps to give a slightly different emphasis from that given by Senator Tate and those commentators who may share his perception of how all this works, to the significance, in the context of the world heritage issue, of Australia making a nomination of an area, on the one hand, and on the other, securing the actual listing of that area on the World Heritage List. I understood Senator Tate to say-indeed, I have heard a number of other people make this point-that the nomination itself is likely to be of no particular constitutional significance at all, but the listing of the area or any other area on the World Heritage List, with the multilateral international recognition that this would imply, would be of real significance in giving constitutional support to this legislation. I simply say that I am not so clear that that is an appropriate dichotomy to identify in this area; I am not at all sure that things are as clear cut or as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA> What seems to be the test after the Koowarta case is that the subject matter in question be such as to have the capacity to affect Australia's international reputation or Australia's international relations. It may be that even the listing of a particular subject area on something like a World Heritage is insufficient to make it an issue of international importance so far as Australia 's reputation, standing and relations are concerned. Alternatively, it may be that the mere nomination of an area to put it on such an international list would be sufficient in all the circumstances to evidence the international status that that area enjoys and give it the characteristic of being a subject matter upon which the international reputation of Australia might depend. </PARA>
<PARA> I think if anything is clear in all this rather muddy debate about the scope of the external affairs power, it is two things. First, that it is not necessary to have a treaty for any particular subject matter to be international in character for the purposes of attracting the external affairs power jurisdiction; there may be some subject matter that is not the subject of a treaty but which nonetheless is manifestly international in character in the sense that Australia 's reputation is at stake in anything it does in relation to that area. Secondly , it is clear that if we have a treaty that is not necessarily the end of the matter at all; the mere existence of a treaty does not necessarily give it the force and character of being international in status as a result. What matters is whether the action or inaction on the matter is such as to be likely to affect Australia's international relations. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the kind of subject areas which might satisfy this description the question becomes very interesting. It is clear now, in the light of the Koowarta case if not before, that racial discrimination is a subject area that is properly international in character and in which Australia's performance is likely to affect our reputation and international relations. It is almost as clear that human rights matters generally satisfy that description in this modern age. The question that has to be resolved in the context of the present debate is whether the protection of a nation's cultural and natural heritage is these days such an issue. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Mason" NAMEID="YJ7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YJ7">Senator Mason</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And world heritage.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. Maybe one can refine it further and refer to the protection of a nation's cultural and natural heritage in areas that are of potential universal significance. That may be another way of describing and narrowing the issue and the argument. I simply want to say that while I acknowledge that there is room for doubt in this area-certainly the issue is not nearly as clear-cut as it is for racial discrimination and human rights; one has to be a real constitutional optimist to suggest otherwise-I believe that the external affairs power, quite apart from other possible heads of power-I do not want to go into that in the short time available tonight-probably is good enough to support this legislation. I further believe that it is strongly arguable in the context of South West Tasmania that the mere nomination of South West Tasmania in this international treaty forum is enough to evidence the status of that particular area as being a proper subject for Commonwealth legislation under the external affairs power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The elements of the agreement are as follows. What we have, in the first place, is a multilateral treaty in place which is manifestly not a mere device, not a put up job to serve the domestic interests of one or other of the parties to it. It is a multilateral treaty on a subject matter, it appears, of genuine, to that extent, international concern. Secondly, we have a situation where the Commonwealth has clear-cut obligations under that treaty to protect areas which are of outstanding universal value even without those areas being listed formally on the World Heritage List. That is perfectly clear by any reading of articles 4 and 5 of the Convention and the definition of natural heritage. </PARA>
<PARA> It is further clear, as we all know, that the Commonwealth has nominated the area of South West Tasmania for world listing as being of outstanding universal value. No one has seriously suggested that in so nominating South West Tasmania the Commonwealth has acted other than in good faith in implementing its obligations and the opportunities open to it under the international treaty. It is nonsensical to claim, as a number of senators have claimed, that if we take this view about South West Tasmania assuming international status by virtue of the Commonwealth's nominating it in this treaty forum, we are opening the door for the Commonwealth to identify some sleazy part of inner suburban Melbourne equally as an area of international heritage significance, thus opening the door for some manifestly absurd exercise of the Commonwealth's legislative power. I simply do not think that follows. There is a good faith element in all these sorts of applications of constitutional law in this area and there does not seem to be any serious suggestion that good faith has been lacking in this particular case. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in this chain of reasoning there are plenty of reasons for supposing that international attention would be attracted and serious adverse reaction guaranteed if this area of Tasmanian wilderness thus nominated were to be destroyed. The preservation of the South West seems to me to be the kind of issue about which it can be claimed that Australia's international reputation and standing are at stake. If this is so, then neither the formal nomination, nor ultimate listing, is particularly crucial. The nomination is simply the process by which the Commonwealth has identified in good faith an area as possibly coming within that description of something of international significance so far as its beauty and other characteristics are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other point I wish to make is that all of this argument has, of course , a larger relevance than just in the purely technical context of the scope and operation of the external affairs power. It is the case that the Tasmanian south -west is an area of international significance. As such, the whole question, I suggest, ought to be approached with a rather larger spirit than has been shown by a number of contributors to this debate here this evening. Of course Tasmania 's economic problems are acute and alarming, and of course it is that concern that has motivated most of the resistence within Tasmania, and perhaps also in this chamber, to the kinds of concepts and thoughts embedded in this legislation . But it is not nearly so obvious that those economic ills and that anguish of Tasmania will be corrected by this particular Franklin dam project. </PARA>
<PARA> In the absence of any clear-cut demonstration that the State's economic ills will be resolved by this project-in fact the evidence strongly suggests the contrary-it seems to me that there is very little justification for the wallowing in parochialism that we have heard from so many of the contributors to this debate. The concept of wounded State pride and injured State feeling that has gone into the contributions of so many of the opponents of this legislation, both from Tasmania and from elsewhere, seems to be misconceived when what is in issue is an area manifestly of the national and international significance of south-western Tasmania. The kind of hostility with which those who have defended this legislation have been treated by the opponents of the Bill seems to me to do no justice to the genuineness of those who hold very strong views about the desirability of protecting South West Tasmania, nor does it acknowledge the very real force of their argument. </PARA>

For instance, I am very surprised that he, as an eminent lawyer , would have nothing to say about the construction and the drafting of this Bill .

<PARA> Just in passing, I wonder whether, in the most friendly of ways, I could pass on to Senator Mason some advice that Senator Withers passed on to me a long time ago. It was quite simple. He said: 'Remember this: There are more people who have talked their way out of this place than ever talked their way into it'. It seems to me that that advice might well be profitably and charitably passed on to Senator Mason now. After all, how much bread, money or better living conditions would this Bill put into the mouths or hands of his constituents in New South Wales? I do not think that they would be terribly interested in legislation of this kind. I think that they are expecting something different from Senator Mason. But that is my opinion. He ought to know best how to handle his own constituency. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that Senator Harradine and Senator Crichton-Browne have already suggested, very strongly and wisely, that these world heritage concepts are world government concepts and that they cut across very strongly what should be well established boundaries of interest and jurisdiction. I cannot see that this Federation of the Commonwealth and the sovereign States can live peacefully together if the Commonwealth is to interfere in such detail with the basic affairs of the States. I am certain that there will be many more disturbances in the State of South Australia between Mr Bannon and various people with whom he does not seem to get on if the Australian Labor Party persists in supporting Bills of this nature. The States will not put up with that. </PARA>
<PARA> I am certain also that in Western Australia and Queensland we have a very deep sympathy for the present Tasmanian Government which finds itself so sorely beset by members of this Commonwealth Parliament who ought to be attending to their own basic problems in their own parties and assisting us to get the best results in this chamber. Heaven knows, they talk about these subjects in their matters of public importance day after day. We will have the same sort of ridiculous litany of matters of public importance next week concerning the problems of this Commonwealth. Why should honourable senators opposite want to interfere in the affairs of the States when they ought to be applying themselves more appropriately to the matters that concern this Commonwealth?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume's speech made very clear indeed the problems that Senator Mason's Bill-which, as I said, is ill-conceived-will cause if it becomes law. I think Senator Baume properly suggested that it was hardly a serious Bill. If one looks at what has happened during this debate it is quite plain that Senator Mason does regard this as a serious Bill. Of course, the Australian Labor Party supports it. Anything that breaks down the authority of the States will be supported by members of the Labor Party. Their record on these matters is very clear. When the Labor Government was in office it tried unsuccessfully to break down the essential relationship between the States and the municipal governments -the cities and so on-within those States. The Labor Party brought forward a plan for regional authorities which was designed to upset the relationship with the State governments and their municipal authorities, to cut across the State government boundaries and to go directly to the regions. That is centralism at its worst. That is one of the bad aspects of Senator Mason's Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is all right for Senator Chipp to talk about vociferous activities. I congratulate Senator Chipp and all the other people who are involved in this campaign. They have built an enormous bushfire out of the flame of a match. Earlier Senator Chipp said that Dr Norman Sanders had flown over the area. But those flights are nothing to the flights of fancy that this chamber has heard from Senator Chipp. This has been a most remarkable performance. I pay tribute to Senator Chipp's capacity to organise these things-he understands this -for his own quite proper political purposes. That is what this democracy is about. But Senator Chipp and those who support him have to realise that there is a strong group of people in this community who do not blow their bags and who sit quietly and look at these things. Senator Chipp's followers imagine that they have almost a total right-almost a dictatorship, if you like-to impose their views on this community. A very big group-I submit that it is a much larger group than Senator Chipp and his followers know about-is totally opposed to all of these wild activities. These people can see where it is going to lead. They can see that it will lead to a breakdown of the essential areas of authority of this Commonwealth Government and its relationship with the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe it is an utterly disgraceful situation when a small group can hold up the whole development of a State by mobilising opinion outside that State. It is a most remarkable but still disgraceful state of affairs. If this mechanism is allowed to continue to flourish and to prosper, we will have enormous difficulties with all of the States. I have already flagged the opinion of many in Western Australia. I am supported by my colleague Senator Crichton-Browne from Western Australia. I know Senator MacGibbon feels the same way and we have heard from Senator Kilgariff as well as Senator Harradine, who certainly represents a very strong proportion of the people in Tasmania. These people are very concerned about what is happening and they will have memories when the next Senate election comes around. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chipp's remarks were interesting. He has mentioned before that States rights are an issue. That is something that he ought to appreciate because he is here as a senator representing Victoria. As I said before about Senator Mason, I cannot see how these activities are directly related to the function of a senator from his State. I cannot see how a senator from Victoria can involve himself in the affairs of another State when the people in that State are represented adequately or otherwise by their own team of senators. It does seem to me-I offer a personal opinion here-to be almost an impertinence for honourable senators from one State to go into another State and to seek to impose their organised views about the affairs of people within that State. </PARA>
<PARA> Will this Senate, founded in the concept of States rights and responsibilities allied with Commonwealth rights and responsibilities, now seek to destroy the very foundation on which it rests? I hope every citizen is listening to what is happening. This debate is not about world heritage; it is about the abandonment of the States to an all-powerful Commonwealth. I am not suggesting that our Government will assume this role of an all-powerful government and destroy the States. The very essence of the Liberal Party's philosophy and policy is against that concept, but as has so often been said before, we may not govern for ever. Of course the Australian Labor Party will support this Bill. It knows that the more States' authority is broken down the more a centralist, specialist, socialist concept will be possible. This Bill is bad. It is ill-drafted and ought to be thrown into the deepest part of the river, along with the ALP amendments. </PARA>

It is a long way from here, it is very deep and it runs into a very deep bay. That would be a very appropriate place to put it. We in Western Australia do not want this sort of interference in our State. I would have to say, with all respect to Senator Mason, that I would not relish the Australian Democrats chances in the next Senate election. He has created this situation and has made it very difficult for his colleagues in Western Australia. I should thank him for this but I do not like to see a good man making a mess of what might be a good job. I think that this World Heritage Properties Protection Bill is essentially bad. It should be rejected by the Senate, and it should be rejected for the right reasons. It cuts across boundaries in a way that legislation should not. It cuts across State boundaries and interferes with that essential relationship that exists between the Commonwealth and the States.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I was always opposed to this World Heritage Properties Protection Bill 1982 but having heard the speakers for it I am now very opposed to it and I find that I cannot contain myself in the face of this heresy. The point at issue is not that the Commonwealth has power to legislate in the area as Senator Evans spent hours trying to tell us. There is no argument that the Commonwealth can legislate in this area if it wants to. The real point is that we should not have to legislate in this area at all; we do not have a need to do so. Therefore, we do not need this Bill. Stripped to its basics there is just a very simple little ploy going on here. The ploy is just one of the things where, if a person does not have a majority position or a position where the majority of the people in the Australian community support him he tries to outflank the whole deal by appealing to a supernational body, in this case the World Heritage Commission, and thus avoid in the process the wishes of the people whom he represents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is one of those paths that we are going down increasingly in Australia on many issues where we are tied into being signatories to overseas bodies and when we do not examine all the consequences of what is involved by signing on the dotted line, let alone looking at how the decisions were arrived at or at the people who arrived at these decisions. The impression somehow is created that all overseas bodies are much more ethical, much more honest, and much more responsible than national bodies. The logic of that escapes me but it is a line that is sold very consistently by people who want to get support for issues for which they do not have support in their own countries. I take the view that the converse is often true, having had quite a bit of experience with overseas bodies. The composition of international organisations is nowhere near comparable with the composition of national bodies. That is not surprising because people only come together for a few days at a time, once a year, once every two years or once every five years. Their internal communications and cohesion is very poor. One always has communication problems through language difficulties and translation and all the rest of it. The intimate meeting of minds for a highly technical or a well reasoned argument is often missing. I am not saying that it cannot be attained but very frequently it is not attained and the broadest of communiques or resumes of meetings are put out because they are the only ones on which people can reach agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to speak out against this Bill. I want to speak for Queensland and also for Australia. Quite simply we are involved here with an abdication of Australia 's sovereignty and an abdication of sovereignty held by the individual States. There is no getting away from that point whatsoever. Unlike Senator Mason and members of the Australian Labor Party I just do not have a feeling of inferiority about being an Australian and looking after Australia's affairs. I am proud of the workings of this Parliament and the other parliaments in Australia. I am proud of their achievements and their abilities to reach the right conclusions in certain circumstances. We are a developing society; we are a changing society. We have made mistakes in the past and I promise honourable senators that we will make mistakes in the future. </PARA>

What we are dealing with here is a philosophic division between those of us who believe in going our own way and the centralist belief of the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party. We live in Australia in a federation and a federation just happens to be the hardest of all political systems to make work because it means that we have a group of separate sovereign States and we cannot ride over those people in a jackbooted fashion. We have to co-operate, communicate and co- ordinate. In other words, we have to live like adults. I can understand that that would be a bit hard for some people to do.

I do not find it surprising if they wish to abolish the States because they are on record on many occasions as having said that. Senator Mason a year or so ago was talking about the abolition of State governments and the setting up of the old socialist doctrine of regional seats of government or some equivalent shire scheme such as that to administer Australia from some central source. I find that an heretical belief for someone who also holds a seat in the Senate, which is the States House. Ever since federation the sovereignty of the States has been maintained. Indeed, if we had not had a federation we would not have had a Commonwealth of Australia because we had six States that all had a proud and successful history of achievement before 1901.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we nearly had three and we will have three one day. But the characteristics of the federation are that we have to respect the diversity of human nature, of human achievement and it also relates very well to the geography of Australia, the great distances that are involved and the different regional attitudes that come from having this Federal system. A consequence of that which is lost by people here is that States must, therefore, be different and States can be different. They can quite legally, legitimately and properly have different values as to how they want the societies in their States to be run. It is impossible for Canberra to decide what needs to be done in my own State, in Burketown or Birdsville and it is even less possible for someone in New York or in Paris to make that decision for us. I am prepared to trust people to behave as adults and to be responsible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The solution to Senator Mason's problem is to embark on a public awareness campaign to create a heightened awareness of the environment. My respect for the environment and the ecological movement is second to none but what we have already in place through the national parks system is a system which is functionally adequate, which can be upgraded and which can satisfy the needs of the preservation of the environment. In fact, it is only through having the support of the local people, by involving them in things like an enhancement of a national parks program that we will get the environment preserved. Unless people feel a relationship to what is going on locally, unless they feel they have a direct responsibility themselves to that environment they simply will not be concerned about it. The issue of south Tasmania is not the reason that this Bill should be brought in. It is always very bad from a legislative point of view to bring in general legislation to cover one particular point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some time last week, Senator McLaren raised the matter of the Ralkon Agricultural Co. Pty Ltd and the Aboriginal Development Commission. Yesterday, my office was contacted by the adviser to the Point McLeay Community Council; and, later, one of my staff spoke to a Mr H. J. Rankine, the Chairman of the Point McLeay Community Council. These people contacted my office because they were particularly concerned at some of the statements and allegations which have been made by Senator McLaren over a period of a year or more. They believe that, for some unspecified reason of his own, Senator McLaren is attempting to make some sort of political capital out of the Aboriginal situation in the area. They believe that his attack is scandalous and that it is demoralising them. The community is unhappy because it feels that it has no right of reply.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Black against black as well and, for all I know, white against white and any other colours in between. The point is that they feel that Senator McLaren's comments are divisive and demoralising, that the Aboriginal community is given no opportunity to rebut them and that they are destroying the confidence of the people who live in the area in the Aboriginal community and also the ability of the Aborigines to control their own destiny. Indeed, they went so far as to say to one of my staff that they believe that he is being generally anti-Aboriginal in standing up for what appears at least the defence of one particular white man.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today, I received a particularly long telegram signed by H. J. Rankine J.P., Chairman of the Point McLeay Community Council. I intended to have this telegram incorporated in Hansard in order to save the time of the Senate; but, since Senator McLaren has come into the chamber, I presume that he will want to make some sort of response to my remarks. Since this telegram arrived late and I do not have a copy of it, this means that I will have to read it, as a courtesy to Senator McLaren, and for that reason I apologise to the Senate for keeping it longer than I intended. The telegram is addressed to me and it reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Janine Haines</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House Canberra</PARA>
<PARA> As Chairman of the Point McLeay Community Council and as a representative of the Point McLeay Aboriginal community over the past twenty years I strongly deplore the political antics and ill informed grandstanding on Aboriginal matters by Senator McLaren in the Senate as reported in Hansard dated 17th November 1982. Senator McLaren's views are biased towards a minority faction and certainly do not reflect the beliefs of my Council or that of many Aboriginal people within this community. Senator McLaren's unsubstantiated attacks on hardworking and longserving officers of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission which he so vigorously castigates are totally unwarranted and certainly divisive in our relationships with these departments. The senator's fervor would be better channelled to more useful purposes than that of headstrong political mudstirring and faction polarisation. The assistance received by my Council from the Aboriginal Development Commission was a direct response to resolutions passed by my Council seeking support in its endeavours to regain control and use of its lease holdings upon which Ralkon Agricultural Co. has continued to occupy in defiance of all previous attempts by my Council to remove a small faction that occupies Council lands to the detriment of the Council and the Aboriginal community as a whole. I particularly bring to your notice that in 1974 I originated the concept of a farming project on Council lands and as a result of this concept the Council negotiated the purchase of Bartletts Farm through the then known ALF Commission (now ADC) to compliment existing Council farm lands. It was never intended that the farm's management be other than as a sub-committee to the Council and under the direct control of the Council for the general benefit of the Point McLeay Aboriginal community. The dispute between the Council and Ralkon Agricultural Co. is of many years standing and is currently the subject of litigation therefore these intrusions by Senator McLaren can only be harmful to the settlement of the dispute. Clarification of many issues now the subject of litigation can be obtained by reading the Commonwealth Ombudsman's report on the dispute and to which document I respectfully refer you. </PARA>
<PARA>H. J. RANKINE, J.P., Chairman Point McLeay Community Council</PARA>
<PARA>It would appear from the telegram and from the telephone conversations between my staff and people at the Community Council yesterday that there is considerable concern in the community about what has been said in this place over a number of years; that morale at Point McLeay is particularly low; that division is reaching some fairly scandalous sort of peak, from what I understand ; and that the people there would like at least their side of the story put as well, that is what I have attempted to do this evening. </PARA>

He said that there was an attempt by the Government to talk out Senator Mason's private member's Bill, the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill.

The speakers list, as it was settled, contained the names of Senators Ryan, Hill, Tate, Baume and Mason. A number of other senators joined the debate. If the Australian Democrats say that the Government talked the debate out they should do it against the background that Senator Chipp himself added his name to the list of speakers, as did Senators Button, Evans, Harradine, Martyr, Crichton-Browne and MacGibbon. The extra speakers came from all parties represented in the chamber; they came from the Democrats, the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party. The Independent senator was also a speaker. Senator Bolkus may, when he understands that matter, wish to reconsider what was an entirely false and improper accusation made by him. </PARA>

<PARA> What action has the Australian Government taken in the following forums in pursuance of the right of the East Timorese people to self-determination and in pursuance of the right of the human rights of the East Timorese: (a) United Nations General Assembly; (b) United Nations Commission on Human Rights; (c) United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; and (d) United Nations Childrens Fund.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government has taken the following action:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) United Nations General Assembly-Australia has participated in debate on resolutions on the situation in East Timor on the UN General Assembly every year since 1975. Australia voted for the resolution adopted in 1975, abstained in 1976 and 1977, and has voted against resolutions introduced since 1978. UN resolutions on East Timor have also been opposed in recent years by the great majority of other countries in the region, including New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, India and Japan.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) United Nations Commission on Human Rights-The question of East Timor has not arisen in annual sessions of the Commission on Human Rights, and thus there has been no occasion for Australia to take action there. The Commission has, however, established a working group in disappearances which is currently investigating allegations of disappearances in East Timor among other places. Australia has consistently taken a close interest in the activities of this working group.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees-The Office of the UNHCR is a strictly non-political, humanitarian organisation the focus of which is on refugees or displaced persons outside their country or origin. Australia has not pursued the question of East Timor within the UNHCR as it would have been inappropriate to have done so.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) United Nations Childrens Fund-UNICEF has undertaken a special assistance project in East Timor which concentrates on health and nutrition programs. The UNICEF representatives in Indonesia visited East Timor in April 1982 in connection with drawing up details of the project. On 28 July 1982, the Australian Government announced it would contribute $250,000 to this project. The Australian Government will continue to give careful consideration to requests for assistance to improve the social and economic well-being of the people of East Timor. UNICEF activities in East Timor are in line with its overall aims of promoting practical projects to assist mothers and children.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 October 1982 (Hansard, page 1935) Senator Georges asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister a question without notice concerning the World Disarmament Campaign (WDC).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following response to that part of the question relating to the funding of WDC:</PARA>
<PARA> One of the decisions of the recent United Nations Second Special Session of Disarmament (UNSSOD II) was to launch the World Disarmament Campaign designed to mobilise public opinion world wide. The Australian delegation to the Special Session was an active member of the group which drafted the text on the WDC incorporated into the Final Document of the Session. The Government considers that the WDC can make a contribution in Australia to support existing efforts to inform and to generate public understanding on disarmament issues.</PARA>
<PARA> It was decided at UNSSOD II that the United Nations would provide the substance of the information for the Campaign and coordinate its implementation throughout the world. In doing this the United Nations will work closely with governments and non-governmental organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> The Second Special Session also decided that the WDC should be funded from within the existing United Nations budget and from voluntary contributions of states and non-governmental organisations. Australia's financial support for the Campaign will be drawn from the substantial contribution made to the regular budget of the United Nations. The Government does not propose to make an additional contribution to UN funds for the WDC, nor will it be providing funds directly to non-governmental organisations for this purpose.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 21 October 1982 (Hansard, page 1688) Senator Primmer asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. What action has been taken by the Department of Foreign Affairs in the interest of Father Brian Gore, currently held in detention in the Philippines? Is the Minister aware that seven Filipino Christians have been similarly held in detention in Davao City since being arrested on the night of 16 January 1982 , amongst them being Leonor Sevilla, who is well known among Victorian Christians for her work amongst the poor in the Philippines? Will the Minister take up with the Filipino authorities in Australia the case of Miss Sevilla and the six others and seek either their early trial or discharge from prison.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the information I provided on the case of Father Gore, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> On 16 January, Leonor Sevilla, together with six companions (Rolly Trinidad, Puring Trinidad, Hemenegildo Florida, Elias Casilac, Tarcintia Bitar and Lourdes Samson) was detained in San Vincente, Davao del Norte Province. Reportedly the arrests were related to local opposition to Government moves to resettle large numbers of farmers to assist its military operations against the New People's Army organisation. All were transferred to Davao City and, on 22 January, charged with possession of subversive material. Ms Sevilla and five of her companions were also charged with membership of a subversive organisation.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the filing of a habeas corpus petition by civil liberties groups the seven were flown to Manila on 8 February. The Supreme Court on 9 February gave the defence and prosecution ten days to file their cases. I am informed that the defence lawyers submitted their petition on 19 February and the Solicitor-General submitted his on 20 February. Since the seven were returned to Davao, I understand there have been no developments in the case.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that, in the circumstances, it would be appropriate for the Australian Government to seek to intervene. The Australian Embassy in Manila follows developments in cases such as these including, where possible, through the lawyers of the persons detained. The Philippine Government is, I believe, aware of the interest in Australia in alleged violations of human rights in the Philippines. As for the Australian Government, it is deeply concerned about violations of human rights wherever they occur. The Government's position on internationally accepted standards of human rights is well known including to the Philippines Government. This position has been reiterated in a number of international fora.</PARA>
