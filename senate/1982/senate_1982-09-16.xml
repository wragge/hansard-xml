Could the Minister please advise as to the possibility of this Government questioning the authorities in Guatemala on the disappearance of 70 Guatemalan politicians between January 1980 and January 1982 as reported in that country's printed media? I ask this question in the light of the fact that Amnesty International has been unsuccessful in its attempts to investigate these disappearances and an approach from the Australian Government to the Guatemalan authorities on this matter could prove to be of assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, concerns a matter that I think will be of public interest, or at least of interest to those very many sporting people who reside in this country, that is, the code of conduct for the Commonwealth Games that Australia is being asked to sign. I must say that I have had difficulty in obtaining a copy of that document although it may well be shown to me during the day. Has the Minister seen the document? Is it true that the New Zealand Commonwealth Games Committee has refused to sign the code because it feels that to do so would be overstepping its authority as it says the code applies to sportsfolk outside its jurisdiction? Is it true that, if the Australian Commonwealth Games Committee signs that code, it may well be to the detriment of many sporting Australians? Why should such a group-indeed any group -be able to dictate to other sportspeople? Will the Minister arrange for the code to be released to the public so that we can have some discussion of the issues and so on that may result from the signing by Australia, behind closed doors, of a code that may well be used to apply pressures to people who in no way are involved in the Commonwealth Games?</PARA></TALK.START>

Since I have not seen the document, I really cannot be aware of the answers to his subsequent questions, important though they are and desirable as answers may be. It is appropriate, therefore, that I ask the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment whether he has the document in question, if he does not have it whether he can obtain it, and whether he can then answer the questions put by Senator Townley, including the request that the document be released for more public scrutiny.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, concerns an article in yesterday's Australian Financial Review which drew attention to the possibility at the moment or in the immediate future of a reduction in iron ore and coal exports to Japan. Has the Leader seen the article, particularly the passage in the article that says that union unreliability, particularly in the iron ore industry, is not essentially a cause of the potential drop in exports? Has the Leader ever seen, as I have over many years, large queues of iron ore carriers off Port Hedland? Does he agree with the article? My experience is that union unreliability must be a cause of a drop in exports. Does the Leader find the statement on this matter in the Australian Financial Review hard to accept?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I saw an article in the Australian Financial Review yesterday relating to the fall in exports to Japan of iron ore and coal. It is, of course, a matter of judgment and not precision as to how much of the fall is due to shrinking markets around the world. I indicated yesterday the excess steel capacity of the free world. However, I can say emphatically to Senator Martyr that in a series of discussions in the past year at ministerial level both here and in Japan I have been told a number of times by the Japanese of their concern about industrial troubles and port delays in Australia. The Japanese Ministers have expressed the greatest concern about the necessity for any contracts that are made and maintained to be based upon the absolute reliability of the supplier as in normal times the ore goes from port to ship to port and then to mills literally in a 24-hour timetable situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At all the ministerial discussions, particularly the discussions with individual Ministers, the reliability of Australia has been raised and argued with us. The concern in relation to industrial matters has been stressed to us, as have worries about the inadequacy of coal ports and loading ports. Of course, the queues of ships off New South Wales have been disastrous in terms of exports in recent times. The simple fact is that, whatever may be the judgment as to how much has been caused by the recession and how much has been caused by our unreliability as a trader, in looking to the future Australia must be able, if it wants to be accepted as a reliable partner in the world, to put aside its industrial conflicts and to unbutton the bottlenecks at the ports and loading zones.</PARA>

I made the point that along with the question of industrial confict there was the problem of ports, of facilities for loading and for handling, and of infrastructure. That has been stressed to us. Of course, quite clearly the need for the development of better infrastructure, particularly at ports, is one of the factors which would create a disability for the future should things look up and contracts wish to expand.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is a question of some detail, but important detail, on an item that appeared at page 359 of the United States Nuclear Proliferation Factbook of September 1980. The item is in the section devoted to United States nuclear weapons incidents. One could almost substitute the word 'accidents' for ' incidents' but it is headed 'incidents'. On that page it states that on 16 and 17 June 1968 a weapons system was aboard the United States cruiser Boston and the Australian destroyer Hobart.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will be aware that Griffith University is the site of some of the facilities, in particular, residential facilities, that will be used for the Games. I can understand Senator Martin's concern that students may experience some disruption as a result of the need to adjust the academic year. The teaching year at Griffith has been rearranged to take account of interruptions in September and October. It will consist of two semesters, each of three months, before the Games and will be followed by a period of assessment after the Games. That may go on until a little later than normal. Students at the university who qualify for allowances under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme for 1982 will, in fact, subject to normal conditions , receive those allowances in full to 31 December. Therefore, although the academic year of the university will have to be adjusted to take account of the Games and to allow participants to use the facilities that have been provided, there will be no adverse consequences for students in terms of TEAS allowances. Nor will there be any disadvantage to students in this regard as a consequence of the teaching year being interrupted.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am not able to advise Senator Lajovic whether the financial details of the project are as he has stated but I will try to obtain that information for him.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate follows the question asked by Senator Martyr and the Minister's reply. Has the Minister seen the front page article in the Australian of 7 September in which Mr Bruce Watson, the managing director of MIM Holdings Ltd, stated that the country's industrial relations problems are often over-stated and 'are not about to lead to anarchy'? Did he see in the same article where the chairman of the Shell group in Australia, Mr Kevan Gosper, is reported to have said that the country did itself a great deal of disadvantage by continually hawking its industrial problems and that management must take a lot of the responsibility for that? Does the Minister consider these two views to be reasonable and, if so, when his colleagues and the media next become involved in blaming the trade union movement for Australia's ailing economy will he remind them that fact should be separated from sensationalism in the field of industrial relations?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very happy to convey to the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Wran, the symptoms that Senator McIntosh has just expressed because Mr Wran, uniquely, has been most strenuous in his attack upon elements of the trade union movement for holding the whole of New South Wales and other parts of Australia to ransom. One should not be selective. Right at this moment Australia is experiencing a most serious, crippling strike and emergency legislation has had to be introduced to give directions to break through a bottleneck of a group of trade unionists.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct myself to that. I said before that the Japanese had raised at each of the recent ministerial meetings the question of industrial relations in Australia. I did not say that all the blame should be laid at the feet of the trade union movement. I make that perfectly clear. I believe that the polarisation of conflict between management and worker in this country is ugly and totally unnecessary. I have always said that and I have never been in a situation in which I would level blame in that regard in a polarised way. Until management and worker come to an understanding that they have a common interest and not a civil war this country will suffer continuously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have seen a number of reports and I believe what Senator McIntosh says is accurate. Both those people said that there is presented to the outside world an exaggeration of our industrial strife in comparison with other countries. I have argued that very strongly on the international scene, and so have other Ministers. I have argued to the Japanese and I have argued to the Europeans that, whilst we are not without blame in our industrial situation, we sit unhappily at about the middle in the world based on our industrial conflict performance. I do not want to say that my response to the question by Senator Martyr on Western Australia was aimed at any one target. I aimed to say that the world outside, those who buy our products, are very concerned that we should be reliable partners. They are concerned that we have the infrastructure to supply the things they need and a little reflection on the matter will remind Senator McIntosh that that is what I said.</PARA>
<PARA> I would be very happy indeed to work with anyone who would seek to minimise the conflict that lies in industry, and that is what the Government is trying to do. The Government is trying to see, through the very great benefits provided in the present Budget and through consultations with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and employer organisations, that it can come to a better understanding. I hope that in the longer run we reach a bipartisan situation in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The loans scheme which has been proposed by the Government will give very considerable benefit to students, and because of the means test, which is the threshold test, the benefits will be directed towards the less well -off students. The scheme which has been announced, with its very generous rate of interest subsidy and its loan repayment holiday, will benefit students who take advantage of it. As the honourable senator will know, the Government has proposed that the interest rates payable by students will be 5 per cent less than the ruling overdraft interest rate. This would be a very preferential rate of interest for those students who take loans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have heard expressions of some fears from student representatives, and indeed I received a delegation yesterday, as did some other senators. The only tests which are being applied are income tests and the test that students should be full time students. It has never been intended that the scheme should be made available for part time students. It is for full time students who are needy. The proposal will add a further benefit and a further option to those undertaking tertiary education. Because it offers an extra benefit and an extra option, it is something which I hope the student community will welcome. Because it is optional, it is entirely up to students whether they use it, but it is generous and it carries no risks for students who may wish to take advantage of the scheme.</PARA>

I understand that the matter is being brought to the attention of the relevant Minister and to the Government of the Northern Territory in case there is something that they wish to do within their legislative responsibility. In May of this year the Minister for Communications issued a Press release in which he drew attention to the disabilities which may occur if people continue to disadvantage themselves by purchasing television receivers which are not equipped with UHF capabilities, as Senator Kilgariff pointed out in his question .</PARA></TALK.START>

The Minister is concerned by rumours that some cheap receivers not equipped with UHF capability are being sold, particularly in the Northern Territory.

Ltd to stand down some 2,500 workers in New South Wales and its warning that further retrenchments could be on the cards at Whyalla in South Australia. Is the Minister aware that one of the reasons given for these latest retrenchments is the unacceptably high level of steel imports? Does this not contradict the statement made by the Prime Minister on 27 August that the Government's decision not to restrict the level of steel imports would not create unemployment in the industry? Does the Minister not agree that a continuing high level of steel imports, coupled with a shrinking domestic market for steel, has contributed to the pressure on BHP to reduce its production and hence its work force? Will the Government urgently reconsider its decision not to limit steel imports in view of the worsening unemployment situation not only in the steel industry but also throughout the economy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter raised by the honourable senator is one about which a number of statements have required correction over recent days. There is, of course, a great deal of concern about the state of the steel industry in Australia. That concern was reflected, I think, at the meeting which was held yesterday between the Government and the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia. Mr Short was in Canberra with other officers of that union. As no doubt the honourable senator is aware, there was agreement that a steel industry council should be established which would have a role in determining the longer term level of assistance and protection for the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the recent retrenchments are concerned, however, I refer the honourable senator to the Press release which was put out by the Acting Minister for Industry and Commerce on 14 September. The Press release followed an announcement which came from BHP linking the retrenchments to the Government's decision. Mr Fife pointed out that he in fact had received an assurance from the management of BHP that the announcement of retrenchments was not in any way the result of the Government's temporary assistance decision. The simple fact which underlies that statement is that, as Mr Fife was informed by the company, the products subject to temporary assistance were not produced at the steelworks in Newcastle which is the works at which the retrenchments occurred.</PARA>
<PARA> The matter is not just a straightforward one of saying that if we granted some additional temporary protection, as requested, the retrenchments would not have occurred because the request did not relate to the sort of steel which is produced in the area where the retrenchments occurred. There are difficulties in the steel industry but it is not the view of the Government that those difficulties will be met simply by applying protective provisions. The matter is before the appropriate authorities for inquiry at the moment. The matter will be watched very carefully by the Government as this, of course, is a very significant industry for Australia. Clearly it is being watched very carefully by the relevant trade unions which are concerned. The matter no doubt will be the subject of discussion and announcement from time to time.</PARA>

I ask: Is the Minister aware of a scheme proposed by the British Secretary of State for Employment who believes that young people in Britain are unemployed because they are pricing themselves out of jobs? He thinks they may be able to gain experience and enter the labour market by accepting very low wages for a beginning. I ask whether the Australian Government is giving any consideration to any scheme of this type? Is it giving consideration to an attack on the problems of youth unemployment by allowing them, for example, to work on a hourly basis; by encouraging them to work a shorter week which they may be better able to handle, such as 20 or 30 hours; and by breaking the strangling consequences of minimum wage provisions for 16 and 17-year-olds?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not part of the Government's programs to tackle the very serious question of youth unemployment by arranging either reduced hours or reduced pay in that sector. I think it would be common ground around the chamber that the price of labour does have a very significant effect on the demand for labour and it is undoubtedly true that the cost or the award rates applying to young and inexperienced workers may well be at a level where the employment of such workers is simply not economic. The Government's response to that has been not to seek the lowering of those award wages in its tackling of this problem to date. Rather, it has provided a series of subsidies to employers which, of course, have the effect of reducing the cost of labour to the level at which it is to the economic advantage of the employer to employ. One achieves the same result but, of course, at very considerable cost to the taxpayer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are very significant subsidies with respect to a great number of apprentices employed in Australia through the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training Scheme. There is the Special Youth Employment Training Program. Subsidies are available for unemployed youth who have been out of work for some time. In the recent Budget there was a considerable expansion of those programs in money terms and also, as I recall, some liberalisation of the administration with the view to giving the eligible young unemployed the opportunity of looking for employment virtually armed with a commitment that they would be eligible for the subsidy. The Commonwealth Government has responded to the problem that is raised by the honourable senator in his question by subsidy rather than by seeking employment at reduced rates.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no area in which one is more likely to get suggestions for change than this because there is widespread community concern about unemployed youth. All honourable senators, I am sure, receive representations which suggest, for example, that those receiving unemployment benefit might be asked to provide some service for it. That is a suggestion which has been raised frequently. Many proposals are put forward. I merely wish to say to the Senate that the Government has tried to approach the problems of unemployed youth in a coherent fashion. It has looked at the education area, which is the responsibility of Senator Baume, and has tried to ensure that the allowances available for both secondary students and tertiary students are available at a level, and to people on such incomes, which will ensure that education remains a viable option for the great bulk of young people. I think two-thirds of the 15, 16 and 17-year- olds in Australia remain in education. We have looked to the subsidisation of employment and we have looked to improving the resources available to those who work with unemployed and homeless youth.</PARA>
<PARA> I thank the honourable senator for the suggestion which is contained in his question. I will ensure that it is drawn to the attention of Mr Macphee and that it is taken into account in the continuing consideration which we three Ministers in particular give to the problems of people in this particular age group.</PARA>

I do not think that any piece of legislation has been considered more widely by the people affected by it than this legislation has been. There was evidence of very great support for it. On looking back through the debate in the Senate I was struck by Senator Walsh's contribution when he pointed out the absurdity of so many of the objections to the legislation which he characterised as being the product of Lygon Street farmers. I was sorry that some of the subsequent speakers from his party reflected some of the views of Lygon Street farmers, but that is not his fault. In any event, there would be great disappointment at the failure to pass the plant variety rights legislation, for the sorts of reasons indicated by Senator Archer in his question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware that one of the critical reasons why people wanted the legislation to be passed was the desire to have available certain improved varieties which are required by growers and which are not available because the protection of PVR legislation is not available. That is a matter on which I agree with the suggestion put forward in the question. The establishment of a PVR scheme in Australia could have resulted in a significant increase in the number of overseas varieties which could be multiplied under contract for re-export.

Is the Minister about to approve a proposal to hand over ANL's Tasmanian administration to a private shipping interest under the umbrella of a joint company comprising Webster Travel and ANL? What is the merit of this proposal, given the fact that ANL opened up and expanded its Tasmanian operations to eliminate overcharging by agents? I do not, of course, mean to reflect on Webster Travel at all in that statement. However, is the Minister aware of the fact that only quite recently Webster Travel relinquished its ANL sea-road accreditations and is no longer a passenger agent in Hobart and Launceston? Will the Minister for Transport and Construction give an assurance that no decision will be made on this matter until all of the facts of the situation are investigated by him and preferably after a debate in this place or in the other House?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Acting Attorney-General. It follows a question directed by Senator Evans to Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle yesterday. Is the Minister aware that tax avoidance by trust stripping has been operating on a major scale in Australia since about 1978, that it has continued unabated despite the enactment of Part IV of the Income Tax Assessment Act in 1981 and the amendments to section 100A, and that it is established to have cost the revenue very large sums of money, possibly of the order of hundreds of millions of dollars, as with bottom-of-the-harbour schemes? Has any, and if so what, advice been supplied by the Attorney-General's Department on this subject? Has the Attorney-General's Department been involved in contemplating conduct or any conduct relating to legal proceedings against those involved in these schemes?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question asked today by Senator Button, the question asked yesterday by Senator Evans and the statement by Senator Evans this morning are a little strange in light of the fact that the Government has in fact taken substantial action in this area. It was the subject of a detailed statement issued by the Treasurer on 11 May 1982. I have no particulars of the advice supplied by the Attorney-General's Department in the course of preparing for the action which was taken, but I refer both honourable senators who have raised this matter to the Treasurer's statement of 11 May 1982, which deals in considerable detail with the question of trust stripping.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 4 December 1980 any person who enters into an arrangement for the purpose of securing that a trustee will be unable to pay the trust's income tax liability has been liable to prosecution under the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. In other words, such persons are subject to severe criminal penalty. If Senator Evans has evidence that in fact those procedures are still being used, certainly he should draw any such evidence to the attention of the Commissioner of Taxation or the Government, as he would wish-the Commissioner is the person responsible-because it would appear that criminal offences are being committed. That is something which would be of very great concern to the Government. The advice which is available to the Government-I quote here from information provided by the Treasurer to my colleague who represents the Treasurer in this place, in response to the query which was made by Senator Evans-is that in fact the practice is at an end. It is a practice which on our advice is not currently proceeding. But, as I said before, if there is any evidence to the contrary we would certainly wish to know about it.</PARA>
<PARA> The other thing is that the Treasurer announced in the statement I have mentioned that, if there was any deficiency in the law with respect to dealing with these schemes, the Government would legislate back to that date to correct the law. In other words, the Government has put on the public record that it is prepared to legislate back to that date of announcement if some technical reason requires it. There is no technical reason known to the Government; but, if it emerged that there was, the Government would legislate to catch the practice. Whilst I cannot respond by saying what advice has been given by the Attorney- General's Department-I will have to take that part of the question on notice-I can say that this matter has been attended to, that the practice is one which carries very significant criminal penalties and that the advice we have is that the practice is one which has effectively been terminated but that, should that not be the case, we would wish to have any information which is available to the Opposition so that it can be attended to.</PARA>

<PARA> I have arranged for the letter to be presented to Archbishop Glemp or his representative by the Ambassador in Warsaw. I shall inform you when this has been done.</PARA>
<PARA> The Ambassador in Warsaw has already attempted to pass the text of the Senate resolution to the Polish authorities through the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I regret to inform you that the Ministry refused to accept the text. It was clear, however, that the Ministry was fully aware of the terms of the resolution and of the Senate debate which they described as 'gross interference in Poland's affairs'. By their reaction, the Polish authorities made it plain that they remain sensitive to Western condemnation of the continuing imposition of martial law. They can be in no doubt as to the extent of parliamentary and community concern in Australia at the situation in Poland.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that Senator Harradine has conveyed the text of the Senate resolution to two representatives of 'Solidarity' who recently visited Australia . It would be difficult for our Embassy in Warsaw to pass the text directly to representatives of 'Solidarity' in Poland. As you will know, the movement has been suspended by the Polish Military Council and operates underground.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish first to voice my disappointment that this annual report arrived the day after the estimates for the Public Service Board had been considered by the relevant Estimates Committee. It is a fairly well printed document and I see no reason why it could not have been available to Committee members to peruse before we looked at the Estimates. That it arrived the day after is a matter for regret. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to comment on one or two aspects of the report. The first relates to the staff ceilings. The Board notes with pride that over a period of a year there has been a 1.6 per cent reduction in the staff employed in the Public Service. When, at the Estimates Committee hearings, you ask the various heads of departments or assistant secretaries of departments whether these staff reductions are affecting their efficiency the answer is always that they are not . If, in fact, the departments are below establishment level and their representatives are asked, 'If you are operating efficiently, why should you go up to your establishment level?', you rarely receive an answer that is convincing. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe we can see already in two areas, those of the Australian Taxation Office and the Crown Solicitor's Office, the problems that have been caused by these staff reductions. Reductions in the staffing of certain departments have been penny wise and pound foolish. That was seen last year in respect of the Taxation Office, concerning which it was suggested that some 140 jobs in the enforcement and prosecution section might go by the board. However, it was estimated that $45m would then have been lost to Consolidated Revenue, compared with a proposed saving of $1.5m. The second aspect of the report is that the Public Service Board, as does every other section of the Public Service, uses consultants. Everywhere we look in Estimates figures or annual reports we find that these bodies are employing consultants at very high rates of pay. I wonder why an organisation such as the Public Service Board cannot obtain expertise from within its own ranks to carry out some of the studies that are undertaken. It is a specialist body, expert in systems of administration and how departments should be run. For the life of me, I cannot see why so many consultants are needed. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of the report with which I strongly disagree concerns page 6 where, under the heading of 'Industrial action in the Service', the Board makes the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA> The Board reiterates its conviction that industrial action by public servants cannot be justified and in the longer term can only prove damaging to the Service. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a fairly bald statement. I do not mind the Public Service Board criticising in its reports specific industrial actions and backing up that criticism with whatever evidence it can adduce. What I do object to is the Board making the statement that it believes that any industrial action by public servants is, ipso facto, wrong. We all know that without some sort of industrial protection by unions in the Public Service this Government would make public servants the pacesetters in the community-that is, the downward pacesetters, the ones whose salaries would be reduced to set the example to the rest of the community. It is wrong for an annual report to contain such a slur against the unions. </PARA>
<PARA> I also think that the Public Service Board should have a look at the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It came out in the Department's annual report , published a couple of weeks ago, that there has been a 31.9 per cent turnover in its core staff. I do not know of any other area that has had a 31.9 per cent turnover in core staff. It seems to be a matter of pride for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet that that occurred. I can understand that there is a need for interchange of employment to get wider experience but I would have thought that a turnover of almost a third is far too great. The only other comment I wish to make is that the Board has reported on a devolution of the recruitment function by the Board. That is commendable. It has noted that it will be under regular audit and review, and this is one of the major steps mentioned in the report. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>Those of us who were privileged the other night to hear Don Talbot respond to questions dealing with the estimates for the Department of Home Affairs and Environment would now have a better appreciation of the complexities of a venture such as the Australian Institute of Sport. If we look at the situation objectively, in relation to sports achievements and the vast expenditure needed for specialisation in various sports, we find ourselves in the middle ground between, on the one hand, the intensity of Eastern European sports promotion designed to obtain the maximum number of Olympic Games medals and on the other hand, the United States private enterprise millionaire syndrome. The officers of the Australian Institute of Sport showed that it is a very difficult situation. I was one of those who were critical earlier of the Institute's failure to provide adequate facilities for the exponents of field games. A remedy to that problem has been achieved, and when we see a report of these dimensions we realise the vast amount of engine room work that has to be performed to achieve such a remedy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) was present at the Estimates Committee hearings dealing with the Institute of Sport when the delicate question-I am a non-smoker but am completely open on the matter-concerning acceptance of sponsorship from tobacco companies and other such organisations was raised. I appreciate the scrupulousness of the Institute in that regard but the point is that because of the gap left by the lack of sponsorship by such companies the Government has added responsibilities. As to the recruitment of potential stars in the various sports, one of the greatest difficulties is that many people who have been on the verge of Olympic selection have gone through the intensity of hard training up to the time they are 20 years old, but if they are rated only fifth or sixth they do not make the Olympic Games team, although their educational objectives have often suffered. That is why with squads in the various groups and sports enumerated here, it is inevitable that there will be personality clashes. I say that because I am pleased that Don Talbot has been reappointed. I suppose that it requires the wisdom of a Solomon to deal with highly dedicated athletes and at the same time the capitalist world in which we live. Obviously the performances of some Olympic stars are forgotten after a couple of years, and in the competitive world they find that often it is difficult to get a job commensurate with their abilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I go beyond that. I suppose that we were once a country in which there were cricket and the various football codes and none of the other sports meant very much. But today, probably, with television showing gymnastics and a host of other sports in close-up at the Olympic Games young Australians are given a far wider menu of the sports in which they may take part. We are in a scientific age and there are various methods of assessing the capabilities of the human body. This is one of the areas in which the Institute has had to marry muscular performances with mental needs. Overall, it is good to find that this first annual report gives the Parliament an indication of how the money has been spent . When minor tiffs arise between administrators and participants, perhaps we shall be mature and not have heresy hunts as to whether the adminstrator ought to go or whether the athlete should be sent to Coventry as well. </PARA>
<PARA> People such as Raelene Boyle have been unfairly criticised in some areas. As members of this place will know-I pay tribute to Senator Missen, who is not present; and Senator Martyr should not take offence at that-we took up the cause of Gael Mulhall over the unfair imposition in relation to breaches of particular amateur procedures. Much as we say that sport is above politics, the plain fact is that at the time-her case exemplified it-the Third World countries wanted to get even with the United States through one of their athletes, and Gael Mulhall found herself an innocent victim of the crossfire. Australia must maintain a fairly solid standard. When our athletes are unfairly stigmatised, we must stand up for them. </PARA>
<PARA> I must throw one brickbat. I refer to the South Australian Minister who was responsible for Home Affairs before the changes to the Ministry. When I raised the question of Gael Mulhall's unfair treatment with him, he lectured me in a letter by saying that this Government does not interfere in sport. But it did interfere in relation to those athletes who rightly argued that they should go to the Moscow Olympic Games. All I say about the South Australian Minister to whom I am referring is that I think that there were great double standards in saying to Gael Mulhall 'we shall not interfere in this; it is solely a domestic matter for the athletics federation', when the Government and himself and everyone else moralised on why people should not go to the Moscow Games. That is probably water under the bridge, but it had to be said. As far as this Senate is concerned, whether it be Gael Mulhall, Raelene Boyle or a host of other athletes , they all have our best wishes in the events in the coming weeks. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I note from page 24 of the report, which deals with surpluses and deficits over the years, that South Australia in 1978-79, under a Labor government, had a surplus of $6,453,000. The next figure shown is for the 1980-81 year. We find that, under the Tonkin Liberal Government, the surplus which was converted to a deficit of $6,585,000. The provisional figures for 1981-82 show a surplus of $ 491,000. I venture to say that the small surplus which the State has now has been brought about by allowing the Public Service to run down and also to handing out to private contractors much of the work which, under Labor governments, was done by government departments such as the South Australian Highways Department. Much of the work that that Department used to do is now being carried out by private contractors. A lot of the machinery-very good machinery-which was built up by the Labor Government over a period of 10 years has been either sold or let out at a very low rental to these private contractors who are now doing the work which the government departments did in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Having looked at Budget Paper No. 7, I say that if this Government remains in office much longer we will very shortly see South Australia coming to the Commonwealth Grants Commission, as Queensland does, to get very large amounts of money to allow it to function. When we look at the population figures shown in Budget Paper No. 7, we see that South Australia's population is predicted in this year to fall behind that of Western Australia. I think that bears out what I have been saying in this Parliament by way of notice of motion for some time, namely, that many thousands of people are leaving South Australia to go to other States. When we look at page 19 of Budget Paper No. 7, we see that the population of South Australia in 1982-83 is predicted by the Federal Government to be a figure which is 10,000 below that of Western Australia. So I venture to say that, if we do not get rid of the Liberal Government in South Australia very soon, we will be in for a very torrid time. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not possible for me to make detailed comments about the report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission on special assistance for the Northern Territory because I have had the report before me for only a brief period. Therefore, I will seek leave later to develop my remarks at a later stage. The broad comment one can make about the whole memorandum of understanding concerning financing of the Northern Territory since 1978 is that there has been a reasonable approach to it and the Northern Territory is getting assistance from the Federal Government. I used the word 'reasonable' because we have just finished an examination of the estimates of the Department of the Capital Territory and it will be known that I have been reasonably critical of the amount of money which has been made available to the Australian Capital Territory over the years. It is obvious that the Northern Territory still remains very much the poor cousin in relation to the amount of money that is provided to the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the memorandum of understanding the Northern Territory does receive extra money in place of the Grants Commission allocation. It started at $20m and is going down at the rate of $5m a year. Obviously at some time in the future there will be nothing available to the Northern Territory by way of this special grant and the Northern Territory will be looking to the Grants Commission for assistance with projects in the Northern Territory. In order to do that-of course, the Grants Commission is already doing it-the Grants Commission must assess the ability of the Northern Territory to raise revenue. I ask the Grants Commission to note that the capacity of the Northern Territory in this matter is particularly limited, basically for two reasons: Firstly, the small tax base of the Northern Territory and, secondly, the high cost structure. </PARA>
<PARA> I deal first with the small tax base. The Northern Territory has a population of only 130,000 and this includes many who are not in receipt of any wages. There is a high rate of unemployment in the Northern Territory and there is no indication at the present time that the employment situation will improve in the foreseeable future. Approximately 25 per cent of the Northern Territory's population are Aboriginal people. Many of those people live in areas where there is no possibility of employment. It is not a case of their not wanting to work; there is no possibility of employment because there are no industries in many of these areas. It is fair to say that in some of the areas there is a little possibility of industry developing at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Federal Government that it encouraged the development of self- government in the Northern Territory, as we all did. There was a move in the Northern Territory, spearheaded by Dick Ward and others, for self-government. The Federal Government, because of that encouragement, has some obligation to assist the Northern Territory. In relation to the high cost structure angle, it is fair to say that there is a higher cost of living in the Northern Territory than there is in the rest of Australia. There is a higher cost of accommodation and a higher cost of building one's own home. There is a higher cost of infrastructure of every sort, such as the cost of building roads and the development of electricity. As we all know, the Northern Territory faces problems associated with the geography of the place-the distances between centres and the amount of freight that must be paid to carry the normal necessities of life to remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I am coming to is that the Northern Territory cannot use the same base as the States. I appreciate that Western Australia and Queensland are also large areas but they do not have the same problems as the Northern Territory. They have large metropolitan areas. They have more developed commercial bases and better developed manufacturing bases. They are able to carry the problems associated with having a large geographical area. If we tried to use the standard that applies to the States we would experience problems. If we impose high taxes and high charges we will throttle the growing child before it grows to maturity. We may be pushed into imposing taxes which would be anti-social in their application. We must be careful about the way in which we raise money in the Northern Territory. I do not want to delay the Senate at this time. I would like to develop my remarks at a later stage. For that reason, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not wish at this time to speak to the report in detail but rather to raise again the question of the difficulty of actually even speaking to such a report in the time available. This was the only report on the list of papers tabled today which was not available prior to tabling; the difficulty being, of course, that the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume), who is responsible for the areas being in the Senate, the report was not able to be tabled until this time. However, there does seem to be a difficulty and I hope through you, Mr Deputy President, that we might be able to clear it up. I was under the impression that as soon as the Minister moved his motion in relation to these reports they would be available immediately to all honourable senators in the chamber. I sought a copy of this report but it seemed that it was not available. The first reason given was that it would not be released until it was reached on the list. I do not believe that that is in keeping with the Standing Orders. The second reason given was that it was not available because it had not arrived from the printers. I believe that if that is the case then such reports should not be tabled unless they can be released immediately to honourable senators at the time they are tabled. I would hope that you, Mr Deputy President, might be able, through the President, to seek from the Department of the Senate the actual issue of this document today to make sure that honourable senators are not deprived of the opportunity of commenting on reports because of their non- availability when they are supposedly tabled. I find the position incongruous. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the Senate, through the Senate Standing Orders Committee, will have to look at the problem of these documents which are not able to be discussed for want of time. There may be a better arrangement that we can come to in relation to this particular matter. Because of that position and because of the fact that I may wish to make some substantive comments in relation to a year which, in the Commonwealth Teaching Service, was extremely important particularly because of the hiving off of teachers from that service into the Northern Territory, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the reports. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's fifth report brings together and makes final recommendations on many of the matters covered in the first four reports presented. In particular the Committee has focused on the following issues: The circumstances in which authorities should be created; the degree of operating independence which should be granted to authorities; recommendations for an effective system of accountability for authorities; and categorisation of authorities for accountability purposes</PARA>
<PARA> The report contains a categorised list of authorities which updates the list contained in earlier reports and incorporates changes suggested by particular authorities and with which the Committee agreed. As detailed in the report, the categorisation is significant in that it is a basis for determining which functions should be performed by authorities, the independence required by authorities in particular categories and it also provides a structure within which financial accountability can be determined. In terms of financial accountability, the Committee generally concurs with proposals of the joint working party, which comprised the Department of Finance and the Auditor-General 's Office, that guidelines be provided for authority financial reporting. To enable the implementation of the guidelines, once finalised, the Committee recommends that they form part of an annual reports Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of an annual reports Act is another major recommendation contained in earlier reports of the Senate Finance and Government Operations Committee and the fifth report provides greater detail as to the contents of the proposed Act. Some of the inclusions in the annual reports Act are: Proposed guidelines as to financial statements as set out in the joint working party report; time limits for reporting by commercial authorities of six months and for other authorities three months; interim reports should be presented when it becomes clear that a full report cannot be presented in the recommended time period; that authorities not create subsidiaries with powers wider than their own; that ministerial approval be obtained prior to the creation of authorities; the same auditor should audit both the parents' and subsidiaries' accounts; and that prior to the creation of overseas subsidiaries to the authority should obtain prior ministerial approval and the Parliament must have knowledge of the proposal to create the subsidiary. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Committee has examined in detail the relationship between Ministers and authorities taking into account both the legal and the practical relationships which do and should exist. In particular the Committee has examined the question of ministerial responsibility in relation to authorities and the resultant effect that this can have on an authority's independence. The Committee recommends that where it is appropriate for the Minister to have any power of direction over an authority, the Minister should have a general power of direction with authorities maintaining a written record of directions so given and the Minister tabling them within six sitting days of their being made. In considering the relationship between Ministers and authorities, the Committee has also set out the role of the departments in terms of the authorities administered by their particular Minister of state. In particular the role of departmental members on authority boards is questioned and recommendations made that they should be non-voting members, with full access to information and documents, so as to avoid any question of conflict of interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also examines the economic impact and financial behaviour of authorities. The Committee considers this aspect of such importance that it is currently the subject of a separate major inquiry which will be reported on to the Senate in the new year. Reference is made to the question of sunset legislation. The Committee concludes that the review component of sunset is indeed essential but that this review could be achieved by other more cost- effective means. The experience of the limitations and failures of the United States of America sunset review system was in the mind of the Committee. Other matters referred to in the Committee's fifth report concern staffing of authorities and Australian Capital Territory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's sixth report continues our case study approach to the examination of particular Commonwealth statutory authorities. This report contains 15 individual reports which have been prepared by the Committee between November 1981 and August 1982. Six of these reports have been presented to the Senate previously but are reprinted in this report because they form an important part of the endeavour of this Committee to identify and develop the problems and suggested solutions to the problems revealed. I do not propose to detail the particular matters in regard to annual reports and other matters raised in this sixth report as essentially the solution lies in the recommendations contained in the fifth report. The provisions of our proposed annual reports Act will go a long way toward resolving the particular problems raised. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I would like to comment on two matters of significance. The Committee' s report on the Honey (Export Inspection Charge) Bill 1982 resulted in the Bill being withdrawn as the service to which the charge applied was found to be not required by the honey industry or overseas importers of honey. The Committee has also reported on the 1978-79 and 1979-80 annual reports of the Canberra Commercial Development Authority and it is with some concern that I report to the Senate that the Committee has found it necessary to censure board members for permitting the sequence of events constituting the saga set out in the report and their apparent unwillingness to resolve their problems despite the specific legislative provisions obligating them to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> In tabling the reports I wish to acknowledge the cost effectiveness of the new system of word processing introduced by the Committee secretariat for printing reports which has resulted in the fifth and sixth reports being printed within 2 weeks rather than the usual 2 months. I commend the reports to the Senate. I take the opportunity on behalf of the members of the Committee to acknowledge the work that has been done by the Committee secretariat and the very considerable contribution which it has made. I thank the Senate for the opportunity to make the statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few comments on the reports. I am a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Government Finance and Operations but I was not at the time a lot of the evidence was taken which led to the drafting of the fifth report. I must say I am enthusiastic about much of what is contained in it. I believe that the report will make a major contribution to public administration in this country although we acknowledge that much more work has to be done on many aspects of the administration of statutory authorities covered in the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Peter Rae gave a rough outline of the chapters in the fifth report. He mentioned that there was a categorised list of authorities. I think that this is a very useful document in that it sets out the many authorities of the Commonwealth. However, I think in some cases the categorisation is unsatisfactory in that we have much more refining to do. This points to an important aspect of the whole study of statutory authorities. I think that one cannot generalise too much about statutory authorities. One can make comments about the need for much more ministerial responsibility and accountability of authorities through their Ministers to the Parliament and the need for Ministers to be able to give directions and to have them carried through. But if one says that in too generalised a fashion one can easily be pulled up in relation to certain authorities where that would not be expected to apply. I refer to authorities such as courts and tribunals and the Australian Broadcasting Commission where most of us would say there has to be a high degree of independence about things like programming. So we have to be careful about generalising. Of course, the sorts of generalised comments that are often made about the need for accountability of business authorities are very true. </PARA>
<PARA> The list of statutory authorities has been expanded quite a lot because it includes Public Service officers who happen to be subject to an Act of Parliament passed in relation to their duties and responsibilities. For instance , the Director-General of Social Security is listed as a statutory authority. Yet, of course, he is head of the Department of Social Security. It just happens that the Parliament has passed legislation to prescribe certain of the activities of that office. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that this report will be very useful for the Labor Government which will doubtless come into office next year, or sooner if Malcolm Fraser gets a sudden rush of blood to the head before the end of this year. I think much of what is in the report reflects the thinking of the Australian Labor Party about the way in which Government ought to deal with statutory authorities under its control and the activities of Ministers in relation to statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of the fifth report that I highlight is the issue of the relationship between Ministers and authorities, and the power of direction. Again, as I have mentioned, it does not apply to all statutory authorities, only the relevant ones. In the conclusions on page 67, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> We consider that the legislative provisions governing the ministerial power of direction over local authorities are in need of change to ensure the accountability to the Parliament of those responsible for authorities' actions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers that where it is appropriate to have any power of direction then the minister should have a general power of direction in terms such as:</PARA>
<PARA>'The Corporation shall comply with any directions given to it by the minister with respect to the performance of its functions and the exercise of its powers' . </PARA>
<PARA>That section of the conclusion continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Difficulties are caused by giving ministers power over specific matters only. The implication in specifying these matters is that the minister has no power of direction over other matters. A general power of direction in the above term should form part of the Annual Reports Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The major advantage of giving ministers a general power of direction would be to remove any doubts about the implementation by authorities of government policy or guidelines. Ministers would always have the power to direct authorities to follow policies or guidelines, and authorities could expect to be thereby fully and accurately informed of their content, unlike the uncertainty which has arisen in the past. </PARA>
<PARA>But, as the Committee goes on to say, the important thing about ministerial directions is that they be published. If a Minister instructs an authority to do something, he should not be able to shelter behind the eventual action of the authority by saying that it was that authority's action. It should be clear that it was as a result of a specific direction from a Minister. The report discusses the way in which Ministers ought to provide direction in writing, the way in which the authority ought to publish those directions in its annual report, and the way in which a Minister ought to table in the Parliament in appropriate circumstances the direction so that, in those cases where it would be far too late for the public to be aware of the direction to wait for the annual report, the time limits can be observed. </PARA>
<PARA> Amongst the many matters covered in the fifth report I highlight also chapter 9 about the financial behaviour of business and similar authorities. I point to the discussion on page 94 about the payment of Commonwealth and State taxes and charges. Of course, this applies especially to business authorities. Business authorities would be better able to show their real costs and benefits if the relevant local or State government taxes and charges were paid. There is a very uneven implementation of this. Some authorities, such as Qantas Airways Limited, Trans Australia Airlines and the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, are subject to income tax. Others, such as Telecom Australia and Australia Post are not. There is an uneven application of State taxes and charges and local government rates though, of course, we need to note that some authorities in appropriate cases make ex-gratia payments for those rates even when they are not obliged to pay them. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to make one or two comments about the sixth report which, as Senator Peter Rae has said, covers reports on individual matters referred by the Senate to the Finance and Government Operations Committee. The outstanding feature of the report is that it shows such a wide range of authorities as having problems-problems which have been referred to the Committee. These range from the National Gallery to the Special Broadcasting Service, the Overseas Property Bureau, payments to an individual supposedly to advertise Australia overseas, the administration of the Cocos and Christmas Islands and the fishing industry. I suppose that if there is one theme that emerges it is the possibility of lack of communication in the administration of some authorities and in regard to some payments by departments. </PARA>
<PARA> In chapter 11 we read of the payments to Ken Warby of Spirit of Australia fame. It highlights some particularly poor ministerial administration by certain former Ministers of this Government and is worthy of attention. </PARA>
<PARA> Another example was provided by the Cocos Islands-Christmas Island administration, which again showed the benefit of the activities of the Finance and Government Operations Committee in bringing the authorities together and thereby relatively quickly solving problems that had continued for some time, apparently because of mere lack of communication. Much of the Committee's work is concerned with considering the tardiness of authorities in presenting annual reports. That appears to have some effect because certain authorities seem to be doing more to get their reports in on time. One of the key matters upon which the Committee is insisting is appreciation of the fact that annual reports are important but it is particularly important that they be presented early or they become of purely archival value only. In conclusion, I pay tribute to the staff of the Committee and the enthusiasm of the Chairman. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision to provide bounty assistance to the production in Australia of certain fresh berry fruits used for processing. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to adopt this form of assistance follows the Government's acceptance of a recommendation by the Industries Assistance Commission in its Report No. 276 of 24 August 1981 entitled 'Fruit and Fruit Products'. The report covered a wide range of miscellaneous processed fruit products and fresh and processed passionfruit and berry fruits. The Government's decision on that report was announced on 21 April 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepted the IAC's views that assistance in the form of a bounty rather than a tariff would be more appropriate in this case. A tariff on imports would have the effect of increasing the cost of locally produced jam and juice products using imported berry fruit and reduce the competitiveness of those jams and juices against imports. Furthermore a tariff was considered not to be an efficient means of assisting producers of berry fruits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the bounty to be payable at the rate of $100 per tonne of commercially cultivated fresh fruit provided to processors of the fruit. The bounty is to be paid directly to the growers of the fruit and bounty payments will be based on information provided in regular returns to be furnished by the processors. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme is to operate for a period of five years from 1 July 1982 and bounty payments in the first year are estimated to be $300,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The bounty will provide a level of assistance to the berry fruit industry estimated to be equivalent to a tariff of about 10 per cent. This level of assistance is in keeping with that recommended by the Industries Assistance Commission, and accepted by the Government, for most other fruit and fruit products covered by the Commission's report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government expects that the bounty scheme proposed by this Bill will assist growers to adjust to newer technology and greater mechanization so that they can withstand increasing competition from imports. The Government also expects that this assistance measure will ensure a greater uptake of locally produced berry fruits for processing. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise for taking the time of the Senate, particularly on an occasion on which we have Estimates committee hearings. I am always reluctant to do it in any case. Unfortunately, however, I was unable to put a question during Question Time this morning and I must raise the matter that I would have raised at that time. I shall try to be as brief as possible. The background is that the Commonwealth Electoral Office in the Northern Territory is refusing to supply candidates with enrolment cards to enable them to go out and enrol people, to get them on the electoral roll. The question that I would have put this morning was in two parts. Firstly, who made the decision? Was it the Commonwealth Electoral Office or was it a ministerial or a Government decision? The second half of the question would have asked the Minister whether he would ensure that candidates would have unlimited supplies of enrolment cards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that it is fair to say that parties of all political colours have carried out enrolment drives in their own particular areas. It is an important part of the campaigning activities of all candidates. When they go door knocking , if they knock on the door of a person who is not enrolled, they ask that person to complete a card, it is signed, and they take it back. I think that all of us who have campaigned at any time will know the advantage in that sort of situation. In the Northern Territory it is particularly important when those of us who are candidates or those of us who are in Parliament at present go to outlying, remote areas, either where Aboriginal people live or where there are stations with both Aboriginal and white populations. </PARA>
<PARA> It would seem to me that 100 per cent enrolment is what we are all about. It is the intention of all of us-the Commonwealth Electoral Office, politicians and the population generally-to try to get 100 per cent enrolment of all people. There should be no limitation or restriction whatsoever on enrolment. I am not suggesting that there is anything like the shocking situation that developed in Western Australia a couple of years ago; rather, that we are simply working towards that goal. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two possible responses: Firstly, that the Commonwealth office is doing the job, therefore we do not have to do it; and secondly, that in some way it is undesirable to have party involvement in enrolment. On the first possible response, let me say that I appreciate the work that the Commonwealth office is doing, particularly in the Aboriginal areas. I was involved in that before I came into this place, giving assistance from the Department of Education. I commend that office for its work. Nevertheless, why restrict it simply to that office? After all, if the Commonwealth Electoral Office misses some of those who ought to be enrolled, let that group that is missed out be picked up by the candidate. The office is obviously short of staff. All Commonwealth offices are short of staff at present, particularly in remote areas. The office is short of staff who have the expertise to deal with Aboriginal people, so I think that we can assist them in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> The second possible response is that there is something undesirable in candidates enrolling people. I reject that. I reject as nonsense any suggestion that any influence is exerted on people simply because one encourages them to fill out an enrolment card. Our method of balloting in Australia, our secret ballot, covers this. There is no possibility that simply because one gets a person on the electoral roll he will necessarily vote for one. Many of us feel that often when doing this work we may be getting votes for our opposite numbers . This does not concern me at all and I am sure that it does not concern anyone who travels around. </PARA>
<PARA> Our goal is to get 100 per cent enrolment. I feel that on election campaign is the ideal time to do so. The climate is right. We are talking to people about political matters. We can raise the subject of whether their names are on the electoral roll. If they say they are not, it is an ideal time to take out the card, get it filled in and signed and to take it back to the electoral office for processing. I remind the Minister that this work is done voluntarily and it assists the office to achieve the goal of having 100 per cent of all Australians registered on the roll. Rather than prolong the adjournment debate, I call on the Minister to instruct the Commonwealth Electoral Office to make sure that candidates, at least, are supplied with unlimited access to enrolment cards so that they may assist in this goal of enrolment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this adjournment debate I wish to make some brief comments on the Press coverage of the debate and vote yesterday afternoon on the motion to discuss a matter of urgency on South West Tasmania moved by Senator Chipp. I do not want to rehash the debate of yesterday or to repeat everything I said in my speech. But I think it was a pity that in some reports of the result no mention at all was made of the reason there was opposition to a vote being taken, and that reason is the existence of the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania, which is still operating and considering the very issue which the motion was about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am always loath to complain about what appears to be unfair Press coverage and I very rarely do it. But it struck me that in this case the coverage was incomplete. This applied particularly to the Tasmanian papers, which I assume got the Australian Associated Press report of the matter, and also Helen O'Neil' s report on PM last night. The interpretation in those reports was that the reason the Government and the Opposition senators voted against taking a vote on the original motion was that they were scared of people crossing the floor. I was incredulous about that. Of course, I cannot speak for the Government-perhaps one or two Government senators would have crossed the floor if a vote had been taken-but there is no way in the world that that would have applied to the Australian Labor Party. The original motion was along the lines of stated ALP policy, but the reason we did not want a vote on the motion was that the Senate Select Committee on which Senator Chipp and Opposition senators were serving was in existence. If the Opposition had moved such a motion on some other issue while that issue was before a committee we would have been shot down in flames by everyone concerned and accused of being rude to the Senate; it would be claimed to be part of our downgrading its role, opposing its powers and that sort of thing. I ask the Senate to consider the reaction which would have resulted from our moving such a motion. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously Senator Chipp briefed members of the Press about his opinion on why we did not agree to the original motion going to a vote. But I think his interpretation-if it was his interpretation-was wrong. If he had consulted us before raising the matter, as I suggested he should have done for courtesy's sake alone, there may have been a better result on the issue. I suspect that the fact of the motion and its not being voted on and the Press reporting that was inspired by it have damaged the work of the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania. Instead of emphasising the issue it has been downgraded. </PARA>
<PARA> One could be forgiven for suspecting-although I know it is not true-that somebody who took that action did not care about the issue but cared only about grandstanding on it to try to prove that his party was the only one which cared about such issues. As I said, I know that is not true but I suspect that it does make the work of the Committee and those of us on it more difficult. As I suggested in my speech yesterday I am upset about the tactics of the matter. I wanted the Committee's report to be credible and not to appear to be pre-empted by a decision of the Senate. I particularly ask those sections of the media that did not refer to the fact that a Senate select committee is inquiring into this matter to consider the Opposition's reason for voting against the notion that a vote be taken. I emphasise that we did not vote against the urgency motion. We believed that it was inappropriate for the matter to be voted on at that stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not detain the Senate long. Senator Coates seems to be complaining about a lack of courtesy on my part. He ought to know that one of the unwritten rules in the Parliament-it is a rule that is rarely broken by any senators or members-is that if one is going to be critical of another senator or member one pays that person the courtesy of informing him or her or the person's office staff about it. In this case Senator Coates did not do that. He chose to raise this matter without any reference to me first. He got up here today quietly during the adjournment debate and said: 'Obviously Senator Chipp had briefed the Press on his interpretation of events'. I categorically deny that allegation. No member of the Press knew of my intentions, knew what I was going to say or knew what my tactics were until after the event at about six o'clock when I simply gave copies of my speech to members of the Press and agreed to an interview with one journalist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am rather curious at the so-called outrage of Senator Coates and other members of the Australian Labor Party. Let me cite a couple of statistics. Since the Government lost control of the Senate, on 18 out of 21 Wednesdays-that is the day the proceedings of the Senate are broadcast-the Australian Labor Party has raised matters of public importance or urgency motions. It has had those opportunities by the grace, I suggest, of the Government, which could easily have got in before the Labor Party and raised matters of public importance or urgency motions. That course is open to any member of the Government. As a matter of courtesy, the Government has allowed the Labor Party to raise that number of matters. The Australian Democrats could have broken agreements and could have sneaked into the President's chamber at one minute past midnight in an endeavour to raise such matters. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Coates is whingeing about not having a fair go, let him look at the statistics. On 18 out of 21 occasions, the Australian Labor Party has had the floor when the Senate proceedings have been broadcast on a Wednesday. The Government has raised such matters on two occasions and the Australian Democrats only on one occasion since the Government lost control of the Senate. Senator Coates talked about lack of consultation but I point out that it was only one week ago, last Thursday, when a member of his own party put down in this chamber a matter of urgency without consulting the Australian Democrats, and without telling us that it was a matter of urgency instead of a matter of public importance. I think it is absolute humbug for him to get up here now and say that we owed it to somebody to tell some other political party about our intentions. I do not wish to canvass the matter as Senator Coates did today. I thought more of him and I thought he would have at least paid me the courtesy of telling me that he intended to raise this matter in the adjournment debate. Whatever he says, the fact remains that yesterday an opportunity was open to him to force this Senate to vote on an issue. He chose to deny the Senate that opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I should like to make it clear to Senator Chipp that the point of my remarks today was the failure of the Press to refer to the existence of the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania. The reference to him was a secondary reference, apart from the fact that it was very much a last minute decision on my part to rise in the adjournment debate. I should like also to point out in relation to Senator Chipp's remarks that I made no suggestion that the Australian Democrats were not entitled to raise a matter of public importance. There was no reference whatsoever to that. Of course they are entitled to raise their fair share of matters of public importance. In saying that there ought to have been consultation, I did not say that they had an obligation to consult other than in relation to the South West Tasmania issue . My point was that, to ensure that the issue was dealt with in an appropriate way, it was my opinion that it would have been preferable for consultation to take place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Briefly, I wish to foreshadow a matter that I will raise and to give the Senate notice of an intention. I believe that it would be desirable if one of the Senate committees were to consider the following terms of reference:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The impact in Australia upon labour and labour related costs including wage and employment agreements of various forms of protection arising from:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) customs tariffs and quotas</PARA>
<PARA> (b) natural protection of an industry from international competition, for example, the building industry</PARA>
<PARA> (c) other forms of imposed or natural protection from international competition . </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think that I need to elaborate in detail as to why I believe it would be of value to the whole of Australia for some work to be done by a Senate committee in relation to these questions. I believe that the public debate in relation to them is not necessarily well-informed. There are many matters which affect the economy and the management of the economy of Australia which are not just industrial matters. This matter is not raised for the purpose of having a mud-slinging exercise but rather to try to find out what is the situation in relation to protection and what is the impact. The National Farmers Federation and other organisations continually express their concern. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd and others have expressed their concern. The Industries Assistance Commission has at times had to deal with the matter. But I do not believe that a parliamentary committee has ever conducted the type of inquiry which I think could help the consideration of the matter and the application of principles in relation to these questions. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore wanted to speak very briefly to indicate to the Senate that in the future I will be raising this matter formally as a reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce, possibly even to the same committee which has been looking at the questions involving the Bendigo Ordnance Factory and the Coburg Clothing Factory, or to some other committee. Part of the reason I raise this matter in this way is to invite some thought on the part of honourable senators as to which would be the most appropriate way that this objective could be achieved. I thank the Senate for the opportunity of raising this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter which I first raised in this chamber by way of a question on Tuesday, 24 August. I put a question in two parts to Senator Chaney in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Primary Industry and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. I referred to the very serious problem which is now occurring in the timber industry in the south-east of South Australia. I asked him what the Government or what Mr Lynch, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, was doing to try to eliminate this problem. I pointed out to the Minister that the problem was being created by imports of cheap New Zealand timber in particular and of some from the United States of America. I asked my question and the Minister in part of his answer said that Mr Lynch had met also with representatives of the South East Trades and Labour Council of South Australia. I knew that because I arranged the deputation of the representatives of the South East Trades and Labour Council to meet with Mr Lynch in Melbourne. I accompanied those representatives to Melbourne to have talks with the Minister. While we were there the Minister said that he would be making a statement within a week or so as to whether there would be a reference to the Temporary Assistance Authority on whether any dumping was taking place, but he did not make a statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chaney was not able to inform me about what was happening except to say that some representatives of his Department were going to carry out further talks with representatives of the equivalent departments in New Zealand. I accepted that but I was very surprised when I picked up the Hansard of Thursday, 26 August and saw a very detailed statement, plus a document which was incorporated, by the Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Hodgman, who was representing Mr Lynch, which obviously was in answer to a Dorothy Dix question from the Federal member for Barker, Mr Porter. I can only assume that having read the Hansard of Tuesday he was prompted to take some action about the problem in the south-east of South Australia because to my mind that is the first time he has gone public about the problem which exists in the south-east. He was able to get a very detailed answer-much more detailed than I was able to get. Obviously Senator Chaney was just as aware of the matter as Mr Hodgman because when we analyse the two answers we see that the answer which I received from Senator Chaney on the Tuesday was in exactly the same words as Mr Hodgman's answer in the House of Representatives. Mr Hodgman was even pulled up by the Speaker because he was going on for too long with his answer. There were a couple of interjections. Mr Hurford said:</PARA>
<PARA> More talks! What is he doing about it?</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to Mr Lynch. Prior to that he had said by way of interjection:</PARA>
<PARA> What is he doing about it?</PARA>
<PARA>Later my colleague Mr Morris, the honourable member for Shortland, raised a point of order. Arising out of that Mr Hodgman had incorporated in Hansard a document. So it would appear that it was quite obvious that the Government was prepared to give more details of what Mr Lynch was doing to the member for Barker even though he was two days behind me in asking the question. I have had some detailed involvement in the problem which exists down there and it concerns me. I hope that, in future when I ask questions, if the Government has the information to hand it will at least give it to me when I am up on my feet first and not keep it until the honourable member for Barker reads the Hansard, sees what I have been trying to do for the people and then comes in on the grouter, as the saying goes. The other part of the question about which I am most concerned and which I raised on that occasion has to do with the proposed closure of the cellulose mill at Millicent. On that day I asked Senator Chaney:</PARA>
<PARA> Has the Government received any representation from the South Australian Premier, Mr Tonkin, for assistance in preventing the cellulose paper mill at Millicent from closing, with the resultant loss of more than 300 jobs? If no representation has been received, will the Minister take immediate action to ascertain what is required to prevent the closure from taking place?</PARA>
<PARA>I had to ask a supplementary question and remind Senator Chaney that he had not answered. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I have no information in my brief on that matter--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the cellulose mill-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I will have to check that point and let Senator McLaren have a further reply. </PARA>
<PARA>More than three weeks have now gone by and I have not received any information from Senator Chaney as to whether the South Australian Liberal Premier, Mr Tonkin, has done anything to try to keep that industry in the south-east. I was very disturbed to read in the Adelaide Advertiser of Wednesday, 15 September 1982, under the heading '175 SE jobs may go, says union', an article written by an industrial reporter called Michael Grealy which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A paper-manufacturing plant near Millicent employing 175 workers may be closed, according to the major union at the plant. </PARA>
<PARA> The State president of the Pulp and Papermakers' Federation, Mr F. J. Haggis, said yesterday unions had been called to a meeting in Melbourne today to hear a decision on the plant's future. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Haggis said that since then APM had expanded its plants interstate but ' virtually nothing has happened here'. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on further to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Local quality could not match the product made interstate, where the company had installed modern machinery. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what concerns me. We have a government in South Australia which was elected on a promise, among others, to stop the job rot and to get industry on its feet. Its claim at the time, that industry was lagging in South Australia under the then Labor Government, has been proved to be untrue by what has happened in the last three years. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about the statement of Mr Haggis that local quality could not match the product made interstate where the company had installed modern machinery. I would have thought that if the Tonkin Government was concerned about retaining people-and I pointed out that South Australia had slipped behind Western Australia in terms of population when I spoke in this place during the tabling of papers-it would have taken some action to assist this industry, if it needed financial assistance, to upgrade its machinery so that South Australia could compete with Victoria. I would have thought Mr Tonkin would have been very interested in this matter and that perhaps Mr Porter would have acquainted him with the problem in view of the fact that they both belong to the same party. I have no doubt that the ability of the work force in the south-east of South Australia is equal to any. The article points out that members of the work force have been in the industry for a long time. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The average age of workers at the plant now was 48 and their average service was 16.5 years. </PARA>
<PARA>So the workers have had long experience in that industry in the south-east. However, it seems as though the industry is now to close as I predicted over three weeks ago in this place when I asked the Minister for Social Security ( Senator Chaney) what the South Australian Government had done to try to prevent this happening. It is quite obvious that the South Australian Government did nothing because Senator Chaney has not replied. I am wondering what is going to happen to the 175 people employed directly in the cellulose mill. If the mill closes down the figure of 300 I used, which was given to me by responsible people in the south-east, could be even greater because the closure would affect log fellers and a whole host of people such as those engaged in transport associated with the industry. When we lump that on top of the fact that imported timber from New Zealand and America has caused many of the mills in the south- east to go to a four-day week or a nine-day fortnight and the retrenchment of 75 workers following the closure of the Sapfor mill, we find that we have a very serious problem in the south-east. However, this problem does not exist only in the south-east. The article to which I am referring bears out the fact that Mr Tonkin is not doing the job he was elected to do and in respect of which he criticised the Labor Party. The article refers to other developments. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> United Trades and Labor Council industrial officer Mr R. L. Felmingham said about 2000 jobs had been lost in the SA manufacturing industry this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The State secretary of the Transport Workers' Union, Mr K. M. Cys, said 111 TWU members had lost their jobs in SA recently, most in August. </PARA>
<PARA> About 45 people are expected to be retrenched by Perry Engineering Co. Ltd, at Mile End. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Felmingham said a survey of affiliated unions in manufacturing industry showed a loss of 1417 jobs--</PARA>
<PARA>He is talking about South Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>since January. </PARA>
<PARA> The workers had been retrenched, made redundant or had accepted early retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> The survey of 18 companies showed 279 fewer jobs at Kelvinator Australia Ltd, 330 at General Motors-Holdens Ltd, 105 at ATCO, 125 at BHP, 75 at Sapfor Timber Mills--</PARA>
<PARA>That is the industry about which I have been talking-</PARA>
<PARA>47 at Gerard Industries, 50 at Kenwood, 95 at Tubemakers, 100 at NEI Engineering and 100 at Mount Barker tannery. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, living near the Mount Barker tannery I know that this enterprise has closed down and that the land is being sold. When we were in government I was able to get over a quarter of a million dollars to assist that industry, firstly through Mr Enderby when he was the responsible Minister and later through Senator James McClelland, who is now Mr Justice McClelland. Now, following the election of a Liberal Government in Canberra and a State Liberal Government in South Australia that industry has gone-it has been closed down and the property is being sold. One can go on and on. It is a whole sorry story about what is happening not just federally but particularly in South Australia. Governments, both Federal and State, appear to be closing their eyes to the problems of industries which are closing down and workers who are having to go on the dole. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disturbed that I have not had an answer, particularly from Senator Chaney. I do not blame him. He probably tried to get answers from those departments that he represents. But I have not had an answer. I hope that when we return here next week Senator Chaney or somebody responsible can put down an answer and in particular can tell us what Mr Tonkin is doing, if he is doing anything, to keep these industries in South Australia. As I said earlier in the debate on the Grants Commission report, the population of South Australia has now slipped behind that of Western Australia. That State is in diabolical trouble. </PARA>

Before I spoke, I indicated through the Whips that I did not really expect a reply from the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume), as I do not expect a reply from the Minister to what I am saying now. However, I did receive a reply from the Minister that night. But it was a petty and pompous reply. I received it from the Minister for Education. The reply was not fitting for the type of item that I raised and it was not the type of reply that I would expect from a responsible Minister.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some six honourable senators have spoken in this adjournment debate. I make some brief comments. Senator Robertson raised the question of an apparent denial by the Australian Electoral Office in the Northern Territory-in Darwin I think-to supply to candidates, or presumably others, quantities of enrolment cards. My comments are informal. I have a vague recollection of this matter having risen under my gaze at some stage in the last year or two and of some restriction having been imposed. The restriction was decided upon, as I understood it, by the Australian Electoral Office. I think primarily it was an attempt to stop an unlimited supply of enrolment cards. I can understand that, and I think Senator Robertson would. There could be unreasonable requests and, again from my memory, I think this has been evidenced in requests for some thousands of cards. My reaction was to say that, as I understood it, a right exists for any citizen to obtain electoral cards and to invite others to do so if they have not enrolled. I understood it had been settled on the basis that reasonableness would prevail. I will ask that Senator Robertson's remarks be referred. If there is more to add to what I have said, I will have it added. In any case, if my recollection is right, I will invite the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) to have discussions with the Australian Electoral Office to ensure that cards are available.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An hour or so ago Senator Chipp was speaking in the Senate and he drew attention in a general way to the state of confusion in which the Government finds itself, partly because of the many reefs and shoals that seem to beset it at the moment-largely of its own making, I might say-but also I believe because of a certain lack of will, a lack of ability, by the Government to perceive what the problems of the country are and to try to do something about them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this first reading debate on the Dried Fruits Export Charges Amendment Bill 1982 I want to draw attention to a subject I have mentioned before and which I think is very important; that is, the close association between the energy problems of the country and its unemployment problems. In other words, I wish basically to bring forward the thesis that if unemployment is to be controlled it will not be done by encouraging people to be trained in industries and occupations which are already overcrowded; it will be done by looking at new areas of activity and industry which are to the public benefit and, by doing that, making work for some of the people who are at present unemployed. this is not an original idea; it is being done in so many countries overseas that it worries me intensely that the Government of Australia has not yet got around to considering it as a serious proposition. I suggest that the Government, if it really wants to get back the goodwill of the people of Australia and to re- establish some faith in the processes of Government, should get to work on something like that, it should look at what is going on overseas, read the lessons and do something which would indeed-this has been proven; it is not just hypothetical-get many thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of Australians back to work. Indeed, as is happening in some countries, we might even get to the stage where there is virtually a labour shortage. It seems to the Australian Democrats that the Government is seeing the future through a telescope that is well out of focus-a myopic one-and that, as a result, its view is very vague and indistinct. It does not see any of the long term problems of the country and because of that it naturally does not see any solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment we are lulled into a false sense of security by the apparent world glut of petrol. I think all of us who appreciate the situation at all well understand that this will not last. It will be only a matter of a few years before we run out, in spite of the glut in production. The amount of petrol still underground is not increasing; it is diminishing rapidly. Every day that passes reduces the amount of oil that can be taken from our major field in Bass Strait. It is significant that the major rundown in production is only too likely to coincide with a crunch in the world supply situation towards the end of the present decade. If we want to do something about that we must do something now because of the lead times that are required to get that sort of industry into operation. For example, it taes some five years to get a methanol plant into operation. I think it will be much too late if we allow things to drift on until the end of the decade without doing anything about those matters.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is failing lamentably in this whole energy field. It persists, for its inscrutable reasons-I believe they are inscrutable-in involving itself more and more deeply with the discredited, uneconomic and dangerous nuclear power industry which we, of all countries, could very well do without. I think all Australians should be asking themselves what the reasons are. What reasons of money and influence determine this perverse policy of the Government? Why is it so concerned with only that area of energy? Why is it that so much money is being put into that area? The fact is that nuclear energy, and the manufacture of small, dirty atomic bombs of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki type, are very closely associated. Most of the countries now building so-called peaceful reactors-the ones which have not cancelled their orders-want them, not for power but to derive plutonium to make bombs. It is worth once again stressing the point that it is much easier and quicker to breed plutonium in a modern power reactor than it is to breed it in a fast breeder reactor. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Coates spoke about yesterday's debate on the South West Tasmanian dam. In the amount of media that I was able to see or hear this morning I was struck by the fact that the report zoned into one aspect only-that was a division in this place-and did not deal in any way with the reasons. I believe one can say, at the kindest, that the report was incomplete. Yesterday there was recourse to a fundamental principle of this Senate: It is that from time to time it selects subject matters that it believes need to be examined in detail, refers them to a Senate committee, and then defers debate upon them until it is adequately equipped to undertake it. For example, rightly or wrongly, today the Plant Variety Rights Bill has been referred to a committee as was, some weeks ago, the industrial relations legislation. There is no suggestion that, while that is happening there should be debate, on a motion of urgency or otherwise, on the relevant matters. Whether yesterday the urgency motion, if one draws a fine line , was within Standing Orders, does not matter. What happened was that the substantial majority, virtually all but some five honourable senators in this place, believed that we ought to proceed in the normal manner, bearing in mind that a Senate committee investigating a subject has all of the powers of the Senate. Therefore, we had empowered it to go ahead. It is a pity that it might have been construed that there were goodies and baddies yesterday, that for some reason or other there were baddies on both sides of this chamber opposing five Galahads of this world who wanted to fight for the rights of environmentalists. It may be that that was a public relations goal-who shall say. However, it would be proper if the media saw fit to put the matter into perspective. I do not enter the matter that was the subject of dialogue between Senator Chipp and Senator Coates. It seems to me to be one that is outside ministerial responsiblity. Arrangements made behind doors are matters of domestic concern, they can be sorted out otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that Senator Peter Rae has what he considers to be a subject of considerable importance, relating to industry protection, that he proposes to introduce at some time. I have no doubt that the Senate will give it due consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLaren raised what he considered was inaction in regard to two questions. As he would expect. I have no basic first-hand knowledge of either. I hope that all Ministers, as a general principle, treat impartially, all questions asked of them, and I believe we do. Apart from the ordinary melodrama of thrust and parry across the chamber, if a question is asked, it is the intention, certainly of the Ministers with whom I am associated, to give a fair answer. We welcome questions on notice, particularly, so that we can do that. I know nothing about the intervention of an earlier answer to another person in another place. I will draw the attention of the Minister to it and to Senator McLaren's comments. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, he has reminded me of a question regarding the cellulose mill at Millicent. I share his view, as would all honourable senators, that the loss of employment in any place, and there certainly, would be a bad thing. I regret that no answer has been given to him so far. I will refer his comments today, and the question, to the appropriate sources and seek an answer. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry that Senator Colston should have felt it necessary to rise to make the comment that he did. If he feels that he did not receive a satisfactory answer to a particular comment that he made, I will draw that to the attention of the relevant Minister and ask him to peruse Hansard. If the Minister feels then that he needs to comment, he may do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question from information furnished by the Australian Broadcasting Commission:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) A dispute has existed for a number of years which has prevented the ABC from expanding its use of electronic news gathering equipment. Electronic news gathering equipment has been used in the ABC for some time but its application is being restricted until the demarcation issue over the staffing and operational aspects of the equipment is resolved.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Electronic cameras were used for news gathering by the ABC in Sydney, Canberra, Darwin, Rockhampton, Townsville, before the demarcation dispute commenced and are still used in these centres. In other places the cameras have not replaced film cameras in news gathering but are in use for other purposes and in the electronic field production of programs. Information in relation to electronic news gathering equipment in commercial stations is not readily available.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The current demarcation dispute commenced in 1977.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The dispute appears to be nearing an end.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The total cost of equipment specifically purchased for electronic news gathering is estimated at approximately $1m and although the equipment has been purchased over a number of years, the bulk of its has been acquired in the last two financial years.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The ABC has used electronic news gathering equipment in various forms for approximately 10 years. As old equipment wears out it has been replaced with current generation equipment. No equipment has remained unused in store so long that it is now obsolete.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The staff ceiling for 30 June 1982 was 6,143 full time and 79 part time staff. As of 1 July 1982, the Australian Broadcasting Commission is exempt from the staff ceiling provisions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The staff ceiling for 30 June 1981 was 6,202 full time and 81 part time staff.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In technical areas, the normal staff has been augmented from time to time by temporary staff and staff supplied by contractors, to meet peak loads during work on colour television conversion, up-grading of radio studios in regional areas and for special projects such as the Commonwealth Games.</PARA>
<PARA> Contract cleaning, security, plumbing and electrical services have been used where possible so that available staff resources could be concentrated in the program production areas.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No ABC announcers or film cameramen are employed on short term contacts. Where contract staff in these areas are used they are engaged on renewable contracts of at least 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Contract cleaning has been widely utilised in the ABC since the mid-1950's and the extent of any prior costing or consultation with other authorities is not known.</PARA>
<PARA> The rates paid are checked from time to time against those approved by the Department of Administrative Services for the Commonwealth Government service and are considered to be broadly cost effective. Recent cost analyses related to plumbing, electrical and security services have tended to favour provisions of these services by ABC staff.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) There were no cuts in television production in 1981-82 as a result of the 1 per cent reduction in staff ceiling in that year. In the latter part of the 1981 -82 financial year a reduction in planned television production did take place but this was due to the need to reduce planned expenditure to meet part of wage and salary increases which had occurred during the year.</PARA>
