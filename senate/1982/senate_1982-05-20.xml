As far as the monitoring of effectiveness is concerned, the Department itself examines any of the expenditure that is used by it. In particular, I think that for the Government Information Unit and the dissemination of information about Government policies there would be mailing lists of different kinds for different departmental information. All of these things are subject to the same sort of inquiry as Senator McLaren or any other honourable senator may wish to pursue. I have no particular information with regard to the matter raised today . Senator McLaren seeks information about a particular figure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Finance aware of a recent report in the Australian Financial Review that the Government is delaying its substantive response to the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System until August this year? Does the Minister agree that home buyers are desperate not because there are no funds available but rather because they cannot keep pace with rising interest rates, now at an all time high, and because they would certainly not be able to cope with further increases which would inevitably follow a Government decision to deregulate interest rates as recommended in the Campbell report? Will the Minister give an assurance that the Government will not implement this recommendation but will instead maintain controls on housing interest rates, thereby enabling prospective home owners to make their commitment to buy a home without undue anxiety?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has announced on a number of occasions that many aspects of the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System are under study. He indicated that not one announcement but a series of announcements will be made as decisions are taken on the various aspects of the report. As far as home buyers are concerned, I think it ought to be remembered that at the time the report was tabled the Treasurer said that we would be looking particularly at the social consequences of any of the decisions that the Government might take on the recommendations of the Campbell report. In his statements at that time the matter of housing was raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the social consequences of housing interest rates are concerned, I remind the Senate that the Government's housing policy package which was announced some weeks ago contained measures of assistance to home buyers in the near future and recent home buyers. This package has shown the attitude of the Government in its effort to assist home buyers to deal with high interest rates. It has also given great assistance through the tax system and the Homes Savings Grant Scheme. Of course, it must be remembered that the banks have been helpful and co-operative in arranging for quite substantial increases in the housing funds available for those who seek them. The realities with regard to interest rates and the availability of funds cannot be ignored at any time we have this sort of discussion. However, as I said, the Treasurer, when introducing the Campbell inquiry report, spoke of the social consequences of decisions that are taken, and these are very much in the minds of members of the Government as they deal with the various recommendations.</PARA>

<PARA> Does the Minister understand that, in fact, Ampol supplies petrol to this franchise holder at 39.45c a litre and requires him to sell it at 0.65c lower than the price at which it supplies the petrol to him? He thus makes a loss of 0 .65c for every litre of petrol he sells and some two or three weeks later Ampol refunds him the amount lost on the petrol he has sold, plus a profit of about 2. 4c. Does this constitute a mark-up of 5.5 per cent? Is this agreement in accordance with the spirit of legislation recently passed through this chamber? Is Ampol putting itself in a situation where its franchise holders are, in fact, financing Ampol Petroleum (Victoria) Pty Ltd?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a long and complex question to which I have a long and complex answer. It is not, however, an answer with which I will enlighten the Senate at this stage. Of course, there has been a great deal of government intervention in this area, for the simple reason there have been very real difficulties for franchisers and retailers. The relationship between those individuals and the oil companies are now covered by a series of Acts which have been passed by this Parliament and which are in a sense unusual in the general commercial arrangements which apply within Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My advice is that this letter is in accordance with the legislation, provided no bad faith or anything other than what appears on the face of the letter is involved. Whether the letter gives rise to a need for further government intervention is a matter on which I would not give an opinion. In any event, I think it is probably a matter of policy, which I cannot respond to at Question Time. But I take the question to be an indication that Senator Lewis is concerned at the competitive position of this particular retailer, at the question of whether this agreement is within the law and, if it is, whether the law is therefore adequate to protect his interests. I will therefore seek a consideration of those various points and a more detailed reply, which may well be in the form of a letter from the appropriate Minister. The matter is an extremely complex one. Senator Lewis has reminded me that he has asked whether it is within the spirit of the legislation. I can only say that the legislation is intended to provide protection to this particular group but, at the same time , not to prevent real competition in the market place for the benefit of consumers. That is a very delicate balance. I prefer not to hazard a guess at this stage as to whether it is within the spirit of the legislation. I will undertake to give it further and careful examination.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and relates to an alleged breach, or an attempted evasion, of an agreement reached by Health Ministers at a meeting in Adelaide last year that negotiations would take place with tobacco companies about a voluntary advertising code, which negotiations have not yet proceeded because of lack of agreement among the State Ministers. I ask, firstly: Is it correct that representatives of a tobacco company met officers of the Department of Health on Wednesday, 21 April and that they showed the Department a series of filters which are capable of disguising the amount of tar and nicotine delivered by the cigarettes? Secondly, is the Minister aware that a brand known as Barclay has recently been launched on the Australian market, which is claimed to have a low tar delivery-that claim may be made because it has one of these filters attached -but which delivers a high quantity of tar? What action will be taken by the Government to prevent the tobacco industry from engaging in blatantly misleading practices of this kind? Will legislation be implemented to ensure that the actual tar delivered is accurately displayed on each packet of cigarettes and the advertisements for them?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Health Ministers Conference brings together Federal and State Ministers. This conference set up a tobacco products sub- committee to examine matters of the kind raised by Senator Missen. The working party which was set up by that body had its first meeting this year and started discussions with industry. I understand there was a meeting on 21 April between officers of the Department of Health and the appropriate government analytical laboratory. Representatives of the tobacco company advised the committee that the tar levels which can be attained under machine smoking conditions are in fact lower than those which occur if people smoke the cigarettes. This is due to the fact that the smoking machine which tests the cigarettes does not occlude some of the little side vents and does not draw all the material in whereas, when people smoke cigarettes, those vents are occluded and a higher amount of tar is drawn.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Missen is correct in saying that the testing procedure does not give an accurate record with this particular by-pass filter of the amount of matter which is delivered. The machine which is used conforms to international standards. It is the usual machine but it will not pick up the load to the smoker when this particular kind of filter is used. Whether this represents some attempt to mislead the public or to by-pass the proper procedures is another question. I think that what has emerged is that this filter now does present a problem to the Department of Health and to the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories. They are going to put the technical aspects of this matter under review. They will have to come back to the Ministers in due course when this review is complete. If that then involves some alteration to the procedures for advising the public I think that is a matter which will be taken under consideration. The date 21 April is fairly recent and the matters have only just come to attention. It will take some time for analysis to be carried out and for a determination to be made as to whether procedures have to be changed, either in the method of analysis or in the method of notifying the public.</PARA>

This matter is now, properly, I think, the responsibility of the State welfare departments or health departments, since the community health program was returned to sole State administration last year. I think that I saw a report of the paper mentioned by the honourable senator and some reference to it in a newspaper report concerning the incidence of violence. I did not see a report which was in such detail as to identify the cause or the proposed cure which was referred to by Senator Coleman in her question. It is a matter which basically is within State responsibility. I would not expect to be a participant at the Premiers Conference. In any event I would doubt that the Premiers would go into items of detailed policy of the sort that the honourable senator has raised.

Fourthly, how competent in the use of firearms are the prison officers? Fifthly, why was Ricci Vicenti taken to Fremantle Hospital and then transferred to intensive care at Royal Perth Hospital when he had a bullet in his head?

The honourable senator will be aware of the view that has been taken by my predecessors in the post of Minister for Education and in this place over a number of years. We have set out to establish a reasonable set of parameters within which membership of student unions by students can occur. The honourable senator will be aware of the efforts we have made to ensure that in the Australian Capital Territory, an area under this Government's control, there will be appropriate arrangements for membership of student unions. I would be grateful if the honourable senator could show me the agreement that has been reached in the University of Tasmania. It may be a very useful addition to what is emerging as an appropriate and sensitive national policy.

Will the Minister table papers presented to a meeting of Ministers before the 1977 Budget which was called to consider estimates of revenue for 1977-78? Were the papers in question prepared by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and by the Treasury? Do they show that the Treasury estimate, supported by the Commissioner of Taxation, was $1,000m less than that of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet?

Secondly, I repeat what I said yesterday; that is, that in all Budget discussions a great deal of information comes from a wide number of sources and it is for the Cabinet to make its own decisions on that information. That has been the practice throughout all Cabinet meetings of all governments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I do not have figures to confirm those put forward by Senator Bjelke-Petersen in her question as to the precise amount of delayed wheat tonnage which resulted from the disputation on the waterfront mentioned by her in the question. I shall seek those figures from the Minister. Concerning the second part of the question, I agree with her that this sort of delay to exports is damaging to Australia's economy and to our reputation as a reliable trading partner. It also needs to be said that it is damaging to every Australian, and that the standard of living of every Australian is ultimately affected by this sort of activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to what action has been taken by the Government, the Government has shared the concern of the Australian community about the record of disputation on the waterfront over the last year or more. There has been an extended period in which a succession of disputes has occurred in different ports. One is treated to the spectacle of what is now known in New South Wales as Wran's Navy waiting outside Wollongong and Newcastle, and there have been problems in other States as well. It was because of those concerns that the previous Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Viner, raised that matter with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Stevedoring Industry Consultative Council and the National Labour Consultative Council, and there was a review and examination by the Government of the issues relating to improving industrial relations on the waterfront. The matter was raised at the Premiers Conference in February and there was an agreement at the Premiers level that this was a problem. The Premiers accepted an invitation to join the Commonwealth in discussing with employers and unions the means of improving industrial relations situations in these industries.</PARA>
<PARA> Comparatively recently there was a very large meeting in, I think, Senator Bjelke-Petersen's capital city, Brisbane, involving unions, States, employers and the Commonwealth. As a result of that meeting further work is being done. It was agreed that the ACTU and the Confederation of Australian Industry would review with their affiliates the effectiveness of existing consultative mechanisms, including dispute settling procedures in both industries, and report back prior to the next Premiers Conference in June. So the matter is getting active attention at government level and at the trade union and employer level. I think it is widely recognised that the sort of damaging effects that Senator Bjelke-Petersen mentioned are occurring, and if they continue to occur we shall wind up a much poorer country. Concerning the maritime industry, I simply remind the Senate that we have had the Crawford report and that there are negotiations with the maritime unions about the revitalisation of Australian shipping, which is an an ancillary area in which we must obviously improve our performance.</PARA>

I understand that in correspondence to certain senators, including Senator Chipp, the Prime Minister has made it clear that the Commonwealth has given no commitment as to its support. Whether the Tasmanian Government shall proceed with the proposed hydro- electric development in South-West Tasmania is a matter for decision by the Tasmanian Government. As stated previously by the Prime Minister in answers to questions on this subject, all States would object vigorously if the Commonwealth were to impose its decision-making on the normal programs of the States. These are matters for which the States must carry responsibility. The generation of electric power is a State matter entirely. The method of its generation is a State matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a quite significant incidence of malaria in Australia. The table shows that approximately 500 cases a year are reported. One would wonder how we could have so many cases in this country. Malaria is not indigenous in Australia. The figures for 1981 show that all 500 cases were contracted overseas. The latest year for which we have complete figures-that is, 1981-shows a slight drop in the incidence. I think we have to be a bit cautious in order to be certain that this represents a trend and is not just a chance variation. It is not yet possible to present a complete analysis of the origin of each malaria case in 1981, but it seems that most cases originated in the Solomon Islands. Fewer cases were reported from South East Asia compared with the year before. There were very few cases from the other endemic area of Africa and Central America.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think there are public health implications for these figures, particularly concerning the large number of cases that come to Australia from the Pacific Basin.

They would want to know the source of the infection in order to choose the correct drugs and to take the appropriate public health response.</PARA>

There are concerns, not only in Australia but also at a world level, about the likely growth of trade. Varying decisions need to be taken by those who are planning for the future. Investment confidence is still strong but undoubtedly many manufacturers will need to make certain decisions. Perhaps the most recent wage decision will have removed some of the doubts that many of them may have had with regard to planning for the future. What we want to see is a continuance of development, of job opportunities and, above all, of confidence in the strength of the Australian economy. To say that is not to ignore that difficulties exist for some-with regard to the financing of capital requirements and so on-but I believe that to draw the inference, as the honourable senator has done, that a massive lack of confidence exists does not represent accurately what is in the minds of those who are looking to develop and to continue manufacturing planning .</PARA></TALK.START>

Those servicemen who were injured or suffered illness as a result of those trials may receive a disability pension but not a service pension, because they did not serve overseas in a theatre of war. I ask: Does the Minister consider that servicemen who were disabled in these hazardous trials are being financially disadvantaged, since all of their disability pension is deemed to be income for age pension eligibility, whereas only 40 per cent of a disability pension is so regarded in qualifying for a service pension?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important to recognise that the service pension was designed in the first place-it has been so for 50 years-to take account of the unrecognised effects of war. The disability pension was designed to compensate directly a serviceman for injuries he suffered as a result of war service. So it is well established that the disability pension payable to people in these circumstances is designed to compensate them for injuries having occurred as a result of exposure to mustard gas experiments. From that point of view, therefore, the question of a service pension does not necessarily arise. The question of eligibility, generally speaking, is a matter which is constantly being reviewed by the Government and will, of course, be taken into account in Budget discussions. On the specific point about the amount of disability pension being taken into account in assessing eligibility for the age pension, that, of course, is again related to Budget consideration and is something that the Government will no doubt consider later this year.</PARA></TALK.START>

Will it do the sensible thing and use the same funds to expand the existing domestic terminal in such a way that it can cater for the Hobart-Christchurch flights on those days on which they operate and allow for the extra space needed for domestic flights to cope with normal busy times such as Easter and other holiday periods when the airport is uncomfortably packed with people?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen printed information regarding HMS Invincible. I do not know whether it coincided with the time of the sinking of HMS Sheffield. I think one should read the information leaflet very carefully. The fact is that Invincible is a vessel designed to provide the most effective means of anti-submarine warfare detection that modern navies have in mind. The Invincible took part in North Atlantic tests some months ago and was commended by all navies concerned. The fact is that Invincible contains the type of helicopters that can operate what are called dunking or dipping sonars which can take soundings wide of all convoys and detect the presence of enemy submarines well ahead of any kind of threat to the convoys by submarines. Therefore, I think the Senate would regard it as important that there should be in Australia for the future, a great impetus to our detection ability in anti-submarine warfare. The fact is that the alternative is shore-based aircraft of the Orion type which do not have active sonobuoys; such aircraft use passive sonobuoys with a limited zone. The Invincible is not, in itself, a total capacity. Of course there must be support and protective systems. Of course the very nature of war is such that all vessels are vulnerable. It would help all honourable senators if they applied their minds to the general purpose of an anti-submarine war vessel, and particularly to the general purpose of dunking or active sonars which provide greater protection for convoys, particularly as Australia at any time of conflict would need massive convoy movements across the world and therefore protection.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today Senator Robert Ray asked me a question about the Australian Consulate-General in Houston. The formal opening of the Consulate-General is to take place on 14 June. It is correct to say that Australia has Consulates-General in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and Honolulu. The decision to establish a Consulate-General in Houston took account of the growing importance of the southern area of the United States for Australia as a market and the potential it offered for further Australian exports. Other considerations include the requirement for consular assistance to Australians in this area of the United States and the growing demand for the provision of information about Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The decision to establish the Consulate-General in Houston was announced on 11 February. I had some concern about the announcement of the person who was to be appointed and I understand that announcement was to be made today.

It is normal practice for Australian diplomatic and consular missions overseas to be under the charge of officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The functions of the office extend well beyond trade activities and the responsibilities of the Consul-General will be much wider than those of a trade commissioner.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Clerk of the Senate, Mr Bradshaw, will be accompanying me to a conference in Sydney next week, I take this opportunity of informing honourable senators that he will be retiring as Clerk of the Senate during the winter recess. Today is the last day on which he will be serving in this chamber in his capacity as Clerk of the Senate. Mr Bradshaw served in the Royal Australian Air Force in England during the war. After study in the post-war period, he joined the Senate in July 1950 as Clerk of Papers and Accountant. He served as Private Secretary to the President of the Senate during 1953 and 1954, as Clerk of Records in 1954 and 1955 and as Ministerial Liaison Officer during 1955 and 1956. He then became Usher of the Black Rod and served in that capacity from 1956 to 1964-a quite extensive period. In 1964 he was promoted to Principal Parliamentary Officer and in 1965 to Clerk-Assistant. In 1973 he became First Clerk-Assistant. In 1979 he became Deputy Clerk of the Senate and since October 1980 he has served as Clerk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During his service he has been involved in many other aspects of the working of the Senate. He was Secretary to the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review from 1956 to 1959 and Secretary to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence from 1959 to 1965. He was also Secretary to one of the very early Senate select committees-the Senate Select Committee on the Encouragement of Australian Productions for Television-during 1962 and 1963. The Deputy President, the Honourable Douglas McClelland, served on that Committee with Mr Bradshaw. Mr Bradshaw also served as Secretary to the Senate Select Committee on Off-Shore Petroleum Resources. Three Presidents served on that Committee with Mr Bradshaw- the Honourable Justin O'Byrne, Sir Condor Laucke and, of course, myself. I do not know whether there is any significance in that or whether Mr Bradshaw should be commended or otherwise. I will leave that to the judgment of honourable senators. Mr Bradshaw was also Secretary to the Australian Inter-Parliamentary Union delegations to meetings in Canberra, Tehran, Bucharest and Tokyo. He also accompanied the previous President of the Senate to the 250th anniversary of the Parliament in the Bahamas, as well as on official visits to Japan and China.</PARA>
<PARA> Altogether Mr Bradshaw has served for some 32 years in this chamber. During that time he has seen many changes take place and has made a great contribution not only to the Senate but also to the Australian parliamentary institution itself. On a personal note, I thank him very much for the kindness he has extended to me since I became President of this chamber. I have leant heavily on him and other advisers in this place. There is no doubt that during his period of service he has made many friends, both senators and staff. Some of them have left this place but many of them still serve here. He has a very gentle and friendly manner and one which attracts people to him. The Deputy President, Senator Douglas McClelland, is not present today, but he has asked to join me in extending to Mr Bradshaw and his wife all the very best for the future and in thanking him very much for what he has done for this chamber. We wish Mr Bradshaw and Mrs Bradshaw well in his retirement.</PARA>

It is no mean thing for a person to proceed through the various offices of the Senate and come to the very high office of Clerk of the Senate. It is a distinguished office and an office of very great significance and importance. Keith Bradshaw has had some very distinguished predecessors and he walks amongst them as a peer.

It is important, in a parliament like this, that the work of the place is facilitated as much as possible by those who are here permanently and not subject to the fortunes applicable to politicians, who Arthur Calwell described as roosters today and feather dusters tomorrow.

Although we will miss him on his departure we know that his place will be filled by a person of great competence. As each person moves up the rung we are happy in the knowledge that each of those persons is a competent, trustworthy and non-partisan officer of the Senate who has been encouraged and nurtured by people such as Keith Bradshaw.

I imagine that he was adept at morse code. I know he would need in this chamber the anticipation that that job sometimes requires, for example, especially with the tic-tacking that used to go on between himself and Acting Presidents from time to time. I believe he holds the record of being the last clerk of a Senate committee to have travelled by ship to Western Australia.

There is only one honourable senator remaining to become President who served on that Committee. I hesitate to mention his name , but it is Senator Keeffe. I believe it cannot be stressed enough how much people in the community regard the work done on that Committee. Indeed before election to the Senate I had cause to come across a number of people who had been very interested in the work of that Committee. That Committee took a number of years on its inquiry and occupied, I think, five years of Keith's career. The Committee's report is a living testimony to the industriousness and effort which Keith Bradshaw puts into the tasks which he has been given. Mr President, you, as Chairman of that Committee, would be well aware of the efforts of Keith Bradshaw. You have referred to them in your address to the Parliament today. The Committee undertook its task without the benefit of large resources and its achievement contrasts more than favourably with the royal commission into the same subject area. Indeed, the report of the Committee, for which much credit must be given to its Secretary, Keith Bradshaw, is even today regarded as a textbook on the legislation within the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I know that you and other honourable senators know that Keith is held in high regard amongst the staff and other people who work in this building . It came as a great shock to me to learn only last week that Keith was going to retire and I think it is a great pity. I am sorry that he is unable to continue as Clerk of the Senate. He is a man of great courtesy, even-handedness and propriety in his dealings with senators from both sides of the Parliament.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This report is largely now, it must be conceded, of historical interest as it relates to the tenth session of the Law of the Sea Conference which ended over a year ago on 24 April 1981. The Convention on the Law of the Sea was, of course, adopted in New York on 30 April 1982 at the end of the eleventh session of the Conference just a few weeks ago. We look forward to seeing the report of the Australian delegation to that final and all-important session and hope that we will not have to wait a year to receive it. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular interest in this tenth report lies in the account it gives of the devastating impact of the Reagan Government's sudden announcement at the opening of this tenth session that a fundamental review of United States policy in relation to the proposed convention had been ordered. It is now a matter of record that, when the convention was finally adopted, the United States was one of four countries, in company with Turkey, Venezuela and Israel, which voted against the convention in April this year. One hundred and thirty countries, Australia included, voted in favour of it. Seventeen countries, including, amongst others, Brisbane-I mean Britain; but it would be absolutely typical of the dog in the manger attitude adopted by that particular administration in this country, although it has not yet assumed international status-Britain, Germany and the Soviet Union, abstained from the convention. It is, accordingly, I think interesting given that final outcome, to note the report of the Australian delegation, politely expressed but certainly devastating in its effect, which appears on page 8 of the report. It is in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The announcement of the United States review of its policy caused considerable consternation and disenchantment among delegations, most of whom had believed that they were assembling for a final negotiating session. For many delegations the decision was a baffling and disquieting one, since many of the provisions in the Draft Convention reflected the results of protracted negotiations involving concessions on points to meet particular concerns of the United States Delegation. In these circumstances many delegations were prompted to speculate whether the reasons for the United States decision were more fundamental than the original public announcement might have led them to believe. </PARA>
<PARA>In any event, the United States Government's announcement was nothing short of ruinous to the session to which this report relates. At page 9 the report states :</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the efforts of the Conference to continue working more or less as normal were doomed to frustration. It proved impossible to have serious discussions on all but a relatively small range of issues. </PARA>
<PARA>The serious roadblock, as it is referred to in the report, feared by delegates of course became an ever greater reality as the following year developed. Ultimately years of work towards consensus-we should note that the formal sessions in relation to this go all the way back to 1974-were destroyed by the self-interest of the United States which ultimately undermines the capacity of the United Nations to perform the role that so many of us are anxious for it to be able to do. The objections of the United States related to some extent to the procedural amending provisions of the proposed Law of the Sea Treaty but more essentially, and centrally, to the compulsory transfer of deep sea bed mining technology from private corporations to the proposed new United Nations Deep Sea Bed Mining Authority. For obvious reasons of commercial self-interest in relation to the corporations involved and the private sector interests involved, the United States, under the new Reagan Government, went to bat right to the last hurdle for the protection, as it perceived it, of those interests and in the process destroyed a consensus which had been evolving for eight years. There were undoubtedly important Third World implications for the United States in the course of the action that thus occurred. There is no doubt that the existing Law of the Sea, which it has been the purpose of this whole process to revise and make the subject of an international convention, has been operating in such a way as to disadvantage spectacularly the developing countries. The report notes on page 1:</PARA>
<PARA> The Conference came about because of the conviction of many States that the traditional Law of the Sea was inequitable in that it advantaged the developed countries and disadvantaged the developing countries and was outmoded because it had permitted the exhaustion of fishing grounds throughout the world and did not satisfactorily equip coastal States to protect the marine environment off the shores. </PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that the failure of the United States to come into this proposed treaty will have profound practical implications, at least in the short run, for the effectiveness of the new international order created by it. Undoubtedly there will be a delay in the establishment of the international sea bed authority which is to supervise deep sea bed mining. The United States and the Soviet Union were both to contribute a very large section of that body's budget and if the two nations are not party to the treaty-the Soviet Union is clearly maintaining its abstention role until such time as the United States comes in- the budgetary strains on the other countries will of course be very much greater and there may as a result be a decision to adopt a much slower course in setting up the authority than might otherwise have been the case. </PARA>
<PARA> There are nonetheless some grounds for supposing that the resistance of the United States to endorsing and participating in this treaty may not be permanent . It is not because of any likely change of heart or any prospect of greater sensitivity emerging in the breast of the Reagan Administration. That would be far too much to hope for. Rather, it is a question of being likely that the United States will realise that it is in its own ultimate interest to join in this international treaty arrangement. It has become clear that Japan, which has been a very active supporter of the treaty-a signatory of it or, at least, a voter for it-along with several other nations working on the development of the expensive sea bed technology, can be expected to take advantage of the United States absence and will put considerable pressure on the United States eventually to come in and participate in the treaty. It is clear that the operation of sea bed mining under the treaty regime will ultimately be perceived by the United States and the commercial authorities and interests to which it has so far bowed as being in the interests of the United States. </PARA>

This is one area, at least, in which there is a substantial degree of bipartisan solidarity between the parties . We agree very strongly with the points made by the Foreign Minister, Mr Street , when he spoke on this issue in the House of Representatives on 4 May. We are disappointed, to put it at its mildest, with the United States reaction to these events so far and we look forward to the United States reconsidering its position.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The report on the Housing Assistance Act is one of the obligations to the Parliament and arises from the legislation which deals with the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. The objectives of the 1976 agreement were to facilitate home ownership for those able to afford it but not able to gain it through the private market and to provide adequate rental housing for those in the community who are deemed to be in need of governmental assistance at a price that is within their capacity to pay. The agreement, therefore, provides for two programs. Firstly, it provides for a home purchase assistance program, which assists those persons wishing to buy a home who are unable to obtain mortgage finance through the private market or any other sources. It must be admitted that that is a growing number of people in today's very tight economic conditions. Secondly, it provides for a rental housing assistance program which provides rental accommodation for those most in need of rental housing assistance. With the increasing mobility of our work force today, we need more and more rental housing, particularly public rental housing, to provide for those persons. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth provides advances to the States to meet those purposes. Of course, the funding in 1980-81 shows that the Commonwealth Government is failing very dismally in its obligations and responsibilities. The table on page 5 shows that Commonwealth advances to the States for the past two years have fallen alarmingly. It is particularly important for the Senate to note that no rental housing assistance at all is given to Queensland. One would expect the Government members to be interested in that fact, but they remain silent. There has been an increase in dollar terms in total advances to New South Wales, my State, of only $2,138,000, which is a drop in real terms of 8.3 per cent. There has been a drop in total advances to all the States of some 7.7 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the Government's policies has been particularly bad for public housing in the States and of course that is why all State housing commissions and housing Ministers have been critical of the Commonwealth Government's abdication of its responsibilities in this matter. For example, the New South Wales Housing Commission is reported to be running out of money in the present quarter. It cannot keep up with the increasing demand for public housing. An article in the Australian Financial Review of 27 March stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1976-77 Commonwealth loans and grants for public housing in New South Wales totalled $103 million. By 1980-81 this figure had fallen to $69 million.</PARA>
<PARA>That was in a period when the consumer price increase had gone up by more than 50 per cent. The article, reporting the Chairman of the Housing Commission, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It was clear that high costs of land and housing, high rentals and very difficult conditions in the finance sector generally were continuing to confront homeseekers with a difficult situation, a scenario which suggested a continuation of the trend for levels of public housing demand to increase. </PARA>
<PARA>And of course that is exactly what has happened. Total funds for home purchase assistance under the Agreement have been reduced by $11,321,000 in the year under review and this neglect has had a bad effect upon the construction industry generally. For example, home building approvals have slumped to a seven -year low, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for January 1980. This means that since this Government came to office it has brought about a serious decline in the home building industry. The Commonwealth should be using the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement to stimulate the housing industry and therefore stimulate the Australian economy but of course it pursues its own ideological and philosophical position in the belief that the buck spent in the government sector is somehow different from the buck that is spent in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Government finance for rental assistance has been increased only marginally in the same period. I raised this matter in the Senate on 11 March this year. Time will not permit me to deal with all the details except to say that a 72 per cent cutback in Commonwealth funds since 1975 will have the inevitable result-it is very clear, particularly in New South Wales-of forcing up rents. The Government' s current housing policies do nothing to redress the problems in housing and certainly do nothing other than give emphasis to increased rents. </PARA>
<PARA> Interest rate increases have recently been announced and we are led to believe that another increase in interest rates will soon take place. The new housing assistance scheme which this Government announced recently will do very little to alleviate the problem. As my colleague, the Opposition spokesman on housing, Tom Uren, said, the housing scheme announced in March is nothing more than a gimmick and a sop to the wealthy and it will do very little to assist the very sections of the Australian community that need assistance. The home buyers who need assistance will not be guaranteed any assistance under the Government's latest policy. So that housing scheme will really be giving $74m to assist the very wealthy, the only group of people who can get into the housing scene in today's environment. </PARA>
<PARA> If we compare the home purchase assistance figures for 1979-80 and 1980-81 we can see that there has been an increase of only $0.3m for New South Wales. This represents a drop of 6 per cent in real terms for last year. Victoria and Queensland both experienced a drop in dollar terms, which means massive cuts in real terms so far as their capacity to provide public housing is concerned. Overall one has to say that statistically the report provides us with basic information which shows that the Commonwealth is abdicating its responsibilities in this area. No matter which State we look at we will find a situation in which the responsible Minister, regardless of his political complexion, is critical of the severe cutbacks that have occurred in the provision of Commonwealth funds to the States for housing. A very interesting article which appeared in the Bulletin of 30 March this year states:</PARA>
<PARA> Next year's housing issue will be ''the rental crisis''. The government knows this and as part of its package last week provided $20 million for housing crisis assistance. The Commonwealth expects the States to match this on a dollar -for-dollar basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Considering that the ''rental lobby'' has been barely heard in Canberra, this looks at first glance to be an act of rare compassion on the part of the government. Rather it should be seen as recognition of a very difficult problem.</PARA>
<PARA>The article went on to show that in 1975-76 132,000 houses were built in Australia. Five years later, in 1980-81, that figure had increased by only 2,000 to 134,000. This has occurred at a time when our population is growing and we are stimulating our immigration policies and bringing more than 100,000 people into Australia each year. All of this compounds the problem and adds to the demand situation in our housing industry. If we do not meet the supply side, prices in the private and public sectors are inevitably forced up and the States are forced to increase the rents which they charge for their housing commission homes. Of course, in the private rental market we have seen rentals increase by at least 50 per cent over the last couple of years. The Commonwealth Government, as this report indicates, is failing to recognise its responsibilities in this area. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1980-81 annual report of the Australian Federal Police is a most welcome document for those of us who are concerned about the state of policing in the Australian Capital Territory and areas under Commonwealth jurisdiction. The report is welcome, firstly, because it is a far more expansive review than last year's report of the activities of the Australian Federal Police and it affords us an opportunity to look at the amalgamation of the Commonwealth Police and the Australian Capital Territory Police which was agreed to on 19 October 1979 and which is in its third year of operation. Secondly, the report is welcome because it is much more candid than the previous report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Sir Colin Woods, made some remarks in the report, particularly in the introduction, which give us some-I must emphasise 'some'-insight into the vast problems faced by the Australian Federal Police. Sir Colin's comments give us some idea of the problems, but this is not really sufficient. As I have said on several occasions, I believe there is a need for a substantial review of the activities and functions of the Australian Federal Police. There is a need for soul-searching and a shake-up. One can only say that the current Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) has failed miserably, as did his predecessors, to put into effect the essential leadership needed to bring about an effective amalgamation and an effective police organisation to carry out the functions as determined by the Commonwealth Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me be a little more specific about those matters. The Minister for Administrative Services informed the Commissioner of the new charter for the Federal Police in November of last year. That charter is shown in appendix A to the report. The Opposition has no quibble with that, because it believes that there is an increasing need and role for the Australian Federal Police. The major priorities are identified as the investigation of crimes under Commonwealth law, the policing of the Australian Capital Territory, an emphasis on combating drug-related and organised crime and, of course, fraud. It must be said that such are the lack of resources and the discontent within the Australian Federal Police that in respect of Medibank frauds, for example, resources are so stretched that the organisation is able to look at manipulation and misappropriation State by State only; it cannot conduct a total review of the wholesale, improper practices by the medical profession that from time to time have been brought to light in respect of Medibank. One is aware that drug trafficking constitutes a major and growing problem for the Australian community , also that organised crime is growing in importance and significance. The Australian Federal Police is not able effectively to play its part in combating these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports the emphasis that Sir Colin Woods places on these matters. Honourable senators will be aware that in both the House of Representatives and in this place the current royal commissions and the problems of the State police forces have been discussed. So often what is wrong in New South Wales is highlighted, but similar problems exist in other States. There is conflict and competition between the State police forces and our new Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the problem with the charter lies in its unrealistic expectations. The Commonwealth Police Officers Association has called these guidelines 'fine but misleading'. The Secretary of that Association has said:</PARA>
<PARA> What is the use of extending tasks and responsibilities without an increase in staff? The resources of the A.F.P. are already stretched to such an extent that the force won't be able to carry out some of the functions outlined by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>The journal of the Association recently editorialised in regard to this matter in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> One often wonders how our organisation--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Australian Federal Police-</PARA>
<PARA>and as a consequence our Commissioner manages to function with the manipulation of funding that appears to occur each and every year. We regularly seem to run out of money for one thing or another part way through the financial year. On the one hand we have the acceptance of particular functions by the Government and on the other a cut-back in the finance that would enable us to carry out such activities. (A true catch 22 situation). </PARA>
<PARA>I have already referred to the complaints about the staffing levels of the organisation. For example, I am led to believe that in Canberra the effective establishment for detectives, as indeed for the men on the beat, has declined by about one-third. On the other hand, I am led to believe that at the Governor- General's residence there are five protective guards. I wonder what sort of police organisation we have when that sort of emphasis occurs at the Governor- General's residence and fewer police are on the beat in the streets of Canberra itself. According to figures given at a Senate Estimates Committee C hearing last year, there has been an actual reduction in staffing, particularly in the junior ranks, in both the general policing and protective services components of the force. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the figures shown in the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;According to the 1981 report of the Australia Federal Police, a major review of the functional divisions, staffing and rank numbers requirements was conducted. This review confirmed what the men and women in the force have been saying for some time-that the general policing duties component is insufficiently staffed. Therefore the general duties component has been increased by 748 ranks as from 31 December 1981. The report does not make clear, however, that those extra positions will be taken from the other component of the force, the protective services component. Of course, that is a major bone of contention. The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The corresponding Protective Service officer ranks were not abolished at the time the general duties ranks were created as it was necessary to develop a program for that progressive transfer of officers of that component, after appropriate training, to the General Police Component. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, the total numbers of staff in the Australian Federal Police will be increased only marginally. That, of course, will have a disastrous effect upon the morale, activities and efficiency of the force. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few moments that are left to me I raise a matter which Sir Colin Woods has described as a minor indiscretion, that is, the giving of a security clearance, a character reference, to a Greek restaurant owner in Canberra which was subsequently found to be so deficient that the Commissioner as well as the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs saw fit to make changes to the recommendations. I am not concerned about the disciplinary action that was taken or the suggestions that there had been an indiscretion. Sir Colin Woods said that the officer concerned, then acting Assistant Commissioner Antill, was transferred to Queensland not because of the indiscretion. Mr Kennedy, the officer above him, was primarily responsible. Mr Kennedy has now been transferred to a different department. I raise this matter not to seek some sort of a witch hunt or persecution of the officers but to indicate the unsatisfactory way in which the Australian Federal Police force is operating. The evidence is abundantly clear that there is an unsatisfactory staff situation . </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>A discussion took place at the meeting which was held in Adelaide on 8 February about the inquiry of the Industries Assistance Commission into the canned fruit industry about which I am very interested. It is of vital importance to the Riverland area of South Australia. The cannery is in the hands of the receivers. This is causing a lot of worry to not only the growers and the people who derive their livelihood from working in the cannery but also the small business people who derive their livelihood in a round about way from the incomes of fruit growers and from the wages from the people who work in the cannery. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disturbed to find that the annual report of the Australian Canned Fruits Sale Promotion Committee will not be available to the Senate today. It is very important that we can speak on that paper. The interim report by the IAC on the canning fruit industry is referred to in the document about which I am speaking. Although it has been published and will be tabled here today we will not be able to speak to it today because we are not aware of the recommendations in respect of the canning fruit industry in Australia. That places undue restrictions on senators who may wish to make some remarks about what the IAC has recommended in respect of that industry. Whilst I can talk about that report here because it is mentioned in the report of the Australian Agricultural Council, we are prevented from having any discussions on the recommendations of the IAC report. This should not be so. We have spoken about this matter before when papers have been tabled in this Parliament without senators having a prior opportunity to see their contents. All that an honourable senator can do is move that the Senate take note of the report and then seek leave to continue his or her remarks so that it will be on the Notice Paper and be debated at some future date. As I pointed out here a couple of weeks ago, some reports had been tabled in the Parliament 12 or 18 months prior to them coming on for debate. They are well out of date when we get the opportunity to debate them. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other matters about which I would like to talk. One concerns live sheep exports and a study mission which went to the Middle East, but I will not talk about that because my colleague Senator Childs will deal with that matter in some detail. It is the next matter on my list for consideration. Another matter is the commercialisation of rabbits. We well remember the long discussions that have taken place in Australia. I think at one time a senator tried to establish a rabbit farm in New South Wales. He was not able to do that and he had to go to South Africa, I think, or America, to establish his rabbit farm. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This mission was sponsored by the Government to overcome the disputes that have occurred and which are still occurring over this issue. The objectives of the mission are significant. They are:</PARA>
<PARA> To report to the Australian Government on the Middle East market for sheep, sheep meat and alternate meats. To identify opportunities for expanding demand in the area for Australian mutton. To make recommendations on any special market development or promotional assistance measures which could help to exploit the market opportunities which are identified. </PARA>
<PARA>Those objectives are very important. It is important then to examine the major importers of live sheep in 1981. We find that Saudi Arabia imported 2,008,000 live sheep, Kuwait 1,540,000 live sheep and Libya 794,000 live sheep. Australia dominates the world trade. For example, Kuwait imports 96 per cent of its live sheep from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth while examining this matter because the major shipper to Kuwait is the Kuwait Livestock Transport and Trading Co. It is run by two of the ruling families of Kuwait, so the company is subsidised by interest free loans and cheap fuel oil which is readily available in Kuwait. We assist this trade by supplying cheap water and feed from Australia. The Kuwaiti Government gives a subsidy for live sheep and then another subsidy goes to butchers in Kuwait. That is the position. They are the advantages enjoyed by the live sheep trade.</PARA>
<PARA> Against that we have the claim by the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union that there should be an increase in frozen or chilled meat going to these countries. The Kuwait Livestock Transport and Trading Co., which dominates the market there, claims that the Moslem Hal-al method of slaughter cannot be complied with in Australia. Of course that is not true. It also claims that the consumer preference is for live sheep. It does this to scare people away from meat slaughtered in Australia. The reason for the subsidy is understandable, but it is to the disadvantage of employment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I contrast that situation with the position in Iran. A change has taken place because of the war waged there. Iran used to be the largest importer of live sheep and all the arguments about preference for meat not to be processed here used to be trotted out. Last year Iran imported 715,000 sheep compared with 2.5 million sheep in 1977-78. Last year, 24,000 tonnes of frozen mutton went to Iran from Australia, and 92,000 tonnes of fresh lamb went from New Zealand. This substitution of carcass meat for live sheep in Iran, due to port congestion and cash problems, gives the lie to the claim that people in these countries cannot make a change. It gives the lie to the suggestion that consumer preference is such that these people will not take carcasses instead of live sheep. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also alleged that these people might go elsewhere. This is a fallacious argument. Australian meats take 16 days to get to the Middle East. North Africa can get it there within 10 hours; and sheep from Turkey takes only two or three days. South America could only supply the market for half a year; they are and will always be minor suppliers of the market. The European countries do not have flocks sufficient to supply the market. On the other hand, New Zealand has taken a principled stand and refuses to export live sheep. It has not suffered because of that decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequences of this development for employment in Australia are very serious. Over the past five years the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union has lost approximately 10,000 members. Its membership has reduced from 55,000 to 45,000 workers. It is a very serious situation for rural Australia when we consider the accumulator effect on employment which country abattoirs have in the areas in which they are situated. When we consider that only half of the sheep goes in meat and the other half goes into products such as hides, bone meal, sausage cases and fertiliser, we can appreciate that the meat processing industry is being lost to our country and half the industry is being ignored by Government policies. New Zealand was told seven years ago that it had to sell live sheep. It has resisted doing so and it has been successful in improving its exports despite the threats which it did not cave in to. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer briefly to a particular section of the report. When the members of the mission concluded their work in the Middle East they stopped over in Singapore. The purpose of that stopover was to review the mission and to prepare recommendations. These recommendations, along with others received, gained unanimous support. Following the mission's arrival back in Australia arrangements were made in Canberra for discussions with the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon). The purpose of the meeting was to acquaint the Minister with the recommendations. After reading the recommendations the Minister advised the mission that he could accept all the recommendations except the second one. That second recommendation is significant. The second recommendation, in a draft dated April this year, was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Australian Government in consultation with interested industry bodies investigate the feasibility of a scheme having the following features</PARA>
<PARA> a tax on the export of live sheep for slaughter to be levied on the exporter, the amount of tax being determined periodically by reference to the difference between the prices of sheep for export and for slaughter in Australia--</PARA>
<PARA>It continued-</PARA>
<PARA> the proceeds of the export tax to be used to facilitate the export of mutton and hoggett to the markets which import live sheep for slaughter</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister claimed that this recommendation would conflict with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. He said that the mission should re-write this recommendation. The following day members of the mission, after lengthy deliberations, decided that the recommendation should remain except for the deletion of the reference to a guaranteed price for sheep. The mission decided that the recommendation should be referred to the bureaucracy so that the reservations expressed by the Minister could be checked. However, it was to be returned to the Minister as an addendum to the formal list of recommendations. The suggestion that the second recommendation to which I have referred is in conflict with GATT must be considered doubtful. The countries concerned are not signatories to GATT and even if they were they are also members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries which manipulates the world price of oil, even to the point of controlling supply. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the report in itself is a tremendous step forward. It shows that when people in the industry examine a concrete problem they are capable of seeking solutions. It also, of course, is the basis for possible agreement. I think unfortunately it has the weakness that it does not go to the point of the very significant submissions by the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union which realises that it is vital in rural Australia that employment is given to people in the meat industry. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave not granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to me that at long last the Government and the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) are endeavouring to come to grips with the problem which has beset this country, particularly some export ports, because of the dramatic increase in the export of live sheep. I think that the Minister and all those involved in the Australian Sheep Meat Study Mission to the Middle East, including members of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union, are to be congratulated for undertaking that task, for bringing back to Australia knowledge of what they saw and heard and for presenting it in a report such as this. I note that in the introduction of the report it is stated that the matter has been a contentious issue. Living where I do, I am fully aware that it has been an extremely contentious issue. It is particularly contentious in the town of Portland where, twice within 12 months, the local abattoirs, which employ an average of some 600 persons in the slaughter of sheep and cattle, have closed down. They closed down in the middle of last year and early this year. Those people, many of whom have worked in that trade for the whole of their working lives, twice have been put in the position of having no jobs and having to accept the unemployment benefit. I think it is to the eternal disgrace of the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser), that time and again he has rejected requests by people in his own electorate for some assistance in relation to this issue. Always he gives the same reply. He gives no assistance to workers out of work. I think that indicates the makeup of the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is stated in the report that sheep sold for live export commonly bring a higher price than can be obtained for similar sheep sold for slaughter in Australia. Because of this sheep producers value the trade highly and oppose any interference with it. It is my contention that buyers of live sheep for export pay only marginally above the going domestic rate. Figures in all the recent bulletins put out by the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation indicate that a price of $2 or $3 a head over and above the going domestic rate is all they are prepared to pay for sheep for export. I guess that two or three bucks a head to a farmer who perhaps has got 5,000, 500 or only five sheep to sell is a few bucks. They are a measly few bucks really when one looks at the price obtained for the these same sheep in the countries where they are exported. Frankly, it is my view that the sheep growers of Australia are being ripped off right, left and centre by these meat exporters. It is my contention that the exporters could well pay $5 to $10 a head over and above the going domestic rate for these sheep . They do not do so because there is no competition in the market that they are supplying at the purchasing end, that is here in Australia. As I said, the exporters pay marginally over and above the going rate and that is all. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that most honourable senators have seen and read of the protests that have been held, particularly in the town of Portland and especially by meatworkers who are out of work. I have known many of these people for years. Knowing them as I do it is not hard to understand their emotions when they see a large multi-storey sheep export vessel coming into that port. They are out of work yet thousands of sheep are penned within a bull's roar of the town waiting to be exported on a massive vessel that is riding at anchor or tied up at the dock at Portland. Last week 120,000 sheep were taken out by one of these vessels . I suggest that people-male and female-who get upset about picket lines and the workers on those picket lines should think a little more seriously and have some concern for the attitudes the picketers express. The picketers see it as work going out of their port, on the hoof, while they are obliged to accept unemployment benefits. This is in a town which has been beset by problems because of the move into it of the large aluminium firm, Alcoa of Australia Ltd, which has upset the whole social structure of the town by its very presence. Rents have gone through the ceiling and services are totally undermanned throughout the social strata of that town and district. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I think that people should think a little more seriously about what they see and what they read about the town of Portland. They should have a little more concern when they see picket lines. They should be upset at the attitude adopted by some sadistic truck drivers who seem to take pleasure in roaring down on a picket line and threatening people's lives. I understand that the meatworkers were extremely pleased with the attitude of the members of the Victorian Police Force who attended the demonstration last week. We all know that members of the police force all too often are the meat in the sandwich in confrontations such as these, but I am informed that they played a very impartial role and the picketers I spoke to had only commendation for them. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the Middle East-the other end of the live sheep controversy-it is obvious from reading this report that changes are evolving in all the countries which the mission visited. As I read the report there are indications that those countries are slowly, perhaps too slowly for the meatworkers of Australia, coming around to the concept that chilled and frozen mutton is or will be more acceptable than it has been. I guess that any of us who have been to the Middle East, who have had the opportunity to tour some of those countries and who have seen the lifestyles that have been traditional for thousands of years, can also appreciate these changes are evolving due to an improved standard of living. I do not have the time to go through the report; one could speak on it for an hour . I hope that the moves that have been made, both in the Middle East and at this end to increase the carcass trade rather than trade in live sheep, will be carried forth with a great amount of vigour. I also hope that we will adopt a little more of an aggressive stance in our marketing of sheep meat in the Middle East and that we will see the day when we will no longer have the confrontation that is currently rife in our ports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Both Senator Childs and Senator Primmer have referred to the discord and confrontation that has been provoked in the last couple of years by live animal exports. To a very substantial degree that discord and confrontation is a result of the continuing high and rising levels of unemployment. Traditionally most employees in the meat industry have been neither long term nor permanent employees. They have moved in and out of the industry because of its seasonal nature. They have also quite commonly moved into the industry for a short time and then permanently moved out. If it were not for the generally high levels of unemployment there is no doubt that there would be much less resistance than there in fact is from people who are at present employed in the meat industry to what they perceive as a threat to their jobs. In the decade of the 1960s such people would have readily obtained employment in other areas and would not have resorted to the confrontation tactics which have recently been adopted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Action by overseas governments substantially distorts market prices in a number of Middle Eastern markets, according to the report of the Australian Sheep Meat Study Mission to the Middle East, which is being discussed. The price to the consumer of freshly killed meat, which comes mainly from imported livestock, is very heavily subsidised by the governments of Bahrain and Kuwait and subsidised to a lesser extent by the Government of Libya. In Saudi Arabia, the major market in the area, the reverse is the case; livestock imports are not subsidised but imports of frozen and chilled mutton are. In Saudi Arabia, in spite of government intervention-the effect of which is to lower the price of imported carcass mutton and let market forces determine the price of locally killed mutton, usually from imported livestock-the price to the consumer for the freshly killed imported livestock, is significantly higher. It continues to be sold, which is about as clear an expression of consumer preference for that type of product that I think anyone could ask for. </PARA>
<PARA> In the other cases-that is, Libya and particularly Bahrain and Kuwait-the recommendation of the mission is that the Australian authorities should endeavour to increase the sales of Australian frozen meat and, in most cases, of Australian chilled meat. If the governments of those countries choose to subsidise the importation of livestock-which is effectively what they are doing- a question which presents itself is: In whose hands or in whose pockets does that subsidy ultimately rest? The fact that a premium, which Senator Primmer thinks is $2 to $3-most estimates would put it higher-is paid in Australian sale yards for live animals destined for export, suggests, to say the least, that some of that subsidy coming from the governments of Bahrain, Kuwait and Libya, is finishing up in the pockets of Australian sheep sellers. If that is so, one might ask why Australia should attempt to terminate this arrangement. That is a question to which the mission not only does not seem to have addressed itself but also one that does not seem to have occurred to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to say very much more on the matter but I do want to comment on a program which appeared on, I think, Channel 9 a couple of weeks ago and which included a reference to New Zealand. A widespread misunderstanding has arisen from a belief that the New Zealand situation is completely analogous to Australia's. It ought to be fairly clear that shipping live sheep to the Middle East from New Zealand, other things being equal, would be less attractive than shipping them from Australia because it is a good deal further, apart from higher shipping costs and the increased risk of deaths at sea and so on. More importantly, traditionally the great bulk of sheep being shipped live from Australia are adult sterile males-wethers, as the cockies call them. </PARA>

The structure of the New Zealand flock is entirely different; it is oriented to fat lamb production and it has a very much higher proportion of ewes and a very low proportion of merinos. For all those reasons, a negligible proportion-when I took the figures out I think it was 2 per cent-of the total New Zealand sheep flock is males above one year of age, and males above one year of age overwhelmingly constitute exports of sheep.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks on this report will be very brief. I join with my colleagues, Senator Childs, Senator Primmer and Senator Walsh, in what they have said. I fully concur with all they have said. In particular, I concur with the thoughts expressed by my colleague Senator Primmer , who comes from the area of Portland where there are great problems at present with the shipping of live sheep. There are also problems of unemployment. I am one of those persons who went through such a phase many years ago because I used to be an employee of Borthwick's, particularly in the lambing season. I know the feeling of these workers there-the situation then would have been similar to the situation now-when it comes to the end of the lamb season and they do not have a job. The circumstances were different previously in that Borthwick's establishment was run by producer gas. Many of the workers at the abattoirs were able to obtain work in the forests cutting wood during the winter. So the gas producers would be fed right through the year generating their own electricity. That does not take place now. The scene has altered greatly but not concerning unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have every sympathy for those people who are now facing the prospect, as Senator Primmer pointed out, of seeing their livelihood shipped out on the hoof from Portland in these mammoth sheep carriers. I hope that the meat workers, in their protests over a period, will be able to convince the sheep growers and the owners that they are not getting a greater income by shipping their sheep out live. As a matter of fact, their income would be more secure if they had a secure marketing method for the dressed product. The Government ought to be looking at ways of convincing the people in the Middle East that the sheep can be slaughtered in conformity with their religious rites. The sheep are slaughtered under much more hygienic conditions in Australia than in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to indulge in elaborating on that at present as I know other people want to speak on other reports. I seek leave of the Senate to have incorporated in Hansard pages 4 to 12, the recommendations, of the report which we are discussing at present. The people who read the Hansard will then be able to see the general summary of the findings of this mission which went to the Middle East. They will be able to see also the remarks made by the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union on what it thinks about the export of live sheep. I seek leave of the Senate for the incorporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SUMMARY OF FINDINGS</PARA>
<PARA> A summary of findings to which all Mission members subscribe is listed below. The AMIEU representatives place a different emphasis on certain of the findings; that summary is in the following chapter. </PARA>
<PARA> 1. Increased incomes and rapid population growth including a heavy influx of expatriates over the last ten years have resulted in very substantial increases in meat consumption in all of the countries visited by the Mission. Growth in demand for meat has far outstripped growth in local production. Rapidly growing imports of livestock for local slaughter, beef, sheep meats and poultry have made up the shortfall. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Low rainfall and desert environments limit the scope for increasing local livestock production. Efforts to expand production are mainly based on intensive feeding operations. All five countries are expected to continue to be substantial importers of meat and/or livestock. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. In each country there are different market segments catering for the differing tastes and preferences of the local and large expatriate populations. The traditional dietary preferences of the local populations are reflected in Government policies which influence the composition of imports in favour of livestock rather than meat. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The meat purchasing habits of the indigenous populations are heavily influenced by the old custom of families slaughtering their own sheep for consumption on the same day. Customary family slaughter has declined. The old ways continue to be reflected, however, in a preference for purchasing freshly slaughtered meat, even though much of it is then frozen in domestic freezers for later consumption. Many of the muslim expatriate inhabitants who purchase meat in the general market place have similar backgrounds and preferences. Muslim expatriates in labour camps may share the preference but have less opportunity to express it. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. The premium sheepmeat is that from Arab 'fat tail' sheep, bred in local flocks and imported from nearby countries. The limited available supply of this type of sheep is supplemented by imports of sheep from Eastern Europe and Australia. Imports from Australia have increased markedly over the last ten years to meet the increased consumer demand resulting from rising incomes and population growth. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. The Australian live sheep are the heaviest in the market and are less expensive than those from most other countries. They are said to be too fat to be ideally suited to the market and to have an undesirable taste, thought to be imparted by the pellets fed during transport. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. The religious requirement for meat to be halal-ie for it to be slaughtered according to the tenets of Islam-and suspicion that imported meat cannot be so relied upon, is an important factor contributing to the strength of the preference for locally slaughtered fresh meat. Religious officials in some of the countries did not subscribe to this mistrust; they indicated willingness to support a publicity campaign to inform consumers of the reliability of Australian Islamic slaughter procedures. Authorities in other countries remain to be convinced of the reliability of Australian procedures. It is evident that a campaign to convince officialdom and the general populace of the religious reliability of Australian meat should be a key element in efforts to expand Australian meat sales to these Middle East countries. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. The Mission was consistently advised by traders and officials that frozen mutton could not be readily substituted for imports of live sheep. So far as the substitution of other frozen or chilled sheep meat for live sheep was concerned the expectations varied from country to country depending upon local circumstances. In Saudi Arabia most live sheep traders claimed that there was little possibility of substitution but some of them were contemplating entering the chilled and frozen trade. Several supermarket and wholesale traders in Saudi Arabia believed there was growth potential in the frozen and chilled sheep meat trade and had programs planned or underway reflecting this. In the other main Australian live sheep importing countries visited, the position concerning future growth potential was complicated due to the existence of discriminatory pricing arrangements favouring fresh meat. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. Several live sheep importers informed the Mission of efforts being made to develop additional sources of supply of live sheep. These included proposals for substantial investment in developing sheep production in potential supplying countries. It was acknowledged that interruption to the supply of live sheep from Australia would probably cause short-term difficulties. There was confidence that these difficulties would be overcome through the development and tapping of alternative sources of supply. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. Notwithstanding the preference for fresh locally slaughtered meat, there is evidence of gradual acceptance of imported meat among the local populations in some of the countries. This is most evident in Saudi Arabia where, with the aid of Government subsidies, chilled and frozen imported meat is sold at considerably lower prices than fresh locally slaughtered meat. It is also evident in the United Arab Emirates where again imported meat is available at lower prices than the fresh product because of policies which allow normal price relativities to prevail. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. Among the imported meats sold in souks and butcher shops, chilled meat appears to be preferred over frozen and commands a higher price. Of the imported sheep meats, light lean lamb is most in demand. This demand is claimed to be due to a composite of factors one of which is a preference for very lean meat. Chilled or frozen mutton is not apparent in the market places mainly patronised by the local inhabitants. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. In Kuwait and Bahrain the fresh meat preference is reinforced by direct Government subsidies on live sheep imports which result in fresh meat from imported sheep being less expensive than the chilled or frozen product. In Libya , fresh and imported chilled meat are both subsidised and sold at the same price . The Libyan State organisation responsible for all meat imports and distribution does not supply frozen meat except in small quantities to hotels and oil companies. </PARA>
<PARA> 13. The real cost of meat from imported live sheep in all the countries is generally higher than the cost of imported chilled meat and well above the cost of imported frozen meat. In the absence of subsidies, fresh meat would be expected to sell at the highest price followed by chilled meat and then frozen. </PARA>
<PARA> 14. In all five countries, chicken consumption and production has increased remarkably over the last ten years. Chicken meat supplies include large quantities of imported frozen chicken except in Libya which is self-sufficient. In all of the countries chicken sells at lower prices than red meat and is a major dietary item for local inhabitants and expatriates alike. The ready acceptance of frozen imported chicken, apart from its convenience, is said to be due to chicken being a comparitively new item in local diets and consequently not subject to long standing traditions. Chicken is subject to Islamic slaughter requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> 15. Expatriates presently appear to be the main consumers of imported chilled and frozen sheep meats and beef. </PARA>
<PARA> 16. In Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries the expatriate demand is segmented. Western style supermarkets and a hotel and restaurant market serve business and professional people. A catering trade serves the large number of foreign workers in construction and oil camps. There is a gradual trend for the more westernised of the local people to purchase at least some of their meat requirements from supermarkets in chilled or frozen form. </PARA>
<PARA> 17. In Libya, segmentation of the market is less apparent. There, imported chilled meat, mainly beef, is sold through the same outlets as locally slaughtered fresh meat. </PARA>
<PARA> 18. Meat from a wide range of supplying countries is evident in all segments of the imported meat markets. Price competition is strong between products of like quality. Products which consumers regard as being of superior quality can command price premiums which sometimes are substantial. Secure and attractive packaging provides a marketing advantage for retail packs. The packaging of Australian meat at retail level should be improved to match competing countries' product presentation. </PARA>
<PARA> 19. Regulations imposing restricted entry periods and shelf life for chilled and a frozen meat are likely to limit the expansion of Australia's meat exports to some countries. Other local health regulations which prohibit the sale of frozen meat alongside fresh, the freezing of chilled meat and the thawing of frozen meat place limitations on the ability to promote demand for imported meat . The technical justification for these requirements could be questionable. </PARA>
<PARA> 20. The Mission learnt of the emergence of Mainland China as a mutton exporter to Kuwait. 1981 exports from China to Kuwait represented in excess of 1500 tonnes or expressed as a percentage of total imports 22 per cent. Imported mutton from China is utilised in the catering industry. </PARA>
<PARA> 21. All of the countries visited have plans to build new modern abattoirs which will significantly increase slaughter capacity. In Saudi Arabia the expansion was explained as being part of a policy to encourage butchers and individual consumers to have livestock slaughtered in an abattoir rather than in backyard facilities. However, it appears the planned expansion in all of the countries would provide capacity in excess and in some cases well in excess, of present or likely future domestic market requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> 22. There are also plans to provide a variety of by-products processing plants and for facilities for further processing of locally slaughtered meat into consumer cuts and products and for a capacity for freezing meat. </PARA>
<PARA> 23. Supermarkets and fast food outlets are currently enjoying a buoyant period with considerable expansion planned for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> 24. Except in Libya there is no shortage of cold storage facilities either at portside or internally. Libya has very limited capacity for storing frozen meat and only a small expansion is planned. Household refrigerators and freezers are said to be commonplace especially in the main urban centres. </PARA>
<PARA> 25. The Mission was informed of recent animal disease outbreaks in certain ports serviced by vessels carrying live sheep from Australia. One outbreak was identified as rinderpest and descriptions of others suggested that they may have involved diseases exotic to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> 26. Concern was expressed in certain markets about Australia's unreliability as a trading partner due to industrial disputation. On pursuing this question not all delays could be substantiated as due to this cause. </PARA>
<PARA> 27. The Mission was told of the desire of Middle East businessmen to invest in agriculture and processing industries in Australia. One reason advanced for such investment was to ensure future supplies. </PARA>
<PARA> 28. The Mission learnt of the establishment of another large National livesheep buying and shipping company, Saudi Livestock Transport and Trading Company. On the basis of plans outlined to the Mission it would appear that this organisation, together with Kuwait Livestock Transport and Trading Company, will account for a very large proportion of sheep purchased and shipped from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>SUMMARY OF  FINDINGS BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE AUSTRALASIAN MEAT INDUSTRY EMPLOYEES' UNION</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The AMIEU is concerned at the planned building of new abattoirs in the countries visited. The countries are importing the maximum number of sheep available from other suppliers. It is evident that the expected increase in the throughput is to be supplied by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The demand for Australian mutton continues to grow. Imports in 1980 by the countries visited reached 88,150 tonnes, (3,875,000 live sheep, equivalent carcass weight 77,500 tonnes, plus 10,650 tonnes of processed mutton). </PARA>
<PARA> 3. The figure continued to rise in 1981 when mutton imports reached 102,000 tonnes, (4.5 million sheep, equivalent tonnage of 88,150 tonnes, plus 12,028 tonnes of processed mutton). </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The foregoing figures clearly indicate that the major demand is for big framed wether carcasses and continues to increase annually. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. The local populations in all the countries visited have a strong preference for fresh meat, particularly sheepmeat. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. Prior to refrigeration becoming widely available (within the last 10 years), the only way to keep meat fresh was to keep it alive. The tradition of arranging the consumption of the whole carcass at one sitting was because meat left over could not be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. All countries visited continue to tolerate the belief that the only way to be sure that sheep meat from Australia is Hal-Al, is to slaughter it locally. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. Kuwait, Bahrain and Libya directly discriminate against processed mutton by regulation or embargo. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. In Kuwait and Bahrain the fresh meat preference is reinforced by price fixing and subsidy arrangements which result in fresh meat from imported sheep being less expensive than the chilled or frozen product. Libya imposes a total embargo against frozen or chilled mutton from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. In Saudi Arabia the preference for fresh sheepmeat is maintained despite prices of fresh meat being substantially higher than chilled and frozen meat prices. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. Frozen chicken is widely available, its low cost ensures that it is the predominant meat item fed to the large number of foreign workers maintained in labour camps throughout the countries visited. The volume of poultry consumed by foreign labourers may be the reason that the authorities appear unconcerned that the meat is not necessarily Hal-Al. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. A demand exists among the wealthier expatriates for chilled and frozen lamb of 8-12 kg; a demand exists also for chilled and frozen beef and veal. </PARA>
<PARA> 13. Competition for the preferred type of sheepmeat is keen with other suppliers better able to provide the smaller framed lamb carcass. The large expatriate population of the UAE are the main consumers of chilled and frozen sheep meats. </PARA>
<PARA> 14. The expatriate demand is segmented-a supermarket trade and a hotel and restaurant trade serving business and professional people. </PARA>
<PARA> 15. There is a gradual trend for the more westernised members of the local people to purchase at least some of their meat requirements from supermarkets in chilled or frozen form. </PARA>
<PARA> 16. Australia's domestic consumption accounts for 80-90% of lamb production, the average carcass weight of which is 16 kg. Therefore heavy lamb, hogget and young mutton offer the best opportunities for expanding Australia's sheep meat exports to the expatriate market. This is subject to current discriminatory regulations being eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA> 17. With the exception of the UAE, mutton consistent with the following specification represents 80-90% of sheep meats consumed. </PARA>
<PARA> 18. The countries visited have a strong preference for big framed wethers weighing in excess of 50 kg live weight (and preferably heavier). There are no other countries capable of supplying the market with sheep of similar type. </PARA>
<PARA> 19. Libya has a preference for wethers of a more common weight i.e. 40-45 kg live weight. Despite this, Libya is forced to purchase at least 50% of its requirements from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> 20. Frozen or chilled mutton will have to be shipped by sea if significant quantities are to be involved. This will require a review of live sheep regulations by the countries visited and the assistance of the respective Governments in overturning the existing prejudice based on religious grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> 21. Several traders, particularly in Saudi Arabia are interested in testing the market for this type of meat if given market development assistance from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> 22. In devising marketing arrangements for these meats there should be an effort to have them sold alongside fresh mutton on a price competitive basis. </PARA>
<PARA> 23. In Kuwait and Bahrain this would require the co-operation of the local authorities in varying existing price control and subsidy arrangements which favour the import of live sheep rather than meat. In Libya the current embargo against Australian mutton would have to be terminated. </PARA>
<PARA> 24. We will also need to seek variation of regulations in some countries which prohibit thawing of frozen carcasses or which require chilled meat to be sold on the same basis as frozen. </PARA>
<PARA> 25. Provided that the negative factors contained in Items 7 and 8 are eliminated the prospects for mutton exports to the countries visited is encouraging. In the circumstances the imposition of a ratio is clearly a matter of political judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> 26. It is clear, however, that live sheep importers have taken all possible steps to obtain live sheep supplies from alternative sources. The Mission was unable to identify other suppliers capable of replacing Australia from its current dominant position. </PARA>
<PARA> 27. Ninety-six percent of sheep slaughtered in Kuwait are imported from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> 28. The AMIEU is of the view that the demand for big framed wether mutton will continue to rise. A ratio would ensure that a proportion of the market would therefore be supplied with frozen or chilled carcass mutton. </PARA>
<PARA> 29. In all the countries visited, the requirement was for sheep meat from Australia to be Hal-Al and the view was that imported mutton from Australia cannot be relied upon. This is the major factor contributing to the preference for locally slaughtered sheep meat. </PARA>
<PARA> 30. Religious authorities in some of the countries did not subscribe to this mistrust but acknowledged that it existed; they would lend their support to a publicity program to inform consumers of the reliability and correctness of Australian Islamic slaugher procedures. Success would depend upon demonstrable Government support. </PARA>
<PARA> 31. The Mission was informed of outbreaks of animal diseases exotic to Australia. The diseases included, Sheep Pox, Foot and Mouth, Rinderpest and Screw-worm Fly. </PARA>
<PARA> 32. The AMIEU is concerned that livestock vessels are regularly visiting Australia shortly after sailing from areas where the above diseases are prevalent. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the authors of the statement deserve high commendation. It is only when one reads this document that one appreciates the complexities of Australian citizenship, particularly when one has to relate one's own national attitudes to international obligations. Pages 4 and 5 of the report mention an area of abuse. If a woman in Australia on a tourist visa gives birth to a child there is a bit of a tug of war as to the child's citizenship. This has occurred with Asians on a number of occasions. If they are Chinese and return to Malaysia or Singapore, particularly Malaysia, they get the full viciousness of Malaysian hostility to Chinese. On a number of occasions Australia has had to bail out a family because the hard line Malaysian attitude was that a child born in Australia and going back with its mother and father to Malaysia was, in Malaysian eyes, an illegal alien. </PARA>
<PARA> In other situations the parents could plan to acquire citizenship for the child and then use it as a lever to get permanent domicile themselves. The compromise on page 5 of this statement endeavours to get the best of the two worlds. It will be interesting, when this statement has been digested, to see how people view the matter. On reflection, it is probably the best possible solution. The report, I am pleased, mentions the removal of 'British subject', as distinct from 'Australian citizen'. The word 'subject' is more of a relic of colonial days. I commend the former Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and his advisers on its removal. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I mention is very delicate in view of a number of deportation cases, particularly two that are pending. The statement deals with people committing offences just before or just after they are granted citizenship. I regarded it as an historic day in the Senate when Mr Justice Murphy, who was the Attorney-General, removed discriminatory clauses in the Crimes Act which were a hangover, an obsession of non-Labor governments in the 1920s. There was a maritime dispute. Two men who had permanent residence, Australian citizenship, namely, Jacob Johansen and a chap named Walsh, who were of Scandinavian and Irish origin, were regarded as the demons of the trade union movement. They were never deported but the provisions hung like the sword of Damocles until 1972. An enlightened Attorney-General, Lionel Murphy, then removed them. </PARA>
<PARA> I admit that maybe some Nazi war criminals have come to Australia who could have been sent back to face retribution. As late as this year several Baltic nationals who were SS men came to Australia. One was aged 70. To the best of my knowledge he has been sent back and other charges are pending. We had a similar case with a chap named Vicks. A minority of members of the Australian Labor Party wanted action to be taken. The then Attorney-General, Lionel Murphy, felt that Australia was leaning on the side of civil liberty. I felt that people such as war criminals should not have been the beneficiaries of the liberal attitude we took on citizenship. To show how slowly we are moving with the times, that discriminatory practice was removed by Canada in the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> The other points that I want to refer to are in themselves not large. I refer, firstly, to the amazing discrimination involved in the provision whereby a British woman ordinarily resident in Australia who bears a child out of wedlock out of the country can register that child as an Australian citizen but if the woman is not British the child cannot be registered as an Australian citizen. The step that has been taken is not big but it is a belated recognition of equality. I have some reservations in relation to this consolidated franchise. Some United States nationals come here to avoid their call-up and Vietnam commitments, others went to Scandinavian countries. Some of them have been rather scornful since acquiring Danish citizenship or Australian citizenship. I do not think any of us should be jingoistic in our attitude to citizenship, but we do not like free riders. It is no reflection on Senator Peter Baume, but if Senator Chaney were in the chamber I would say to him that I believe that to some degree the unravelling of the reciprocal arrangements for social security benefits with one or two countries in Europe might have deterred some people who were on the threshold of obtaining citizenship and who felt that they would lose some social security benefits if they proceeded. I do not say that they were quite so mercenary about it. </PARA>
<PARA> My use of the word 'mercenary' reminds me of the activities of mad Mick Hoare and his fellow mercenaries. He is presently facing trial in South Africa. It burns me up that he ignored Australian laws about Australian citizens being involved in brushfire wars. Our diplomatic people have had to become involved in this matter. I question whether a person such as that, who is prepared to get involved in these private wars, is entitled to hold Australian citizenship. However, that is a low grade matter; it is not a major matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The reference in the ministerial statement to children of marriages of an overseas nature transferring to Australian citizenship recalls to mind the situation of a mate of mine who has been out of Australia continuously and who is active in the commercial world of Japan and other Asian coutries. There was a time when I was a bit amused with the problems that Britain had with the dominions beyond the seas following the acquisition of independence of African countries and the role played by Indians with British passports. Frankly, I felt some of these people should have stayed with their African brothers, helping with their merchandise skills and contributing taxes, rather than going to Britain. But, whether these people were of Indian or African extraction, Britain was their country of nationality. I apply that situation to Australia in speaking of the mobility of Australians. I recognise that our people of the diplomatic corps and those accepting United Nations assignments face some very intricate problems in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by referring to the fact that it has been indicated that a large number of people have not sought Australian citizenship. I was encouraged last night by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle pointing out that we are overcoming some of the bureaucratic roadblocks-for example, the slowness in Federal or State police screening. Also, we have been able to infuse additional clerical staff into the system. I am sure that Barry Cotter of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association will be happy with the efforts of people on this side of the chamber to bring about the breakthrough. With those words of wisdom, I commend the ministerial statement. I hope that we will have further discussions on these matters before they become law. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This statement by the former Minister for Communications, Mr Sinclair, purports to deal with issues surrounding the development and establishment of a domestic satellite system in Australia. The statement is remarkable not so much for what it says but for the issues which it leaves unresolved in relation to the domestic satellite which has been proposed. The first issue which it leaves unresolved, of course, is the cost. At this stage the final cost of a domestic satellite for Australia is completely indecisive. The only fixed cost that can be pointed to is that of $166m which is to be paid under contract to the Hughes Aerospace Corporation of the United States in respect of the satellite. That cost is fixed. Every other cost is open-ended. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that the Department of Finance, which is responsible for providing the money, has queried the cost of the domestic satellite. Yet no Government statement has been made in response to that query from the Department of Finance. I do not know whether this Government, which talks about the market place and so on, is a very good example to the market place in the way in which it does business in relation to issues such as the investment of what will probably be in the order of $600m in respect of that satellite as there has been no financial statement provided as to the projected cost. There has never been an economic analysis, a cost-benefit analysis, of the cost of the provision of a domestic satellite to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a government which talks so much about knocking off some little committee here or something else there under the direction of the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee, the so-called razor gang-an exercise which every public servant in Canberra knows is costing much more than the continuation of those bodies would cost. We are now almost at a stage where we can identify some of the costs of the razor gang's recommendations in terms of the ongoing costs and the actual costs of changing arrangements in the Public Service. The Government, which talks a lot about these issues, is here talking about spending $600m of taxpayers' money without any economic analysis or cost- benefit analysis of what is involved. I think it is important to note in relation to financial matters that, except in regard to broadcasting to the outback of Australia and the provision of telephones to the outback of Australia , the satellite is just a technical alternative to the terrestrial system of communications which we already have. It will be used for data transfer, television relaying, et cetera. I simply make the point that the major cities of Australia are already terrestrialy linked in respect of the television transmission, data transfer and so on to which I have referred. In terms of benefit as against the cost the only perceived benefit at the moment, as distinct from the benefits that can be provided by a terrestrial system, is in respect of some outback broadcasting and the provision of television services to some people in the outback. We do not for a moment say that is not important. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Peter Baume would know, the satellite provided only an alternative route to the existing terrestrial system. The signal goes up and down instead of across the land mass. If one looks at the matter in perspective, the all-up cost of perhaps $600m is over half of Telecom Australia's current annual investment of about a billion dollars. That investment of $600m, of course, is to be spread over several years. If that is so, it should be regarded as just like any other investment in telecommunications, because that is what it is-an investment in telecommunications-and it should be stripped of its mystique . There is no reason why the costs of the satellite should not be subject to the same frank disclosure by Government as are the costs of other telecommunications services. It is high time the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), whose Department has queried the costs of the satellite on a number of occasions, came into this chamber and made a statement about the costs of the satellite and gave some estimate of the cost and benefits as that Department sees them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is nothing in Mr Sinclair's statement about these matters and there is nothing about the management of the satellite, particularly how that management will be integrated with the terrestrial system, that is, the system provided by Telecom. Perhaps that is why Mr Sinclair has been moved to the defence portfolio -because this sort of statement does not stand up to any critical analysis which should be made of a development such as this and at this cost. I shudder to think what will happen if defence estimating is done on the same sort of basis, although, of course, it is already, if one examines some of the projected expenditure on capital works in relation to defence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I think I said the defence expenditure would not stand up to examination. There has to be an examination of that. I am pre-judging that, if you like. There is nothing in this statement about limitations of ownership in the company Aussat Pty Ltd which will manage the satellite. There is, more importantly, nothing about possible conflict of interest between companies which are both shareholders in that satellite company and users of the satellite service. A most important principle in telecommunications throughout the world is the separation of hardware from software-engineers call it hardware-software separation-and the separation of those who provide the services from those who use them. In this statement no consideration is given to that very important question. I can tell honourable senators now that, if people who are providing a service are also using it, it will be said, and quite properly, that there is always the suspicion that users who are also shareholders in the service company will obtain some benefit or other which other potential users will not have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All these matters are related to the inquiry into telecommunications being conducted by the Davidson Committee. Last year, in correcting Mr Mansfield, the secretary of the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association-the relevant union-Mr Sinclair said that the Davidson inquiry had nothing to do with the satellite. As reported in the House of Representatives Hansard of 6 may this year-I do not have time to quote the remarks now-Mr Sinclair referred to the Davidson Committee's important decisions about the domestic satellite. There is nothing in this statement about other methods, about the second proposed commercial satellite. There is nothing in the statement about methods of bringing television services to remote areas using terrestrial means such as radio concentrators. One cannot help feeling that this whole satellite project is simply an expensive, uncosted exercise in gee whiz technology, 'gee whiz' being, of course, the nickname given to the former Minister who launched this project, and a number of other red hares, I suppose I had better say, instead of red herrings, in communications policy which the present Government is now desperately trying to follow up. It is time for a proper evaluation of the cost of this satellite. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak only very briefly to outline the major concern that the Australian Democrats have about the establishment of a national communications satellite system. We agree with the comments of the Opposition as outlined by Senator Button that there has been no cost-benefit analysis of a satellite. We are talking about a large amount-$600m or more. It is a very large expenditure at a time when governments are looking at ways and means of saving money, and one has to query the priorities at this time. Certainly there should be a cost-benefit analysis, but such an analysis has not been carried out. That is one area of oversight by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But even assuming that a satellite has to come to this country and that we have to face up to such an expenditure at this time, we are particularly concerned about the ownership of Aussat Pty Ltd. The Government has said it will control 51 per cent of the shares but it has put no restriction on the private ownership of the other 49 per cent of the company. It is wide open for users or individuals to own very large parcels of that 49 per cent of shares. We see grave dangers in this in that users can also become very large part-owners, shareholders, in the operation of the company. This would give the users and the shareholders a very powerful say in how the satellite is to be used. We, as a party, are already concerned about the concentration of ownership of the media and communications generally in this country. We believe that the national interest is best served if there is the widest possible diversity of ownership in communications. So we would like to see the Government impose a limit of 5 per cent on private shareholdings in the Aussat company. If this were done it would ensure that the satellite was used to the benefit of all Australians and would give them some feeling of involvement in a very important new area of technology. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As a result of the letter received by the President from the Chairman of the Administrative Review Council, the Senate, I believe, finds itself in a catch-22 situation. The motion referred to by Mr Tucker in his letter to the President, as he says was agreed to by a majority of the Senate on 29 April 1982. The notice of that motion had in fact been on the Notice Paper of the Senate since 18 August 1981. We had a debate in this place involving people on this side of the chamber and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) and for all that time the Government had the opportunity to consider this motion. My point is that of all the arguments used against the motion-the Government opposed the motion on the night of 28 April 1982-the one argument that was not used by the Government was the argument that the Administrative Review Council had no power to deal with the administrative advice tendered to certain Ministers on the use of agent orange and other defoliants in Vietnam. I believe that I would have found it to be a fairly compelling argument. We may have considered changing the motion in some way but we did not do so. The argument was not put forward as a reason to vote against the motion. Either the Government had not considered seriously the motion and the powers of the Administrative Review Council or it was indulging in a political tactic knowing quite well that the Administrative Review Council would consider that it could not deal with the matter referred to in the motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point I wish to make arises out of the very sensible letter by Mr Tucker to the President. Mr Tucker points out that the functions of the Review Council are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to ascertain, and keep under review, the classes of administrative decisions that are not the subject of review by a court, tribunal or other body.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to make recommendations to the Minister as to whether any of those classes of decisions should be the subject of review by a court, tribunal or other body and, if so, as to the appropriate court, tribunal or other body to make that review;</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, classes would appear to be general rather than specific and it would appear that the Administrative Review Council can consider only these classes and not specific forms of administration as the Senate requested in its motion. Therefore, as Mr Tucker says, his interpretation is that the matter does not come within the ambit of the Council's statutory functions. He then goes on to add:</PARA>
<PARA>the Commonwealth Ombudsman is empowered to investigate 'action that relates to a matter of administration'. </PARA>
<PARA>He further points out that the Ombudsman can deal with specific instances as was mentioned in the motion agreed to by the Senate. The difficulty, of course, is that the Ombudsman's function is qualified. The Ombudsman cannot conduct a public inquiry; he reports only to Ministers and to the Government. So we are in a catch-22 situation when we want to investigate administration, or maladministration, of this type. The Administrative Review Council cannot deal with specific forms of administration. The Ombudsman can do so, but not publicly , and he does not report publicly. I suggest that Mr Tucker's letter, quite unexpectedly to me demonstrates that we have a hiatus between the functions of the Administrative Review Council and the Ombudsman. I think it is something that the Senate, the Government and the Opposition will have to consider in the future. We will now reconsider our position on this matter. We will come up with a more definitive reply later. I thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, for producing this letter and giving us the opportunity to comment on it in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee has been gratified to note the response to its activities, both within and outside the Parliament, and has no doubt that such responses have contributed to its effectiveness and have assisted in its arriving at the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report. A number of matters raised by the Committee have resulted in useful amendments to legislation this year. The Committee wishes to pay special tribute to its counsel, Professor Dennis Pearce, of the Australian National University. Without his dedication and skill in performing the onerous function which has been imposed upon him-particularly during this experimental period of the Committee's operations-the task of scrutinising the many Bills which have come before the Committee would have been virtually impossible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While I have moved at this stage for the adoption of the report, the Committee is concerned to ensure that senators have sufficient opportunity to study the comments made, and its conclusions and recommendations. At the same time, the Committee wishes to ensure that the work it has been performing continues until the Senate is able to reach a decision on the report. For this reason, I will be seeking leave to give a notice of motion, which if agreed to by the Senate, would make transitional arrangements for the continued operation of a scrutiny committee until such time as the Senate determines whether a standing committee for the scrutiny of Bills should be permanently established, and, if so whether, an appropriate Standing Order should govern its operations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the reasons why I wish to speak briefly again to these estimates is that last night, when we were talking about the cost of providing for children within the Australian Capital Territory, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) said that most of the children being looked after were children who had some particular problems, such as coming from broken homes or being orphans, and that because of that element the cost of looking after them was probably higher than it should have been under normal circumstances. I make just this point: If that information is correct, it certainly was not given to the Estimates Committee. It was not given by the Minister. From the Hansard report of the discussion in Estimates Committee F, we find that a number of statements were made, particularly one by Mr Wall. He referred to the cost of keeping children or looking after children in the Australian Capital Territory, but he also said that only a slight number of children had some problems and were looked after outside the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that we would need to get information from the Minister as to the number of children who are being looked after in those homes and who have some particular problem, be it medical or psychological, or some problem which would mean that the cost of looking after the child would be much higher than under normal circumstances. I again draw the attention of the Senate to the problem that exists, or the problem that I see. The cost of looking after a child was listed at $250 a week. We then looked a little further and noted from the information given to Estimates Committee F that to foster a child the cost was $30 a week. Looking back at the Government's record in relation to child endowment, I am not sure that the Government pays extra money to single parents who have to look after children, and I am not sure that the Government pays extra money to a parent who has a child who has a special medical problem. It seems to me that it is a fairly fallacious argument to use-because of the high cost-that all these children have special care. </PARA>
<PARA> In the statements made to the Estimates Committee, there is no statement by the Minister that sets out those details. I ask the Minister to give the number of children held in those institutions or homes, those that have special problems, and what is the cost of those children as compared with the costs for children whom we would call normal children in those homes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I realise that there was not a full discussion on all those aspects in the Estimates Committee. I drew the attention of Senator Jones to that last night. As to the specific question about the numbers involved and the details of that, I shall endeavour to get that information for the honourable senator. We do not have it available at present.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a matter that I wish to raise again with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner). I raised it on the first reading of the Bill. It is in relation to an answer which I am still awaiting to a question that I gave on notice on 18 November 1981. I shall repeat the question for the Minister in the hope that, if his officers do not have the answer today, I shall be in receipt of it before the debate resumes, on my notice of motion, on Thursday of next week. As I said the other day, I was most disturbed that, whilst some six months ago I sought an answer to my question and had not received it, Senator Messner, in his reply to a debate here on 29 April- on a notice of motion of mine in relation to Commonwealth home loans-was able to use some figures which I had sought. He said to me, in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that Senator McLaren mentioned one or two people who had low interest loans in the Australian Capital Territory but I note that there were many others . In fact, 5,900 people in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister was able to pluck that figure out of the air to use in a debate in endeavouring to rebut my argument, but he has not been able to provide me with the figures, and I would be interested to know where he got that particular figure from. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall just refresh the Minister's memory with the question I put on notice on 18 November:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLaren: To ask the Minister representing the Minister for the Capital Territory-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) How many people in the Australian Capital Territory are in receipt of long term Commonwealth Home Loans at interest rates fixed at 6.25 per cent per annum, or lower. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) What income brackets are these people in and what are the terms and interest rates applicable to each income bracket. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Are any of the recipients Cabinet Ministers, if so what are their names and the terms and interest rates applicable to their respective loans. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) How many persons, if any, in each of the States were able to obtain the same generous long term low-interest provisions of the Commonwealth Home Loans. </PARA>
<PARA>I shall not enter into any debate on this matter today, because there is a debate in process in this Parliament, which I hope will be determined before the Parliament rises. However, I want to make a brief explanation. In paragraph (2) of my question, I ask what income brackets these people are in. I have no complaint about people on low incomes having low interest rate home loans. I have no complaint about ex-servicemen who served this country in World War I or World War II having such loans, but I have a complaint about such loans being granted to people on very high incomes, such as the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon), who has now paid off his loan, and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) who, as far as I am aware, still has a long term, low interest home loan. It is loans for those people to which I object. </PARA>
<PARA> I have presented many petitions to this Parliament calling upon the Government to make these same generous terms available to the many disadvantaged people who are now paying abnormally high rates of interest for home loans. I have no objection to people on low incomes being in receipt of low interest rate home loans. That is quite right. I have no objection to those provisions being made available for ex-servicemen who have served this country in time of need. If the Minister does not have the figures now, I hope that he will provide me with them before we enter into the debate next Thursday. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recall the earlier references from Senator McLaren and, in particular, the question that he asked on 18 November last year. In relation to his further comments on 6 May, I think, when he commented upon certain information that I made available at that time, it was very limited information, of course, and it referred only to the total number of loans. I think that the number was 5,900. I may also have referred to the fact that the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) had discharged his loan with the housing authority. That was the only information which I supplied at that time, and it did not go very far along the road to answering the full question asked by Senator McLaren on 18 November. The information I provided then was basically public knowledge. As I think will be acknowledged, there was some public comment about Mr Nixon discharging his loan, and there had been newspaper reports about the numbers of people at previous times having loans of this kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the further points, I shall not take the matter any further, because I shall seek to get the information for which the honourable senator asked in the latter part of his comments. I just make the observation that those cheap loans were made available back in 1964 at a time when interest rates were much lower than they are today; but, because of the documentation that was prepared at that time, that was a feature of all loans made at that particular time. I understand that the necessary documentation covering such loans in these circumstances has been changed since then, so that there are now applicable to these kinds of loans variable interest rates as distinct from the situation that existed before . But as to the exact detail which Senator McLaren is seeking, I shall need to take that request on notice. I undertake to get that information as quickly as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to deal with an item that comes under the appropriation for the Department of Transport. Last night during the consideration of the estimates for this Department mention was made by Senator Jessop of the Port Augusta airport. He said he had raised this matter during the hearings of Estimates Committee F. I just want to quote a couple of lines of what he said as recorded at page 298 of the Senate Estimates Committee Hansard of 22 April. Talking about the Port Augusta airport he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a very small aerodrome at the moment, catering mainly for the flying doctor and light aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement has caused some concern in the Port Augusta area because a commercial air service provided by Pagas Airlines does operate into that airport . Many charter aircraft also use it. There is a Bandeirante 8-seater aircraft which operates through there on a regular basis to Leigh Creek. I just want to acquaint people with the fact that that service is there. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter which Senator Jessop spoke about last night was the plea that he had made to the then Minister for Transport for some upgrading of the airport and some undertakings that he claimed he had been given. Of course Senator Jessop in years gone by has claimed to have been given many undertakings in relation to the far west of South Australia, particularly in respect to television services. As yet a lot of them have not eventuated. What we in South Australia are now hoping is that this matter for which he has asked for high priority to be given in the Budget is not just another furphy floating around. I will quote what he did say lat night as recorded at page 2192 of the Senate Hansard. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has given me the undertaking that he will give it priority. </PARA>
<PARA>Well, of course my interjection was:</PARA>
<PARA> What undertaking has the Minister for Transport given to Mr Wallis?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Wallis is, of course, the honourable member for Grey, and has been for quite a number of years. As a matter of fact, it was Mr Wallis who unseated Senator Jessop when he was the honourable member for Grey. Mr Wallis has been pursing this matter ever since he has been the honourable member for Grey in an attempt to get the airport upgraded. I spoke to him this morning. He had also heard what took place last night. Further on in the speech Senator Jessop said:</PARA>
<PARA> I think I have had a lot longer interest in that subject than the person to whom Senator McLaren referred. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Wallis has now asked me, seeing that Senator Jessop was so deeply involved in that airport, whether Senator Jessop in fact had had any part in the siting of the airport at the time. It was sited wrongly because of the height of the hills . Now, when the airport is going to be sealed, it has to be reoriented some seven degrees to bring it up to civil aviation standards. Mr Wallis also reminded me that immediately the reshuffle of the Cabinet took place he wrote to Mr Fife, who is now responsible for civil aviation matters, and asked him to determine as a priority the sealing of the Port Augusta airstrip and its upgrading. I just want to point out that whilst Senator Jessop may claim some responsibility for whatever is going to happen there, Mr Wallis has been right on the ball for many, many years in trying to get this airport upgraded because he uses it on a regular basis, at least when Parliament is sitting, flying to and from Canberra. He is concerned not only for his own safety but also for the safety and wellbeing of every other person who uses that airport, and in particular the people who operate aircraft in and out of Port Augusta. </PARA>
<PARA> I make this plea on behalf of Mr Wallis because the other place is not sitting. He was going to make this plea in the other place some weeks ago but of course they operate in a different fashion from the way we operate in this place. A member can be stopped in full flight when he is on his feet. Mr Wallis rose to speak about the problems during the debate on the Civil Aviation (Carriers Liability) Amendment Bill. He was also going to bring up the matter of the state of the Port Augusta airport. I think he got about four words out of his mouth before the gag was applied. He could not make that speech. It would have been most important, particularly for the people in the far western part of the State in which he resides and which he represents. He was most upset about that. Fortunately that does not happen in this place. Once a senator is on his feet, irrespective of whether he is annoying the people opposite or the Leader he cannot be sat down unless he offends Standing Orders. As long as he sticks to the subject under consideration he can go ahead and say his piece. That does not happen in the other place. It was unfortunate for Mr Wallis otherwise what he has been endeavouring to do over the years to get some work done on that airport would have been on the public record. I just make a plea on behalf of Mr Wallis that Mr Fife should take immediate notice of the letter which Mr Wallis has written to him on behalf of the people who use that airport, and in particular on behalf of the local council. I am not going to get into that argument because Senator Jessop has made some claims about local ownership. I am sure the local council and the airport committee, of which Mr Wallis is a member, will be able to handle that in the way that it ought to be handled when they are given a copy of this Hansard which is already in the mail to them. They will be perusing it early on Monday morning. </PARA>
<PARA> I again make the plea to Senator Messner that he remind Mr Fife that if he has not already got that letter from Mr Wallis it is in the pipeline because he wrote to him immediately he received the appointment and asked him to give this matter urgent priority. I hope that when we come to the Budget session there will be an appropriation to do the work at the Port Augusta airport which we on this side of the chamber are very concerned to see take place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might be able to expand on the status of the development of the Port Augusta airport at this stage for the benefit of Senator McLaren. The aerodrome is owned and operated by the Corporation of the City of Port Augusta as an authorised landing area. The Corporation has made submissions to the Department recently about local ownership. The Department considers that work to bring the aerodrome to full standards for current and known future aviation needs, and to satisfy licensing requirements, could be justifiable in the context of local ownership entry. That means that the Corporation could well qualify for prospective grants of 50 per cent of the costs under the normal program. This entry to the plan would proceed if agreement can be reached with the Corporation on the scope of the works necessary and for which Commonwealth grants would be sought and agreement can be reached with central agencies on the justification for entry. But all of this would depend upon the availability of funds. This of course brings us back to the point I made last night, that is, that this is a matter for the Budget and it will be considered in that context.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the estimates for the Department of Health. I have a question relating to additional information given to me only yesterday. This information had been sought during the Estimates Committee hearing. I ask the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) to ask the departmental officers to give me some additional information. I had asked whether the Department's computer fails to check what speciality medical services are provided by doctors who are qualified in that particular speciality . The Department's answer is that the Department has considered this comment and will make changes to the automatic data processing system which will permit this check to be carried out in two specialities from 1 July. I ask: Why only two speciality areas? If it is possible for two areas to be checked, why is it not possible for all areas to be checked?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also asked what steps had been taken to overcome the matters raised by the Auditor-General. The answer that has been provided states that of the 20 matters raised by the Auditor-General the Department has advised that, from 1 July, 14 matters would be resolved with the introduction of the new ADP system. Four matters were disputed with the Auditor-General's Office with the Department recording its comments. We have not received any record of the comments that I am aware of. I asked the secretary of the committee about this and he is not aware of having received any. I wonder whether the Department can supply me with the information regarding its comments on these disputed areas. We have been told that the Committee will be advised on the progress of two matters about which it has started conducting investigations. I wonder when we can hope to hear of the progress on those two matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to a question of mine, Dr Langsford, the First Assistant Director-General of the Public Health Division responded that the working party on occupational health needs of women in the work force has not met for some time but that its considerations had been taken over by a major committee which looks at reproduction and family health. This is reassuring because some of the major concerns of the working party related specifically to reproduction related aspects of the health of working women, such as menstrual problems, conception, pregnancy, lactation, the menopause and the very many implications of poor or hazardous working environments or processes for the health of women and/or their offspring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A well attended seminar on women's occupational health was convened by the National Women's Advisory Council in May 1981. This was probably the first full scale serious look at the subject since a survey of working women in Victorian industry was carried out in 1928. The 1981 meeting examined the available data and concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> Women workers as a group experience more stress than men</PARA>
<PARA> A large number of women employed outside the home also carry the main responsibility within the family for household tasks and child care</PARA>
<PARA> Many women are segregated into a number of industries which are particularly hazardous--</PARA>
<PARA>But they are not normally seen to be so-</PARA>
<PARA>(e.g. the manufacturing, food processing, and clothing industries)</PARA>
<PARA> Women tend to fill the low-status occupations, ones which tend to be highly repetitive and produce on average greater tension and stress, as well as physical problems . . . greater insecurity</PARA>
<PARA> Working women face potential health problems associated with their reproductive functions</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, and very importantly-</PARA>
<PARA> Housework is also work-but it is not recognised as such; it is unpaid, involves long hours, often heavy physical work, there is no compensation, leave or safety inspections, and it is subject to numerous conflicting demands. </PARA>
<PARA>All of us are well aware of this. The National Women's Advisory Council in its 1980-81 annual report observed:</PARA>
<PARA> These investigations led us to believe that specific advice on the occupational health needs of women should be considered and presented to the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I eagerly await some evidence of the deliberations of the National Health and Medical Research Council committee on reproduction and family health. One of the most fundamental and crucial contemporary questions would concern the potential mutagenecity, tetragenecity and carcinogenecity of the plethora of chemicals, gases, solvents and metals to which many workers, both male and female, are currently exposed. Many experts have recently drawn attention to the lack of proper analysis, registration and monitoring of the use of potentially very toxic chemicals which are in daily use. I believe that all honourable senators received during this week a publication Livestock and Grain Producer which included an advertisement headed: 'Bulk buys available NOW'. Among the things that people were being urged to buy in bulk was a liquid arsenic dip which was provided in 20 litre containers. There was no indication in this advertisement about any danger which might be associated with the use, the storing or anything else of liquid arsenic dip which farmers were being urged to buy. That represents just one example of the sorts of unacknowledged dangers with which people are coming in contact daily. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr John Matthews of the Australian Council of Trade Unions Trades Hall Council Occupational Health and Safety Unit stated that whole industries have been associated with excess cancer deaths. Sir Edward Hughes, the head of the Monash University's School of Surgery, has called for the collection of occupational data in conjunction with the Victorian Government's cancer registry. Every registry of congenital malformations should also contain the occupational histories of both parents. The Government has a responsibility to prevent birth deformities and cancers of the types that are caused by exposure to harmful industrial and agricultural chemicals. I sincerely hope that the National Health and Medical Research Council and its various committees will prevail upon the Government to identify the hazards and move expeditiously to ensure that no Australian, living or anticipated, is exposed to these unnecessary and largely avoidable risks. </PARA>
<PARA> There are dozens of issues which are desperately in need of investigation particularly in relation to women in the work force. The effect of shift work, for instance, has not been even adequately investigated. There has been no investigation done at all, as far as I am aware, at an official level, of the social, psychological and physiological damage that is caused by the stress of shift work. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two issues which I would like to touch on very briefly. They concern the use of visual display units and radiation and tenosynovitis. Newly introduced computers, particularly visual display units, have created a great deal of anxiety especially among the women who use them for hours and days on end. The VDU is said to be harmless. But in a notorious case four women who were employed as VDU operators by the Toronto Star gave birth to children with congenital defects. No causal link had been proved but neither had the machines been cleared. I know that women who are employed by Telecom Australia are extremely anxious about the possible ill-effects of the constant use of visual display units. Incidentally, I have been told that radiation from VDUs, if it exists, is assumed to emit from the screen in a direct fashion, but in fact it is just as likely to be emitted downwards from the bottom of the unit. So if male users are worried about any adverse effects that radiation might have on their reproductive organs they should be careful not to tuck them under the desk on which the VDU sits. </PARA>
<PARA> The repetition industry affects very many women workers. Pat Young of the Workers Health Resource Centre referred recently to the very high incidence of tenosynovitis-that is, repetition injury-among cleaners, food packers, electrical assemblers, mail sorters, bank clerks who count money and even garbage collectors. Pat Young said that many workers go off on sick pay and then leave the job. She said:</PARA>
<PARA> Many are frightened they will be sacked if they complain: One electrical factory got rid of the problem by firing 45 women. </PARA>
<PARA>Many doctors do not know enough about the injuries to recognise them. Surely this is a state of affairs which is crying out for urgent attention from the NHMRC. In conclusion I would strongly recommend that the Department of Health study chapter 7 of the 1980-81 report of the National Women's Advisory Council, to which I have referred earlier. The report represents the experience of many women who are workers themselves and their voices should be heeded. If the working party on the needs of working women is not to be reconvened by the NHMRC some other means should be devised for bringing these matters urgently before the Council. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Initially I wish to deal with the Department of Social Security. First of all, I refer to a matter which was the subject of some discussion during the Estimates Committee hearing. That is, of course, the matter of staffing. The subject of the staffing of the Department of Social Security is always a feature of the questioning at Estimates committees and this year it was of greater interest because of the dispute between the Government, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) and members of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association regarding staffing levels. Matters have developed since then. I think that they are worth discussing and bringing up during the consideration of the Appropriation Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the past two weeks we have seen a remarkable upgrading of staffing within the Department. On 4 May the provision of 580 additional staff was announced. This produced a new staff ceiling of 12,279. Today another 314 positions have been announced for 1982-83, taking the staff ceiling, on my count, to 12,593. The distribution of those additional staff I will deal with a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> First, I would remind the Committee of the position that existed six months ago . ACOA members of the Department were then asking that an additional 1,000 staff be provided. Later that demand was broken down to one for the immediate provision of 300 additional staff. Work bans were imposed on overpayments as an attention getting device and irritant until the Minister for Social Security took seriously the staff shortages, which were having a depressing effect on the morale of the Department, whose staff members were worried that they were giving poor service to clients-who, heaven knows, were in enough trouble as it was. </PARA>
<PARA> Most honourable senators know what happened. First, there were stand-downs and then the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Act, or CEEP legislation , was revived. To use the jargon, they were 'CEEP-ed'. The Minister was not interested in the reasoned case that the departmental officials were making. I suggest that he was going on like a school master who was interested only in disciplining them, in trying desperately to shore up his position as el supremo in the area, whatever the cost to his front line troops, as they might be called , on the counter, and to the hapless claimants who were forced to line up in their hundreds at the charitable agencies or emergency relief counters of State departments. More than $1m was spent in advertisements and so on abusing the staff. That money was recouped by stopping their pay. Mediation offers were ignored. Pleas by courageous senior staff, who wrote telling the Minister how staff limitations had depressed the quality of services to recipients and jeopardised safeguards on the spending of large amounts of Commonwealth Government money, were ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the dispute the staff ceilings were defended as not only adequate but generous. When the stand-downs, penalties and bans stopped, a couple of weeks before Christmas, the Minister finally agreed, in consultation with the ACOA, upon an independent inquiry into staffing needs-a simple course which could have, and I suggest should have been the beginning and not the end of the process. One of the reasons why it had not been the starting point was that the Director-General of the Department had unilaterally, in October 1981, cancelled the national consultative mechanism for settling disputes. We are told that the independent inquiry is to report in a month's time but the urgency of the proven staffing needs could not even await that. As I have said, on 4 May 580 more jobs were approved by the Public Service Board, independently of any increase granted as a result of the independent review. The ACOA welcomed it as leading to a better service for the needy and underprivileged and claimed that it would be of great satisfaction to members, who had made considerable sacrifices on the issue in November and December last. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we learn that another 314 positions will be provided in the coming financial year. Thus, an additional 894 jobs will have been provided in the Department even before the independent inquiry has finished its work. All of the 80 positions provided on 4 May in the unemployment benefit area went to New South Wales, where the pressure by the ACOA had been most evident and forceful. I suggest that the Public Service board recognised the justice of the ACOA claims within a few months of the union's stand. By comparison, the stand of the Minister was not only petulant, not only extreme but also quite clearly wrong. An analysis of the additional positions granted reveals a few startling assumptions. If one deducts the positions allocated to STRATPLAN, the new $100m computer, to freedom of information staff, 80 per cent of the new staffing is to be devoted to the effects of pension population growth-which does not require much staff work once processing has taken place-and to increase work expected in the unemployment and sickness benefit areas. That is, the bulk of the additional staff, the extra 80 per cent, will be devoted to the processing of unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> An addition of 15 per cent to 20 per cent will be made to the staff in regional offices in 1982-83 because of judgments concerning projected unemployment figures. It is our first signal that the Government expects further considerable increases in unemployment benefits payments and beneficiaries. It would appear that the services area of the Department is again to be the poor relation. It is not to be given additional staff and at this stage it appears that employees there are in total confusion about the intentions of the Ministers and the Director-General. For some months there have been rumours about a reorganisation within the Department, even rumours about the possible abolition of the social welfare division, a combination of service and subsidy areas, and a separate rehabilitation directorate. I suggest that morale is low because confusion reigns as a result of the differing statements that have been made inside and outside the Department, and the lack of communication between the Government, and the directorate of the Department and the rank and file workers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General's report this year directs some attention to the way in which staff shortages have prevented work taking place on the acquittal of the pre-school capital program. A rather bland letter from the Minister assuring me that there are no staff shortage problems in New South Wales has not in fact reassured me, as in two areas-pre-grant interviews for unemployment benefits and the children's services area referred to earlier-his statements are at variance with the comments of the Auditor-General. Quite clearly, all of the fuss and bother that went on last year, all of the the posturing by the Government about the matters of the Public Service in the Department-about how unjust were their activities and claims in the face of what the Minister called generous staffing procedures-have been shown in the last few days to be wrong. The response by the Government has been shown to be wrong. In fact, to a fairly large extent the claims of the organisation which represents the employees are now being met. They could have been met at any early stage, when they could have been demonstrated, to be true, fair and reasonable. Instead we had the performance that we went through last year and the shouting and screaming across the barricades which occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that in future the Government will take more notice, not only of the union and other representatives of workers in the Department, but also of the State Directors of Social Security, at least one of whom, as Senator Chaney knows well-we discussed it during the Estimates committee hearing-reported the difficulties to him a long time ago. It was just that the Government chose last year to make what it thought was political capital out of an unfortunate industrial incident. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to respond immediately to Senator Grimes because he seems to be under a considerable misapprehension and I would hate to prolong his misunderstanding of the situation that he has tried to describe. He appears to have fallen into the same error as did the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association originally with respect to the announcement of staff ceilings as at 30 June 1982 -an error that fortunately we have managed to clear up with that body.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will not canvass all of the matters that Senator Grimes raised because he tried to rerun some of the reels that were run so unsuccessfully last November and December. The position with respect to the announcement of the staff ceiling which is to apply as at 30 June 1982 is simply this: In the course of the year the Department assumed additional functions. Because of Budget provisions we took over certain functions in the health field and we undertook certain additional functions which warranted the obtaining of additional temporary staff ceilings. The reason why a temporary staffing ceiling was obtained was that until those new functions had been tried in the Department and put into operation it was thought that one could not make a final determination as to the staff levels which were required. Indeed, I think it was even conceded by the union that the temporary staff cover which we obtained for the major function we took on, the health function, was quite adequate and proved to be as much as- indeed, probably more than-was required.</PARA>
<PARA> During the year that temporary ceiling varied. Some of the temporary ceiling was retained for training purposes. But, as we move towards the end of the financial year, the Public Service Board has now made determinations which put all those ceilings on to a permanent basis. In other words, the temporary arrangements which have applied throughout the year, because of the variations in the functions of the Department have been subsumed into a set end-of-year staff ceiling which provides our commencement point for the next year. So, to some extent, I think there certainly was public misunderstanding about that. The figure of 500 which was announced, in part, picks up those temporary positions. </PARA>
<PARA> The other changes were made on the basis of the standard staffing formulas which have been in use in the Department for some time whereby certain staff are granted according to the volume of work in particular sections-for example, the number of pensioners and beneficiaries. There is a ratio between the number of beneficiaries and the number of staff. So there are adjustments in that area as well. Indeed, the interim ceiling which was then announced for June 1983 represents an estimate on the part of the Board of the work load which will be carried by the Department at that time given predictions as to the numbers of pensioners and beneficiaries at that time. In other words, I stress that we have always tried to make fair staffing arrangements within the Department. The Government has been anxious to see that the Department which impinges so much on the lives of many Australians is fairly staffed. I stress that we are currently following exactly the same staffing ratio methods as have applied in the past. I say that because I think it is important that it be understood publicly and in the Senate that the staffing of the Department in many of its functions relates quite simply to the volume of work in a way which is measured and accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> It was never my position last year-there were plenty of public statements to this effect-that the staffing position in the Department was static. Indeed, I made it quite clear that there would continue to be adjustments through to the end of the financial year and beyond. That has occurred, as it should. I made it plain to the union when the recent announcements were made about staff ceilings that the announcements were without prejudice to the findings of the inquiry which was commenced earlier this year after I had again had some consultations with the union. I regard my dealings in this area as being essential to the good running of the Department. I put on record, yet again, the very simple reason for not being prepared to deal with the union during the dispute last year. It was that we had done a whole series of things, including obtaining temporary staff ceiling cover for new functions, which were very much in accord with the union's requests and demands over the years. I was not prepared in the face of quite reasonable activities on the part of both the management of the Department and the Government to lie down in front of threats of trade union activity of a very destructive kind. I make no apology for that. </PARA>
<PARA> That strike was a total failure. The left wing faction, in its publications since that strike, has put it on record that that strike totally failed. However , I regard the strike as something which is in the past and best forgotten. It is important that the staff of the Department, the management of the Department and the Government devote themselves to the good running of the Department in as co-operative a manner as possible. Certainly I intend to approach staffing and all other matters in that spirit. I am sorry that Senator Grimes has found it necessary to try to rerun the reel here this afternoon. There is no substance in the points he has made. If he would like to conduct a closer examination of the figures and their method of calculation and computation he is more than welcome to do so. I offer him that detailed information if it is of interest to him. </PARA>
<PARA> The only additional point I comment on is that there certainly has been some bias in the allocation of additional staff which has been granted under those formulas. Again, I do not think there is anything peculiar about that. As I said during the strike, it was never my claim that the position in every social security office was satisfactory; rather, that the general position was satisfactory but there were problems that we were attending to. It is certainly true that there is an uneven work load. That, I think, will be better disclosed by the inquiry which is currently under way. But it has been the judgment of the management of the Department, with which I have not sought to interfere, that it is warranted to direct some of those additional resources into the areas where there would appear to be greater problems with respect to work. I think that is perfectly sensible management. I would not, of course, wish to interfere with it . </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome very much the fact that the unions concerned, with which I have had dealings recently, have seen fit to welcome the publication of the staff ceilings which have been announced. They have certainly been concerned that this has not been a pre-emption of any consideration of the inquiry which was undertaken earlier this year. I have given them my assurance that that is so. I simply wish to assure this Committee that staffing matters will continue to get the same careful attention from the management of the Department and from me as they have received over the past 18 months. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Department of Health for distributing to members of the Committee copies of the first four quarterly reports of the National Perinatal Statistics Unit. These reports are entitled ' Congenital malformations monitoring report'. The first was issued in January 1981. Apparently they have appeared quarterly since then. I am certainly very interested in being placed on the mailing list for these reports. These reports contain data from four States on congenital malformations. It is anticipated that the monitoring system will eventually include data from all States and Territories in Australia. The four States which are presently included in the data collection are New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania and South Australia. According to the first issue of this report, the objectives of the monitoring system are: Firstly, to monitor the reported incidence of congenital malformations in Australia; secondly, to study trends in incidence rates of individual malformations and of infants with multiple malformations and with malformation syndromes; and thirdly, to compare incidence rates in each State and Territory with national rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The monitoring system may enable the early detection of new teratogens or it can provide baseline data for the evaluation of reported associations between drugs or environmental agents and malformations. Similar monitoring systems are now functioning in about 20 countries. I wonder whether every effort has been made to obtain at least the acknowledgment of the non-participating States of the need for a standardised system of collecting data. It is futile for States which are still outside the national collection to insist on collecting their own information-I know that an exercise of this nature is being undertaken competently in Western Australia-unless it can be added to the national profile.</PARA>
<PARA> I referred earlier today to the necessity for registers of birth deformities to include the occupational histories of both parents. I stress this again. It is absolutely essential as a means of identifying occupations or aspects of such occupations which should be avoided by prospective parents. There is already substantial evidence that, for example, recovery rooms associated with operating theatres, unless properly ventilated, contain dangerous levels of halogenated hydrocarbons. We know too that many of the solvents used in laundries and drycleaning establishments are believed to be accountable for still-births, miscarriages and birth deformities. I could use dozens of other examples. I want to point to the absolutely essential nature of this aspect of data collection. I am delighted that we now have this register and that it is functioning. I stress again that to be of optimum value it must be national and it must be comprehensive. I hope that the Department of Health will do what it can to attain this state of affairs in the shortest possible time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise another matter but in passing, in reply to the typical response of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) to my remarks earlier, I merely make the point that the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, Mr Roy Dowell and other State directors of the Department of Social Security pointed out to the Minister the deficiencies in the staffing of his Department-particularly the deficiencies in the areas of unemployment and sickness benefits, at the front counters and in regional offices. An attempt was made to negotiate with the Department and the Government , and only after that were work bans applied. Although the Minister pretends to be and tries to say that he is a reasonable person, it was with a touch of hysteria in his voice that he came out with stories of left wing factions in the ACOA, et cetera. The simple fact of the matter is that of course the ACOA welcomes the new staff ceilings. That is what it asked for all the time. They are a justification of the claims it made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that the Minister spent more on self-publicity in that dispute, castigating his staff members, than the Department spends on publicising benefits and pensions to potential recipients. It is an example of his priorities. I hope that now that his State colleague has been removed from the area of industrial relations he will talk to the more reasonable Minister from Victoria and perhaps learn from him rather than from the combative and confrontationist approach of the previous Minister, who has been discredited throughout this land for his handling of industrial relations. Senator Chaney can dream about his left wing factions in the ACOA and the Public Service, and about reds under the bed. All that demonstrates is that some things never change in this country, and one of those things is the attitude of extreme conservatives like him. I wish to deal with the handling of invalid pensions. Another area which was also raised in the Estimates Committee--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite her present invalidity Senator Walters regularly finds great amusement in any reference to the disabled made either in this chamber or in Estimates committees. She thinks it is a joke that people should require assistance because of disability and invalidity, and repeatedly she says so. Despite the fact that her injury, sustained after celebrating what she saw as a great victory on Saturday night, is disabling her it has not affected her earning an income and therefore she has no sympathy for those in a more unfortunate situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The administration of invalid pensions has been disturbing to many honourable senators. This concern arose with the tightening of eligibility procedures which were introduced by Mr Lanigan when he was the Director-General of Social Services. He is well known to people in this place. He commissioned a legal opinion from Mr Hulme, a well-known tax expert, and Mr Gavan Griffith, a man who is famous for having argued in the Green-Daniels case on behalf of the Department of Social Security. The view put was that social services were 'a gratuity, not a right'. Mr Lanigan used that opinion to direct that only medical criteria were to be taken into account in granting invalid pensions and that no other factors were to be considered. As honourable senators know, at that time thousands of invalid pensioners were taken off pensions virtually overnight. New applicants found it very difficult to get pensions if they were in any way capable of moving about. One of the famous statements in that opinion was that quadriplegics frequently could do something and therefore may not necessarily be eligible for invalid pensions. </PARA>
<PARA> Taking into account the fact that the number of invalid pensions has dropped every month since June 1980 and the regular growth pattern of invalid pensions over the past decade, one could be looking at tens of thousands, some 30,000, pensioners who would have received pensions in the past two years had this change not occurred. In 1977 invalid pensioners represented 10.7 per cent of all pensioners and beneficiaries and now they represent about 9.5 per cent. There were a considerable number of protests from advocates for invalid pensioners and new guidelines were introduced. They appear to have made very little difference. What progress has been made in getting justice for invalid pensioners has come about it seems entirely by the appeals process and in particular the cogent arguments and the considered decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The first breakthrough came from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in the Panke case, which the Minister aproached at the time in, unfortunately, a rather flippant manner. During the hearings of Estimates committees last September, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>that decision . . . is in accordance with the guidelines. It is simply that a wrong decision was taken in that case. Having in mind the number of decisions made, there would be no argument . . . that of course some wrong decisions will be made . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I think we should look at how many wrong decisions are made. Thousands and thousands of wrong decisions have been made because of the restrictive definition of invalid pensioners and the necessity for the Department to enforce that restrictive definition. On the most recent figures from the Minister, in a six-month period from 1 July to 31 December 1981-a period which I have no reason to believe is other than typical-2,846 appeals were made by invalid pension claimants. Of those, 1,286 were conceded without even getting to the Social Security Appeals Tribunals; that is, almost half were granted when the Department took a second look at them. Another 474 won their appeals against the Department even though it is well known that many of the doctors on the Social Security Appeals Tribunals are conservative and more than conscious of their obligations to the Department. For that six-month period, 61.2 per cent of invalid pensioners appealing won their cases. In other words, in almost two- thirds of the cases the Department was judged as wrong and did not dispute the findings. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not easy for disabled people to appeal against the decisions of the Department. It is a big step for people to take and one knows-we all know-that some people are put off from taking on the bureaucracy or the Department in this way and do not appeal. Yet of those who appealed nearly two-thirds won their case. The Department was wrong in two-thirds of those cases. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hear the voice of Senator Walters again. She obviously believes that this is a source of great amusement, and that this is a satisfactory performance. We know her view on this sort of thing. At the moment thousands of cases are banked up at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. These are cases of people appealing to that high authority. I hope many more will join these people to demonstrate the difficulties being faced by them. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal has considered 28 appeals against rejection of invalid pensions on medical grounds, not on income grounds. Of these 28 appeals, the appellants have won 24 cases. The Department has been wrong in about 86 per cent of cases on medical grounds. People involved in the other four cases were referred to training or rehabilitation schemes, and their cases are to be reviewed. The fact that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has taken an overall look at the invalid pensioner claims, their work histories, their medical histories, their psychiatric problems and the likelihood of any employer taking them on should, I believe, have made a difference to decisions taken by the Department of Social Security. The evidence shows that it does not do so unless appeals are in fact made against these adverse decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A recent letter within the Department of Social Security has drawn attention to the unsatisfactory standard of departmental submissions to the tribunals and to the propensity of the Department to persevere with disputed decisions which might otherwise have been conceded. The letter comments on the failure of the Department of Social Security to ask the Department of Health to get further and better specialist opinions and on its failure to consider socio-economic factors which may render the appellant 85 per cent or more permanently incapacitated. It is a difficult problem for any doctor in this community to assess whether someone is, for instance, 85 per cent or 80 per cent disabled or otherwise. Many of us would suggest that this is an unsatisfactory set of parameters to apply but it becomes even more unsatisfactory when, as so often happens, the judgment of someone who has seen and treated the patient, who has examined the patient, is overruled by a departmental medical officer who has not set eyes on the disabled person or, if he has seen the patient, has seen the patient only briefly in what is repeatedly described as a cursory interview. </PARA>
<PARA> I received today a request from one of my colleagues, the honourable member for Wills, Mr Hawke, concerning a person who was on an invalid pension from 1972 but who last year was taken off that invalid pension. He has five certificates from highly qualified medical practitioners who have high degrees in their specialities and who have all examined this man. They all said that in their opinion he is permanently disabled. They said that he has more than 85 per cent disablement and will not be able to continue his work. Five medical practitioners expressed that opinion and yet a departmental doctor overruled those views. The departmental doctor had no knowledge of the lengthy history and treatment of this man who has lost his pension. He has been told that his pension will not be paid. He now has to go through the appeals procedures. Undoubtedly, like so many other people, his appeal will succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I think every honourable senator in this place knows that the handling of invalid pensions in unsatisfactory. This matter is brought up at every Estimates committee hearing. It is brought up every time the Appropriation Bills are debated. I believe that something has to be done about it as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has said repeatedly. It all stems from the crazy set of guidelines which were established for the Department by Mr Lanigan some years ago. We are suffering from the aftermath of that. We will continue to suffer from the aftermath of that until we have a radical change in the administration of invalid pensions in the opposite direction from that made by Mr Lanigan some years ago. </PARA>

Senator Giles raised a series of detailed suggestions with respect to the investigation of the health problems of women. I think the best action I can take with respect to the points she made in the Committee this afternoon is to refer them to the Department of Health for consideration.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a sub-group within the organisation which produced a great deal of printed material, some of which was referred to in the Senate during the dispute. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The dispute in the Department of Social Security which exploded in the last two months of 1981 was an important turning point for ACOA. Hundred of members were stood down for six weeks. Large chunks of the Department were paralysed and industrial action peaked with a three days strike of the entire union in New South Wales. Yet, the dispute ended in defeat for ACOA. What went wrong? We in the Public Servants Action Group think it is important to look closely at the way the campaign went and draw lessons from it. </PARA>
<PARA>So it went on. I commend publications of the Public Service Action Group to any honourable senator who is interested because I think they show the difficult problems that can be produced by a minority within an organisation. I believe that group represents a tiny minority of public servants and I regret that its members have any influence at all in the system. Certainly they did nothing but promote a massive dislocation last year. I regret that Senator Grimes continuously seems to find it necessary to defend what I think most people regard as indefensible. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of invalid pensions, as Senator Grimes correctly said, has been raised at successive Estimates committee hearings and on other occasions in the Senate itself. I agree with his comment that it is difficult to assess whether a person is 80 per cent to 85 per cent disabled and cannot work. It is difficult to do so. That is part of the problem the Department faces in trying to administer that test. The test is administerd by public servants who seek their medical advice from the professional officers of the Department of Health. As Senator Grimes said, that advice often is augmented by outside specialist opinion. I think it is important to concede that one is often engaged in making most difficult judgments. One's mind tends to leap to the picture of a man or a woman in a wheelchair, a person with a severe physical disability which will clearly prevent them from engaging in most forms of activity. That sort of case does not, of course, give rise to difficulty at all. The problems arise with cases of psychosomatic origin-I do not suggest unreal origin; a psychosomatic illness can be as real for the person suffering it as any form of physical illness. There may be marginal physical situations where the assessment is difficult to make. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the efforts of the Department over the last year and a half or so to devise guidelines which will provide more assistance to members of the medical profession in relation to what sort of advice they should be tendering my Department which has the responsibility for making the ultimate decision are an indication of our concern about the difficulty and about the fact that some wrong decisions are made. Of course, the whole object of having a system of appeals, both internal appeals to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and external appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, is to provide a check on the administration of these systems so that we can find out whether the administration is going wrong. Senator Grimes referred to some statistics which he suggests indicate that there are continuing problems. I agree with him that there are continuing problems. A close examination of those statistics shows that there appears to be an unevenness in the administration of the system. The unevenness is a difference from State to State in the statistical position and the statistical trend. Because of that difference, the matter is receiving close attention from both my Department and the Department of Health. Work is being done on producing a better form which will provide more guidance to the medical practitioners involved. A careful assessment is being made of the way cases are being dealt with in those States where there would appear to be a trend which is against that of other States. Those matters are receiving close attention. I do not deny that they require attention; I simply say that they are obtaining it. </PARA>
<PARA> My concern was certainly aroused by the statistics as they came through. It was in fact at my request that a closer dissection of the statistics in terms of invalid pensions either granted or refused was carried out. It was that dissection which showed the unevenness to which I have referred, and which is, I think, an important element of the problem at the moment. I have recently spoken with officers on that. Consultations are occurring between departments and also at my request with people outside the department with an interest in this area. Concerning the decisions which have so far come through, I would merely wish to say that neither Panke's case nor any other has produced a decision which would suggest that the new guidelines which we produced last May are incorrect. Rather the decisions have indicated that the guidelines are not on all occasions applied properly or successfully or with full regard to all of the relevant facts. Of course it is our duty to try to ensure that the number of such errors is minimised. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry that Senator Grimes found it necessary to make some, what I would regard as, rather cheap jibes at Senator Walters's finding problems of invalids amusing. That is clearly a silly remark which is so far from the truth, but since it has been broadcast I do feel it is necessary to comment on it and respond to it. I reject it. It is a silly partisan and political remark which has no place in a discussion on a serious issue. I acknowledge Senator Grimes's serious interests in the problems of the invalid pensioner. I acknowledge that there are serious problems which I, as a Minister, and my Department are tackling. I come back to the point that there are real difficulties in applying tests about the extent of incapacity which indicates that a person is permanently incapable of work. That is a very serious judgment to be made and it is one which has both technical difficulty and sometimes the difficulty of people who do not provide us with all the information that might be required, and so on. They are matters of continuing concern and they are receiving continuing attention. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point which could be made is that in those cases where there is doubt , where people are on the borderline and are judged as not being 85 per cent incapacitated for work, it is, of course, almost invariably the case that some other form of income maintenance is available. The person who is sick rather than invalid is entitled to receive the sickness benefit. The person who is unable to obtain employment because of the state of the labour market is entitled to the unemployment benefit. So, usually in these situations of difficulty-the situations about which we are concerned-it is not a fact that the person is left without income support; rather he or she is put on a form of income support which is not a permanent one but one which applies for as long as the condition of either unemployment or illness remains. I think the issue raised is a serious one. It is one on which further work is to be done and on which I am certainly not fully satisfied with the present state of administration. I will be persisting in efforts to remove the difficulties which remain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise one other matter and to seek a reply from the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). It is the problem which arises out of the unresolved situation of invalid pensioners in Greece whose pensions were suddenly cancelled by the Australian Government in April 1978. I hope we can obtain some firmer assurances from the Minister about the rights of these people to fair play. However delayed it has been, it will be a considerable victory for decency and fairness, I suggest, if these neglected people receive some sort of justice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I brought up this matter in October 1981. When the alleged conspiracy, involving members of the Greek community, occurred, 183 people were arrested in April 1978 in Sydney. Another 600 in Sydney lost their pensions and a further 138 pensioners in Greece had their pensions cancelled at the same time. After examination lasting only a few minutes the pension cancellations of these people were, in fact, confirmed in 105 cases. According to Senator Chaney, on 21 April this year invalid pensions were subsequently restored in 27 cases. I assume that those 27 people were the people who by some means or other returned to Australia to prove their eligibility. If that is the case I would like a breakdown of the number who were restored in Greece and the number restored in Australia. I raised this matter first during discussions on the Estimates eight months ago. At the time, the Minister expressed some interest in looking at the problem of the invalid pensioner who had remained in Greece. When I raised this matter in October, I was assured that the Minister was taking it very seriously, but I have not yet received any results of this alleged seriousness. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole sorry affair is not only tied up with the case in Sydney, where committal proceedings have dragged on for over three years, but also, I suggest, tied up with the Government's determination to prune the number of invalid pensioners-a matter I referred to earlier this afternoon. The invalid pensioners in Greece were in fact the first to feel the severity of the Government's tough approach. Their pensions were cancelled on the spot. They had no three months grace as pensioners in Australia have when they are no longer considered eligible on medical grounds. They had no opportunity to appeal in Greece as the invalid pensioners here now have the opportunity to appeal. Invalid pensioners in Australia can produce additional medical evidence supporting their cases and socio-economic factors are also taken in support of their cases, but that does not apply in Greece. The problem is that these invalid pensioners were apparently simply abandoned by the Government. Many of them had no other income. Some of them begged and borrowed from their families. They had no recourse in law and no sympathetic government. In fact they became non-persons as far as this Government, this country and this Department were concerned. As I say, some of them scraped, begged and borrowed and came back here, and, in fact, had their pensions returned to them. In October I asked that all remaining invalid pensioners in Greece, whose pensions were stopped in March and April 1978, be re -examined in Greece by an independent medical team using the same criteria as those now applied in Australia, and which include work availability, previous work history, age, educational attainment and medical factors which were not previously considered. If we can do this to the people when they return to Australia and re-apply, we must in all conscience, I suggest, do it to all Greek pensioners who do not have the money or the strength to return to Australia to go through the whole process again. </PARA>
<PARA> I have received, and continue to receive, a large number of letters from the Greek-Australian Pensioners Association in Athens and from others who are still courageously battling on and fighting for some justice. I believe because they are in Greece we should not ignore them. The people who write the letters are becoming more desperate and therefore the language is becoming more desperate. I quote from one of them, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> We have considered, Sir, the whole affair, as a racist purge from the Australian Government's point of view and we protest for that. Our members are facing, for the time being, a real tragedy. They are calling us very often, asking for help. They don't have sufficient food. Sufficient money to sustain themselves and their families. They are trapped in Greece with no medications, with no medical care, with no money to pay their fares to return to Australia to undergo a fresh medical examination from Australian doctors, to have their pensions restored or to get any other form of assistance. These unfortunate people, are not entitled to any national benefit in Greece, because they are not contributors to a fund. Any treatment at a public hospital, would cost them a fortune. The General Practitioner's visit, is very expensive. Their health condition, under these circumstances, becomes more deteriorated. Our Association has already sent two members to Australia, having their fares paid out of its funds. We try to find out more money to send some more who are in our list, but it is difficult for us, because we have no means and assets to raise funds to help . . . Continue your actions and presentations to the Australian Government, the only responsible body for the whole sad affair, until our members get the right which they deserve from the Australian justice . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This letter is signed by Mrs K. Andricopoulos and Mrs F. Spyrou. In addition to the pensioners in Greece who have not had the means to return to re-establish their eligibility, I brought up at the time the treatment of those who have managed to return, including the two who had their fares paid by the Greek- Australian Pensioners' Association in Athens. These people have proved their eligibility. They have proved it on the same grounds as they were given pensions initially and they have proved that they had a continuing eligibility. Therefore , I believe they are entitled to back payments for the years before they could return. One really should consider payment from the time of the cancellation at that time of hysterical behaviour in 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> In answer to my question on notice-I received the answer four weeks ago-Senator Chaney advised me that five appeals have not yet been finalised in respect of pensioners who have returned from Greece, have had their pensions restored and are seeking back payments. They date from March 1981. Three have had submissions sent to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal from the Department. In two cases the Department has not put its submissions together. I am interested in why the Department is fighting so hard against back payments in these cases. Why does it not just concede? Quite clearly the Department was wrong. I hope that we can get a better reply than on the last occasion when this matter was raised. On 18 March this year Senator Primmer asked the Minister for Social Security what action had been taken on behalf of the invalid pensioners in Greece who had been taken off the pension in 1978? Senator Chaney replied in a totally negative fashion. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The action I took following the matter being raised last year was to refer it to my Department for advice and consideration on the various factors which are involved. I have received a number advisings on the matter. Those advisings have not put me in a position where I feel able to make any move in the matter that I am sure Senator Primmer or Senator Grimes would regard as positive. I still have the matter under consideration. That consideration has gone on for longer than I would have wished . . . At this stage I do not have anything positive to offer the honourable senator with respect to the matter raised by Senator Grimes last year. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister: Can he please do better now? I think we should remind him that the invalid pensioners in Australia whose cases have been reviewed in Australia and have appealed have had a 61 per cent success rate before the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and, I think, an 86 per cent success rate before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I emphasise that it took just one phone call from Canberra four years ago to stop those pensions being paid in Greece. Four years of inertia have passed and we still have not got the Government to take on board the notion that some of those people could have suffered a dreadful wrong at that time. Some people have demonstrated that they suffered a wrong at that time. It may be that legal problems are holding up the Government's considerations about cancelling these pensions. The Government may feel that they are ex-pensioners living outside the country and that, therefore, there is no legal obligation. I think there is certainly a moral obligation to reconsider the sad situation of these people. Senator Chaney's predecessor, the present Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), approved the action that was taken. These people have very few rights under the Greek social security system. They worked in this country, paid taxes and had rights under our social security system. A large percentage of those who have managed to return to this country have demonstrated that their pensions were removed wrongly. We should treat them as we treat citizens of this country because they are our responsibility. Until we do so this whole situation will remain an unfortunate stain on our system as it exists now. </PARA>

Part of the reason why the matter has not advanced further is that either I or the senior officer most closely involved in this matter have been away and have not had the opportunity to confer further. I envisage we will have an opportunity to do so in the coming weeks. The position with the bulk of those claims is that there would be no entitlement under Australian law.

At the conclusion of the meeting there were only 11 matters on which we required additional information. All that information has come to hand. I suggest to honourable senators who have not yet been able to get round to reading the most interesting report we put together that that practice be adopted by other committees. I recommend to anybody who is interested in the relationship with New Zealand and the closer economic relations proposal that they read the 84- page summary of the matters involved. I would like to thank the officers, the Ministers and the Committee members for the manner in which they co-operated to make it an extremely valuable exercise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise the following matter during the second reading debate of Appropriation Bill (No. 4), although I suppose I could have left discussion until the Committee stage. I am concerned that in this Bill under the heading of 'Primary Industry' an amount of $3m is mentioned as the discharge of the obligations incurred under the Co-operative Farmers and Graziers Direct Meat Supply Ltd (Loan Guarantee) Act 1978. When the Bill was passed through the Parliament on 12 April 1978 Senator Wriedt was then the Leader of the Opposition and spokesman for the Opposition on this matter. He saw fit to sound some very grave warnings about this loan being agreed to. He moved an amendment which was defeated on a vote. Only one amendment was taken to a vote and it was defeated. I make mention of that amendment which was defeated in the Committee stage. It relates to clause 5. Senator Wriedt stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After paragraph (c), insert the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> (ca) the State of Victoria appoints a full-scale inquiry into the operations of the society in order to ascertain the precise reasons for its current financial difficulties;</PARA>
<PARA>That amendment was put to a vote and was defeated. Quite a few honourable senators from our side of the chamber spoke on this legislation as did honourable senators from the other side, for example, Senator Wright and Senator Tehan. They sounded grave warnings about the need for this legislation to be passed. Senator Wriedt, Senator Walsh, Senator Primmer and I spoke on this. We all sounded grave warnings about taxpayers' money being made available-$4.5m from the Commonwealth and $4.5m from the Victorian Government. There was quite a bit of publicity about the matter. That was so even at a later stage when Mr Smith, who I think was then Minister of Agriculture in Victoria, made a statement at a Liberal conference to the effect that the Victorian Government was caught in a bind by the then Whitlam Government because there was an election in the offing and it wanted to win votes. That matter got quite a lot of publicity in the Press. We on this side of the chamber spoke at some length on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I looked back through the Hansard record of the debate that took place when the Bill was before the Senate. I am sorry that Senator Messner is not here because he puts himself up as somewhat of an expert, as an accountant, on financial matters. I will quote what he said in relation to the Co-operative Farmers and Graziers Direct Meat Supply Ltd which was the company getting the loan. On page 1213 of the Senate Hansard of 12 April Senator Messner said:</PARA>
<PARA> I understand from the information available to me that this Co-operative has had a very chequered career and is a worthwhile organisation. We should at least give it a chance to see whether it can pay its way in the next few years. It seems to me that the Co-operative, which has as many as 10,000 shareholders in Victoria and some from my own State of South Australia, has proved that it is capable of making a profit. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, Senator Messner's words on that occasion have since been proved to be quite wrong. The company was not capable of making a profit. Now the Government has been called on to make a final payout. I expect that this is what the amount of money is for. I will ask a question as to whether this will be the final payout. During the course of the debate on the Bill the speakers on this side of the chamber expressed concern not only on behalf of those 10,000 shareholders but also on behalf of all the other shareholders-the taxpayers of Australia. They were being called on to provide $9m to fund this operation. We were a bit sceptical about that. That was the reason why Senator Wriedt moved the amendment calling on the Government to conduct a full-scale inquiry into the operation of the company in order to ascertain the precise reasons for its then current financial difficulties. Of course, the company went from bad to worse. Now the taxpayers of Australia are being called on in this Bill, as I read it, to find $ 3m. I will not take the matter any further. Everything was well documented in the debates which took place here on 12 April 1978 and again in the Senate in the early hours of the morning of 22 November 1979 in the debate on Appropriation bills. The matter was discussed at some length then. I hope I can get an answer at the end of the second reading debate rather than having to pursue in the Committee stages the question of whether the $3m provided in this Bill is to be a final payout or whether we can expect to be called upon at some later stage to find more money to close off this very unsuccessful financial venture. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1982 is not opposed by the Australian Labor Party although we will move an amendment at the end of the second reading debate to add certain words. It is appropriate that the former Minister for Social Security, the present Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), is in the chamber at the moment. She used to get her social security Bills passed when she was the Minister. Her successor, Senator Chaney, has had a little difficulty in doing so. However, for once we do not have any major objections to legislation on social security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation precludes temporary residents of Australia, such as diplomats, defence personnel of other countries and some other foreign residents, from claiming family allowances and similarly prohibits illegal immigrants from claiming family allowances on behalf of their children. It provides that a person who registers as unemployed with the Commonwealth Employment Service and makes a claim for unemployment benefit within 14 days of that registration will be deemed to have made the claim on the date of registration. It provides that where a person claims sickness benefit in respect of a period of sickness, the cause of which was connected with a previous sickness for which the person received a benefit, the sickness benefit is paid from the day on which the incapacity for work commenced-therefore preventing repeated application of the 7 -day waiting rule. It amends the Social Services Act to remove difficulties and deficiencies which arose from the 1979 amendment of the legislation in reclaiming double payments arising from sickness and compensation payments. There is a series of other formal technical and machinery amendments of lesser importance although the standardisation of the specific notification of change of circumstances for families receiving the handicapped children's allowance may cause some concern in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Before dealing with the essence of the legislation, I do as I have done before and make a plea for the consolidation and simplification where possible of this cumbersome Social Services Act. It has been added to, amended and deleted from over the years and can be a minefield for experienced legal counsel and bureaucrats, let alone members of parliament and those it is designed to help. Consolidated copies are hard to come by even, I understand, in the Department of Social Security. The fact that many of the technical amendments are overdue by many years is a reflection of the difficulty in keeping the legislation up to date. I think it is beyond time that some consideration was given to a proper, overall look at the legislation. Senator Chaney, who is now in the chamber, being a lawyer will undoubtedly do this at night after he goes home to relax, considering the new sitting hours. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not oppose the changes which are made in this legislation but we will be moving an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill flagging some deficiencies in the provision of family allowances and compensation referred to in this legislation. We could, of course, have listed all the serious deficiencies in the provisions of social services in this country-things like the inadequate levels of benefits; the harshness of the income test and fringe benefits, particularly the discrimination against the single unemployed and the young unemployed; the harshness of the present application of the invalid pension parameters; and a large number of other deficiencies-but time limits and the Standing Orders would prevent a reasoned debate if those subjects were listed in what would be almost an endless amendment. Hence, the amendment is, in fact, a limited one. </PARA>
<PARA> There is clearly no justification for the Australian taxpayer paying family allowances to foreign diplomats, to visitors or to foreign military personnel, who frequently get many other benefits, both directly from the Australian taxpayer and through revenue forgone because of the privileges afforded to such people by the Government and, therefore, the Australian taxpayer. Therefore, we certainly do not oppose that section of the legislation. One can, I suppose, justify the non-payment of such benefits essentially to the children of prohibited immigrants though the number in this case must be pretty small. In light of the fact that no attack on the prohibited immigrant who later on is made legal in this country by reclaiming prior payments is included in the legislation, on balance, we support this provision though we are rather uneasy, I must admit, about the target apparently being the innocent children of such immigrants. It is interesting that in the past when we have brought up the matter of paying family allowances, particularly since family allowances were introduced in exchange for the old child endowment and tax rebates, we have questioned the fact that these were paid to diplomats and others in those circumstances. I wonder whether the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney ) can tell us why it has taken so long for the Government to take action in this regard. But as I said before, we certainly do not oppose the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The change in the legislation affecting unemployment benefits is also worth supporting. There are difficulties through postal delays, through the fact that officers of the different departments are in different towns and through the confusion which is created by what is a fairly complicated form which results in delays of days and sometimes weeks for a person who is unemployed and who has applied for assistance with employment. We believe that the introduction of the 14-day period of grace which can be extended in unusual circumstances is a sensible change and we have no objection to it. We hope, of course, that the Department will be flexible in the extension of what it sees as 'unusual circumstances' so that the aim of the legislation-and the aim of the Parliament in supporting the legislation-is carried through. Similarly, the change in the legislation regarding sickness benefit, whereby people who have chronic or recurrent illnesses will not have to make a series of applications resulting in repeated 7-day waiting periods because of recurrence of the illness or because of related illness, is something we do not oppose. I hope that the definition of 'associated illness', 'consequential illness' or 'related illness' is applied with compassion and proper medical advice so that we do not have endless disputes on the matter. I am sure that most members of parliament and others who represent the disadvantaged in this situation will be keeping an eye on the application of this amendment. The technical changes as they refer to the change in circumstances of children and families receiving the handicapped children's allowance are reasonable, but again must be administered with compassion and flexibility. Parents of such children have a difficult time and sickness, the mere difficulty of caring for a handicapped child and other factors may delay notification. We hope that not too much rigidity is applied in this amended form of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficult section of the Bill lies in the vexed question of the relationship between sickness benefit and compensation payments. It is dealt with in Part III and attempts to cope with a problem which causes a lot of stress to compensation claimants and those who counsel them, including members of parliament. I am sure that every member of parliament has frequently had to deal with irate constituents who are caught up in the confusion that exists in this area. The area is also subject to legal manipulations and contriving by both the lawyers of the claimants and the lawyers representing insurance companies frequently for the benefit of both sides. </PARA>
<PARA> I have some sympathy for the legal counsel and the Government in trying to cope with this area, and I am sure that the Minister shares that sympathy. It is obvious that the attempts made in 1979 were not adequately covered by the amendments made in that year. Senator Chaney and I spent some eight months with the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs looking at the whole compensation situation in this country and at the proposals of Mr Justice Woodhouse and his inquiry to introduce a national compensation scheme. We certainly ended up wiser about the situation after those eight months but we were probably even more confused in some areas than we were when we started. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic problem lies in the compensation system itself in this country, which is characterised by uncertainty of outcome, inordinate delays, legalistic confusion and high costs. The system causes much resentment amongst those who have to use it. It inhibits rehabilitation, as that Senate Committee was told over and over again by experts in the field, and as Mr Justice Woodhouse has pointed out. I believe that no amount of fiddling with the social services will fix that system. The delays in settling compensation claims which are so characteristic of the system of compensation in this country mean that many people spend considerable time, often unnecessarily, on sickness benefit while awaiting settlement of their claims one way or the other. I believe that there is no doubt that the knowledge that people receive sickness benefit, that they receive some assistance from the social security system, exacerbates the delays. A lack of urgency is felt by representatives of the litigants and particularly by those who are being sued. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill attempts to overcome several technical problems which are inherent in the system. The social security system of sickness benefit, quite correctly, is not meant to supplement the compensation system but to complement it with the sickness benefit which acts as a sort of bridge. A no-fault system of the sort which exists in New Zealand, which is at present being modified in New Zealand and which provides immediate and adequate benefits would introduce some form of justice to the system and would overcome the problems that exist now, but to introduce such a system into our legal and constitutional state of affairs would be difficult, if not almost impossible. This is not to suggest that I support uncritically the proposal put forward by Mr Justice Woodhouse in his report; but I dare say that I would support some variation of it. Certainly, the Senate Committee which looked at that proposal found that very grave difficulties and inequities would have arisen if it had been introduced as suggested. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two proposals in this legislation which we hope will improve the present system of delays in settling the sickness benefit and compensation problem. The first concerns improving the gathering of information about the beneficiary's compensation entitlements and the second concerns the ability of the Director-General or his delegate to claim payments to cover previously paid sickness benefit from the payment rather than having to chase the compensated person. The inclusion of payments under the no-fault motor vehicle insurance schemes which exist at least in Victoria and Tasmania is also a desirable and sensible change and will provide justice to both the taxpayers and the recipients. There are provisions in the legislation for the compensated person to be informed of the claims for the recovery of sickness benefit and, most importantly, there is a provision for the Director-General to disregard payments in cases of need and special circumstances. That is a clause which should be handled carefully and, again, with considerable sympathy and compassion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is to be hoped that the changes enabling the Department to intercept the payments made to the claimant and to ensure that the claimant is informed of what is going on will preclude the need for the Director-General to use this discretion, but I agree that it is terribly important that the discretion should be there. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal, in a couple of judgments, has suggested that this should be so. My information is that the amount of sickness benefit reclaimed under the relevant section last year was about $5.6m. I would be interested if the Minister could give the Senate an estimate for future years in the light of these changes. I hope that he and the Government recognise the fact that in the context of the overall Budget it is certainly not a large amount of money. That is another reason for sympathetic interpretation by the Government. In the past there have been difficulties, as has been demonstrated by some of the successful appeals or appeals which resulted in critical remarks from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Opposition, I move the following amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that the Government should-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) increase family allowances for first and second children, thus removing the disadvantage affecting most Australian families with children, and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) provide a system of national compensaton to eliminate the excessive costs, delays and uncertainty which exists in the present system.'</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that that amendment speaks for itself but I wish to make some remarks about both of the subjects with which it deals. When the Government introduced its family allowance system in 1976-a system which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and others described as the single most important reform in the Australian welfare system since Federation-one of its greatest attractions was said to be its simplicity, the simplicity of having a universal payment, a positive payment to all parents with dependent children, and of having it out in the open as a welfare payment instead of hidden as a taxation offset. This simplicity and this openness have enabled us to see how the government's policy of freezing the value of these payments has in fact compounded hardship and poverty in this country. The Minister has given the figure of $1,570m as the cost of family allowances had they been indexed. That is some $530m more than this year's Budget estimate. The Government is in fact saving $530m at the expense of young Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1977 the Government has saved approximately $1.5 billion by not keeping family allowance payments in line with cost of living rises. When the family allowances were introduced-they were introduced at a time when the expectation of people was that there would be tax indexation-we pointed out that this may have been a means whereby these payments could have been frozen, whereas under a system of tax indexation the rebate for children, as it then was, would have had to be indexed. In fact, this has happened. I shall give some examples of how this freezing of family allowances with a limited increase in recent Budgets has affected the family budget. If the payments had been indexed, families with one child would have been receiving another $10.70 a month; families with two children, another $25.95 a month; those with three children, another $31.30 a month; those with four children, another $36.65 a month; and those with five children, another $42.85 a month. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as though the Government was unaware of the inequities in this system . Its National Consultative Council on Social Welfare has raised the inequity of family allowances in each of its reports. The Social Welfare Policy Secretariat report on poverty measurement pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA> Couples with children are more likely than those without to have low incomes in relation to needs while sole parents are the neediest of groups. There are more couples with one or two children with low income in relation to their needs than couples with three children or more, although a greater proportion of the larger families has low incomes in relation to their needs. </PARA>
<PARA>In this last Budget the Government took the cheap way out. It totally ignored couples with one or two children, who constitute 74 per cent-three-quarters, essentially-of the families with young children. They got nothing. Larger families with three or more children got limited increases, and those increases cost at the time $89.6m. </PARA>
<PARA> In Melbourne at the Salvation Army a few weeks ago, Colonel Gordon Fischer consistently used the word 'frustration' in connection with his work with the most desperately poor people, the people who have to bury their pride and ask for handouts for their families. Most of these people are unemployed and most are single parent families. The frustration comes from the inability of any charitable organisation, with the best will in the world, to meet those needs. These people have increasing costs, and a large section of their increasing costs is the cost of parenthood, the cost of raising children. Some recognition, I suppose, of the costs of raising children was made in the 1976 Budget, but neglecting the inroads of inflation into family income has been a feature of subsequent Budgets. </PARA>
<PARA> In our amendment we are urging the Government to end this snub to young families and to recognise the additional costs of food, clothing, education needs and so on, which they have shouldered without the Government taking a sufficient share of the burden. The costs of parenthood are considerable. These costs have a greater effect on the income of families. But so often we hear that the increases should be in the area of the dependent spouse rebate, as if marriage itself was the great factor which increased the economic cost to families. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, our amendment mentions the inadequacies of the compensation system. I understand that Senator Haines will be moving an amendment to this section of the Labor Party's amendment. I imagine that we shall support that. We ask that the Government look again at providing a system of national compensation to eliminate the excessive costs, delays and uncertainties which exist in the present system. As I have said, that does not mean that we just want a holus- bolus introduction of the system suggested by Mr Justice Woodhouse. But after taxation, the big inhibiting factor-I find it so from correspondence to me-to people employing more workers is the cost of compensation premiums. </PARA>
<PARA> As long as we have a system in which the outcome is so uncertain, in which people with the same sorts of injuries and disabilities resulting from those injuries can get compensation varying from nil or the invalid pension to $1m, $ 2m, or $3m, as long as the system is such that cases get bogged down in the courts for years, and health costs and legal costs can eat about 50c in every dollar of compensation obtained, while we have a system in which lawyers and insurance companies find it necessary to create artificial schemes of settlement whereby for the period that people are eligible for sickness benefit they are given a dollar a week and for the rest of the time they are given lump sums or very much larger payments, and while we have the sorts of bargaining that we have to have in the area of compensation in the courts, I suggest that the system is not satisfactory. I do not believe that anyone on the committee on which I served, with the possible exception of former Senator Wright, believes that overall the present system is satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> If a conservative government in New Zealand-admittedly working from a lower base of social security payments-can introduce a reform whereby compensation can be streamlined and the costs reduced, we should look at it. If we cannot do it constitutionally as a Commonwealth Government, we should be looking at getting the co-operation of the States to introduce it on a national basis in that way. Already Tasmania and Victoria have introduced no-fault schemes for motor vehicle accidents. That is a step in the right direction. I understand that that system is to be introduced in the Australian Capital Territory. But we need it in a much more comprehensive way to avoid the uncertainties in the present system. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said that the Bill is an omnibus Bill. It aims at reducing some of the anomalies in the present Social Services Act. I should just like to make passing remarks about two inequities which have been raised before by many people in this place and which I believe will be raised again until the inequities are removed. Single parents who are in the unfortunate position of being on unemployment benefits are among the poorest groups in the community. Single parents on unemployment benefits rather than widows' pensions or supporting parent's benefits are in the worst position of all. There are about 2,418 in the country. Because they are on unemployment benefits only, they get no guardian's allowance, no fringe benefits, no pharmaceutical benefits, no transport concessions, no rent assistance, and no supplementary assistance. Most of them, I suspect, are families who do not satisfy the residency provisions for pensions . There is no reason to leave them in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> For instance, a lone parent on unemployment benefit who has two children receives only $98.20 a week for the three of them, which has to pay for all rent , utilities, transport, clothing, food, and so on, for three people. At the last count, this put them $31.50 a week below the poverty line. The next Social Services Bill of this kind should, at the very least, make these families eligible for the guardian's allowance, and consideration should be given to extending to them the supplementary assistance and health benefits available to pensioners. This is an injustice, among many other injustices, which should not be allowed to exist. </PARA>
<PARA> Another anomaly is the absurd and unfair anomaly that the female spouses of invalid pensioners are eligible for a spouse's pension whereas a male spouse of a female invalid pensioner is not eligible. I believe that you have raised this matter yourself, Mr Acting Deputy President, on many occasions. Such a person must, if he wishes to give up work to look after an invalid wife, qualify for a special benefit, which again is a payment that is more strictly means tested and has no fringe benefit attachments. There are only a handful of these people. It is a disgrace that this anomaly is being perpetuated-to save, I assume, a few dollars. All this arises because of the complexity and complication in our system, but when these anomalies are picked up and known about, they really should be changed, and changed as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> To sum up, we do not oppose the changes in this legislation. We move a second reading amendment flagging just two of the insufficiencies in the present system . We understand that an amendment will be moved by Senator Haines, and I can tell her now that I consider that we shall accept that amendment, but perhaps we shall talk about it briefly when she has moved it. We urge the Government to look at the whole of the legislation rather than consider it in a piecemeal manner as has been done in the past by all governments, I suppose. In this way we can have a legislation and a system which treat all people more fairly than they do now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; In the interests of the smooth running of the Senate and being as aware as I am that the next lot of business is due to come on at 3.30 p.m., I shall attempt to be as brief as possible. Senator Grimes has, as has the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) in his second reading speech, already canvassed the main issues in this legislation, and I do not intend to do so again. The Australian Democrats have no objections to the changes inherent in this legislation; indeed we support them fully. Clearly it is anomalous, as Senator Grimes has already pointed out, that Australian taxpayers should support the children of diplomats, consuls, foreign defence personnel et cetera as well as other temporary residents in Australia whether they are prohibited or not. It is equally silly, to say nothing of financially damaging, for some people entitled to the unemployment or sickness benefit to be denied them because of an unintentional delay in applying for them or because of some other entanglement in red tape. The amendments in the Bill correcting these problems are sensible and even if they affect, as Senator Grimes also pointed out, only a small group of people they are nevertheless in our eyes worthwhile. Similar comments can be made about the amendments relating to the provision of the handicapped children's allowance when the child moves out of the home in which he or she was being looked after.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major changes proposed by the Bill and the ones which are the most complex are those clauses amending section 39 of the Social Services Act 1979 which were never proclaimed but which were in fact intended to repeal section 115 of the Social Services Act 1947. Section 115 currently provides the means whereby an amount of compensation, paid or payable to a person who is, or is qualified to be, or was, a sickness beneficiary in respect of the same incapacity, is brought to account. The provision reflects the principle that a person should not retain both sickness benefits paid in respect of an incapacity and compensation paid in respect of the same incapacity. In essence, the person has the rate of the sickness benefit reduced or is required to repay the amount, or part of the amount, of sickness benefit received to take account of the payment or right to payment of compensation from a third party. The intended effect is that there be no 'double payment' in respect of the same incapacity, and that is a fair enough aim. </PARA>
<PARA> The section does, as the Minister stated in his second reading speech, have a number of shortcomings which have been exploited to circumvent the recovery provisions defined in the section, and this legislation aims to correct these. To remove these deficiencies, shortcomings and anomalies, the Government has introduced a series of amendments, for which action, as I have said, the Government is to be commended. The amendments streamline the legislation, speed up the processes generally and add a human element in the extension of the discretionary role of the Director-General as far as the sickness benefit and compensation payments are concerned. As long as all these things operate to the advantage of the beneficiary they are, of course, to be applauded. We have all heard of people who have been financially disadvantaged by the system, inadvertently, by the delaying tactic of some of the more venal lawyers around the place who are perhaps more interested in building up their bank balances or indulging in nice intellectual debate or by the rigid application of the letter of the law rather than the spirit of it. If this legislation can prevent those things from happening then the Democrats, as does the Labor Party, support it fully. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me briefly to the Opposition's amendment to the Government's motion that the Bill be now read a second time. The first part of the Opposition's amendment is commonly known around this place somewhat cynically as a motherhood motion, perhaps more precisely than some of those which go by that name since it refers to an increase in family allowances for first and second children. Again, the Democrats support this contention. I suppose I ought to declare that I have a vested interest. I have only two children, and most parents with two children will tell you that the first and second children are the ones who engender the maximum expense particularly when they happen to be one of each variety. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clothes cannot be handed down when children are one of each variety. These days perhaps there is more chance of that happening than there used to be, but I do not encourage it. It may be that to accommodate the increase in allowances for first and second children some sort of means test must be applied so that those in most need receive the most increase. I believe that as long as the means test is a reasonable one and is automatically indexed there can be no philosophic argument against it if the country's financial position of course is so parlous as to require it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second part of the Opposition's amendment is also reasonable in concept but I believe it does not go far enough. It is not sufficiently precise particularly in view of the remarks made by Dr Blewett in another place relating to the Woodhouse Committee recomendations. For that reason I propose to move an amendment to paragraph (b) of the Opposition's amendment which seeks to amend the motion for the second reading. I therefore move:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out paragraph (b) of the words proposed to be added, insert the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> '(b) provide a system of national compensation, as recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, which is designed to eliminate excessive costs, delays and uncertainty of the present system, but which does not incorporate the more extreme proposals of the Woodhouse Report.'.</PARA>
<PARA>I do this because the Democrats, who have already both in this chamber and outside it indicated full support for the concept of a national portable contributory superannuation scheme, also have no philosophic objection to the implementation of a national compensation scheme. Senator Grimes mentioned a no- fault car accident scheme. I would also like to mention the fact that the number of sporting accidents not covered by any form of insurance is, if nothing else, sufficient reason for looking at the concept of a national compensation scheme. Having said that I must make the point that we are no more happy about the Woodhouse Committee report or the 1974 draft Bill which followed it than we were with the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which inquired into that Bill and reported in July 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> Briefly in the last few minutes I would like to refer to some of the comments made by members of that Committee. There was an addendum at page 189 of the report by Senators Chaney, Missen and Wright which states:</PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of reasons detailed in the Committee Report which in our view, preclude the Bill achieving the theoretically laudible objectives of the Woodhouse Committee to provide:</PARA>
<PARA> ' . . . a universal and comprehensive scheme designed to alleviate the problems of persons afflicted by any physical or mental incapacity . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I will not go into the rest of it in great detail, but that feeling was shared to a considerable extent by Senators Button and Grimes who also made the point that they found some aspects of the Woodhouse Committee proposal for implementing the concept of national compensation superficial and believed that if the Bill were amended in accordance with the Committee's recommendations many of those difficulties would be overcome. Senator Chaney went further and added an additional comment of his own, again pointing out that rather than persisting with the present national Compensation Bill it would be preferable to develop a constitutionally sound alternative in co-operation with the States to improve the fairness, justice and efficiency of the provision of benefits to persons suffering injury or sickness. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before us today is commendable in that it is a genuine attempt to remove certain anomalies which exist in the present system, and we are happy to support it. Nevertheless, as Senator Grimes has also pointed out, some inequities still exist in the social services area. A number of them, if not all , would be removed if family allowances for first and second children were increased and if a national compensation scheme were introduced along the lines of the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in 1975. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard three addenda to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Addendum 2</PARA>
<PARA>ADDENDUM BY SENATORS BUTTON AND GRIMES</PARA>
<PARA> We have read the addendum prepared by the Chairman and we agree with most of the conclusions which he reaches. For reasons of emphasis and style, we prefer however, to state our conclusions in the following way:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) We accept the fundamental concept of the Woodhouse Committee Report and the National Compensation Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) We consider the implementation of that concept as socially desirable, necessary and indeed inevitable. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) We find some aspects of the Woodhouse Committee's proposals for implementing the concept of 'National Compensation' superficial, and we believe this is reflected in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) If the Bill is amended in accordance with the Committee's recommendations many of these difficulties would be overcome. We remain concerned, however, with matters such as the enormous ramifications of Clause 50 of the Bill and the relationship between 'the scheme' and other social welfare programmes. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government must resolve these problems without delay. </PARA>
<PARA> (5) Subject to the qualifications expressed in the last two paragraphs we specifically adopt the views of the Chairman on the following matters:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the need to proceed with the injury part of the scheme,</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the need to seek appropriate powers to implement such a scheme in the event of a constitutional challenge succeeding. </PARA>
<PARA>Addendum 3</PARA>
<PARA>ADDENDUM BY SENATORS CHANEY, MISSEN AND WRIGHT</PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of reasons detailed in the Committee Report which in our view, preclude the Bill achieving the theoretically laudible objectives of the Woodhouse Committee to provide:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . a universal and comprehensive scheme designed to alleviate the problems of persons afflicted by any physical or mental incapacity that has a significant and adverse effect upon the quality of their lives. Its essential purpose will be to provide a form of social insurance in respect of every risk to life and limb during the whole 24 hours of every day.' (Paragraph 344 (a))</PARA>
<PARA> Other matters render the proposed scheme impracticable. </PARA>
<PARA> The major problems we see are:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The constitutional doubt as to its validity, particularly in relation to the abolition of common law rights. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The need for State co-operation (unlikely to occur) to enable its effective operation. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. The need for a solution to the problem of double payments particularly arising in respect to superannuation schemes which are beyond the powers of the Commonwealth and which would require State legislation. It is fairly clear that this is not to be forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The uncertainty of the costing of the scheme, particularly the sickness part of the scheme. The knowledge that many of the clauses (and discretions contained within them) have not been, in any satisfactory way, costed by the proponents of the scheme, or of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. The effect of increased government expenditure and of the dislocation of investment patterns on the insurance industry and the national economy, particularly at a time of economic stress. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. The effect on State government finances and on the finances of semi- government authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. The failure of the Government to finalise, or to propose to the Parliament, any method of financing the Scheme and the failure of the Government in evidence before the Committee to disclose any real consideration or conclusions as to the economic effects of the alternative methods of financing. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. The fact that the implementation of the national compensation scheme may hinder the appropriate resolution of such disputed priorities and may lead to substantial increased expenditure for the purpose of upgrading other welfare programmes or to the neglect of programmes more vital to the relief of poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. The tremendous expense involved in the application of Clause 50 of the Bill to medical and paramedical expenses and losses, or alternatively the injustice of depriving beneficiaries, especially employees, of compensation for medical and hospital expenses outside Medibank and the failure to resolve whether or not such expenditures will or will not be covered under the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. The complete absence of provisions in the Bill for safety and rehabilitation which were, according to the Woodhouse Report, the primary purposes of the Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. The indication of objections to the Bill by the Trade Union Movement and other substantial organisations and the failure to resolve their major objections to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. The deficiencies in the Bill in respect of widows, persons over 65 years of age, and young persons who are denied proper remedies under the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>(2) Constitutional Power</PARA>
<PARA> The extreme doubt about the constitutional power of the Commonwealth Parliament to enact this legislation is of fundamental importance and must, in itself, weigh against the passage of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In Chapter III of the Report, reference is made to the opinion of three Queen's Counsel, Mr F. G. Brennan, Q.C. of Brisbane, Mr A. M. Gleeson, Q.C. of Sydney and Mr R. E. McGarvie, Q.C. of Melbourne, all of whom expressed the view that Clause 97 of the Bill (which is the vital Clause removing common law rights) does not have constitutional validity. All counsel expressed the view that the Clause, which is vital to the Bill, was beyond the legislative power of the Australian Parliament. IT does not come within any of the specific powers granted to the Commonwealth, nor is it within the 'incidental' power of the Australian Parliament. It is therefore likely to fail if challenged. Similar views were expressed by a number of witnesses before the Committee. It was clearly apparent that many State Governments had been so advised and that the Bill, if enacted, would be challenged in the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that, at an earlier stage, the Australian Government obtained advice from Mr M. H. Byers, Q.C. the Solicitor-General, contrary to that given to the Committee by the three counsel previously referred to (see Appendix C) In his written opinion Mr Byers dealt with a number of the Clauses of the Bill. He expressed the view that Clause 97 (i) and (ii) (then Clause 91 (i) and (ii)) was -</PARA>
<PARA> 'valid to the extent that they operate as conditions of the grant of the benefit'. </PARA>
<PARA> He stated at page 13 of his Opinion that-</PARA>
<PARA> 'it would be clear enough that a provision requiring of the beneficiary surrender of his common law or Workers Compensation rights before either receipt of a payment or entitlement to a payment arise, would be a law with respect to the provision of the benefit. I do not think there is any substantial difference between that class of law and the one here in question'. </PARA>
<PARA> In our opinion there is a great deal of difference between the two matters. This is not a case of the surrender of any rights voluntarily but it is a provision of benefits which the claimant must either 'take or leave'. Under the provision of this Bill, once there is a benefit specified under the Bill, the claimant loses his entire rights at common law and can either take or refuse the benefit. If he manages, by some method, to receive common law damages then he is required, by Clause 98 of the Bill, to repay it to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Byers acknowledged that-</PARA>
<PARA> 'it is no doubt true, or may be true, to say that the law with respect to the provision of benefits may not authorise an enactment compelling their acceptance '. </PARA>
<PARA> But he then concluded-</PARA>
<PARA> 'Nonetheless I think that the provision is valid as providing what in substance is a condition by reference to which the Parliament confers the benefit. I do not think that in any legal sense it makes receipt of the benefit become compulsory.'</PARA>
<PARA> We find the argument in no way convincing. We would suggest that, in essence, this removal of common law rights is not a condition of taking a benefit but, in reality, the claimant has no alternative rights. If the benefit is not taken up, the common law right is still abrogated. </PARA>
<PARA> The other opinions obtained by the Committee reject the proposal that the provisions of this vital Clause 97 can be justified under the insurance of social services power, or that it is merely a condition of the grant of a benefit, or incidental to any of the existing powers. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr F. G. Brennan, Q.C. (at page 19 of his Opinion), says-</PARA>
<PARA> 'To give effect to power to provide a benefit for a person it is not necessary to take away or sterilise that person's enforceable right to compensation. The legislative taking away or sterilising of a right of compensation is unrelated to the provision of a benefit'. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr R. E. McGarvie, Q.C., at paragraphs 24, 34 and 35 of his Opinion concludes-</PARA>
<PARA> 24. 'In my opinion Clause 97 would not, upon enactment, be a law with respect to the provision by the Commonwealth of sickness benefits or widows' pensions. Its operation is to abolish rights to damages or other compensation where a benefit is provided by the Commonwealth. Further, in my opinion, Clause 97 is not a law with respect to something which is incidental to the provision by the Commonwealth of sickness benefits or widows' pensions nor is it a law with respect to a matter incidental to the execution by the Parliament of its power to legislate on these subject matters.'</PARA>
<PARA> 34. 'In summary, it is my view that, except for periodical payments falling within the description of invalid pensions, there is no legislative power to achieve the results which Clause 97 is designed to achieve. The Australian Parliament could not validly legislate to abolish rights under state law to workers' compensation rights outside the description of invalid pensions or to abolish rights under state law to common law damages.'</PARA>
<PARA> 35. 'In my opinion, the Australian Parliament does not have constitutional power to enact Clause 97 of the National Compensation Bill 1974 and the Clause, if enacted, would be invalid.'</PARA>
<PARA> We hold the view that it is highly unlikely that this legislation would pass the scrutiny of the High Court. This leads inescapably to the conclusion that the Parliament should not persist in a course which endeavours to abrogate common law rights. The suggestion of a delay in the proclamation of the Bill to enable the High Court challenge to be heard is unsatisfactory and wasteful of the community's resources. There is no doubt that, in the meanwhile, the Department would be expanded and moneys would be spent to no purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>Addendum 4</PARA>
<PARA>ADDENDUM BY SENATOR CHANEY</PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the Committee view expressed in paragraph 1.21 of the Committee report that existing compensation systems are random in their coverage, often provide inadequate compensation and can give rise to inequities. Undoubtedly a better system must be found. Rather than persisting with the present National Compensation Bill, it would be preferable to develop a constitutionally sound alternative. This requires making every effort, in co-operation with the States, to improve the fairness, justice and efficiency of the provision of benefits to persons suffering injury or sickness. </PARA>
<PARA> My attitude to the recommendations made in the body of the Senate Committee's Report must be read in the light of this Addendum. If the current National Compensation Bill is to proceed and receive a Second Reading in the Senate, then I concur with the great majority of recommendations contained in the Senate Committee's Report as they would substantially improve the Bill and remove anomalies and injustices. But my basic recommendation is for the withdrawal of the Bill and the development of a proper system of compensation in co-operation with the States, which have shown in their submissions to this Committee a readiness to adopt new approaches. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak briefly to the amendment moved by Senator Haines. The Australian Labor Party accepts this amendment. It gives me the opportunity to make it quite clear, as I did before, that when I speak of national compensation I do not speak of the proposal in toto which was put down by Mr Justice Woodhouse on the occasion when, along with five lawyers, I was a member of that learned committee. I came to realise, as did the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), Senator Button, Senator Everett, Senator Wright and Senator Missen, the difficulties and the excesses inherent in the proposals of Mr Justice Woodhouse. On signing that report, I did not endear myself, nor did the rest of us, to the Prime Minister of the day. However, all of us remained, I think, fairly firm in the belief of the need for a considerable reform in the compensation system in this community. As Senator Haines's amendment expresses that and makes it clear that we do not agree with the more extreme proposals of the Woodhouse report, the Opposition certainly accepts her amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to thank the Opposition and the Australian Democrats for their support for the provisions contained in the Social Services Legislation Amendment Bill. Essentially the Bill tries to remove some anomalies from the existing legislation. In addition I believe it is a first step along the track that Senator Grimes requested us to follow when he sought a consolidation of the Social Services Act. There are a great number of amendments which tidy the Act and will make it a lot more understandable to the people who have to use it and who are meant to benefit from it. In that sense, quite apart from the actual amendments of substance which are included, I would expect it to be beneficial. The Bill does provide for some minor savings by way of the removal of anomalies. The number of diplomats who receive the family allowance for their children, I understand, is quite small. But it has been an inappropriate provision within our law and it is good that it is to be removed. The amount of savings will be small.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the field of the sickness benefit, I am not able to give an estimate that I would regard as reliable to Senator Grimes in response to his request about the amount of additional savings which might accrue. He has put forward the figure of $5.6m on the savings which will be brought about by the existing provision. I note his caution that one would want a humane administration of this provision. I can only say that I believe the people who administer my Department in the main are anxious to administer the discretionary provisions in a way which is beneficial and helpful to the people with whom they are dealing. The debate has really centred on the amendments which have been moved by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. The Opposition having now accepted the Democrats' amendment I should perhaps indicate to the Senate that, whilst we will be voting against the Labor Party's amendment, as would be expected, I do propose to support the Democrat amendment to the Labor Party's amendment for the sorts of reasons which have been explained by Senator Haines and Senator Grimes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Woodhouse proposals were subjected to considerable scrutiny in this place. As it happens, both Senator Grimes and I were part of that scrutiny. I think we would be at one in saying that the suggestions of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs do represent considerable advances on the original proposal that was put forward in the draft legislation. For that reason , were any motion passed I would prefer it to be passed in the terms of the amendment moved by Senator Haines on behalf of the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> I now put the Government's position regarding the two amendments. The first leg of the amendment calls for an increase in the family allowance for first and second children. In opposing the amendment, I do not for a moment oppose the fact that it would be a good thing to provide additional assistance for one- child and two-child families. The decision was taken in the Budget context last year to provide assistance for third and subsequent children only, because there was a limited amount of money available to add to the pool which goes out in the family allowance area. The cost of making provisions for third and subsequent children was a cost that we felt was within the proper budgetary limits. It was a burden that we were prepared to lay upon the Australian taxpayers because, of course, they are the people who pay for it. We were not prepared to have an additional impost of $368m which is what would have been required had we also extended the benefits to the first and second child. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the truism that it is not the Government's money that we are allocating in this case; it is, of course, the money of the people of Australia-the taxpayers' money. We did not feel able to raise additional taxes or incur a further deficit to the extent of another $368m. I note that the amendment seeks to record a view of the Senate that we should be concerned about the position of families with one or two children as well as the position of families with three or more children. I would merely say in defence of the selection of three or more children that, quite apart from the economic factors, the fact is that families with three and more children are more likely to be in difficulty and economic hardship than smaller families. To that extent there is a good welfare reason for the differentiation that was made. </PARA>
<PARA> On the second point regarding the system of national compensation, I would be the first to admit that there are gaps and at times great inconsistencies between compensation systems. Clearly there are imperfections. I do not think that any honourable senator would underrate the difficulty in producing a non- complex, simple and uniform scheme for the whole of Australia. The trade union movement, which has a very great interest in the workers compensation scheme, would be very reluctant to see that interfered with unless it was absolutely certain that what was being replaced had the very great benefits which have been achieved by the trade union movement over the years for those people who are injured at work. This is a matter of great complexity. The Government did have some consultations with the States on 1976 and 1977 but little progress was made in those discussions. At this stage I do not think there is a very realistic prospect of a national scheme emerging as a matter of agreement between those other responsible governments, namely, the State governments and the Commonwealth Government. For that reason basically, the Government will oppose the amendment while thanking the Senate for the support which it has given to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had understood that the debate on the Social Services Legislation Amendment Bill would conclude at 3.30 p.m. I had not been given any prior warning that there would be an extension of time. The motion passed by the Senate enables this legislation to pass through the Senate today. The Senate Order of Business paper stated quite specifically that the debate would conclude at 3.30 p.m. I was clearly of that view. Therefore, I was engaged in an in-depth discussion and consideration of the Bill to amend the powers of the Senate which will be coming up later on today. After all, the measure, which has been proposed by the Government, is not opposed in any shape or form by the Opposition. Those honourable senators who have spoken thus far seem to be heatedly in agreement concerning its provisions. The only matters of contention appear to be the additions to the motion that the Bill be read a second time. In this regard, I am in a cleft stick. I agree with part of the proposition, namely, that relating to family allowances, but I am not altogether enamoured of the second proposition, namely, that a system of national compensation, as recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, should be provided. I am a little diffident about that for the very reason that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) has just given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The trade union movement throughout Australia, because of its close interest in the issue of workers' compensation, would be very concerned to be assured that its members would, in no sense, suffer a loss of rights as a result of the introduction of a system of national compensation. I recall that I had lengthy discussions with a former Minister for Social Security, Senator Wheeldon, about this very issue. I believe that we were reaching the point at which such an understanding could have been achieved. In the absence of the Senate being provided with details of a particular measure which would ensure that the trade union movement, and workers generally, would not be disadvantaged, insofar as workers' compensation rights were concerned, by the introduction of a national compensation scheme, I would be hesitant to support the Senator Grimes proposal as amended by Senator Haines's proposal. Therefore, I am not able to vote against the amendment as such but would like to vote for half of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to Senator Harradine's foreshadowed amendment. The Opposition moved what I thought was a fairly simple amendment relating to one aspect of the inadequacies of the family allowance system and to the lack of fairness and justice in the national compensation system. Senator Haines clarified that amendment somewhat by pointing out that this Senate would not agree with the excesses of the Woodhouse proposal. I would have assumed that any proposal on national compensation in this country with which I or Senator Haines had anything to do would include a provision to protect the rights of workers under the workers' compensation scheme. That intention may not have been expressed in precise terms but it was certainly meant; it is everything that the party that I represent stands for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, I am in the difficult position that Senator Harradine's proposed amendment will be moved first and then Senator Haines' amendment to my amendment . I have no objection to Senator Harradine's proposal but press the point that my amendment stated that we needed a system of national compensation to remove the excessive costs, delays and uncertainties. I see no reason to resile from my amendment, despite Senator Harradine's concern for the trade union movement. I repeat, in any scheme that we introduced the rights of the trade union movement and of workers generally under workers' compensation legislation would be considered. Therefore, the Opposition will continue its support for Senator Haines's amendment to my amendment but will oppose Senator Harradine's proposed amendment, not because of its content but because it eliminates the reference to compensation in the other two amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 6 May 1982 I presented the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence entitled 'The Gulf and Australia'. On that occasion I spent some time talking about the main recommendations of the report so I do not intend to spend a great deal of time this afternoon on them. However, some important points ought to be made at this time. I say this because I am very pessimistic about the continuing war between Iraq and Iran. It is the forgotten war, it is the war that is being allowed to continue and it is the war that it seems nobody can stop. One Western view that has a lot of currency is that the war is good for the United States of America, it is good for Israel and it is also good for the West. But I believe that the war contains a conflict that could engulf the Middle East and eventually pose a greater threat to world peace than the Arab-Israeli conflict. I see this conflict as a battle between the Islamic fundamentalists, whom I call 'the mediaevals', and the twentieth century Arabs. It is a war that is already spilling over the boundaries of Iraq and Iran. It is already ignoring the traditional left or right labels on the regimes in the area. It is ignoring previous loyalties to either the Eastern or Western blocs and what I think is perhaps more serious is that it is slowly involving the super-powers in a conflict between the countries that have the second and third largest oil reserves in the world. I believe that this should be a worry to all of us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, this war ignores previous loyalties. At the moment Iraq is being supported financially by the Gulf States and by Saudi Arabia. It was estimated in February this year that already the Gulf States and Saudi Arabia had poured $ US30 billion into Iraq to support it during the war. It is also being supported by Jordan, which has sent a volunteer brigade to fight on the Iraqi side, and it is being supported by conservative Arab regimes such as the one in Oman. On 23 February 1982, in a debate in the Senate, I said:</PARA>
<PARA> Even Egypt says that it sides with Iraq in the war; if Iraq's borders are threatened it will sell arms to that country. </PARA>
<PARA>We have seen recently that Egypt has taken sides in the war following the return of the Sinai. Egypt has taken a very active role in this conflict. It is selling arms to Iraq and obviously it is doing that because it believes that Iran and obviously it is doing that because it believes that Iran is posing a threat to the borders of Iraq. Also, we have recently seen the United States of America remove Iraq from the list of countries embargoed from receiving United States military equipment. I think we ought to ask ourselves why that decision has been taken. I am sure that the United States is aware of the increased Soviet influence in Iran. In the speech I made in February, to which I referred, I said that reports at that time suggested that 2,000 to 4,000 Soviet military advisers were in Iran. Recent estimates are that 5,000 military advisers are helping the Iranian forces. The United States is also concerned because Syria, which is aligned to Moscow and is probably the most pro-Moscow State in the Arab world, now supports Iran. It is the one Arab country to support it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to ask ourselves why these countries are taking the particular views that they are. Why are they supporting the particular countries they are supporting at the moment? Why is a group of conservative Arab countries supporting Iraq? Why, for instance, is the Gulf Co-operative Council-a body I am sure we will hear a lot more of in the future-holding joint Defence Ministers meetings at the moment? I think the answer is that those conservative Arab countries believe that the Iranian leaders are becoming the terrorists of the Gulf. They believe that the Iranian leadership at the moment is trying to export its fundamentalist revolution to the Shi'ite minority populations throughout the Arab world. If we want to see an example of this we have only to look at what happened in Bahrain recently when it was proved that the attempted coup was Iranian sponsored. The people who were arrested, the people concerned in that attempted coup, had got their weapons and their training in Iran. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the speech that I made on 23 February the military balance has changed in the Gulf war. At that stage Iraq was being seen to be successful. At the moment the military opinion would be that Iran has reversed the previous trend and in fact is pressing on the borders of Iraq. Iran is doing this despite the horrendous casualties it has recieved. It was reported earlier this year that between 90,000 and 100,000 troops had been either killed or captured. There were reports that Khomeini's revolutionary guards were armed only with pieces of paper given to them by the Mullahs that were supposed to ward off bullets. The Jordanians described these pieces of paper as transit visas to heaven. These revolutionary guards were storming the Iraqi positions and being followed up by Iranian troops. One has only to see the claims being made at the moment about the battle for Khorramshahr which the Ayatollah Khomeini has called the city of blood. Apparently in this battle, which is taking place at the moment, the Iranians have pushed thousands of teenage troops behind the city to stop any retreat by the Iraqi forces at present inside the city. It is only in the last three or four days that reports of that battle have suggested that the Iraqi forces in one particular push killed over 22,000 of these young revolutionary guards who have been pushed into the conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have to ask ourselves why Iran is willing to pay this quite horrendous price in terms of people killed, in terms of military equipment and in terms of cost to its economy, which from all reports is in tatters. Iran is determined to try to bring down the current regime in Baghdad. I think the danger that that poses to Australia is that there is a very real chance that the new regime that would emerge in Iraq if the present regime were to fold would be a more pro- Moscow regime than the one there at the moment. Another point that we have to consider very strongly is that after the Ayatollah Khomeini's regime goes in Iran-this could happen at any time in the future-we will see in that country a regime more pro-Moscow. </PARA>
<PARA> At the present time the Australian Press has front-page stories every day about what is happening in the Falkland Islands and the fact that Britain and the Argentine are prepared to go to war over the Falkland Islands. I am not playing down in any sense what is happening in the Falkland Islands. I am simply saying that the Australian newspapers have front-page articles saying that this conflict is a great threat to world peace and they have reports about the implications for Australia if that conflict spreads, but they do not seem to have reports-if they do they are at page 19 or 20 of the Australian or the Sydney Morning Herald-about the war that is taking place in the Gulf, a war that has been fought for at least 19 months and a war that has claimed between 100, 000 and 200,000 deaths. If it spreads it could easily destabilise countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain-in fact the whole of the Gulf. Naturally, it also could completely destabilise the regimes in Iran and Iraq. As I said earlier, those countries have the second and third largest oil reserves in the world today. If we examine that situation we will find that the implications for Australia and for the West, if only as far as oil supplies are concerned, are most horrendous indeed. I therefore believe that this report from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on the Gulf and Australia is one of the most important reports brought before this Senate for a number of years. It is a report that deserves to be read not only by honourable senators but also by the Australian public generally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, I want to say a few words about this report. I was concerned by the Press coverage the report received when it was brought down. The Press coverage was limited to the more emotive issues contained in the report, whereas it also contains a great deal of material which is worthy of careful note. The adequacy of Australia's defence must be judged according to the threats to Australia. Therefore, as part of a general monitoring of the implementation of the Australian Government's announced defence program, the Committee decided that it should first develop a thorough understanding of the types of threats and contingencies which may be faced by this country.</PARA></TALK.START>

Its strength is principally that it cannot be said to be pursuing a particular line for political purposes and, further, that the Committee can be open and frank without compromising Government policy. Its weakness is that the Committee is limited in relation to classified information and its assessments must be read with that reservation. It was the hope of the Committee that the report would have the effect of dispelling unnecessary fears, lead to an informal and balanced appreciation of Australia's regional relationships and improve the climate of understanding between Australia and its neighbours. It was hoped that the report would be read in that spirit. </PARA>
<PARA> For convenience, threats to the security of Australia were considered under four heads: First, the potential for global conflict and its implication for Australia; secondly, the threat of invasion to Australia; thirdly, intermediate level threats, such as limited lodgments on Australian territory, major raids on , say, military bases or key civil installations, external aggression against a regional country the security of which is highly important to Australia, and the blockade of an Australian port; fourthly, low level contingencies, which include such prospects as overseas-based terrorist groups using violence in Australia, harrassment of our shipping, fishing activities or off-shore exploration and exploitation, or harassment of our nationals in overseas countries. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the potential for global conflict and its implications for Australia, the Committee concluded that any general war involving conventional forces of the super-powers would most likely escalate into a nuclear war and, perhaps contrary to some suggestions now being received from the United States, that it would be unrealistic to believe that any resort to limited nuclear war by the super-powers could be contained before the rapid onset of full scale nuclear war. The Committee recognised the dangerous state of the world in relation to the potential for nuclear conflict. Out of its findings a number of important observations can be made. </PARA>
<PARA> First, it is critical that the United States be able to deter the Soviet Union from a pre-emptive nuclear attack or a general war which, as I have stated, would be most likely to escalate into a nuclear war. Therefore, in urging arms limitation it is important that we recognise that we are likely to have greater influence upon our ally, the United States, and that we must beware of the United States responding, as it may be argued that it has done in recent years, to world opinion whilst a potential aggressor increases its armaments and upsets the balance. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, subject to that restraint, it is however in our best interests to encourage progress in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks and to support, as we are, the United Nations Conference on Disarmament. Thirdly, we have an obvious interest in the isolation of any regional conflict to prevent its escalation into general war. Here we can act in a responsible way, particularly within our region, and make a contribution to lessening the possibilities of nuclear conflict. Fourthly, we have an equally obvious vested interest in contributing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. We can contribute by urging and attempting to influence those states which have not joined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to do so. In the report it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The probability of nuclear weapons being used outside the super powers central relationship is probably greater than the chances of them being used by the super powers. There are a number of 'adversary pairs' in the world in which there is a nuclear component or potential capability on either one or both sides . </PARA>
<PARA>Any contribution that Australia can make to lessening tension between such adversary pairs can only be in our best interests. Thus, the Australian contribution in the Sinai might be seen as such an example. There is obvious comfort in learning that there is little reason for Australia to be a nuclear target with perhaps the exception of the three joint Australian-United States defence installations. The assessment of their potential as nuclear targets is not based on absolute knowledge of designation and functions of the installations but rather on what might be the Soviet perception of their role. The obvious conclusion is that it would be prudent for Australian defence planners to assume that in a major global conflict they would be potential targets. So there is a risk in their continuance. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand it must be remembered, as is noted in the report, that they contribute substantially to America's national technical means of verification which is a means of monitoring the Soviet Union's strategic nuclear forces upon which the SALT agreements are predicated. The bases are therefore a contribution on our part to the control of nuclear weapons. Furthermore, in our contribution as host at North West Cape we are playing a role in the command and control system of the American submarine launched ballistic missile force and thus making a contribution to the stable central balance between super-powers. We must expect to pay a price for our alliance, which it is stated in the report:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . acts as a deterrent against hostile actions against Australia which are of such a magnitude that they are beyond Australia's own capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, we are warned in the report that if the United States resources were fully occupied in a major confrontation with the Soviet Union, Australia would have to be prepared to fend off any threats from other powers with only incidental help from our American allies. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the report deals with the threat of invasion of Australia and finds that invasion by means of conventional warfare is remote, principally because of our geographical location and the formidable natural deterrent it offers. Furthermore, the Committee found a lack of motive on the part of nations for such an invasion, and reports, to our credit, that as a trading country we have been willing to make our resources available on commercial terms, and instances of denial of our resources have been rare. This statement in itself contains an implied warning of our international responsibility in relation to our fortuitous natural resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, in the third part of the report, which deals with intermediate level threats, the Committee again noted our good relations with our neighbours and the little motive that exists for such threats. The part, however, contains several particular warnings which are worth referring to. In one section it draws to the attention of those who read it:</PARA>
<PARA> In the event of serious ideological or other divisions-contrived or real-within Australia, a foreign power might attempt to exploit these divisions to its own advantage. External attacks are likely to be more succesful when a country which is the object of attack is debilitated by internal disorder. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that is a warning particularly worth remembering. A second warning which I wish to state on this occason is:</PARA>
<PARA> An increased vulnerability to attack is one of the consequences for a state which has become diplomatically isolated because its policies are unacceptable to world opinion. </PARA>
<PARA>In our position of geographical isolation and apparent security it is important that we do not become out of step with the balance of an often less fortunate and less secure world. Finally, under that head, the Committee raises for further consideration the subject of the potential for greater co-operation or alliances with other regional powers, a subject to which I believe effort should continually be given. </PARA>
<PARA> In the fourth part of the report the Committee finds that low level contingencies are difficult to control. Furthermore, the threats can become a reality with little warning. Deterrents are suggested, such as surveillance capability and strong and efficient anti-terrorist capabilities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to debate the 192nd report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which concerns the collection and dissemination of statistics. The Committee is one of only three statutory committees of the Parliament. It has significance in that its membership is drawn from both sides-Government and Opposition-and from both Houses of Parliament. It has an immense output and its papers are highly respected. In addition to acting as the watchdog on the finances of government in a whole range of matters it has in recent years widened its brief. In addition to reporting on many matters that are raised by the Auditor-General and on other issues, it also prepares discussion papers. The paper before the Senate today is but one of those.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw the Senate's attention to another innovation. The Committee is holding a series of parliamentary seminars. One is to take place in Parliament House tomorrow. We believe it is important to draw not only the attention of Parliament but also the attention of the wider community to many aspects of public administration. This document on the collection and dissemination of statistics is one. Honourable senators will realise the last major report on the collection and dissemination of statistics was in 1973. It was the report of the committee on Integration of Data Systems, known as the Crisp report. Many of the matters that had currency then are equally relevant today despite certain legislative changes that were enacted in 1974 and 1975. We still have poor communication between producers and users of statistics. We still have a limited accessibility to much existing data and there is still inadequate co-ordination.</PARA>
<PARA> Many people in business recognise that there is too great a paper burden on them and that business has imposed on it a very high cost in producing a great range of statistics for a large number of governmental departments. Business, therefore, would like to see a centralisation in the collection of statistics. Government needs to have available to it accurate, up to date and comprehensive statistics so it can monitor the effects of policy decisions, provide information for formulating new policies on the full range of governmental activities and plan for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The members of our Committee believe that there needs to be a reduction in the paper work burden. In some countries, notably in the United States of America and Canada, governments have taken substantive action to reduce the paper burden on their citizens. We believe the Australian Government should take similar steps. Throughout the world the demand for more statistics appears to be insatiable. In spite of the large manpower and financial resources which are currently being put into the collection and dissemination of statistics, unfortunately a number of difficulties still exist. </PARA>
<PARA> Our report makes 15 major recommendations. I refer only briefly to a number of these. We believe that the co-ordinating powers of the Australian Bureau of Statistics need to be clarified and strengthened, if need be, by amending legislation. We also believe that there is a need for a central register of statistical information, similar to that which exists in the United States. We believe that agencies should be required to consult this register and obtain the Bureau's approval before embarking on any statistical collection. This, we believe, would reduce the paper work created by various departments asking for essentially similar or the same information from business. We also believe that there is a case in some circumstances for charging for the Bureau's statistical publications but not necessarily across the wide ambit of activities. This discussion paper is a further example of the Public Accounts Committee's concern to improve the level of administration in the Public Service and to provide a benefit to the community at large. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a resumption of a debate on a private member's Bill introduced by Senator Gareth Evans of Victoria. It was last debated in this chamber on the evening of 18 March last, prior to the Senate's adjourning, and I was speaking. Today I requested that my name be crossed off the speaker's list to save time because we have two hours in which to debate this issue. It was my understanding that an agreement had been reached among the parties to complete not only the second reading debate today, which the Australian Democrats concurred, but also to have a third reading debate in which the Democrats would have co-operated. In the spirit of that co-operation I removed my name from the speaking list. Then I find-I am not necessarily blaming anyone here, I am stating a fact-that nine more speakers are now listed for the second reading debate. This means that any hope of getting a second reading vote today has gone. That is no criticism, because this is a very important issue.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I will speak relatively briefly because my colleague Senator Michael Macklin, who will speak after me, is the Democrat spokesman on this issue. As I understand it, he has worked very well and with great co-operation with Senator Evans in bringing the Bill, with its relative amendments, to this stage. In summary I know this will probably offend purists like my friend Senator Evans but as a layman I say that the Bill has two main thrusts. One is to try to take out of the hands of petty politicians, who happen at any time to be a leader of a political party, the right to determine an election date that suits their whim or the wishes of their political party and to have fixed terms of parliament and a fixed date on which federal elections should be held. I commend that point of view with vigour. The second thrust of Senator Evans's Bill is to reduce-this is a fairly brutal summary, I admit-the power of the Senate to refuse Supply and to bring down the Government. I know there are many refinements to that, and I hope Senator Evans will forgive me, but for the benefit of the people listening that is what this debate is generally about. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans will be pleased to hear that there are no buts either. On the question of fixed terms of parliament, I have reprimanded those political leaders who believe that the date of an election of a parliament, whether it be State or federal, should be solely in the hands of the leader of the political party which happens to govern at that time. It is an outrageous proposition in a democracy that we allow the leader of a political party, who happens to be Premier or Prime Minister, to manipulate matters to such an extent that he or she can take the Government to the people at a time that suits the political party which he or she happens to lead at that time. We have seen this demonstrated by a series of manipulations. If we have a very good Budget this August speculation will be in the air that Prime Minister Fraser may well be seeking an early election. He can seek an early election and presumably because of the disposition or interpretations of recent governors-general the mere asking for an early election seems to indicate that it will be granted by the Governor-General or, in the case of the State, by a governor. I have expressed very strong views on that matter. That is absolutely opposed to the whole spirit of vice-regal representation. It is rather interesting to look at a speech made by a former Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, which he made in India in about 1975 or thereabouts. He said, very clearly, that it was not good enough grounds for a representative of the Queen or a Governor-General to grant a double dissolution or an early election simply because the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Government of the day asked for one. There had to be some substantive reason, namely the inability of the Government to govern, the difficulties of the Government on the floor of the House or whatever. I put that to one side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apart from the immorality of a proposition that one political party can determine an early election or fix an election date-and that is immoral-there is also the instability which this present system breeds in a community. Almost since Prime Minister Fraser won government at the last election there has been monthly speculation as to whether there will be an early election and whether there will be a double dissolution. We are getting to a time when soon we will be past the time when a double dissolution will be a viable situation. During the whole of next year we will have newspaper speculation such as: 'Will Prime Minister Fraser have an early election?' That will start about January or February. There could well be a mini-Budget in March and an election in April or May--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator MacGibbon. That is a respectable point of view. If Senator MacGibbon believes that instability is not caused among the business sector of this community every four weeks or so when the Prime Minister prompts or allows to flourish, speculation about an early election, he is spending far too much time away from ordinary people and away from the small business sector which he, as a member of the Liberal Party, purports to represent in this place. It is outrageous to contemplate the proposition that small business persons in particular, can plan ahead to any great extent, for example, planning expansion, investment of new funds, diversifying lines of production if they think that there may be an election in the air within the next three months. I am astonished at the lack of wisdom of Senator MacGibbon's interjection. Therefore, it follows that we should adopt the philosophy of a fixed term as in the United States of America where there is no fiddling of election dates. The electors and politicians know that an election will be held on a certain date. Budgets or unemployment figures or anything else cannot be fiddled with. The Government must face the music at a certain time. In Australia no local government can fiddle with an election date. Councillors in local government face the electors at a fixed time. They cannot hold elections at a time to suit their own convenience. Therefore, I have a very strong support for the philosophy of Senator Evans's Bill in this regard. Again I commend him for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second prong to his Bill is that of reducing the power of the Senate to block Supply or to stop the supply of money for the ordinary services of the Government. If I am not mistaken, it was in November last year that Senator Evans's Bill was first brought before the Senate. Since then he has been amenable to suggestions of alteration. The Bill currently before the House has certain provisions which would reduce the power of the Senate to block Supply. The Australian Democrats have reservations about the detail of some of those provisions. Senator Macklin will handle them in detail. As I understand the scuttle-butt around this place, there is enough support amongst honourable senators on both the Labor side and the Liberal side to pass those clauses of this Bill which will bring about a fixed date for elections. But, as I understand it, there is not enough support now in this chamber to pass those clauses which reduce those powers of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Philosophically, the Democrats are behind Senator Evans in his wish to perform this second function. We have demonstrated our good faith on this aspect because those three Democrat senators who were returned at the last election signed a statutory declaration saying that under no circumstances, not even reprehensible circumstances, would they ever block Supply to bring down a government or vote against tax Bills that would prevent a government of the day from governing properly. We are the only political party in the Senate which has demonstrated that will by signing declarations. I think our gesture of support philosophically is there. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to Senator Evans that, while we commend philosophically his intentions in the Bill, there is a view put around by some senators more astute than I that if we are hopeful of getting any amendments to the Constitution it would be better to put those amendments to the people in one question. This is a highly technical matter. As I understand section 128 of the Constitution, any proposed law agreed to by both Houses of the Parliament or initiated by one but disagreed with by the other must be put to the people. What we are debating this afternoon is a proposed law. A Bill is before us. If we pass that Bill and then by some miracle it is passed by the House of Representatives and assented to by the Governor-General, it becomes a proposed law to which the people of Australia will be asked to say yes or no. It has been put to me with some vigour that each of these propositions would have a much better chance of succeeding if they were contained in separate Bills and put as separate questions to the electorate. </PARA>

I would agree with Senator MacGibbon in a flash in saying that any amendments to the Constitution are difficult to get through. What I am saying, if I can plagiarise from my friend and associate Senator Macklin an excellent expression he has coined, is that by passing this Bill as it stands we would be maximising opposition to any constitutional reform at all by passing two matters in the one package. Therefore, I conclude by expressing some sorrow that the Senate is not able to pass this Bill before it rises at least to show that it is a chamber intent on constitutional and electoral reform. Again, at the risk of being tedious, I commend my friend and colleague, Senator Evans, for the work that he has put into the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Constitution Alteration (Fixed Term Parliaments) Bill 1981 which is designed to achieve a number of measures which not only directly impinge upon the independence of the functioning of the Senate and our bicameral system but also seek to strike down the Senate as an effective and relevant chamber. The main provisions of the Bill as they apply to the alterations of the Constitution are: Fixed terms for the House of Representatives, fixed election dates, alteration of the legislative power of the Senate, new provisions relating to disagreements between the Houses, and limitations of the powers of the Governor-General in relation to the appointment of Ministers. While all those matters are of vital importance, in the limited time available to me, I shall by necessity confine myself to those provisions of the proposed Bill which most directly affect the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill before us involves the crippling of the legislative powers of the Senate. As a representative from Western Australia, one of the less populous States of Australia, I oppose this and any other proposals the effect of which is to downgrade the power and influence of the Senate in the Commonwealth Parliament. Everyone knows that the Senate was created to provide checks and balances on the Federal system of Government and to safeguard the interests of the States. Everyone knows that at the convention debates of 1897 and 1898 the representatives of the more populous eastern States sought paramouncy in the Federal Parliament. But the representatives of less populous States would have none of it and as an essential of federalism the Founding Fathers created a Senate constituted in such a way as effectively to fulfil the prime role of checks and balances and the protection of the interests of the States, the main elements of this being equal representation of the original States and, except for the financial initiative, powers which in effect are equal to those of the House of Representatives. The Senate not only has the power of veto over all proposed legislation but also, in respect of those money Bills which it cannot amend, has the right to make requests to the House of Representatives for amendments. If the Senate had not been accorded these powers, it is probable that the constitution would never have been accepted and there would not have been a Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have before us a Bill which seeks to cripple the legislative powers of the Senate and to undermine the entrenched protection of the less populous States. In real terms the effect of this Bill is to reduce the actual powers of the Senate-in fact, to gut the powers of the Senate. As it affects the Senate the Bill will impose upon Australia virtually a unicameral system with all effective powers residing in the eastern seaboard dominated House of Representatives and more particularly the Executive Government. In my view, it would be a great deal more honest of the Australian Labor Party if it were to say that it wished to see the Senate abolished and the rights and the protection of the States which it guards dissolved, a view expressed by Sir John Forrest during the 1897 Constitutional Debates when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> If the powers of the Senate are to be limited and circumscribed in this way, would it not be better to sweep it away altogether. If honourable gentlemen are not prepared to give reasonable powers to the Senate, a straightforward way of dealing with the matter would be to sweep it away altogether. We want no inferior or discredited body in this Constitution. We want both branches of the legislature strong: We desire that they should both live in the respect of the people. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that in 1970 Mr Whitlam described the ALP design for government structure as 'a House of Representatives for nation-wide and international matters, an Assembly for each of our dozen largest cities and a few score regional assemblies for the areas of rural population and resources development outside those cities'. That was, in fact, a call for the abolition of the Senate and the six State Parliaments. Mr Hayden, in referring to the Senate on 14 August 1980, is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> We are committed to its eventual elimination. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe the real aim of the ALP is to abolish the Senate but it is pragmatic enough to realise that the proposition has no appeal to the electorate of Australia as a whole so it has chosen to camouflage its true ambitions with this Bill which in effect would provide the ALP, should it be successful, with the same result. I have absolutely no doubt that the people of Western Australia will have no part of such a proposition. The people of Western Australia perceive correctly that the Senate is a States House and that it is the only chamber in which they have an effective voice. </PARA>
<PARA> It ought to be remembered that the only conditions upon which States such as Western Australia entered the Federation were if the States had equal representation in the Senate and if the Senate had equal powers with the House of Representatives, with the exception of the power to initiate or to amend certain money Bills. If one takes away equal representation and an equal chamber , one takes away the power of the smaller States. The Senate is not just a second chamber in the bicameral system of our Federal Parliament merely to reflect upon the activities of the House of Representatives; it is a chamber in which the States, as separate and disinct entities and as sovereign parts of Australia, are represented for the purpose of maintaining and protecting their constitutional rights against whatever threats may exist and to ensure that their views, grievances and opinions are reflected by those who represent them. The States have equal representation in one equal chamber of the Federal Parliament to allow them to resist proposals which threaten to violate and to invade the rights which have been reserved for them. Of course, it is equally natural that they have equal representation because they were, before entering Federation, and are now, equal in constitutional power and status, although certainly not equal in terms of territory or population. Territory and population should hardly be the absolute test of political status. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the terms and conditions upon which the States entered the Federation was that, in consideration for the transfer of certain powers to the Commonwealth, they would maintain their equality. That, of course, could be done only if they had equal representation in the States House. Had not these conditions been agreed upon there would have been no Federation. In fact, alteration to that provision in the Constitution regarding the relative representation of the States in the Senate cannot take place by the normal provision of a referendum of the majority of people in the majority of States voting in favour of it but rather a majority of people in all the States voting in favour of it-a very sensible and wise provision which makes it, in practical terms, quite impossible for that equal representation to be varied. Does anyone seriously argue that these provisions would apply if it were not intended that the Senate have the powers that it has responsibly exercised over the last 80 years? Equal representation was vigourously pursued because clearly it was going to give the smaller States a powerful voice in the affairs of Australia and to ensure the protection of their interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I labour the question of equal representation is that it demonstrates the great importance the States placed on the powers of the Senate. The greater the powers, the greater the need for equal representation. The reason the founding fathers from the smaller States fought for equal representation was that they were mindful of the great powers they were vesting in the Senate. Let it also not be forgotten that the reason they fought so fiercely for a strong Senate was that they were mindful of the powers they were handing to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps it ought to be remembered by those who would seek to destroy the Senate that the Federal Government is a creature of the States, and not vice versa. Perhaps certain people, in their headlong rush to centralise all power in Canberra, ought to remember that it was six quite separate, quite distinct and quite sovereign States which chose to join together to form a federation. It was they who decided what powers they would surrender and under what conditions they would surrender them. Yet we now have a call for the abolition of those very same States and for the repository of all effective power in Canberra. I quote Mr R. J. Hawke who said in the 1979 Boyer lecture:</PARA>
<PARA> The answer, I think, is that we, who are by nature a fairly conservative people , have come to be infatuated by an assiduously cultivated phenomenon called ' States rights'. I must confess that I do not have any idea what 'States rights' are. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawke went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe the logical implication of this analysis is that Australians would be better served by the elimination of the second tier of government-that is the States-which no longer service their original purpose and act as a positive impediment to achieving good government in our current community. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats have said that the replacement of States with regions is a long-term objective. Prior to federation the separate sovereign colonies joined together at a series of conventions for the purpose of designing a federation. In other words, the States chose to create a federation. The smaller States joined providing they did not give up or sacrifice a disproportionate share of their autonomy, rights, or sovereignty in relation to the more populous States. They were the ones who were deciding what they would allow of their authority to be written into the Constitution and placed in the hands of a Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems in forming a federation in Australia were not unlike those that faced the framers of the American Constitution-it was how to reconcile the creation of a strong national government while at the same time preserving the identity and sovereignty of the separate States. The result is a partly national and partly federal parliament. The national part of the Parliament is the House of Representatives; the federal part is the Senate, the organ of the States-that part of the Federal Parliament that is the tangible, visible and proper presentation of the States, joining them together as equal representatives in the federal system which they themselves created. </PARA>
<PARA> The major provision of Senator Evans's original Bill as it affects the Senate was to take from the Senate the power to reject, defer or amend any money Bill. This provision has now been amended to restrict that proposal to laws appropriating revenues or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government. However, in practical terms, the result will be exactly the same. The first and obvious result of the proposal is that it removes all discipline from corrupt, authoritarian, incompentent or delinquent governments and it further compounds the one real danger the smaller States face from a centralised government-total lack of influence over their own financial affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the proposals before us a Labor government could simply declare in a Bill that it is a Bill appropriating moneys for ordinary annual services and include in that Bill any legislation it so chooses. Section 54 of the Constitution as it presently stands makes it quite clear that any proposed law which appropriates revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the government shall deal only with such appropriation, and under section 53 the Senate cannot amend any proposed law for the appropriation of revenues or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the government. However, the Senate may amend a proposed law for the appropriation of revenues or moneys for any purpose other than the ordinary annual services of the government. In as much as the resolution of proposed laws is not one for the courts but rather for the two Houses of Parliament, the Senate is presently able to reject or delay any Bill and therefore can provide its own remedy against the tacking of other measures on to the ordinary annual service Bill. This prevents the Government from forcing its legislation through the Senate by tacking it on to a money Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I did not hear you because of the yelling, screaming and abuse coming from Senator Walsh's side of the chamber. Whenever I hear a mumbling, bumbling noise in the Senate I seek to ignore it because invariably it happens to be coming from Senator Walsh. However, under the Bill now before the Senate, the Senate is unable to amend any proposed law which the Government describes unilaterally as an ordinary annual service Bill, which simply means that the Government can tack any legislation, however unpalatable to the Senate, on to such a Bill. Clause 8 will amend section 53 by inserting after the fourth paragraph the following paragraph:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>be presented to the Governor-General for the Queen's assent as if it had been passed by both Houses of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>So, in effect, the Senate will no longer have the power to reject or amend any legislation. It is argued by some that the Senate no longer fulfils its function as a States House. However, while much of its strength as a States House is admittedly not always apparent, it continues to function for the purposes for which it was originally designed. On our side of politics there are no doubt many matters that do not even get past the Cabinet room, not to speak of the party room, because the Government sensibly judges that an issue, if it is to be unpopular with the States, would not succeed in either the party room or on the floor of the Senate. I can assure honourable senators on the Opposition side of the chamber that when matters which impinge unfairly or unfavourably upon one or more States are raised in the party room they are invariably consigned to the too-hard basket. The parliamentary Liberal Party has developed a sophisticated, competent and powerful committee system. The present Chairman of the Government members' committee chairmen group, Mr Giles, when he addressed the Australasian Study of Parliamentary Groups in Melbourne, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> These powers are, firstly, to screen and give approval or otherwise to all legislation prior to the introduction into the party room that occurs prior to its introduction into the Parliament. In many instances committee opinion has caused alteration to, and even elimination of, parts of major Bills. I believe action of this kind, exercised responsibly, improves legislation and is, therefore, helpful to governments in that they have the power of veto. </PARA>
<PARA> The system is a proper check and balance on Executive power and becomes more important than ever when hard decisions must be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee may recommend changes to legislation to the Minister either direct or via the joint party room. Such recommendations are usually accepted in one way or another before the Minister delivers the second reading speech. This might involve changes to the Bill itself, to the accompanying explanatory notes or to the Minister's speech. </PARA>
<PARA> As a commendable innovation the Prime Minister has directed that reports to the Government will have Government action taken on them within six months. </PARA>
<PARA>I bothered to quote Mr Giles at some length because the composition of the various committees is flexible and any member who wishes to join any committee proceedings is invariably very welcome. One can add that when a committee is discussing matters which may be of particular interest to any honourable member or honourable senator, that honourable member or honourable senator is welcome to attend the committee's hearings and express his views. One invariably finds that if a subject of relevance to any particular State is to be discussed honourable senators representing that State will attend and ensure that that State's interests are recorded. From the point of view of the Australian Labor Party, of course, the Senate may well no longer be a States House because ALP senators are unable to vote in the Senate to protect their States, even in the unlikely event that that be their wish. All their decisions are made in Caucus, which has an overwhelming number of House of Representatives members, and therefore the House of Representatives members naturally control the Caucus and the ALP senators. Of course, the great majority of the ALP House of Representatives members come from the larger States; so there is absolutely no protection by the ALP in the Senate of the less populous States such as Western Australia, in which the ALP holds three House of Representatives seats and, for the moment, four Senate positions. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of the Senate is littered with occasions on which the Senate has rejected or amended legislation because it has been contrary to the best interests of one or more States. For example, Odgers, in his book Australian Senate Practice, lists the 1939 Gold Tax Bill, the 1952 Land Tax Assessment Bill , the 1958 Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Power Bill, the 1968 Aerodrome ( Passenger Charges) Bill, the 1970 States receipts duties legislation and the 1973 Seas and Submerged Lands Bill, to mention but a few. Then, of course, we have the Constitution Alteration (Democratic Elections) Bill, the Constitution Alteration (Local Government Bodies) Bill, the Constitution Alteration (Mode of Altering the Constitution) Bill and the Interstate Commission Bill. In 1974 the Senate amended the Roads Grants Act and the National Roads Act to protect the rights of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> As recently as last May a number of honourable senators from Western Australia crossed the floor to vote against the Government on a matter which they believed was not in the best interests of Western Australia. The four honourable senators believed that the two-airline agreement was placing Western Australia at a disadvantage in creating artificially high air fares for Western Australian passengers. It would be a very brave Prime Minister and Cabinet that insisted on seeking to introduce into the Senate legislation that was offensive to the States. What better example do we need than the fate that befell the last Labor Prime Minister? It is not without significance to note the legislation that he had defeated in the Senate and the results that were cast upon his Government by the States of Western Australia, Queensland and Tasmania-the three smallest States that suffered most under his centralist and socialist policies. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1975 double dissolution the Liberal-Country Party gained 94 per cent of all House of Representative seats in those three States. In the same election Queensland succeeded in returning six conservative senators, Western Australia returned six Liberal Party senators and Tasmania returned five Liberal Party senators-a total of 17 for the Liberal-Country Party and a miserable 12 for the Australian Labor Party. If one looks at the general Senate voting pattern, particularly in recent years, when the process of centralisation of power to Canberra has developed momentum, one sees that almost without exception these smaller States have returned conservative senators who reflect the concern of their States for a State voice in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> It has also been argued that the founding fathers did not anticipate the development of the two-party system, but of course they did. One has only to read the records of constitutional debates to realise that the founding fathers realised that the substantial party system would develop and influence decisions within the Senate. They came from States that had Upper Houses and, quite naturally, there were political groupings in the various State chambers. That perception did not discourage them from the view that the Senate would function well in the role of a States house, which it has done. Alfred Deakin stated:</PARA>
<PARA> From the first day that the federation is consummated-heaven hasten that day- the people will divide themselves into two parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The instant federation is accomplished, the two Houses will be elected on that basis. State rights and State interests, I venture to say, will never be mentioned because they will never be imperilled. Both sides in order to secure support, will make the first plank of their platform the maintenance and defence of State interests. </PARA>
<PARA>He correctly identified the formation of a two-party system, even if he erred in believing that both sides would safeguard the States. There have been those, certainly on the Opposition side of the Senate, who have consistently argued that the founding fathers did not realise or expect that the provision they gave the Senate to reject or to defer Supply would ever be used. Anyone who bothers or cares to read the records of the various constitutional debates will well know that they certainly did. Mr Reid, a delegate from New South Wales, at the Adelaide convention in 1897, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I am prepared to give the Senate, not an antiquated power, never to be used, but a real power-the right of rejection. </PARA>
<PARA>The likely use of such a power was, of course, well debated. At the same convention, Deakin, in canvassing the causes and effects, made the following point:</PARA>
<PARA> If the Senate decides to take the important step of rejecting the financial policy of the Executive, what would happen? It would thus challenge the policy of the Government and the Government would consult the electors. This may be regarded as penalising them for introducing a measure in accordance with the views of the people. But if the Government is returned at the election, it will be clear that the policy of the Government is approved. I take it that the Council of the States--</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, he was referring to the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA>Will have fulfilled its office. </PARA>
<PARA>In response to an interjection asking whether he would give a second power of veto after a dissolution, he responded:</PARA>
<PARA> I am afraid the power of veto must remain absolute. </PARA>
<PARA>Here was a man from Victoria, who later became a Prime Minister of Australia, arguing for the power of the Senate to reject money Bills, realising that an election would result. The greatest single concern expressed by the founding fathers when debating the question of protection for the smaller States was that of financial discrimination. While, of course, safeguards are written into the Constitution protecting the individual States from the raising of discriminatory taxes for revenue, there is no such safeguard to prevent the Federal Government from discriminating in favour of one State against another in the expenditure of public funds. </PARA>
<PARA> It is absolutely inevitable that if the Senate lost its present powers economic considerations would be enormously influenced by the powerful voices of the eastern seaboard States. In other words, the very fears, concerns and apprehensions that the majority of founding fathers had when they agreed to draw up the Constitution would come to fruition. One does not have to be a cynical political observer to note that money is spent where the votes are, and the votes for either political party are in New South Wales and Victoria. Nothing has changed since Federation. In the first Parliament, New South Wales and Victoria returned almost twice as many members to the House of Representatives as all other States combined. There were 26 members elected from New South Wales , 23 from Victoria and only 26 from the rest of the Commonwealth. Today the ratio is still almost two to one, with 76 members elected from New South Wales and Victoria and 46 from the other States. Indeed, the current situation is that more members are returned from the greater metropolitan areas of Sydney and Melbourne in New South Wales and Victoria than from all the other States and Territories conbined. Metropolitan Sydney and Melbourne return 51 members and the whole of the smaller States and the two Territories return only 49 members. </PARA>
<PARA> Is there anyone who really seriously supports the view that the people of Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland are going to vote in a referendum for a constitutional alteration which frees the metropolitan members from Melbourne and Sydney from the constraints which the Senate can now exercise upon them? Now as never before, it is imperative that the States through their representatives in the Senate retain their power over money matters. There has, over a number of years, been a steady move of financial power to Canberra and the States have become, in many respects, mendicants. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been an increasing use of section 96 of the Constitution to make specific purpose-or tied-grants to the States, which if taken to excess could make the States agents of a government centred in Canberra. We have the introduction of the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Scheme which entitled local government bodies in the States to share in the personal income tax collections of the Commonwealth. The sum made available for distribution to local government as revenue sharing comprises a percentage-currently 2 per cent- of the total of all personal income tax collections by the Commonwealth in the preceding year. The Senate, as the States' representative, has a special interest in monitoring the fairness of the sums distributed to the States for local government purposes. We have the so-called 'spending power' of the Commonwealth, based on section 81 of the Constitution, the appropriation power, and section 61, the executive power, to enter fields of activity where Commonwealth legislative power may be limited. </PARA>
<PARA> I was helped in my consideration of this matter by a book edited by Senator Gareth Evans and entitled 'Labor and the Constitution 1972-1975', which was published in 1977. The chapter of particular help was chapter 2, 'Explorations and Adventures with Commonwealth Powers', written by Michael Crommelin and Gareth Evans. I am indebted to Mr Crommelin and the learned senator. I quote from pages 41 and 42 of their work:</PARA>
<PARA> A number of the Labor Government's programmes in the social welfare area relied upon the acceptance of a broad view of the spending power. The Australian Legal Aid Office, established upon an administrative basis without express legislative sanction other than the appropriation of the necessary funds, is a case in point . . . More significant in many respects, however, was the Australian Assistance Plan. It too was instituted upon an administrative basis, with no legislative support other than an item in the Appropriation Act (No. 1) 1974-75 which provided funds for its implementation. The essence of the AAP lay in its creation of regional councils with authority to assess the social welfare needs of people in the regions, and to apply federally-provided funds towards meeting such needs. The range of services administered by councils under the plan extended beyond the matters upon which the Commonwealth could legislate. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another aspect of this so-called 'spending power' of which I invite the Senate to take note. This involves the possible extension of Commonwealth powers in new areas not defined in the Constitution on the argument that such matters have become a valid and necessary discharge of the Commonwealth's national jurisdiction and which may be inappropriate to State responsibility. These are complex matters yet to be clearly resolved, but I project them because they are indicative of changing constitutional interpretation and areas in which , I believe, the Senate may ultimately be involved in the discharge of its checks and balances and the protection of the States' roles; and, to that end, the safeguarding of the Senate's amendment and veto powers is vital. If the power over money Bills were removed from the Senate, the smaller States would be totally and absolutely at the mercy of, and subject to the good graces and benevolence of, the larger States. There would, of course, be no checks and balances against the unbridled and unfettered power of the two major States in their distribution of judgment and wisdom. </PARA>
<PARA> I make no apology for standing here tonight vigorously defending the rights of the people of Western Australia. It is probably not generally known that the only reason Western Australia ever entered the Federation was the great influx of eastern States people into the Western Australian goldfields. In the few years immediately preceding Federation, the adult population of the colony had grown from about 24,000 to nearly 110,000, that increase being chiefly due to people coming from the eastern States to the Western Australian goldfields. Many thousands of them had never seen the capital city. They had no knowledge of Western Australia, its people or its conditions. Their relatives, friends and associates were in the eastern colonies. Theirs was a purely eastern States outlook. </PARA>
<PARA> The Premier of the day, Sir John Forrest, and his government took the view that the Bill for Federation should not be submitted to a vote of the people until there had been time for some sort of assimilation between the populations of the goldfields and the settled areas. The goldfields sent a delegation to London seeking separation from Western Australia in order that they might link up with the proposed Federation. The then Secretary of State for the Colonies, Mr Joseph Chamberlain, brought such great pressure to bear on the Western Australian Government that it agreed to submit the Bill to the people and to support it. In the few months preceding the taking of the vote, the number of names on the electoral roll was increased from 40,000 to more than 96,000. Notwithstanding support from Forrest and the Press, the settled portions of the State voted against it, but they were overwhelmed by the newcomers. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1906 the Western Australian State Government first voted to secede, and in 1933 the people of Western Australia voted by a majority of 3:1 to secede, and it was only following that call by the State of Western Australia upon the Imperial Parliament to allow it to withdraw from the Federation that the Commonwealth set up its Grants Commission to provide help for disadvantaged States. With such a record of disenchantment with the centralising of power in Canberra by Western Australia, there is no prospect of this Bill having any appeal to Western Australia or either of the other smaller States. I quote Sir John Cockburn who, in 1891, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> We know that the tendency is always to the centre, that the central authority constitutes a vortex which draws power to itself. Therefore, all the buttresses and all the ties should be the other way to enable the States to withstand the destruction of their powers by such absorption . . . Government at a central and distant point can never be government by the people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we are discussing the Constitution and attempts to update or reform it, it is a pity that the debate should yet again descend into pure partisanship. I believe that the Constitution provides us with a framework in which we are able to operate politically. In that sense, that framework ought to be, and I hope can be, the subject of dispassioned, detailed critical analysis, rather than some of the types of things that we have just heard. I agree with a number of the points that Senator Crichton-Browne raised, but I think that they were raised, unfortunately, within a context which makes most people feel not willing to listen to or to take heed of the various points that he was making throughout his speech. I would hope that in the continuation of the debate involved with the Constitution, the various members of political parties, although we disagree often quite violently in relation to policy matters, may come to a less acrimonious debate about the framework in which we must all work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill brought forward by Senator Evans on behalf of the Labor Party is an attempt to raise a number of the issues which are still here from 1975. I believe that the Labor Party has not succeeded in overcoming those problems, but that in a sense was to be expected. The events of 1975 are still very fresh in people's minds and it is unlikely that the final solution to the problems they raised will be reached within the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, it is useful to raise from time to time a debate on the Constitution under which we operate to see whether there is in the community at large some desire to alter a lot or a small part of the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne referred to the debates at the time of the founding of the Constitution and the intent of the provisions of the Constitution. I do not think anybody in this chamber would quibble with the points that he made. Certainly the intent on the part of the States was to limit as much as they could the powers of the central government. I for one am still very much inclined to that view. However, I do not necessarily agree that altering the balance of power between the central Houses would as a natural consequence mean that the powers of the Federal Parliament vis-a-vis the State parliaments would be raised or lowered. That is not a necessary consequence. It could be a consequence of some changes but not necessarily of any change. Therefore, I hope that we will be able to address ourselves to the particular changes that Senator Evans has raised and see whether the consequence of those changes would have the types of effects mentioned by Senator Crichton-Browne. We should not simply assume that any change must necessarily be detrimental. In a sense Senator Crichton-Browne put his finger on the issue when he pointed time and again to a conservative viewpoint. It is a conservative viewpoint to suggest that any change must necessarily be detrimental. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two main sections of this Bill. The first deals with the notion of a fixed term of parliament. I take up the point raised by Senator Chipp. In terms of the informal debate that has gone on about this Bill, it was probably initiated by Senator Hamer; but he can correct me if I am wrong. That point is that in sheer political terms it makes eminent sense to disentangle any changes that we wish to make to the Constitution and to present to the people for their final deliberate vote, one item for one vote, so that they can pick and choose the items they wish to change. Unfortunately in this Bill two fairly major changes still remain, even given the amendments that Senator Evans has foreshadowed he will be moving at the Committee stage to his own Bill. Those changes are, firstly, the notion of introducing a fixed term and, secondly, the changing in some way of the powers of the Senate in relation to appropriation and taxation measures. I must say that I am inclined to the view that Senator Hamer has been putting informally that it makes sense for us to look at one item and one item only so that we can raise it for debate and talk about it in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to raise a purely technical point. The Constitution, in the way in which it is brought forward, and the Referendum (Constitution Alteration) Act of 1906 stipulate quite clearly that the question that is to be proposed to the people for their vote is: 'Do you approve of the proposed law for the alteration of the Constitution entitled . . . ?' The title of the proposed law is inserted there. If Senator Evans's original Bill were to be carried, that insertion would then read: 'An Act to alter the Constitution in relation to the duration of the House of Representatives, the holding of elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives, disagreement between the Houses with respect to the proposed laws and the appointment and the termination of the appointment of Ministers of state'. I submit that that is not in the ultimate a fair proposal to put to the people. I believe it would be much fairer if all the questions were placed on a ballot paper-for example, the ballot paper in my hand which is a sample of the ballot paper that is distributed at any referndum-in such a way that there were separate questions so that one may vote Yes to a fixed term, No to alterations to section 53 and No to alterations to the provisions for the appointment of Ministers of state. That would seem to me to be a fairer and more democratic procedure in terms of permitting the widest possible intervention of the people in the operation of their own Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is unfortunate that the Bill seeks to encompass a wide range of questions that are linked. I think Senator Evans has made the point in one or other of the speeches he has made so far in relation to this Bill-that there is a link between them. That linkage, while being of some substance, is not so strong as to enable them to be considered separately to enable people to take opposing viewpoints in relation to each of the propositions. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also point out that what we are debating here is an Act which will seek by way of referendum to put a proposal to the people. In that sense our debates and our points are made in a hypothetical way. The Bill is not for an Act in the sense of the other Bills which we deliberate and vote upon here. It is one which says: 'Should the people have the right to have their voice made known on this matter?' I hope that honourable senators participating in this debate will take that view. We are saying: 'Should the people be allowed to have a voice on this point at this time? In a sense it would be quite open for any honourable senator to vote for this Bill and to go out into the electorate and campaign against it because it would be open to that person to say: 'I support totally the view that people ought to have the right to make a comment on this very vexed question but I do not believe in these very provisions'. That would be a perfectly reasonable proposition for an honourable senator to put. So I hope that in the ensuing debate we will be able to deal with this Bill more at the level of whether we consider these are appropriate measures to be put to the people. I have already raised one point in relation to that, and that is the way the questions are put to the people. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the proposal as to fixed terms. I think the substance of the amendments that have been foreshadowed by Senator Evans present us with a firmer viewpoint about a fixed term. Indeed, the amendments of Senator Evans actually do provide for a fixed term, rather than the rolling triennium proposed in his original Bill. They do subscribe, I think, to the generally held view that people in the community have that a fixed term is something similar to the fixed term that we know exists in the United States or the fixed term that we know about in terms of our local government system. Therefore, I think it is better for the general community understanding of what fixed terms are about to have it couched in terms that are readily acceptable or are already operational within the governmental system in Australia. I would support the foreshadowed amendments of Senator Evans because I believe they are a better proposition and a fairer proposition to put to the people in that they accord with what the people understand to be the position concerning fixed terms. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the supporting arguments revolving around fixed terms, I think we are again in some difficulty. Basically, constitutions provide the framework in which we operate. They cannot ultimately circumscribe either for good or for bad the way in which people work. Constitutions are not able to make evil people good or good people evil. In that sense it is very difficult to frame constitutions in such a way as to prevent every possible evil that one could imagine being visited on a parliamentary system. Constitutions must be couched in as simple terms as possible and should be of fairly wide application. I believe that in this respect our Constitution is a good model. The framework involved in a fixed term parliament would mean-certainly I hope it would mean- that parliamentarians might be able to take a more dispassionate view of the material that comes before them because there is built into our system another element of continuity and stability. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe, nor I presume does Senator Crichton-Browne as he did not allude to it in his speech, there is any reference in the fixed term element to any destabilisation between the Senate and the House of Representatives. This new proposal does not in any way affect the relationship between the two Houses. The item that we are talking about here does not affect the terms of senators. The original Bill did but this does not. The Bill does not create a nexus, as the original Bill did. It leaves it entirely open for a situation such as occurred in 1975 to occur again. There would be nothing to prevent that 1975 situation from occurring again if the fixed term element were brought in by itself. The Senate could do what it did in 1975. The House of Representatives would be as impotent as it was in 1975 to respond in any way to the initiative of the Senate. The final wash-up of that situation could be anybody's guess. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not really want to debate that interpretation of history. The point is that the relationship is not disturbed by this Bill unless we take into consideration the additional element in the changes which concern the Governor-General. Of itself the fixed term will not do anything, but the hope is that if there is a fixed term it will create a context of stability in political terms. May I pursue that argument a little. The Senate or, according to Senator Missen, the House of Representatives, in another 1975 situation would find itself with very little time left because the provision states that if a special election were held between the normal dates then the government which came in would have only the rest of that term to serve. This provision is included in many constitutions. The operation of those constitutions seems to have the effect that governments do not wish to take people to an election if there is only a short space of time left in which the incoming government might serve. In other words, there is an added political weight to look at what one is doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Senate in those circumstances wanted to take it through, if the reprehensible circumstances were present-and were truly reprehensible-there would be absolutely no reason why it could not be pushed to the final situation that was reached in 1975. In this context there would be a further political reason to think about the action. I believe that is a useful added element. It does not remove any powers; it does not take away any powers of the Senate. But it would add an additional worry for the Senate because the Senate in itself would not be able to force the government to the polls under the provisions of Senator Evans's Bill because he has introduced an additional element-that is, the Governor-General's powers. </PARA>
<PARA> Under Senator Evans's proposals the Senate would not be able to force the government to the polls since the Governor-General would not have any powers to dismiss it unless the government lost the confidence of the House of Representatives. As one remembers, that was not the case in 1975. The House of Representatives still had confidence in the Whitlam Government. I think the additional questions that the Senate must direct its attention to are: First, does it support the notion of a fixed term and, secondly, does it support the idea of limiting the Governor-General's powers? They are distinct items and have to be dealt with in a separate fashion. Either of them can stand on its merits and we can have one without the other. I would ask that honourable senators vote quite deliberately and not simply throw out everything because they dislike some parts of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major element concerns the ordinary annual services of the Government . Basically this is dealt with in sections 53 and 54 of the Constitution. On 13 May 1965 the then Treasurer, Mr Holt, issued a document which came to be known as the 1965 compact. It dealt with the way Bills are put together as they come into the Senate, particularly the Appropriation and Supply Bills. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it was an agreement with senators. There was a committee formed which comprised only government members. I believe that the practice laid down then has served the Parliament well in the time that it has operated. However, if we look at Odgers's Australian Senate Practice, we see that there were a number of occasions, particularly in 1973, on which this practice was seemingly not observed. In 1973 there was a range of problems, some of which were raised in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. I do not want to rehearse that area, but I believe we need to look now at that element and we need to go further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Evans in his amendments has not been able to overcome the problem. I have suggested an amendment to section 54 which would enable the High Court of Australia to involve itself in the whole problem of tacking. I understand Senator Evans's proposition. I believe it flows from his basic philosophical proposition. I do not believe that he did disagree with Senator Crichton-Browne that ultimately the disappearance of this chamber would to him be of some political consolation, if not joy. I do not think he has made any bones about that. I think he has also said in the interim that he is seeking to raise particular points and possibly change some points. I believe he is seeking to take more than the Senate and probably the population of Australia are looking for at this point. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned in terms of his proposed amendments to section 53 inasmuch as I believe they would enable a government to include in the ordinary annual services Bill any material which it wished to pass without the consent of the Senate. I do not believe that any of the amendments proposed by Senator Evans would provide a remedy against this. In fact, I believe that any government could pass any or all Bills into law simply by tacking them on to the ordinary annual appropriations. Provided that the government has also at least the compliance of the Governor-General-if not the support of the Governor-General-in this activity there would not be much difficulty in arranging its own affairs in such a way as to take advantage of the provisions. I suggest to Senator Evans that from his party viewpoint he consider whether, if these provisions were now in operation, the current Government would take immediate advantage of them and arrange its matters so as to avoid any problems whatsoever with a Senate in which it currently does not have a majority. I think, from his partisan viewpoint, he may even believe that the current Government would be able to take advantage of that, and would probably do so. Again, from a partisan point of view, I believe that when the Australian Labor Party came to power it would in turn make precisely the same use of those powers. The Australian Democrats do not really feel that that would in any way rescue the Senate from becoming merely an interesting but rather outmoded talking shop. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with Senator Crichton-Browne that the preservation of the powers of the Senate is of vital importance. That is why I must say that I was very upset by his speech. It is possible to be a very strong supporter of decentralisation, a very strong supporter of getting powers away from a centralist government and a very strong supporter of State rights. Indeed, as the only person in this Senate who has argued constantly for additional States in this country, I say that on all of those bases it is still possible to give attention to the Bill that Senator Evans has brought down and pick and choose one's way through it to see whether or not there are within it items which would improve the operation of the constitutional framework while not attacking the powers of the Senate or disturbing the status quo in relation to the distribution of powers as between the central government and the States. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that Senator Evans will take in good faith the propositions that other honourable senators are putting forward. At least from my political conviction I believe quite strongly in lesser powers at this level and more powers at the State level. I am on record as saying that and will continue to work for it, but I am looking at the question of trying to remove if at all possible-and gaining a majority within the community to support such an event if at all possible-some of the problems of our constitution. I believe that when one reads closely the debates of the constitutional conventions prior to Federation it will be seen that those who took part in the debates had a very clear view that there would be changes in the future. I suggest that honourable senators re-read the debates on the last section of the constitution in relation to referenda. There they will see clearly that everyone at those conventions knew that there would be changes. I believe that the participants would have welcomed the notion that from time to time the people of this country, operating as one people, would see that their best interests lay in modifying and changing the constitutional framework under which their democratic government operated. That seems to me to express something of the substance of a country which is alive, growing and well . We should always welcome and indeed support those who come forward with such propositions. We need not necessarily have to vote or even campaign for them, but I believe that we should give them our support in raising these matters as an item on the political agenda. That is why I believe that every honourable senator ought at least to welcome the opportunity to have this debate. I hope they will also support the notion that the people of Australia should be able to make their voices heard on these particular issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The more detailed elements we will obviously have to work through when we come to the Committee stage of the Bill which unfortunately probably will not be reached today. In a sense I am not disappointed with that because it enables the debate to continue not only here but also in the community and I hope, on this particular element, within the Constitutional Convention. I am sure that those honourable senators who are members of that committee will take up the ideas that have been raised in debates here and use them as a starting point from which to look again at this matter, which must continue to be on the political agenda until a satisfactory resolution is achieved. Such resolutions, as has been decreed by the Constitution, will not be attained until we have almost unanimity concerning it. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the plea that we not approach this matter on a party basis. Quite frankly, I could not care less who introduced the Bill. It does not stand or fall by the person who introduces it or the party to which that persons belongs. It must stand or fall upon its merits for the governance of this country. It should not stand or fall because it is attached, so to speak, to a particular person who belongs to a particular political party. I ask every honourable senator at least to vote in the way in which Senator Crichton-Browne was talking about, and that is as individuals from their States looking at their Constitution. </PARA>

Presumably it will have to be taken up at some time next week. It might be worth reminding the Senate that Senator Evans introduced this Bill a few weeks ago with what I might say was uncharacteristic mildness. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) opposed the Bill root and branch, though he did float the idea of the desirability of having a four-year parliament, a proposition with which I entirely agree, but it is irrelevant to this debate because no such proposal is before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Missen incorporated a speech which pointed out the merits of a fixed term for parliament and the disadvantages of some of the other proposals in Senator Evans's Bill. I entirely agree with those remarks made at the time by the honourable senator. Senator Lewis spoke strongly against the whole concept of a fixed term for parliament. In my view, Senator Evans's Bill deals principally with two quite separate issues: A fixed term for the House of Representatives-the Senate has a fixed term already-and the separate issue as to whether the Senate's power over money Bills should be removed. These are not interlocking proposals. One could quite easily have one without the other. My party is firmly against the removal or emasculation of the Senate's power over money Bills. In any case, there is no chance of such a proposal passing this chamber. Even if, by some extraordinary chance, it was put to the people it would certainly be rejected by them in a referendum. It is a pity that it is in the Bill because it distracts attention from the question of fixed terms for both Houses of Parliament, which is not a party matter. </PARA>

I am sure that the proposal to remove the Senate's powers over money Bills has no chance of being passed in a referendum. The question of a fixed term for Parliament is not a subject on which the Liberal Party has a policy. We did have a parliamentary party committee look into it some time ago. It was divided on the issue. I understand the majority of its members were in favour. However, the committee made no formal report to the party as a whole and we have never established a policy on it, but for that reason I believe that we should be prepared to discuss it with an open mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What are the advantages of a fixed term for the House of Representatives? I am very surprised that the biggest advantage-that it solves the problem of holding simultaneous elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives-has not yet been mentioned in this debate. This problem occurs when the House of Representatives is dissolved earlier than 30 June of the year prior to the expiration of the next Senate term. The consequent separate Senate elections-and there have been four since 1949-infuriate the public and are a needless expense and irritation. Everyone, or almost everyone, accepts that this situation must be cured. Governments of both political complexions have attempted to amend the Constitution-in 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1977-by changing the term of a senator to two terms of the House of Representatives. I said then and I repeat now that I thought this was the wrong solution to a difficult problem. Instead of bringing senators' terms into line with those of the House of Representatives, we should have planned to bring the House of Representatives terms into line with ours. In any case, the first option has been twice rejected by the voters at referendums. Surely we should look very seriously at the other way of solving this problem. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but it was rejected. It did not receive a majority of the States. A second advantage of a fixed term for the House of Representatives is that it removes uncertainty-a point made by Senator Chipp. For at least 12 months before the due date of an election for the House of Representatives, there is speculation about the possibility of an early election. The uncertainty does very great harm to business planning and business confidence and, thus, to all of us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third advantage of the fixed term is that it removes from the Prime Minister the archaic and undesirable power of shortening the term of the House of Representatives at his whim. There is a great deal of humbug talked about this. It is represented as being a key feature of responsible government. Walter Bagehot, who flourished more than 100 years ago, is produced as evidence. But responsible government has evolved a lot since Bagehot's day. The development of party discipline has had a dramatic effect. What we should be looking at is what the situation in Australia is now and is likely to be in the future, not what it was in England in 1850. </PARA>
<PARA> Why would a Prime Minister want to dissolve the House of Representatives early? I am not talking about when he has lost the confidence of the House or when there is a deadlock with the Senate. These are separate issues which I will come to in a moment. But I submit that the reason a Prime Minister would want to dissolve the House early would be because he thinks he would do better in an election if it were held immediately than if the Parliament runs its full term. I know of nothing in the theory or practice of responsible government that makes this a necessary or desirable power. </PARA>
<PARA> It is claimed also that it may be necessary for a Prime Minister to dissolve the House so that he can seek a mandate for a controversial course of action. This is the purest humbug. A Prime Minister does not go to the people for a mandate-for the people to express an opinion-unless he is quite sure what the outcome will be. No, the only reason a Prime Minister would dissolve the Parliament saying he was seeking a mandate would be if he were confident that he had a popular issue and would gain three years more power. Again, I know of nothing in the theory or practice of responsible government that makes this a necessary power or a desirable power. </PARA>
<PARA> What arguments are there against fixed term parliaments? As I have said, this is not a matter on which we have a party attitude. But two Liberals, Senator Lewis and the Attorney-General, have spoken strongly against the idea. I think I have to meet these arguments although, of course, as they are colleagues, I will do it mildly and courteously. However, I am confident that if I can show-as I am sure I can-that their premises are inaccurate and their reasoning faulty, they may agree with me that their conclusions are wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lewis said that the effect of the Bill would be to cripple representative government by taking away the powers of the House of Representatives and advanced a series of propositions to justify that statement. Unfortunately, all of them are wrong or irrelevant. For instance, Senator Lewis suggested that, with fixed terms, responsible government could be negated by the House of Representatives removing one government and installing another without the electorate being consulted. This is true, if the new government could gain a vote of confidence from the House. But it is exactly the same as the present situation, witness the change of Prime Minister in 1971 or the change of governments in 1916 and 1941. No one suggests that these negated responsible government. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lewis is under the impression that 'under the present Constitutional arrangements, a government from which the confidence of the House has been withdrawn may go to an election regardless of whether the House has expressed its confidence in an alternative government'. This is just not true as anyone with a knowledge of our constitutional history will be aware. Senator Lewis went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The inevitable consequences of a fixed term for the Senate and a fixed term for the House of Representatives, so far as practical politics are concerned, would be that the Executive would become totally supreme at the expense of the Parliament. We would have an elected dictatorship. There would not be the slightest doubt about that. The Government would serve its term, whether it be for three years or four years, regardless of its behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA>I should have thought that this was the present situation. I do not see what fixed terms would do to change that. In support, Senator Lewis advanced a curious proposition. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the United States of America where there is a fixed term government. Let me remind the Senate that the United States people had to wait four and a half years after Watergate before they had an opportunity at the ballot box to express their views about the Republican Government. Surely that was a reprehensible action but there was no way the Congress-do not worry about the people-could get rid of that Government. The Congress could not cope with the situation. The result of a fixed term would be that the executive government would reign supreme. </PARA>
<PARA>Almost every statement there is false. There was a presidential and congressional election six months after Watergate and Nixon later resigned rather than face impeachment by Congress. So much for the American people having no power or for Congress being unable to act! I mentioned this because it is typical of the false base on which the case against fixed term parliaments has been constructed. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lewis claimed also that a fixed election date might be awkward. As he put it:</PARA>
<PARA> The fixing of particular days for elections in the Constitution has the disadvantage that it is impossible to avoid holding an election during some temporary internal or external crisis or at the same time as some other event. The reasons for wishing to vary the election date may be relatively mundane, for example, to avoid the day of a State election or a celebratory event-or highly significant, for example, to avoid a period of civil disturbance or international crisis. </PARA>
<PARA>As a matter of fact, it is almost as difficult to avoid awkward dates if a Prime Minister has to choose a date a couple of months ahead. Although I do not want to make too much of it, I have checked what happened on the third Saturday in November every third year from 1903 onwards and on none of those dates, or in the weeks before, was there anything which would have made an election inappropriate. On the other hand, selection by the Prime Minister of the election date resulted in one remarkable fiasco. In 1914, the election campaign spanned the outbreak of World War I and we had no effective government at the critical time. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, both Senator Lewis and the Attorney-General postulated a scarcely believable scenario in the House of Representatives. It went like this:</PARA>
<PARA> The minority faction of the majority party may decline to pass a motion of no confidence, while at the same time joining with the opposition to frustrate major elements of the government's policies. It has been said that no group of members could be so irresponsible. But such a faction may have politically respectable reasons for such a course of action, and may say, for instance: 'We do not want the present Government to be turned out of office; we wish it to carry out parts of its policy which are valuable, and we do not want the Opposition to gain office. But we will prevent the Government from carrying out those parts of its policy which we regard as not in the best interests of the country. Under the present constitutional arrangements a government in such a situation would be able to appeal to the electorate to give it a more co- operative majority in the House. In the past, considering all those jurisdictions which have responsible government, governments have often exercised this right of appeal, and successfully. Under this Bill a weak and debilitated government could be kept in office till the end of its appointed term, unable to carry out its major policies, and unable to resolve the situation. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that scenario is so unlikely that it is scarcely worth providing for. But if it were taken seriously it would be easy to cope with it by providing that the Government could declare any Bill a vote of confidence whose defeat would set in motion the dissolution process. It must not be thought that elections following government loss of control of the House are likely to be frequent. This happened only once in our 82 year history-in 1929. I hope I have made it clear that the intellectual foundation for the Opposition to the fixed term parliament is on very shaky ground indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General is quite right to point out that the term of the House of Representatives will not be absolutely fixed. There are two circumstances under which it might be shortened by the Bill we are considering. The first is where no government can be formed which possesses the confidence of the House. I point out that this has happened only once in our 81-year constitutional history. Senator Evans has codified our present conventions and I have not heard any criticisms of this code. This Bill will mean that the consequence of a government not being able to command the confidence of the House will be an election of the House of Representatives only for the balance of the unexpired fixed term. I repeat that this would be a very rare occurrence, particularly as the short term would be a very strong disincentive to the representatives forcing such an election-a point I think Senator Macklin made a few minutes ago.</PARA>
<PARA> The second circumstance in which the fixed term may be shortened would be if there were a deadlock between the two Houses. Under the present rules both Houses would be dissolved. I understand that the proposal now is that the term for representatives and short term senators be for the balance of the unexpired fixed term. I would have preferred the new start date for the three and six-year parliamentary terms to be the date of the double dissolution election. I think the government which has control of the date could be relied on not to choose an inconvenient date. This would be a much simpler amendment to the Constitution. I do not propose to press this point in the Committee stage because even if this Bill is passed by the Senate it will certainly go through much reconsideration and revision before being put to the people. This point might well be looked at then. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General has pointed out that the average length of parliaments since Federation has been 2.4 years. If the Bill before us is adopted this length would be increased. But, even more important, the problem of simultaneous elections would be solved. The Attorney-General, as I said, also floated the idea of four-year parliaments. I am sure this would be better than the present arrangements, the average length of parliaments being 2.4 years, but I do not think an eight-year term for senators could possibly survive a referendum. In any case, it is a different issue which does not deal with the problems about which I am concerned-simultaneous elections for two houses, removal of the unnecessary business uncertainty in the months before the due date for a House of Representatives election and removal of the undesirable power of a Prime Minister to call elections that are timed to suit his political advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand Senator Evans is removing one unfortunate provision from his Bill. That provision concerns the idea of a joint sitting as an alternative to a double dissolution as a means of resolving a deadlock. This was only a not too subtle way of ensuring the dominance of the House of Representatives. It is merely an irritant in this context and should be discussed separately, if at all . I hope I have made it clear that if we can clear away the partisan rubbish, the emasculation of the Senate, there is a central idea here-the idea of fixed term parliaments and how they might work-which is worth serious consideration on non-party lines. </PARA>
<PARA> I think in these circumstances I should make it quite clear how I intend to vote. I will not be voting in favour of the second reading of this Bill. It has too much that I disagree with for me to vote for it. I will be abstaining which will, if my calculation is correct, ensure that it will pass and go to the Committee stage. In the Committee stage I will oppose all the provisions, whatever merits it might be argued they have, which would reduce the power of the Senate. I will not be doing that necessarily on their merits but because I think they have no place in this particular Bill and will merely ensure the defeat of what I think is a good proposition. If they have all been suitably removed in the Committee stage I will be prepared to support the third reading of the Bill which, as I am sure all concerned are aware, requires 33 votes, an absolute majority of the number of senators. Those are my intentions and that I will do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been said that politics is the art of compromise. I dare say that this Bill, the Constitution Alteration (Fixed Term Parliaments) Bill 1981, therefore is a very political Bill. It is not designed to advantage any political party in particular and is really only a second choice of each of the political parties. It is not intended to expunge what has occurred in the past but it is planned and will provide for a far more stable political future if it is carried. In 1975 the Australian Labor Party took a very important decision after the events which occurred on 11 November and that was to continue to support the democratic option in this country. In spite of the behaviour of and, in my view, the collusion between the then Governor- General and Chief Justice, we made a decision to stay within the normal traditional political processes. There were those in the Labor Party and supporters outside the Party who believed that the Labor Party had all the odds stacked against it and that it should no longer participate in the traditional political processes. There were those who advocated a general strike. The Labor leader at the time, Mr Whitlam, and the leader of the trade union movement, Bob Hawke, opted for continuing in the traditional Australian political process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If Australian democracy is to survive I think that more than just 50 per cent of the community will need to say that they want that particular system. We have already got a very shonky electoral system. It is enough to disillusion many people that we can have fair elections in this country. When the next time the events of 1975 occur, whenever they occur, we cannot guarantee that the disadvantaged group, the group that is thrown out of power, will say: 'Yes, this democratic process is all right'. I believe that the Labor Party has as much right as any other party to govern in this country. I am not sure that that view is shared by some of those honourable senators opposite. I am not going into the cliches of the born-to-rule mentality or anything else but the Labor Party has as much right as any other political party to rule in this country for the term for which it was elected. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very important that the whole of the Australian community supports the democratic process mainly on the grounds of stability as a much abused word. I noticed that in the Tasmanian elections one of the candidates, an Australian Democrat, by the name of Norman Sanders, continually advocated instability as a wonderful thing. I am not sure that the Australian Democrats here would necessarily support him all the way in that philosophy because the sort of instability he wants is some sort of political anarchy where a clown prince like himself can become the king. There is a strong case for stability and it is not necessarily a conservative argument. We on the more radical side of politics acknowledge that stability brings benefits to the citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot remember the name of the economist who made economic projections in the 1940s and compared Australia with Argentina but at the time that comparison was made it was thought that Australia and Argentina would follow similar economic courses. We have a stable economic system and we have developed, whilst not necessarily a perfect growth rate at the moment, a reasonable economic growth rate and a reasonable standard of employment and so on. Argentina, through an instable political system, has had a series of juntas. It has a 100 per cent inflation rate. It has terrorism and secret police-all the sorts of things that we do not want in Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is important if people in future are going to believe in the legitimacy of government in this country. This Bill aims to remove the various grounds for discord that may exist in future. I should like to look at some of the main provisions of the Bill although, because they have been covered in detail previously, I will not spend much time on them. Essentially, members of the House of Representatives and the Senate will be elected for fixed terms every three years. There is always the possibility, given some sort of bipartisan approach, that we can extend that period to four years once we resolve the problem of how long the term for senators should be. The actual date proposed in the Bill for elections to be held on the third Thursday in November I think has been given a lot of consideration. It would allow a government to get its Budget through that session. Indeed, it would act as an incentive to get the Budget through reasonably quickly every three years. If that proves difficult, I do not see any great problem in having the Budget introduced in the autumn session and presented some time in May. In fact, I think there would be some positive economic advantages in doing that. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hamer made some interesting remarks and said that he could not find any problems associated with elections being held on the third weekend in November. Certainly from Victoria's point of view the grand final is over, the Melbourne Cup is over and the cricket and tennis have not started. Indeed, we would have the advantage that we could even tell when the Morgan poll would be leaked and on what day the stock exchange was going to collapse so that everyone would have advance notice of when to sell their shares. There do not seem to be any disadvantages in the date. It is an arbitrary one to some extent, and I dare say if it proved ineffective we could discuss a better one. We have indicated that for a variety of reasons we are amending the Bill to allow not for a restoration of a three-year cycle but for a Parliament, if it is dissolved, to serve out the remaining term. The crucial thing for the Labor Party-obviously it has not received acceptance throughout the chamber-is section 53 of the Constitution. In a spirit of accord and compromise, in which Senator Evans has so dexterously approached this matter, we initially proposed that the Senate have no powers over money or Supply Bills. We have come to the situation where we want only to nominate one money Bill to be certified as the key Bill that cannot be rejected by the Senate. I think that goes a long way to solving some of the problems of 1975, as well as some possible future ones.</PARA>
<PARA> The problem raised by Senator Macklin of tacking on measures, I would have thought could have been dealt with by proper draftsmanship. It is unlikely that we will get Liberal support for that proposal. The reason-this is only my interpretation-is that it goes to the very core of the existence of this chamber . A variety of reasons have been put as to why the Senate exists. Some people assert that it is to represent the States. Other people assert that it is to review legislation. Recently, a more common and major reason put forward for its existence is its excellent committee system. I believe that the Senate, as it is now composed-not intended-exists to frustrate the will of a future Australian Labor government. The reality of history is that Labor does not rule in this country in long bursts. The likelihood is that every time it comes to power because of the separate terms of the two Houses, with the Senate being elected for six years, it will face a conservative majority in the Senate. I think the whole attitude of those opposite is dominated by that thought and by the belief that the Senate will be a useful tool to frustrate a government. The principle applies not only in this area; it also applies in my State of Victoria. I think that is also the main role for the Victorian Legislative Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The reluctance of the Australian Democrats to accept our views on section 53 of the Constitution is, I think, very much a function of their political existence. It is very unlikely that in future they will be represented in the House of Representatives, therefore this is the chamber where they can have a say. I understand their reluctance to cede any powers from this institution, which is the one institution in which they have a say. We have ceded some ground on section 57 in giving up our proposal for holding a joint sitting to resolve deadlocks between Houses. The mathematics is that if any political party had a major win in the House of Representatives it would effectively silence any expression of attitude from the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also codified the powers of the Governor-General, and I think this is a very important step forward. If we have reserve powers for the Governor-General but do not specify what they are and leave the discretion in the hands of the Governor-General, instead of picking a citizen to fulfil the job who has all sorts of admirable qualities, there will be no choice left for a future Labour government except to appoint a lackey, someone who will just do the bidding of the Prime Minister's at the time. He may be a person of very little talent, but if the main criterion for the appointment of a Governor-General is to be his loyalty to the existing government that will debase the office. It is essential that in some way we codify the powers of the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, almost as an aside, in the Bill we give some recognition to the fact that there are Prime Ministers and Ministers of state mentioned in the Constitution. As I said before, this Bill is a compromise proposal. The essence of the fixed term proposal is essentially a trade-off between the Senate and the Executive. The Senate loses its undemocratic power to force the Government to the polls and in turn the Executive cedes its undemocratic power to stage elections just for electoral advantage. I think the most recent example of that in a Federal context concerned Menzies in 1963. The most recent Labor example was with Wran in 1978. He went to the election a year early just for electoral advantage. We do not believe that power should exist.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will always retain certain advantages. If it cannot pick the election date it still has the advantage of being able to pork-barrel electorates. It has the advantage of staff. I think there is no way we can completely restrict the advantages governments have going into elections. I think we will go a long way if we remove the timing aspect. If this is adopted the power of the House of Representatives to form and unform governments will be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> The advantage of this proposal, as I see it, is that the House of Representatives is confirmed as the House where governments are formed. The reality is that people make their choice of government when they vote for the House of Representatives. There is no doubt about that. I think that most honourable senators on the other side of the chamber will concede that. The Senate is accepted for what it is. It is not the House where a government is formed. In my view, the Senate is intended to examine and respond to a government's legislative program, not to determine whether that government continues in office. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal-National Country Party senators were elected, I believe, to enhance the legislative work of their colleagues in the House of Representatives. That is a political reality of today. They do this partly through their ministerial representation in the Senate. We, as Labor senators, were elected to fulfil the same relationship with our colleagues in the House of Representatives. It is also clear that the Australian Democrat senators and Senator Harradine were elected to fulfil a different function. There is no question of people voting for them in terms of trying to form a government. They were elected to contribute amendments or new proposals and to scrutinise Bills, regardless of whether the government was an Australian Labor Party government or a coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been several speeches by Liberal Party members opposing this matter. Probably the most cogent speech was that made by Senator Lewis. I intend to examine some of those arguments. Senator Lewis, in the Australian on 26 November 1981, said of the proposal:</PARA>
<PARA> It gives a government three years in which to do virtually anything it chooses- legislative or otherwise-untrammelled by responsibility to the people through their elected representatives in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>That raises the question of what is a government, what is an Executive and what is a Cabinet. In my view a government, when it comes down to it, is a committee of a majority of the House of Representatives. Given that view, one has to ask oneself whether fixed term legislation would mean that a government no longer needs a majority in the House of Representatives. The answer is no. One also has to ask oneself whether fixed term legislation would mean that the Senate could no longer subject legislation to scrutiny and, in most cases, reject it if it so wishes. Again the answer is no. Senator Lewis continued:</PARA>
<PARA>the Cabinet . . . should be able to seek the views of the electorate if at any time its majority is lost through party splits, or the withdrawal of minor-party support. </PARA>
<PARA>This did not happen in 1975. Quite clearly, this Bill is designed to avert those circumstances occurring again. In the past an existing government has lost its majority. In 1916 Billy Hughes was able to get a majority in the House. In 1941 John Curtin did the same thing. In 1931, when neither Scullin nor Lyons or anyone else could get that majority after the Beasley-Ward rats deserted the Labor Party, we had to go to an election. If we had a fixed term then the situation would have been that if there had been a no confidence motion in the Scullin government and the Governor-General had called Lyons he would not have been able to get a majority in the House and we would have had an election. The point Senator Lewis has made does not have any validity. Similar sorts of circumstances arose before 1910. </PARA>
<PARA> Further Liberal party myths have been raised by Senator Lewis. For example, he said that the legislation's result would be a de facto one-House parliament and that the House could be totally dominated by the Ministry and the bureaucracy. Is that any different from what occurs today? Whether that happens has nothing to do with a fixed term or anything else. If one wants to enhance the power of Parliament over the Executive, I suggest that other measures may be more attractive. It has really got nothing to do with a fixed term of parliament. One of the basic objections raised by Senator Lewis is that the sole purpose is to advantage the Executive government to the detriment of the Parliament. I wonder how one can distinguish between a government and a majority in the House of Representatives. In my view, the two should have absolute confidence in each other. </PARA>
<PARA> A further Liberal Party furphy raised by Senator Lewis is that the Government would also give up its right to seek, if it wished, a mandate from the people to make fundamental changes to policy. Senator Hamer's rebuttal of that point was not only amusing but also very biting. When has any government actually done that? It is in fact a euphemism for the opportunistic calling of early elections for short term advantages. Surely it is the role of the people's representatives in the House of Representatives to judge any fundamental changes in government policy as they did in 1916, 1931 and 1941. Senator Lewis continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Why not openly seek any desired proposals for change, instead of following a devious path . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose it is a rather left-handed compliment to Senator Evans to imply that he has brought in a rather devious Bill that does not confront the issues head on. I think we have to understand that what we are seeking here is a consensus and agreement by the major parties for something that is vital for Australia's future. In my view the greatest and most outrageous statement issued by Senator Lewis was when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The people's forum is to be attacked, to have its powers reduced, in the name of 'reform'. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view the Senate is not the people's forum; it never has been and it never will be. The Senate is not the House where government is formed. Because of that supreme fact, the primary reason for Parliament itself, the Senate can only ever be a secondary House subsidiary to the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several arguments that can be brought to bear to prove that this chamber is not the people's forum. Unlike the House of Representatives, the Senate does not even pretend to have one vote one value. There is a fantastic example of malapportionment which gives a Tasmanian vote ten times the value of one cast in New South Wales. Yet in 1980, 2,717,858 formal votes were cast in New South Wales compared with 243,838 in Tasmania. Using New South Wales as the grossest case of under-representation the other States are over-represented as follows: Victoria by 33.2 per cent; Queensland by 134.8 per cent; South Australia by 269.1 per cent; Western Australia by 331.1 per cent; and Tasmania by 1,014.6 per cent. If New South Wales is fairly to have 10 senators what would be the representation in the other States? Victoria would have 7 1/2 senators, Queensland 4 1/4, South Australia 2 2/3, Western Australia 2 1/3 and Tasmania 9/ 10 of a senator. I am suggesting that the Senate should have representation according to the number of electors. I am suggesting that it is not a people's House. This is the point made by Senator Lewis. Here there is no 5 per cent or 10 per cent variation; we are talking about a 1,000 per cent variation. The reality is that we have States' misrepresentation. </PARA>
<PARA> The only argument that can be put up in the Senate's defence effectively destroys the myth that the Senate is a States' House. People argue that party allegiances from State to State means that in practice these disparities cancel themselves out. For example, New South Wales and Tasmania each elect four Australian Labor Party senators and four Liberal party senators as a base figure . What does it matter? All this proves is that the Senate is a party House. It also suggests the reason why the Senate is intrinsically inferior to the House of Representatives as a democratic forum. The rationalisation that party representation creates an equilibrium that overcomes a system's bias works for the first eight senators in each State, and in the Territories it gives the parties two senators apiece. As we all know well, it does not explain the 12 seats that really matter. The political reality about this institution is that only 12 seats matter in determining who controls the Senate and what happens to the Government. They are the last 12 seats; in other words, one seat in each State by two elections. </PARA>
<PARA> In the foreseeable future-it is hard to make predictions-I believe that 52 of the 64 seats in this House will be electorally predictable. It is unlikely that either the Australian Labor Party of the conservative coalition will ever go below 26 seats. With all due respect to the Australian Democrats that is unlikely. For the fifth seat in each State, over the 1977 and 1980 elections the voting went thus: The Government won five seats, four in 1977 and one in 1980; Brian Harradine won one seat in 1980; the Australian Democrats won five seats, two in 1977 and three in 1980; and the Australian Labor Party won one seat in 1980. This is the substance of the Senate deadlock. But is it a testament to democracy? Not in my view. If we mentally place to one side the first two quotas and concentrate on the crucial fifth position we see that the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales needed more than 300,000 primary votes to win the fifth seat and to elect Senator Sibraa. The quota all up was about 450,000. But in the 1980 election for those comparable vital seats in other States, Senator Haines required just under 100,000 votes, Senator Crichton-Browne required just over 70 ,000 votes and Senator Harradine required just over 50,000 votes. This is not to say that we have to reform the Senate and make all the seats equal to the voting population. But it does belie the fact that this is a people's House; it never will be and it never has been. The excess Labor vote in one State more than equalled the total in the other three States. So this is not a people's institution. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne, who read a very well rehearsed, conservative piece, made several points. First of all, he said that this is a House of States' rights. Whom is he kidding? It is not a House of States' rights; it does not act that way and it has not acted that way. Maybe there is an occasional showpiece trial every 10 years when two or three people trot over to the other side of the chamber and pretend that they are actually voting for the interests of their State when what they are really about is ensuring their own electoral base. I hate to have to impute that motive to them, but I think that is the case. People opposite, in the Government, are loyal to their party. It is not a quality I criticise them for, but they are here to represent their party and not their State. If they are ever faced with a choice between supporting their party or their State, they will pick their party every time. I might be proved wrong in the future, but nothing in my observation of history or since I have been a senator has contradicted that point. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne also extolled the virtues of the founding fathers. Having read the constitutional papers or summaries of the constitutional conventions, Senator Crichton-Browne tells us his perceived view of the intentions of the founding fathers and says that therefore those intentions should never be changed. Really, it is a pity that resurrection is not a little closer because we could get back these founding fathers who are the fount of all wisdom and get them to rule this country. No document drawn up 80 years ago could necessarily be as relevant today. Why should we just go by what was said 80 years ago? If one looks not just at the showpiece debates on the constitution conventions but at the wheeling and dealing that was done one would realise that the Constitution was put up as a pragmatic exercise in which power deals and trade-offs were made. The founding fathers would all get up at the convention and make these lofty, wonderful speeches about the principles of Federation and everything else. We know that the constitutional conventions of today do not operate on lofty principles and discussions. That is very much a matter of self- interest and other matters that come into it. It was the same then. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the only document in the last few thousand years which has stood the test of time is the Ten Commandments, although there is possible revision there. If the founding fathers had meant this Constitution to last forever, why would they have put in the referendum proposals so that the constitution may be changed? They realised that the document they were creating needed to be modified over time. They put in very conservative referendum restrictions to protect the interests of the smaller States. All we are asking is that these proposals be put to the people for some decision. We cannot make the decision here. The only decision we can make here or in the House of Representatives is the decision that the people not be allowed to vote on these particular measures . </PARA>
<PARA> I commend Senator Evans for his initiative in bringing this Bill forward. There is a necessity, I believe, to look to the future to try to head off further constitutional confrontation. It will lead to a situation of instability. It will lead to a situation whereby a large percentage of the voting population in this country will no longer believe in the system. The moment that particular situation occurs, questions of States rights and other matters will become irrelevant. I realise another honourable senator may wish to speak on this Bill so I will conclude my remarks at that point. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is a rerun of the private members' Bill that I introduced in the Thirty-first Parliament. It is being introduced again in this Parliament not only because of the very considerable public support that it has attracted but also for what I believe to be its intrinsic merit as an idea of service to the Australian community. Over the last three years, I have explained the ideas behind this Bill to many thousands of people at almost 100 separate meetings. In every case those ideas have been greeted with unqualified support, which in most cases could reasonably be described as enthusiasm. </PARA>
<PARA> At not one of those meetings, nor in any of the conversations that I have held with people at all levels, has any person actually disagreed with the general principle, with one notable exception. I refer to some of my colleagues in this place, some politicians, whose disagreement, for those who care to look it up in Hansard, is indicated in the report of the second reading debate on the Bill introduced in the previous Parliament. But, again, over the intervening period, many members of parliament, both Federal and State, from a number of States, have been in touch with me and have indicated their agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, my Australian Democrats colleague in the New South Wales Parliament will be introducing similar legislation there. I think my colleague in the Tasmanian Parliament is also considering whether the same sort of legislation could be introduced into the Tasmanian Parliament, where there is, I might say, a modernness of view about democratic methods which I think might encourage such legislation. Tasmania might well be one of those places where this sort of legislation could become law. It could act as an ideal experiment place before the admittedly much deeper and graver step of consideration of the idea for the Commonwealth were taken. The history of this sort of legislation may well be that it is introduced in one of the States and its progress is noted there. Whatever views honourable senators had of it, at least if it were in execution everybody would be looking at it with some interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The idea of citizens' initiative in Australia is gaining ground steadily. A number of organisations, including some political organisations, has taken it on board as policy. I am not absolutely sure whether it is universal in Australia but I know that at least some branches of the Young Liberal Movement have discussed it quite freely. Indeed, I have discussed it with them. I think that a number of people in that organisation are interested in the idea as a possibility for an expansion of Australian democracy. As the saying goes, there is nothing more powerful than an idea that has found its time. I am inclined to think that that might be the case. This Bill, if carried by this Parliament, would allow the Australian people to decide whether they should have a democratic right which is already available to people in many other parts of the free world, that is, the right to make laws independently of parliaments in certain cases. It would be a sort of overriding provision of democracy which allows the people to decide what they want to do in particular matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I have discussed this matter with people at all levels in the community. I was deeply impressed by the variety of views about it because that indicated to me, among other things, that there is far more interest in Australia in the democratic process and ways of improving it than I had thought. That is a hopeful sign, whatever the fate of this Bill or any other Bill of its type. I was a little disappointed, although not altogether surprised, at what I saw as the narrow and very conservative views expressed over this matter by some speakers when it was debated in the last Parliament. It was dismissed then as a sort of ill-informed populist measure which would not really work in practice. </PARA>
<PARA> That appears to me, with hindsight, as self-interest on the part of those people. Some politicians in fact do not want their powers shared with the community to any degree whatsoever, or, alternatively, they have that philosophy that has been described as the philosophy of the great unwashed-the view that the community generally cannot decide its own affairs with any competence or capability but has to be guided by the superior judgment and knowledge of professional politicians. I have conceded the point that there are very many matters in law which are much better decided by Parliaments-technical matters, matters of difficulty, matters of legal complication-but the point is that the history of the initiative in other countries has not been that the community tried to intervene in those matters. In all of the countries where this measure applies, most of the law is still made in the place and at the time that it should be made-in the parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA> It has become obvious to me, from feedback that I have got from the community at the meetings to which I have referred, and so on, that this opposition on these grounds during that short second reading debate in the Thirty-first Parliament to the idea of citizen initiative was not really welcomed by the community. I think that those words of honourable senators here, with respect to them, were noted by more people in the community than I would have thought possible, and they did not like them because they felt that this was one way in which at least politicians could consider mitigating their overall power over events-other than an election every three years-and the population of this country has a right to have that idea seriously considered. I believe, and the Australian Democrats believe, that it should be considered to the stage at which it could be put to the people in a referendum. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder how many honourable senators and people here would doubt what would happen if that were put to the people of Australia. To my mind, there is no doubt whatsoever that the people of this country would wish to have that power. Basic to this debate is the responsibility upon members of this Parliament of deciding whether or not they feel that they should deny people not the opportunity of having the power but the opportunity of deciding for themselves whether they want it. That seems to me of great basic importance. I should have thought that if members of Parliament were prepared to try this out-it may be a bold step into the future-at least it would enhance the view that the public has of politicians. At least we would get the credit from the people of being shown to be trusting of the people, who, after all, elect us, and whom we are supposed to represent, who are the population of this country. I should have thought that that would have been the least of its merits. </PARA>
<PARA> I am convinced, on balance, from the contacts I have had with the electorate over the last few years, that this legislation is something that the Australian people want, and it is especially wanted by those people I would regard as being in highly responsible positions and very well equipped indeed to make the necessary judgements. I would suggest that in many ways that is all that is required. What is needed to make this work-this has been the experience in other countries-is sufficiently highly motivated people with an interest in democracy and in affairs to more or less lead a movement. Someone has to organise the necessary authorising petitions and things of that kind. I firmly believe that we have sufficient citizens' movements in Australia and things of that kind to make that possible. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the Bill seeks to change the Australian Constitution to give the Australian people the inalienable right, in certain circumstances, to make law through a process completely independent of the Parliament. The fundamentals of the Bill are very simple. It seeks a referendum for a constitutional amendment, because that happens to be the only way in which our Constitution can be amended. The people themselves must change the Constitution, and that, of course, is how it should be. This Bill, if carried, would create a new chapter of the Australian Constitution-Chapter IX. This new provision in the Constitution would allow any proposition for change of the law, that is in any field of the law at all, and indeed, of the Constitution itself, to be initiated -the word 'initiated' means 'citizens' initiative'-through a petition of 250,000 signatures, that is, a quarter of million signatures. Propositions brought forward in this way would be presented to the people once a year on a set day. There would not be a separate day for each proposition to be voted on. They would be collected over a period as they are in other parts of the world, notably in California. That is how Proposition 13 got its name. It was the thirteenth proposition on the list. The propositions would be voted on at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of a change to the Constitution, there would have to be a clear majority nationally and a majority in the majority of the States. But the Bill also provides that where a two-thirds majority nationally is achieved, then the provision for a majority in the majority of the States shall not apply. I think there is a good reason for that. On the side of constitutional change there is a point of some importance that is worth mentioning. I am not altogether clear on this. I do not think anybody is. I have discussed it with a number of constitutional lawyers who believe that in this vehicle of the initiative there may well be the machine for constitutional change which Australia needs so badly . It is well known by all people who have studied the mechanisms within the Constitution for its own change that it is very difficult to get results but there is a respectable legal point of view if this new chapter came into existence in the Constitution it would give the people an overriding right, because it was the right of initiative, for the reform of the Constitution itself and if that were so it could be a most exciting possibility, and I would think something of an argument for this right. I am not prepared to go further than that. It is matter which I am sure would engage a good deal of hot legal debate. I am not qualified enough to make or pretend to make any kind of pronouncement on it. I am merely indicating that as a useful possibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats contention is that the present system, which allows only the Parliament the right to initiate laws, is an anachronism and increasingly so. It had relevance, I think, in the nineteenth century when people conceded that they wanted their representatives to make laws for them. Then the degree of education was much less in the community than it is now and the degree of involvement and interest in public affairs were also much less than they are now. I think it is no longer enough for free people in the late twentieth century to have only the right to elect one party or another to government, indeed to have no real control over the legislative process beyond that of election. I suggest that increasingly governments are beginning to recognise this because the number of referenda or proposed referenda or discussions on referenda are becoming greater as the years pass. I think it is a basic understanding on the part of the legislators that this is a good thing. If it is indeed a good thing, then why is not the initiative a good thing? I think it is not enough to say that proposals for referenda should come only from parliaments. They should also come from the people, if the people so wish. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill if carried, and if the referendum were approved by the people, would remove at one stroke whole regions in which the community clearly and consistently perceives the risk of governmental corruption. As matters now stand , financial and other influences brought to bear on governments are perceived as being reflected in the making of law, and also in the absence of certain kinds of laws. The community perceives itself as powerless to control that process, as indeed it is, and perhaps for that reason gives it far greater weight than it ought to do. Nevertheless that does not induce us, I hope, to underrate the appearance and the effect of that process on the community. This new power would make it impossible for firm guarantees to be given by governments to powerful lobby groups that something would, or would not, happen because obviously if a sufficiently large number of people wanted to initiate a matter it must happen if it were approved by a majority of the people, regardless of what the Government wanted. I suggest this new power would make for a much healthier political climate. I think that the merits in that respect alone would be great. Those merits would provide a greatly needed renewed faith in the democratic process in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of some interest historically that when the right to initiate referenda was introduced in a number of American States in the first decade of this century it was because of a widespread disenchantment of the people with the democratic process at that time. I suggest that that situation applies here. It is obvious. One has only to read a newspaper or listen to a radio to know that that is increasingly the case and that politicians, for whatever reasons, are not given much credit for their work. All of us are tarred with a certain kind of brush-whether we like it or not and whoever we are-in the public mind. That in itself is bad. It is regrettable. Having been a member of this place for four years, I believe it is altogether unjustified. Surely it devolves on us to try to find some mechanism whereby we can increase public trust in us. Again, that would make for a much healthier political climate. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, opposition to this issue has been expressed in this place. I do not like it. I believe it was insincere. It really comes back to the nub of the debate on whether this principle will be adopted. Does one say that this country is really a democracy and is one prepared to trust the people who make the decisions? I believe the issue is as simple as that. If one says that one is not prepared to do so then one is really bringing forward only the arguments which were historically presented much earlier against universal suffrage and later women's suffrage. They are the old arguments that things are difficult, law is complicated and there are so many matters about which people do not know enough to decide. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a certain truth in that. I think that most people would say that in many areas of law they do not know enough to decide, but there are other areas of law where I think the people could probably make a much more acceptable decision than we could. A community is much more likely to accept a decision which is made by the majority of its peers than one which is imposed on it by government. In fact, this has been one of the lessons of the use of the initiative and referenda in other countries. Those arguments which say that people do not know enough to decide-no matter how tortuous the attempt may be to conceal the main point-are actually, in the end, arguments for some kind of dictatorship or oligarchy. This may be subject to a check every three years but basically that is the situation. I think that must be clearly said again and again as often as these arguments are advanced against the idea of the initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the other merits of the idea? First, it allows matters of very considerable public interest to be brought to the attention of the electorate in a far greater measure than they are now for decisions to be made. This means that the people realise they have a responsibility to understand a matter because they have to vote on it. That is not the case at present. The electorate tends to be diverted by and engaged in other matters at election time-trivia and short term measures such as whether they are going to get a tax cut in three months time. It is not good for the country that the electorate should vote only on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Matters which are brought forward for decision at the actual vote of this referendum would be unlikely to be trivial. So far as I know, in recent decades there has not been a single petition presented to this Parliament which would have been large enough to secure an initiative. I may be wrong on that, but I do not think so. The requirement of 250,000 signatures sets a very considerable goal to achieve. But if it were thought to be too small the Parliament, plainly, would have the power to suggest a higher figure. This is merely an idea. Any modification, change or discussion of it would be welcomed by me. Certainly I am not laying down what is contained in the second reading speech or indeed in the Bill as the last word on the subject. I would hope to see it amended and other wisdoms brought to bear on it. I would think that an amendment that sought a much higher number of names-for instance, half a million signatures or more- would be insincere because that would be very difficult to achieve in Australia. I believe it would place an unfair strain-an unfair financial strain among other things-on the people who were supposed to organise it. It might also lead to other abuses which I will mention later. This idea, like all ideas of this kind, is by no means a panacea or overall cure-all. The proposal represents an experiment-a bold step forward for this Parliament and certainly a bold step forward for the Australian people. There would be no harm in some caution being exercised. As I said, my purpose is merely to have the idea freely canvassed and discussed, and perhaps amended or changed. </PARA>
<PARA> Is the whole idea merely an idealistic exercise in impractical democracy? I do not think so. As I shall later show, it works very well in some of the world's most successful free societies-societies within friendly nations and regions with which Australia already identifies. Beyond that, it enjoys other advantages . In a future which is generally acknowledged to present difficulties and problems, to require some sacrifice on the part of the community at large, is it not best to allow that community to involve itself in some of the issues, to give it the means to study and know the facts? Is it not likely that such an opportunity would give the people a greater sense of responsibility and involvement and so, over a period, encourage them to a more far-sighted attitude ? I suggest also that it would give them a much greater understanding of the problems of legislatures and perhaps a great deal more sympathy with the problems of members of parliament. I suggest that the more people became involved in this way the more they would be inclined to understand, to sympathise and to exercise what influence they had on the political process in a more responsible way. </PARA>
<PARA> Is that, again, mere naivete? I suggest that it is not. I believe that there is evidence to the contrary. We know that we have a much better educated generation than we have had before. I would say that it is also a much more politically aware society than has existed in the past. The enormous increase in both media and public interest in politics and the rapid growth of citizens' movements of all kinds surely demonstrate this. The old idea that politics was something that people never discussed has disappeared. Continuously politics is a matter of active discussion and of great interest in the society. I believe that that tendency indicates a desire on the part of the community for more input, a desire to play a greater part. I believe that much of the frustration with the political process is due to the fact that intelligent, aware people who would like to play a part in fact do not play it because the machinery is not there to enable them to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Another advantage would be a fuller use of political expertise and experience in government. It should be obvious that one of the regions in which initiatives are most likely to be organised would be that of the Opposition in this Parliament. Is there anything but good in that? Is it not ludicrous that all influence that is vested in one area should become virtually no influence within a matter of days, as a result of an election? Surely the nation would be better served if an avenue existed whereby the Opposition, given sufficient effort and support-by obtaining 250,000 signatures-could be able to bring forward a matter for referendum. I can see, and the Australian Democrats can see, no harm in that whatsoever-nothing but good. </PARA>
<PARA> Would this device of the citizens' initiative be abused? Like every other right , it could indeed be misused by power pressure groups. No freedom can be absolutely guaranteed. No device works uniformly successfully. The proper use of the initiative would then be a matter for the community to look after, and that is as it should be. Would this right usurp the authority and usefulness of the Parliament? Far from it. In other countries that have the initiative the making of the vast body of law, especially in technical or complex areas, has remained the responsibility of the Parliament-even after many decades of application. I believe that would also be the case here. </PARA>
<PARA> Would the device be unduly costly? We have to bear in mind the enormously important input and extra responsibilities that it would bring to the community. I do not think that it would be costly in either real or relative terms. The Bill proposes that the referendum be held in the first Saturday of each December . As a national referendum, it would cost about the same as a national election. That is probably an extreme view. It may be cheaper, but if it did cost the same it would cost about $10m-a large sum of money but only 71c per head of population each year. That is not a very large sum to expend in obtaining those kinds of rights. In addition, every three years the date of the referendum would coincide with the date of the national election-if indeed we had a fixed-term parliament as I hope we will. That would diminish the cost enormously in that year. They could be conducted simultaneously. The average cost over time would also be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The right of the citizen to initiate referendums is practised already, as I have mentioned, in several of the more enlightened countries, including Switzerland, Austria and the United States of America. The right is often found to be a long-standing one. It was granted to the Swiss in 1892, as long as 90 years ago, and it has been adopted by 24 States of the United States of America since 1890. In Switzerland, between 1892 and 1944, 47 initiatives were submitted to the confederation through petition. Of those, about one-quarter were adopted. The others were either rejected or withdrawn, which indicates a pretty high rate of rejection. Again, I think that is a healthy and reassuring sign. In the United States, the most famous recent example of a citizen-initiated referendum is probably the Californian Proposition 13 of 1977 which altered the taxation laws, justifiably, because increasing property taxes due to inflation were giving the Government of California quite an unjustified growth of revenue. A later proposition aimed at cutting a different kind of taxation, income tax-from my study it was not so justified-was, in fact, rejected by the Californian people, which indicates, I feel, that they could be trusted to judge a referendum topic on its individual merits and not just on whether it would result in personal gain for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress that, as with any instrument of government, this power could of course be abused. It relies for its effect on a reasonably large number of politically aware and interested people in the community. But, of course, if the initiative is working well it tends to increase the number of such people. For many years in America the initiative was misused by commercial groups who used paid operators to organise the necessary number of names and petitions. But there is, of course, beyond the actual petition the final and ultimate safeguard-the fact that the people themselves decide through their vote whether or not the matter becomes law. So even if commercial or extremist lobbyists succeeded in getting their ideas on to the annual referendum ballot paper those ideas would still be subject to the commonsense judgment of ordinary people. Granted that, I have no fears about the values of the initiative if introduced in Australia. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A news release dated 17 May 1982 from the Minister for Health (Mr Carlton) gives an account of a brief ceremony at which a cheque for $42,500 was presented to an organisation called GROW, the acronym for the Group Recovery Organisations of the World. Mr Carlton on this occasion said that GROW is Australia's largest non-governmental mental health organisation conducting, as it does, the residential drug and alcohol rehabilitative program in New South Wales. He said that this year the Government will provide $296,000 to this organisation. At the same time, the Western Australian Government has announced the closure of its Community Development Centre. The CDC, as it is known in Western Australia, is an initiative which, since its inception some 15 years ago, has worked for the promotion of sound emotional and mental health and has made Perth a leader in this field. At nominal or no cost, hundreds of men and perhaps thousands of women have gained new skills and awareness, becoming valuable community resource people who, through their immediate and extended families, neighbours and community involvements, care, inform and add a vitality to society which, without their training, might never have developed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many agencies, including, I believe, GROW, have benefited, if not actually survived, because of the committed voluntary energies and time that the Community Development Centre trained citizens have poured into them. Religions and charitable groups, those involved with young offenders, homeless and abused women and children, relatives and friends of the mentally ill, are just a few of the groups which have received assistance and training through the CDC. The country service of the CDC was expanding to include effective living and assertiveness courses, the acquisition of marriage guidance skills and courses in stress management, et cetera. Recently two women wrote from Merredin. They said:</PARA>
<PARA> It seems to us that the services provided by the CDC in keeping healthy people healthy is one we can in no way afford to dispense with. Certainly from a country point of view there is nowhere else we can possibly get this service. </PARA>
<PARA>The Western Australian Government gives as its reason for closing the centre that the service was difficult to evaluate. Humanitarian considerations apart, it is plain poor economics to put the sickness industry before preventative medicine. The social costs of not providing preventative dimensions of community services are easily quantified. We can start off with identifying the $296,000 given by the Federal Government to GROW this year for its drug and alcohol rehabilitation program. As far as I know, GROW is a highly laudable organisation . It is the incredible inconsistency of the Government's actions which appals me . I know that such decisions by State governments are largely out of the hands of the Federal Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). I do believe, however, that there is a growing public awareness of the need for a greater national emphasis on the prevention of mental and physical disease and on the need to educate and support those who seek effectively to communicate, manage their stress, assert their dignity and cope with their sexuality. If the Western Australian Government opts out of such a responsibility, as it apparently seeks to do, we will have to evolve federal schemes for specific grants and line up with GROW and the other organisations for a periodic handout. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir John Carrick</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In accordance with guidelines contained in the joint Prime Ministerial Communique of 21 March 1980, Australian and New Zealand officials have conducted a series of detailed studies relating to possible arrangements for a closer economic relationship (CER) between the two countries. These studies have included such subjects as tariffs, import restrictions, differences in tariff treatment accorded to intermediate goods industries, export incentives, agricultural support/stabilisation schemes and government purchasing. In connection with these studies, consideration has also been given to issues affecting specific industries in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to agriculture, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics has conducted a series of detailed commodity-by-commodity studies and a research paper dealing with the comparative efficiency between the Australian and New Zealand dairy industries and implications for trans-Tasman trade.</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the BAE dairy study, which was published in September 1981, studies have not been undertaken with a view to publication. However they have been drawn upon by the Government in formulating views as to what would constitute an appropriately structured closer economic relationship with New Zealand. The central trade objective of that relationship was described by Prime Ministers as the gradual and progressive removal of barriers to trade between the two countries.</PARA>
<PARA> Officials have consulted closely with industry groups in the course of their studies and views received have been taken into account by the Government in determining Australia's policy approach in negotiations with New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, while it is not intended that the various studies undertaken by officials be published, the results of such studies will be reflected in the package of proposed measures for a new trading arrangement between Australia and New Zealand. That package will be made public before final decisions are taken by the Government. The implications of the proposed package for specific industries and areas will be considered by the Government in this context.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 February 1982 (Hansard, page 481) Senator Sibraa asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, refers also to the arrest of a former employee of the Australian Embassy in Washington on charges of stealing. What security checks are applied to prospective employees before they are granted employment with our Washington Embassy? Have the staff cutbacks resulting from the razor gang's decision led to a breakdown in security arrangements?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The employment of all locally-engaged staff at the Australian Embassy in Washington is subject to a police records check in the United States, as well as in their country of nationality and in any other country of prior residence. In making these checks, the Embassy must rely on the accuracy of information provided by agencies of other governments.</PARA>
<PARA> Generally it is not possible to fully complete police record checks prior to the engagement of an employee. If checks cannot be completed prior to an engagement the employee is placed on probation, which is not confirmed until the checking process has been completed. In the case of the former employee mentioned, checking was completed in accordance with established procedures.</PARA>
<PARA> The imposition of staffing restrictions has not resulted in a breakdown of security arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 22 April 1982 (Hansard, page 1442) Senator Mason asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence . Is the Government aware that when the Government of Argentina understood that British nuclear submarines were in the vicinity of the Falkland Islands the Argentinian Navy's aircraft carrier was withdrawn to port, where it appears it has remained ever since? It is known that there is a world-wide disposition of nuclear submarines and that they could be expected to be present everywhere in the world in a normal war situation. In that case, in a war in which Australia was involved what would the Government propose to do regarding our new aircraft carrier, Australia? Would the ship be kept in port or sent to sea? What would be her usefulness in either of those circumstances?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following information which is additional to that provided by me on 22 April 1982:</PARA>
<PARA> My Department has received no information to suggest that the Argentinian Navy 's carrier was withdrawn to port because British nuclear submarines were in the vicinity of the Falkland Islands.</PARA>
<PARA> HMS Invincible is a modern warship which has been designed specifically for Anti Submarine Warfare (ASW) operations in the NATO strategic environment where there is a considerable threat from nuclear submarines.</PARA>
<PARA> As the central element of a task group, whose major role is to detect and destroy submarines (whether they be nuclear or diesel electric powered), she has proven to be a very effective ASW vessel in NATO exercises.</PARA>
<PARA> In war the new carrier would be at sea, operating in conjunction with other elements of the Australian Defence Force, pursuing the strategy adopted by the Government of the time. One of her primary roles could be the protection of shipping in which she has a demonstrated capability to perform effectively.</PARA>
