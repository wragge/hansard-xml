<PARA> 1. The successive promises of the Federal Government to introduce ethnic television into Australia have only been carried out in respect to Sydney and Melbourne, ignoring other centres with large ethnic populations such as Adelaide .</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Senators in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth that.</PARA>
<PARA> The Students and staff of the University of Queensland express their dismay at the lack of adequate federal government funding to our University, which has resulted, inter alia, in the erosion of our Library facilities-we note that:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The opening hours of our main library have been reduced from 93 1/2 a week in 1975 to 72 hours a week in 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The number of new books purchased per year has fallen from over 50,000 in 1976 to under 23,000 in 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The number of books in storage and inaccessible to students and staff has risen from none in 1977 to over 40,000 in 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The number of books discarded in 1976 was over 6,000-by the end of 1981 over 70,000 had been discarded.</PARA>
<PARA>We believe this to be educationally retrograde and economically wasteful.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate urge the Government to increase funding to a level sufficient to allow the University to restore our previous Library facilities.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. This petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Church of Mary Queen of Peace, Klaipeda, Lithuania was the only church permitted (by the Soviet authorities) to be built in post-war Lithuania.</PARA>
<PARA> That the church was built by the Catholic parishioners from their own resources and with support from overseas Christians.</PARA>
<PARA> That upon completion of the church building in 1960, the church was not allowed to be consecrated and, in 1961 was resumed by the State for purpose other than religious.</PARA>
<PARA> That this resumption of the church and the subsequent persecution and arrests of the local clergy and other christians is contrary to the spirit and the letter of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Human Rights.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled request the Australian Government to communicate most strongly to the Government of the USSR the sympathy of the petitioners for the plight of the Lithuanian Christians and ask that the Church of Mary Queen of Peace be restored to the Catholics of Klaipeda for the practice of their religion without interference.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Attorney-General and refer to the Trade Practices Commission inquiry into the future of stock exchange regulation. This follows a question I asked on the same subject earlier this year. Is the Minister concerned at the statement last week by the South Australian Attorney- General, Mr Griffin, that if the Commission's determination banning fixed brokerage fees were accepted, some 21 brokers could leave Adelaide, forcing the closure of that stock exchange, resulting in a loss of some $1m in stamp duty revenue, and a set-back to State development? Does the Minister recognise that the closure of the Adelaide exchange would also result in national companies removing their head offices from Adelaide? Given the possible detrimental effects of the Commission's determination on South Australia's development, does the Government recognise this fact and will it do all in its power to ensure that the Adelaide stock exchange is not forced to close?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am certainly aware of the matter raised by Senator Jessop and, in particular, the concerns that have been expressed by the South Australian Attorney-General, Mr Griffin, about the impact on the South Australian stock exchange of the determination of the Trade Practices Commission in regard to access to stock exchange and brokerage rates. This concern has been expressed in a number of States and by State Attorneys-General. The Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities has already discussed the matter. It was decided during a telephone hook-up we had two or three weeks ago that the concerns about the impact on State stock exchanges, particularly in Perth, Hobart, Adelaide and Brisbane, would be expressed by the individual Attorneys, or by one of them on behalf of the others. The Trade Practices Commission has before it a draft determination, the one about which concern was expressed. The Trade Practices Commission was scheduled to hold last week-and I have no reason to believe that it did not do so-a pre-decision conference on the matter. I assume that Mr Griffin and perhaps some other State Attorneys expressed their views to the Trade Practices Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The process before the Trade Practices Commission is that it has issued a draft determination and is scheduled to hold a pre-decision conference at which it will be giving consideration to that matter and no doubt other matters that are placed before it. I do not know when it will make its final determination. Against that, of course, appeals are available to the Trade Practices Tribunal. However, the matter is certainly one which is under lively consideration of the Ministerial Council which will meet briefly on Friday of this week. I have no doubt that the matter will be discussed there. I am watching the matter very closely on behalf of the Federal Government and I will no doubt be taking it in the form of a submission to Cabinet in the near future. At this stage I am awaiting the final determination of the Trade Practices Commission before taking any further action at the Federal level.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Attorney-General, and he will not be surprised to hear that it concerns matters arising out of the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union which was tabled yesterday. Will the Attorney immediately table in each case, with the names and other identifying characteristics of individuals erased, the following opinions received by the Government, all expressing the view that criminal prosecutions or civil proceedings for misfeasance could lie against those involved in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, namely, the opinions of Mr Brinsden, Q.C., in January 1975, and again by Mr Brinsden, Q.C., in June 1975 ; by the unnamed Sydney Q.C. in early 1976 on the Norfolk Island matter, referred to on page 40 of the Costigan report; by the police investigators into the Perth matter in November 1976; by Mr Traill, Q.C., in July 1978; by Mr Ormiston, Q.C., and Dr Spry, Q.C.-a joint opinion in 1978-as referred to at page 75 of the Costigan report, if there is any uncertainty about that one; by the Melbourne Q.C. who was briefed by the liquidator of Keirad Pty Ltd in September 1978, the opinion referred to by Mr Lionel Bowen in the House of Representatives the other day, if there is any uncertainty about that one; by the Solicitor- General, Mr Byers, in July 1982, and, for good measure, the opinions submitted by the Law Institute of Victoria in December 1980 to the same effect from Mr Forsyth, Q.C., and Messrs Russell and Davies, Q.C.?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Will the Attorney also table on exactly the same conditions any memorandum or any other document containing a reasoned opinion by Mr Gleedman of the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth, who apparently, despite what Mr Costigan described as his total incompetence in matters of law, both criminal and civil, was of the opinion that prosecutions would not lie; the letter from the Crown Solicitor to the Commissioner of Taxation dated 3 April 1979 which, in Mr Costigan's words, did not condescend to particulars, and, finally, the further letter of 29 September 1980 confirming that advice by the Crown Solicitor, again without descending to detail? I also invite him to table any other opinions, reasoned or otherwise, which he may have in his possession which have not come to public light and which bear upon this issue. Finally, in responding to this question will the Attorney-General explain how it was possible for him to say, as he did on the Nationwide television program last night, that there has been a serious and genuine conflict of expert legal opinion on the question of whether prosecutions would lie under the law as it stood before the passage of the Government's own legislation in 1980?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans mentioned a large number of documents in his question. I will have to give consideration to the extent to which any of these can be tabled. I remind the Senate of the secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act and the fact that the Crown Solicitor has always followed the rule that opinions and so forth that have been given on matters referred to him by the Australian Taxation Office for legal action arising under the Income Tax Assessment Act are not made available to Ministers. Senator Evans will be aware that the Income Tax Assessment Act specifically refers to Ministers. That is the rule that has always been followed and Mr Costigan, of course, emphasises that fact very clearly and definitely in his report. He points to it as one of the problems that Ministers are faced with in administering the law in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Furthermore, as it appears from my response to the report that I tabled yesterday, the Government has decided that action should be taken in relation to both possible criminal proceedings and possible civil proceedings. It is not the rule and it would be foolish indeed to table opinions which will or may well be used as the basis for legal proceedings. We never do that and I see no reason why in this case there should be any difference. I am sure Senator Evans would realise that we do not make available--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Wait a minute. It is not just a matter of identification, it is also the sorts of arguments and so forth that opinions contain. Of course, these are not made known to those who are to be sued or prosecuted. There are very considerable reasons for that attitude to be taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a miscellany of documents in this case. They are not all just opinions . Senator Evans even asked for a police investigator's report. Good heavens, who would ever dream of making public a police investigator's report in regard to a case about which he is asked to consider whether he should take prosecution proceedings? That is really the most absurd request that I have ever heard.</PARA>
<PARA> In the last part of the question, Senator Evans referred to a somewhat lively debate that we had last night on the Nationwide program as to the opinions, as I understand it, that had been received. Advice had been received from Mr Brinsden in the case referred to by Mr Costigan. There may have been some other opinions that had been received but I certainly have not been aware of them. I was not aware of anything on the specific point of criminal proceedings until after the McCabe report was put down. The view of the Crown Solicitor was not that of just the Deputy Crown Solicitor in Perth and his staff. It was a view that had been formed by the Crown law authorities in Canberra after discussions they had with the taxation officials. They formed the view that the existing criminal law was not really suitable or adequate for the specific proceedings that were recommended by Mr Brinsden.</PARA>
<PARA> Certainly the view expressed by Mr Brinsden was different from the view that had been expressed by others. including the Solicitor-General, whose report we obtained after the McCabe report and before the Costigan report. The Treasurer, Mr Howard, and I decided to take action and obtain the Solicitor-General's opinion and indeed another Sydney silk's opinion, seeing the view which was being expressed by Mr McCabe and which had been expressed by Mr Brinsden was very different from the view which had been held by the Crown Solicitor's Office . But they are very able lawyers in the Crown Solicitor's Office, as Senator Evans would readily admit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the fourth interim report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and I ask the Attorney-General: Is it a fact that a major component of the report relates to the unnamed promoter of a system of taxation evasion and fraud?

In any event, I ask for an absolute assurance that the Government will take all possible steps to prosecute any person who has engaged in tax evasion and fraud under the existing Crimes Act and the existing income tax assessment law irrespective of any attempt to recover tax evaded by the introduction of what may be regarded by some people as objectionable retrospective taxation laws?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Under the new powers that we gave the Royal Commissioner-as he recommended-in the last session, he obtained access to tax records in these matters. He is now empowered to pass that information on to the Attorney-General and his Department for the purpose of considering prosecution and also to make a report to the Government in general terms, which he did in this case and which report has been tabled by the Government. The case Senator Rae mentions is one that has been dealt with and is the same as the Perth case which the Deputy Crown Solicitor and the Crown law authorities are well aware of and have been aware of for many years. As I said yesterday, and I re-affirm it today, the position is that the Government decided-indeed the Treasurer and I decided-prior to the tabling of the Costigan report that we would pursue such criminal remedies as were available under existing law at the time, that is, the law as it was before the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act was passed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have decided also to set up a special task force headed by a special prosecutor to undertake this very large effort that will be required. That task force also will be charged with the duty of looking at the pursuit of civil remedies, irrespective of any other laws that may be proposed to the Parliament on the subject. That, I thought, was clearly stated yesterday. However, I take the opportunity provided by Senator Rae's question to reaffirm today that the special task force will be concerned with the pursuit of all remedies that are available at the time, regardless of any further laws such as the Crimes ( Taxation Offences) Act that have been passed or may be proposed in this area.</PARA>

Can the Leader of the Government say whether the assessors' final report on the project announcing the winning entry in June 1980 stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are as satisfied as we can be at this stage that the competition winner's cost estimate is generally credible and realistic and that there will be no really significant increases . . . as the building proceeds . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Was it not announced here last week that the cost has escalated to $370m as of March 1982, an increase of almost 2 1/2 times the estimate announced by the assessors, even though inflation during the period concerned has been only of the order of 41 per cent? Is it not a fact that if cost escalations occur during the six years to completion of the building at the same level as they have done so far, the final cost of that building will reach $1,332m? Is it a fact that the Government has decided to allocate a further sum of $82m for telephones, furniture and art works for the building, that this amount also will be increased at the inflation rate and that on this assumption those items would cost the nation about the same as the total cost of the Sydney Opera House? In what way are such costs appropriate for a nation with our present problems? Finally, will the Government, before it is too late, appoint an independent commission of Australian architects and engineers to monitor constantly and publicly the progress of this project so that no more of these $40m and $50m cost escalations in real terms occur?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I repeat that the decision to build the new Parliament House is a decision of this Parliament. Secondly, the overview of each of the steps in the building of this Parliament House is done by a joint parliamentary committee of this Parliament. Thirdly, the design feature, the furniture and the fittings are all supervised and agreed upon by that joint committee of this Parliament. Also, I remind honourable senators that Mr President, either yesterday or in very recent times, made a statement upon the controlled costs of the Parliament and emphasised that in fact very strong control measures had been undertaken. I visited the site, met with representatives of the Parliament House Construction Authority and discussed the costs. I was assured by them to my own satisfaction that there was a strong cost control, at least as strong as that which applies to any other construction. I am not aware of the figures that Senator Mason put forward. Of course, there will be cost increases year by year in terms of inflation. It was always known that that would be so and that the costs as originally quoted were at the nominal cost of the particular time. It was also known that the building costs would not include furniture, fittings and the general artwork and that that would be covered by a separate estimate. That has been known. That is in fact under the overview of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the New Parliament House. Having said that, because I have no way of being precise on the figures given by Senator Mason, I will refer the question to the appropriate Minister and get a specific reply.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague says: 'Thank God for that'. This Government has given more in real terms to the total recurrent support of government schools throughout Australia than was given in the last year of the Labor Government. It is not possible for the New South Wales Teachers Federation to assert that we are abandoning government schools or that we are abandoning the government school system. That assertion simply does not hold up. It is possible to say that the resources applied to government schools have improved in real terms. It is possible to say that the Karmel resource targets were reached for government schools in all the systems. It is equally true to say that in the non -government sector those resource targets have not been reached, that students in the non-government sector still work with worse resources than their colleagues in government schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important that we do not confuse the standards of education with the standards of resources. I think Professor Chipman was talking about standards of education.

The Australian Government, conscious of Poland's economic situation, has done nothing to impede the flow of private humanitarian aid to the people of Poland. It will be recalled that last week in this place we had a discussion on these matters and at that time we refered to the Government' s cash grant of $1m to the national 'Help Poland Live' appeal. At the same time the Government has endorsed the actions of allies who have imposed sanctions on the Polish Government in response to the imposition of martial law. It is the Government's view that the responsibility for creating a situation in which these sanctions no longer apply rests with the Polish military council and also with the Soviet authorities who continue to apply pressure. Regrettably, they have yet to show any genuine intention in that regard.

I ask: Is it a fact that between 1971 and 1978 the Commonwealth met all expenditure by a State in a year on agreed measures necessitated by major disasters in excess of a base amount set for the State? Is it a fact that between 1971 and 1978, under the then Commonwealth-State arrangements, New South Wales had to meet only the first $5m and that thereafter everything spent on drought relief was met by the Commonwealth? Did the present Government alter those arrangements to provide for a doubling of the amount that in the first instance each State had to contribute-in the case of New South Wales from $5m to $10m-and that in respect of any State expenditure thereafter the Commonwealth would contribute not the total amount but only three-quarters thereof? In view of the serious drought conditions throughout Australia, particularly in New South Wales, and in view of the national conference on drought relief that is being requested by the Prime Minister, will the Minister recommend to the Prime Minister and to the Government that they seriously consider reverting to the pre-1978 relief arrangements?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday during Question Time I indicated, in much less detail , that the present contribution requirements of State governments dated back to 1978-79. I understand that the position prior to that date was along the lines outlined by the honourable senator in his question. The arrangements since have been fixed and have worked, I believe, to the general satisfaction of the States, although there have been special arrangements from time to time as drought conditions have deepened in a particular State. As I mentioned at the close of Question Time yesterday, the Prime Minister has now communicated with all Premiers-I believe telexes were sent yesterday morning-drawing attention to the deepening severity of the drought and suggesting that discussions between the Minister for Primary Industry, whom I represent in this place, and relevant State Ministers should be held on an early date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has certainly shown that it has been prepared to be flexible within the framework of the 1978 arrangements. For example, for New South Wales , which as the State with the largest population has the largest base amount to meet, namely $10m, the Commonwealth has already made a $10m interest free loan. So that, in current budgetary terms, the State contribution has been met on an interest free loan basis. That is one example of a variation in order to meet a particular situation. I do not think that I should attempt to predict the degree of flexibility in these arrangements that the Commonwealth might be prepared to consider embarking upon. In general, I believe, it has regarded the formula as established in the late 1970s as fairly satisfactory. However, it certainly accepts that the present drought is one of very great severity which is bearing down very heavily on both grain producers and those who are dependent upon the pastoral industry. I will refer the honourable senator's suggestions to the Minister for Primary Industry for consideration. Of course, from time to time I will also report to the Senate on the results of any changes on policy in this area.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The recent Budget contained an announcement about changes in the administration of the exemption from diesel fuel excise. The situation which had applied to that date came to an end, in part because of the Government's concern about the abuses which were occurring with respect to the pre-Budget exemptions. It was announced in the Budget that henceforth users will have to pay the duty but that certain users would be entitled to claim a refund. Those users are those in the agricultural, mining, forestry and fishing industries, those who use diesel fuel for domestic use, and hospitals, nursing institutions and aged persons' homes. That does mean that those who could claim exemption and now cannot will of course be carrying an increased burden. That includes a number of significant State authorities. So, yes, I am aware of the changes which were announced in the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the second major point in Senator Crichton-Browne's question regarding minimum inconvenience, I can assure him that the Government is concerned to minimise the paper work which farmers and others have to indulge in to claim the rebate. The matter has received very careful Government consideration and at this stage I think the Government is still in the process of finalising the precise administrative arrangements which will apply. I can assure the Senate that one of the major considerations in the Government's mind in designing that system has been to keep the procedures as simple as possible. That has to be done in the context of the old system, whereby those who were exempt simply had a number and therefore bought their fuel duty free by lodging the number with the supplier. That system was open to abuse, and was abused. People who were not entitled to the exemption obtained duty free fuel and that was a position that the Government believed could not be allowed to continue.</PARA>

At that time no decision was taken to change the arrangements with regard to payroll tax , which is a tax levied by the States and Territories themselves. Arrangements for the distribution of funds, specific purpose grants and so on were discussed and made at that time. To consider payroll tax as being the only difficulty in regard to employment is to overlook the fact that it is but one cost in the cost of labour or the cost of production. A number of other things bear very directly on costs and it always seems to me to be passing strange that everyone suggests that the removal of payroll tax, or the levying of payroll tax by the Commonwealth or some other form of raising this amount of revenue, would somehow be the answer to the unemployment problem. As I say, it is but one cost and the States have it within their powers to choose to raise funds in some other way if they feel it is more appropriate or they could perhaps in their own ways, in conjunction with the Commonwealth, look at all the costs of production, including costs of wages that are paid by employers and by governments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Throughout the whole community there is a recognition of margins for skill for all people, be they professional people or national leaders, including the judiciary and heads of the Public Service. There is no attempt to compare the wage or salary of such a person with that of a person who is on, shall we say, a lower or average weekly wage. Of course, it is clear that persons on higher wages have particular advantages. That is and always has been the main situation. I have to say when referring to the Prime Minister's salary, Ministers' salaries and salaries of parliamentarians generally, that over the last seven years of this Government Ministers and members of parliament have repeatedly undertaken wage restraint. Their wages and allowances have been fixed by the Remuneration Tribunal. I think that is a situation that is accepted by all sides of this Parliament and that it would be regarded as fair. Nevertheless , decisions have been made that Ministers and members would receive less than the Remuneration Tribunal had allocated. That has been done in the interests of restraint.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the last Remuneration Tribunal finding, the Government indicated to the Tribunal that for top public servants, the judiciary, heads of statutory bodies and parliamentarians, it would be good to have wage restraint. That was adopted at 7 per cent. The Academic Salaries Tribunal, under Mr Justice Ludeke, also did the same in respect of higher wages with the aim of showing wage restraint.</PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, in all the factors that have been examined, and in every country in the free world, there has been a recognition that if wages rise unduly, they will force up prices and create unemployment. After all, I think it was a former Labor Treasurer, Mr Crean, who said that one man's wage increase is another man' s job. That has been indicated. Of course the present Government understands the common need for human beings to have higher living standards. It was governments of this faith that brought to Australia policies that established the highest rate of home ownership of any country in the world. We intend to continue that.</PARA>
<PARA> The policies have worked. The recent Budget, which has been widely acclaimed, has been aimed at assisting both the lower and the lower middle income earning levels. The Budget was aimed specifically to home in on families, particularly families with a single working spouse and children, and to give to them the greatest benefit; hence the assistance for interest on home loans; hence the increased spouse allowance; hence the increase in the family allowance. As the Budget has pointed out, such an average family will receive a net gain, after discounting for the increases in indirect taxes, of about $16 or $17 a week.</PARA>
<PARA> I remind Senator Elstob that prior to the Budget the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions had indicated that if tax concessions were to be available to the community, there would be grounds for wage restraint. All I can say is that the Government has fulfilled those requirements, and there is now a logical onus on everyone to carry out that restraint.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to an article which appeared in today's Australian under the heading ' Klan-type violence against Aborigines'. The Commissioner for Community Relations , Mr Al Grassby, is reported to have made certain very serious allegations concerning the actions of a minority ratbag element which unfortunately exists in our society. As these allegations are purported to be made by a man for whom I have the highest respect, what action does the Minister propose to take to protect these members of my race and to eradicate this idiotic behaviour in our society before it does untold damage to race relations in this nation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe all other senators would have been as concerned as Senator Bonner to have read that account in this morning's newspaper. What made the story more difficult to follow up was that the Commissioner chose not to identify the town where that and a number of other events took place. I think he probably made a correct decision not to identify the place, but it does make it difficult to apply specific corrective actions. The problems to which he refers are, unfortunately, widespread through our society. I think the honourable senator in his question was really asking for those general problems to be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>

In view of all the procrastination by the Government that has occurred so far concerning the Freedom of Information Act, will the Attorney-General give an unequivocal guarantee that the operation of the Act will commence on 1 December 1982, or is that date only as definite as the last one that was announced or the one before that? Once the Act comes into operation, will the information sought earlier in Question Time today arising out of the Costigan report, the report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, become available?

<PARA> As to the second part of Senator Coates's question, there are exemptions in the Act for police reports and legal opinions. I do not believe that the Freedom of Information Act can be brought into aid as a reason why the Government should table the documents that Senator Evans sought earlier today. Of course, the exemptions are ones which the Government does not necessarily have to claim as exemptions and wherever there are exemptions the Government will look at them to see whether there is good reason for claiming those exemptions under that Act. I will have to give further consideration to this matter, but I think that almost all of the documents mentioned by Senator Evans would be covered by exemptions under the Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have read the Costigan report several times. Indeed, it repays very careful reading. Unlike members of the Australian Labor Party I have read the whole of it and not, selectively, chapter 3. I have noted that the main thrust of the report is the revelation, brought about by the action of the Government in setting up the inquiry, of the terrible wave of crime of a wide variety being perpetrated within the membership of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. It takes some selective bias and partisanship by honourable senators opposite that they were able yesterday to venture into that report without noting that it centred basically on the fact that the violence and bloody murder, the intimidation, the false pretences-in fact, every kind of crime-and the organisation of crime in that union, had been revealed. The reaction of the Labor Party is simply an indication to the community that it is not interested in the royal commission's report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the inquiry was set up to look at the allegations made by the public that there was murder, that there was violence, that there was brutality and intimidation and that there was corruption. It was set up by this Government and its terms were widened by this Government so that there could be full exposure. Indeed, yesterday it was completely revealed that the setting up of that inquiry was fully justified.</PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from the proposed establishment of the crimes commission, the joint prosecutors and the various other devices, there is now a clear revelation to the community that we have within one section of the trade union movement a cesspit which must be cleaned up. It is one of the major tragedies of our society that a great movement-the trade union movement-should, at this moment, be under scrutiny because one very major union has been found to be in itself virtually an organised Mafia. The setting up of this royal commission has been fully justified. The remedies which have been taken and those which are to be taken will pursue all the problems mentioned in all sections of the report. Anybody who has breached the law will be pursued. We make that abundantly clear. We have set up methods of investigation but heavily--</PARA>

I would not want to wonder how many members of the particular union hold tickets in Labor leagues and in branches of the Labor Party. The Labor Party should not be selective; nor should it forget that the only reason for the exposure of this matter is Liberal Government action. Not a single activity occurred during the period of the Whitlam Government even though the Costigan report states that for three years under the Whitlam Government this was known. Not a single prosecution was carried out. The report states these things. Nothing was done by the Whitlam Government at all to clean up that section of the trade union movement. Indeed, the McCabe-Lafranchi report, which the Labor Party continues to refer to, was instituted by a State Liberal government, so the facts that are now before the public and the means of pursuing these people result from actions by Liberal governments. The Whitlam Government was reminded that it was the protection of section 16 of the taxation Act which covered these matters and prevented full disclosure. Nothing happened under the Whitlam Government. The answer, of course, is very clear. This Government and the past State Liberal Government of Victoria have enabled these exposures to be made and we will pursue them to the full.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate censures the Government for its grave failure, and the failure of the Attorney-General and the Treasurer in particular, in the administration of legislation relating to criminal and civil offences against the tax laws resulting in multi-billion dollar frauds against the Commonwealth, and calls for the resignation of the Attorney-General and the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA>If there is anything charitable about this motion it is that it censures the Government for failure-failure equalling incompetence. Of course there is an alternative view, which is not expressed in the words of the motion but which can be expressed, and that is not only that the Government has failed but also that it has never tried in relation to the matter with which I want to deal. Before I go on to deal with that matter let me deal with a couple of canards that have been perpetrated in this Parliament today relating to the commencement of the tax avoidance industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point I want to make is that it is very easy to say that because in 1973 an astute officer of the office of the Commissioner of Taxation detected a number of schemes which were frauds on the Commonwealth, and that because that was the chronological date, that is when it all began. But of course the key thing is illustrated best by the report of the royal commissioner, Mr Costigan, when he refers to the fact that opinions and a brief for prosecution in relation to this matter:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . were found relegated to a bottom drawer where, I was told, they had rested undisturbed for the past five years. </PARA>
<PARA>He was told that in 1981. Of course the key date is August 1975. That is when people in this Senate were blocking the Budget of the Whitlam Government. For five years after that the documents remained in a bottom drawer with nothing being done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, as Senator Evans points out, a prosecution was authorised in 1975 by the Whitlam Government. Seven years later, under this Government, nothing has been done about it. If honourable senators want to hear why, they must just listen for a few minutes and stop shouting silly interjections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point is this: The royal commission is called the Royal Commission on the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. If Ministers come into this place and say that the Labor Party or any of its members condone the activities of the Ship Painters and Dockers Union they are perpetrating a lie, because that is not so. We do not condone them for a moment. In setting up this royal commission the Liberal Government indulged in a quite legitimate persecution, as it has turned out, of some of the members of a particular trade union. The Liberal Government launched a tiger which has turned round and bitten it right on the nose and that is the problem it faces today. Let me remind government senators about the Liberal Government. It came into office in 1975 and one of its great slogans was: 'We are going to end the great tax rip-off'. It came into office on that slogan and it will go out on that slogan because under this Government the biggest tax rip-off in the history of this country has been perpetrated as a result of incompetence and inertia by this Government and two of its Ministers in particular-the greatest rip-off in the history of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important, I believe, to establish the environment in which this vote of no confidence in this Government is moved. Environments, we are told, are very important. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) said that. He said that the climate of opinion was not right to take action on this matter. Let us look at the environment in which this motion has been brought forward today. After seven years of Fraser government we live in a society, under a Prime Minister who is going to govern 'for all the people', where anyone who robs a bank of $5,000 goes to gaol for about eight years. If one defrauds the Taxation Commissioner of $250,000 one might have to pay an extra penalty if the Attorney-General and the Treasurer and the public servants under their direction bother to get off their backsides and do anything about it. That is the sort of society in which we live under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We live in a society where the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), in his own defence, says that there are not two million people, living in poverty in Australia. No, he says, there are only 1 million people, which presumably is a matter of great pride to the Fraser Government. We live in a society in which there has been a massive shift in the taxation burden from the rich to the poor. In 1981-82 pay-as-you-earn taxpayers paid 45.4 per cent of the total tax take compared with 41 per cent in 1975 when this tax rip-off Government, as it was calling itself, came into office. We live in a society where the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) comes into the Senate and claims that this Government has ended the tax avoidance industry. What authority does she cite for that proposition? She cites a man who is named in the McCabe-Lafranchi report as being up to his ears in tax evasion. That is the man whom the Minister for Finance cites in this Parliament as authority for the proposition that the Fraser Government has ended the tax avoidance industry. My God, there is something about quoting the Devil for one's own purpose! There has never been a better example of that than that quotation made by the Minister for Finance and the Treasurer in the other place a few days ago. </PARA>
<PARA> We live in a society where gross inequities are being perpetrated, where the number of companies has proliferated and the tax which they pay has fallen in relation to the total tax take. Why has all this happened? Do not take my word for it; take the word, for example, of Professor Mathews. At the beginning of this year he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The taxation system has disintegrated and become a major instrument for distributing income from the poor to the rich. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what this Government expert said about the taxation system and how it has developed under this Government. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> If the same enthusiasm were to be shown by the Commonwealth for controlling revenue collections as for controlling Government expenditures, higher rates of taxation would be unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that higher rates of taxation would be unnecessary if the same enthusiasm had been shown. Of course, that is an understatement. Not only would higher taxation rates have been unnecessary but also taxation for the ordinary pay-as-you-earn taxpayer would have been less and I believe there are plenty of figures which establish that fact. But the key point in Professor Mathews statement is contained in the words 'lack of enthusiasm'. This Government has had no enthusiasm for pursuing its friends in the tax avoidance industry-no enthusiasm whatsoever. We will come to the details of that in a minute. But right under the noses of the Attorney-General and the Treasurer there was a proliferation of the tax avoidance industry. There was a whole range of consistent legal opinions to the effect that that industry could be stopped- legal opinions which were available to this Government and which this Government chose to ignore. But, as I said, it is lack of enthusiasm which is the important factor. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as if the Fraser Government is an insensitive government, insensitive to the feelings of the electorate, unastute about the importance of taxation as an instrument in society. It is not as if it is that sort of government at all. If it is not administratively astute to the importance of taxation, it has always been politically astute about that subject. Need I remind honourable senators of the 1977 election, the election which was going to be the tax reduction-recovery election, the election in which one could dial a tax cut and find out what one was going to get from the Liberal Party if it were re-elected.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters, there were a lot of people in this country who did not have to pick up their gold-plated telephones. They did not pay any tax anyway because of the proliferation of tax avoidance schemes. They did not have to dial a tax cut; that was a service offered to the ordinary people of this country. Those taxation cuts were taken away from them four months later when higher taxes were implemented. This is the Government which has been so astute about the importance of taxation that twice it has promised the introduction of tax indexation. Why did it promise to do this? According to the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) it did so to keep governments honest. This Government has taken away indexation after having promised it. That is how honest and astute this Government is about the real burden of taxation in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The interim report of Commissioner Costigan in relation to these matters reveals the extent of the incompetence, deception and corruption within the Department administered by the Attorney-General and for which he is responsible. But it does more than that. It casts gravest doubts on the veracity of the Treasurer and the Attorney-General in their public statements as to the extent of their commitment to stamp out tax avoidance in this community. We saw the commitment of the Treasurer in June 1982 when, asked what is at fault in the question of tax avoidance, he said: 'Community attitudes are at fault'. This is a man who is a Deputy Prime Minister of this country, a so-called leader, one would have thought, of opinion. What he is saying, of course, is that the Government has lost confidence in the veracity and integrity of people and they, not the Government, ought to be dismissed. He is saying that community attitudes are at fault. This undertaker's clerk who keeps the receipts for the Prime Minister of this country hides behind a screen. He is like the Duke of Plaza Toro: 'In different things of martial kind, when there is any fighting he led his regiment from behind'. The Duke of Plaza Toro found it less exciting.

It reveals, of course, the indolence and lack of will by the Attorney-General and the Treasurer to act when these enormous rip-offs were taking place under their very noses. Of course, ultimately it is an indictment of the competence of the Attorney-General and the Treasurer. They are not fit to be Ministers in this or any other government. The only honourable course is for both of them to resign, which this motion calls on them to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Look at the lamentable history of this affair. It is contained in chapter three of the Commissioner's report. It reveals that in 1973 and 1974 a diligent officer of the Taxation Office found a set of facts and a method of prosecuting a bottom-of-the-harbour scheme. That was referred to the Deputy Crown Solicitor' s Office in Perth. By the end of 1975 the basis of a prosecution was established to the satisfaction of the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Federal Police. This satisfaction was supported by a clear opinion sought and obtained from Mr Brinsden, Q.C. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, when we talk about the basis for a prosecution, we are talking about the basis for a prosecution of a scheme, a pilot scheme if you like, which has led to the loss of millions and millions of dollars-hundreds of millions of dollars in the words of the Commissioner-to the revenue of this country. That money might have been spent on improving the lot of pensioners, on preventing the sales tax increases which took place in the Budget and which imposed a burden on the ordinary people. It might have been spent in a variety of other ways to improve the social cohesion and sense of justice in this community. Hundreds of millions of dollars might have been spent on those things for which this government has never been able to find the money. </PARA>
<PARA> But that whole process foundered in the Attorney-General's Department, in the Perth office of the Deputy Crown Solicitor, because no prosecutions were ever launched, no money was recovered and nothing was done. The responsibility for what Commissioner Costigan calls the 'lamentable history of non-prosecution' is shared by all levels-the Deputy Crown Solicitor's office in Perth, the central Crown Solicitor's office in Canberra-and goes all the way to the Crown Solicitor himself. The responsibility, if we accept the standards of the Fraser Government as laid down by the master, goes to the senior levels of government itself-to the Attorney-General, the Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Senate: Can Ministers escape responsibility for the grossly inadequate supervision of the prosecution by and administration of their Departments? If taxation were such a crucial issue and if this Government were concerned, why did the Attorney-General not say to his Department: 'What are we doing about this?'. The Attorney-General will say, as he said on television: ' They could not tell me anything because of section 16, the secrecy provision.' What a load of rubbish! Of course they could have told the Attorney-General what was being done. The secrecy provision only protects the names of individuals. It does not protect a Minister from being told what is being done by his Department . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know, Senator Walters, but it was known in 1975 and a prosecution was authorised. That is more than this Government has done in seven years. The Royal Commissioner establishes, if Senator Walters wants figures, that the cost to the community of tax avoidance as a result of these schemes is enormous. Mr Risstrom, the Secretary of the Australian Taxpayers Association, estimates that it is up to $5 billion. Professor Mathews says that it is $5 billion but the Commissioner of Taxation says that it is at least $1 billion. Were not the Attorney-General and the Treasurer aware of these figures? Were not they aware of any of those figures which have been talked about in the Senate now for two and a half years? Were not they aware of the reports of the Commissioner of Taxation which identified the loss through these schemes in 1977 -78, when this Government was in office, as being $4 billion? Each year it went up progressively under the Senator Walters Government. It went up progressively until, in the last report, it was nearly $1.000m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These are the crude figures which people who are as astute as Senator Walters might have read if they had bothered to be interested. Of course, that is the whole problem; the Government is not interested in this issue. The Attorney- General and Mr Howard, the Treasurer, knew all this. Why did not the Attorney- General take an interest in what was going on in his Department as a result of the existence of the test case in 1975? Did he not know? Did he not care? There has been a solid factual foundation for that test case, in Mr Brinsden's opinion , in the opinion of the Costigan Royal Commission and in the opinions of four independent Queen's counsel. There was no basis in law or fact for the abandonment of the prosecution by the Crown Solicitor in 1979. It was due to incompetence. It was due to lack of will to prosecute. The Deputy Crown Solicitor, the Taxation Office, the Australian Federal Police and the Crown Solicitor had all been advised of the solid basis for the prosecution of that test case. </PARA>
<PARA> How can two Ministers say in the Parliament that they did not know, were not aware or were unsure of the basis of action? There has always been a solid legal foundation for prosecution of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. It was availble for criminal prosecution under the Crimes Act, at common law, under company law and under State crimes Acts. A vast body of legal weaponry was available to an Attorney-General with the will to prosecute. The passage of the 1980 legislation , the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act, was not necessary to stamp out these schemes. The Royal Commissioner said:</PARA>
<PARA> The answer lies not in new laws but in enforcement of the old. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at the role of the Treasurer in this affair. He has always said that the old laws were ineffective. In a Press release on 28 May this year he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I have been advised by the Taxation Office that prior to the prosecution of the December 1980 Act there were no effective avenues for prosecution under the then existing law either Commonwealth or State which could have been pursued. </PARA>
<PARA>I heard the Prime Minister talking about this a little while ago. He has found a new scapegoat-officers of the Attorney-General's Department; public servants suffering from inertia and things of that kind. That is a confession of 'not guilty but incompetent'. That is what the Prime Minister is saying if he accepts his own standards about government. As the Royal Commissioner pointed out, the old laws were effective; there was just no will to enforce them. This Government knew or ought to have known that the old laws were effective. There is nobody in this country who ought to have known that more than the Attorney-General. Contrary to Mr Howard's Press release, which I have just quoted, there were effective avenues for prosecution under the existing laws. The Treasurer is either misleading the Parliament or he has not informed himself. Either way, he is culpable. There were four other legal opinions which established that there was a basis for prosecution and they were known to this Government. Of course, the Taxation Office knew what was going on throughout this period. It appears in the annual reports of the Commissioner of Taxation. The Treasurer should acknowledge that as early as 1974 or 1975 these opinions were available. In his Press statement issued on 27 June 1981 on the McCabe-Lafranchi report, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of further discussion which took place over the period 1976-1979 it became clear that there was no foundation on which the prosecutions could have successfully been launched. </PARA>
<PARA>This is an attempt to cover up deficiencies and inaction. The passage of 1980 legislation took place years after Mr Howard must have known that the tax avoidance industry rorts were taking place to the enormous extent they were. What is clear is that this Government knew, in which case it is culpable, or it ought to have known, in which case it is negligent, as early as 1976 about a massive criminal fraud, and it had easy remedies to deal with it. As a result of its failure to use those remedies, the tax burden in this country has been shifted, as Professor Mathews said, from the rich to the poor. Senator Chaney concedes that one million people are living in poverty. The Government had top level legal opinions to support prosecutions but it did nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Durack is the chief law officer in this country. He is responsible for protecting the laws of the Commonwealth. With the Treasurer, he is responsible for protecting the revenue. He is responsible for launching prosecutions. He is responsible for the Attorney-General's Department which, according to the Royal Commissioner, at the Deputy Crown Solicitor level is in a disgraceful mess; it did nothing about these matters. The Attorney of this country did not interest himself in a major test case against tax avoiders. If he had he would have said to his law officers: 'What is my Department doing about this issue?' He would have received an answer, or he should have received an answer. If he did not receive an answer he should have said: 'Well, get on with it'. He knew what the issue was all about. To say that section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act will help him in that respect is to ignore the substance and reality of the issue. He is culpable. He presided over all this mess and, on any notion of ministerial responsibility, he is responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether Ministers of this Government have any standards left. But if they do they must be the standards which the Prime Minister set, or has talked about over a long period. This was going to be a Government without impropriety. In 1972 he said:</PARA>
<PARA> If a major blunder occurred in a department, of real importance to Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that this is an enormous blunder; I suppose one could call it that . It is an enormous cover-up-worse than a blunder. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> If a major blunder occurred in a department, of real importance to Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought it was pretty important to Australia. The Prime Minister has been talking his head off about it in the last fortnight. It is important in terms of revenue lost and the burden which is being imposed on the ordinary people in this country. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>and if the Minister were unaware of it, the Minister should accept responsibility for the mistakes of his department and offer to resign. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Durack pleads that he was unaware of it. Nobody in this country, other than the Attorney-General, could live in a more blissful state of ignorance. Nobody could live in a more ignorant bliss. He knows that this has been an issue which goes to the social and political morality of this country. We have said it here over the years. The Government cannot impose additional burdens on lowly paid people if it condones this sort of thing. It has been said dozens of times in the Senate alone and it has been said in public. The Attorney's defence to that is: 'Well, I was ignorant. Those fellows in the Attorney-General's Department did not tell me'. He should have found out. It is his job to find out . Of course, the Prime Minister has even higher standards than that, standards which have brought the demise of some honest Ministers. The Prime Minister once said. </PARA>
<PARA> The community rightly demand a high standard from the Ministers of the Government. The judgments on Ministers are more exacting and sometimes more harsh than the judgments which might be passed on those outside the sphere of public life. If these high standards were not upheld, the people's confidence in Government-a confidence which is fundamental to Australian democracy-would be undermined. </PARA>
<PARA>My God, that has happened. The people's confidence in this Government has been undermined. As I said at the beginning, the Government will go out on the same slogan with which it came in: 'People are concerned to end the tax rip-off'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Button, brings in the Senate this afternoon a motion of censure on the Government for its failure, and the failure of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and myself in particular, in the administration of legislation relating to criminal and civil offences against tax laws, resulting in what he calls a multi-billion dollar fraud against the Commonwealth, and calls for the resignation of the Treasurer and myself. The Government rejects the censure raised against it. In another place this afternoon the Treasurer has rejected the call for his resignation and I reject the call for mine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The motion moved by Senator Button has been moved by the leader of the Australian Labor Party, a party which is a newcomer to this sense of indignation which it now tries to portray about tax avoidance. It was when the Labor Party was in government from 1972 to 1975 that the tax avoidance industry in this country began. One of the first and most serious schemes, and what proved to be probably the forerunner in the tax avoidance industry, was a scheme known as the Curran scheme. The Curran scheme was well known to the Labor Government in 1974. The Treasurer of the day, Mr Crean, said that it would close the loophole, but it was never closed by the Labor Government at any time before it went out of office. Now we have this indignation expressed by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden, the man who was Treasurer in that Government in 1975 and who allowed the tax avoidance industry really to get going with the Curran scheme. It did nothing whatever--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tax avoidance industry, as I said, began to show its face in the years of the Labor Government and was ignored by the Labor Government when it knew perfectly well of the existence of one of the first and worst types of tax avoidance schemes; the Curran scheme. Now, at this very late stage, and I will deal more with the role of this Government later, the Opposition is trying to cash in with the widespread and quite proper indignation in the community about tax avoidance. Senator Button in his motion, the form of which has become rather familiar in Senator Button's motions, talks about the failure of the Government to enforce tax laws and criminal and civil laws, resulting in a multi -billion dollar fraud. One would imagine from that that he is talking generally about the loss of revenue. But as he presents his case, he is referring to the particular case which has been highlighted in the report of Mr Costigan's Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. Of course, the revenue that may be lost may well be hundreds of millions; nobody knows exactly what the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes amount to, but they are certainly not multi-billion dollar frauds as a whole. The schemes that the Government has tackled and stamped out may well otherwise have resulted in multi -billion dollar losses. The Opposition just picks figures out of the air, without making an estimate of any sure kind. Of course, it makes much better politics to talk, now, about multi-billion dollar losses. As I have said, from time to time the total losses flowing from particular schemes have been assessed by the Commissioner of Taxation. Certainly, they run into hundreds of millions of dollars but not, as far as the Government is aware, figures of the kind that the Opposition is trying to make people believe by reiterating scare estimates of this type.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition is also trying to suggest, by its motion, that the loss of all this revenue represents a failure on the part of the Government to administer existing laws. But what is the Opposition's policy in relation to tax avoidance? What policy does it say the Government should adopt? It says that the law should be changed, and changed retrospectively. The Australian Labor Party's answer to the problem of tax avoidance now, having ignored the problem when it was in government and for a good deal of its time in Opposition, is to promise to change all of the existing laws and do so with reprospective effect. That is the Labor Party's policy. Yet today it tries to censure the Government because, it says, the Government has not administered the existing laws; that if we had done so the multi-billion dollar loss of revenue to which it refers would have been avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Government found the existing laws inadequate to meet the problem. Senator Sir John Carrick, who will speak later in the debate, will table a schedule of all the changes to existing laws which this Government has introduced under the leadership of the Treasurer, John Howard. Mr Howard is probably the first Federal Treasurer who has had to face such a massive tax avoidance problem, but he has responded to the challenge in a most active, vigorous and successful way. The so-called existing laws had proved inadequate; new laws were needed. The response of the Government was to introduce new laws and, in doing so, it succeeded significantly in stamping out the tax avoidance industry. It did not-and could not-stamp it out by administering existing laws, be they civil or criminal. I repeat, extensive new laws were needed. I am not merely talking about the individual case which Labor supporters seem to think represents the only issue involved. The straw, or bottom-of-the-harbour company is the product of only one of a large number of tax avoidance schemes that were introduced. That massive avoidance was not discovered by the Opposition. It was not discovered by Mr Costigan. The Government knew of the great variety of tax avoidance schemes in existence and acted against them. The schedule of the numerous measures that have been introduced by the Treasurer, John Howard, since 1977, and passed by the Parliament, will reveal the great activity on the part of the Government in changing the laws with the direct aim of stamping out various tax avoidance schemes which had arisen. </PARA>
<PARA> We came to government at a time when the tax avoidance industry was getting under way. As I have said, one of its earlier schemes had been ignored completely by the Labor Government. We stamped out that scheme by special legislation. We were also faced with a number of decisions of the High Court of Australia which revealed that the existing laws were not adequate. Time and again the Court's decisions showed that new laws were needed. For many years we had thought that a general dragnet provision, section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act-which, briefly, states that arrangements entered into with the object of avoiding tax are null and void-could be used to strike down tax avoidance schemes. But, as a result of decisions of the High Court, that also virtually became a dead letter. What was the response of the Government to those High Court decisions? Numerous individual Acts, which succeeded in stamping out such schemes, were introduced and passed. But the industry had grown so large, had become so flourishing, and had so much wealth at its disposal that as soon as one scheme was stamped out another tended to crop up. Before the Commissioner of Taxation had time to become aware of these schemes, large losses of revenue accrued. The Government decided to try to deal with the problem, since section 260 had proven ineffective, by implementing a new general provision. Over those years a great deal of work had to be done to find a new, better and, it was to be hoped, foolproof section of the Act to replace section 260. That was implemented in new Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which was passed by the Parliament a little over a year ago. I believe that reveals the very active policy of this Government to deal with tax avoidance specifically, directly and, as has fortunately, proven to be the case, successfully. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the specific case that we are discussing. It is one of numerous examples of tax avoidance which came to the attention of the Government over these years. As the Treasurer has said in statements issued during the recess- and again in the House today-the existence of so-called bottom-of-the-harbour or straw company schemes became known to the Government in about the middle of 1978 . They were brought to the Treasurer's attention by the Commissioner of Taxation . At about that time the Commissioner of Taxation had also raised the matter with the Crown Solicitor. There was, as the Treasurer and I have now become aware, this case in Perth. Let me make it quite clear-although I believe the Opposition accepts it as fact-that this case, which had first been referred to the Crown Solicitor in Perth in 1974, did not become known to the Treasurer or myself until after the McCabe-Lafranchi report was brought down this year. That particular case, and the opinion that had been given by Mr Brinsden in that case was--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply wish to clear up that fact because the matter has been raised. As I have said, the specific case was not known to us. But in 1978 we knew of the problem. The Commissioner of Taxation had become concerned at the number of cases that had come to his attention. The matter was discussed with the Crown Law authorities and the views expressed by the Crown Law authorities were that there would be difficulties with the existing law, particularly with the criminal provisions as they existed because they were not specifically tailored to that particular type of scheme. Then the Treasurer, this having been brought to his attention, commenced to develop a new law, the toughest law of all-what became the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. That legislation was introduced and passed by this Parliament at the end of 1980. That law was one which did introduce-it is unusual in our tax laws-very specific criminal offences concerned with tax avoidance. That was the response that we took, as a government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer and I are now said to be specifically responsible and I do not deny the general responsibility that we have in this matter. That was the response of the Government to that scheme which had been brought to its attention. It was one of a number of schemes brought to the attention of the Government over those years. The response by the Government was to introduce special legislation. The Government's response to the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes was the development of special legislation, the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. On all sides it is recognised that that Act was successful in dealing with those schemes, as other Acts have been successful in dealing with specific tax avoidance schemes. That, coupled with the general provision of the new Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act introduced last year, has had dramatic effects on the tax avoidance industry, to the extent that people are now saying that the tax avoidance industry has largely been brought to its knees . It has been brought to its knees because of the constant activities of this Government since it became fully aware of the problem in 1977 and 1978. Since those years this Government and the Treasurer, I believe with a great deal of legal assistance from officers of the Attorney-General's Department and the Parliamentary Counsel, have produced this highly successful stamping out of the tax avoidance industry. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, Mr Costigan in his third report and now in his fourth report talks a great deal about the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. The Opposition seems to be suggesting that this is the first time that the nature of the bottom-of- the-harbour or straw company avoidance schemes has become publicly known. That is not so; they were known to the Parliament. We brought in the legislation in 1980 and the Treasurer, in introducing the Bill, laid out the reasons for it. All that is new in the Costigan report is the recounting of the way in which a particular case had been handled in the Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth. In answer to questions earlier today and in my statement yesterday I made it clear that the Government does not condone the way in which the matter was handled in either the Perth office or the Central Office of the Crown Solicitor. But it is not prepared to accept as the final proof of the matter all of the findings of the royal commission. The people working in these offices have legal rights and actions would have to be taken in accordance with the existing law before those matters could finally be determined. I do not want to make any further comment on the findings because they are the subject of consideration under the Public Service Act. In the other cases, promoters and operators of these schemes will possibly be subject to prosecution. I have indicated what steps are being taken in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to say-Senator Evans has made quite a feature of this matter-that the views of the Crown Solicitor and his associates about the adequacy of existing legislation were formed in absolute good faith. They had very good reasons for taking those views. I believe that the advice they gave to the Government that a new law was required was sound and sensible, even though it may turn out as a result of successful prosecutions that the existing law was adequate. We do not yet know whether that will be so. Yet Senator Evans comes in here and pontificates about the matter as though it was all cut and dried that the opinions he has referred to, including his own, will be shown to be correct. Nobody knows that. That is basically why the Crown Law authorities formed the view that new laws were needed. As I have said, the new laws have proved effective. The mere passage of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act was a most effective method of stamping out these practices. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there are grounds for prosecution under the Act, those prosecutions will be undertaken. The Act has been in force now for over 18 months. Everybody recognises that few schemes have come to light since then, and they are being looked at to see whether there should be prosecutions. That is the Government's response. The Government has a proud record of achievement in tackling tax avoidance. Despite what has been said, the Government has been well served by many dedicated public servants in the Taxation Office, the Crown Solicitor's Office and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel over these years. The Taxation Office has identified these schemes and brought them to the attention of the Government. The Treasurer responded readily and got the Government to pass special legislation. A great deal of work was done by legal officers in my Department in drafting and advising in respect of legislation. So I think that a sense of perspective is required in relation to the report of Mr Costigan. As I said, I do not necessarily accept all that he has said. Even if one does accept the report, the fact of the matter is that it deals with the performance of a few people only and it is not and should not be seen to be a reflection on the many Crown Law officials and officials of the Attorney-General 's Department who are highly competent lawyers and dedicated servants of the Government and of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the matters with which I have dealt, which will be followed up in much more detail in the schedules that Senator Sir John Carrick will table, completely refute the Opposition's motion, and they are the reason why the Government rejects it and why the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and I have rejected the calls for our resignation. As a result of the work that has been done by the Treasurer personally and by his Department, I believe that we have got on top of the tax avoidance industry. Of course this will require continual vigilance. That is why I outlined yesterday in my statement the steps that the Government is taking to prosecute vigorously if possible--</PARA>

The sums of money involved, the losses involved, Senator Chaney-unless you are about to put on public record some losses about which we do not yet know, through your Western Australian mates or by some other means, in the history of Tory government in Australia-have been absolutely phenomenal by any standards. The failure in administration involved has not been simply a matter of minor peccadilloes. These have been no mere temporary or understandable lapses on the part of officials or politicians. This is no mere tuppeny-ha'penny kind of a matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The loss involved to the nation's resources, as Mr Costigan has pointed out, is on a literally incalculable scale. His own estimate is in terms of hundreds if not thousands of millions of dollars. But even if we accept the Government's own very cautious, very self-favouring estimate of only about $450m having been lost , which it believes is potentially recoverable in this area, we are clearly talking about staggering and unprecedentedly large sums of money. It is for this reason that this censure motion is directed in the first instance against the Government as a whole, because it is a failure of government, of Government will and Government competence, that is staggering in its dimensions. It is a failure which acutely reveals the hollowness of the Government's pretensions, repeated again by the Minister today, to be seriously concerned with tax avoidance and tax evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government as a whole has sought to avoid blame in this matter by saying, I guess, three things. First, the Government says that there were genuine legal doubts as to whether prosecutions would lie in these matters. Secondly, it says that to the extent that there was indefensible maladministration within the Perth branch of the Crown Solicitor's Office, the two officers most immediately involved and still on deck have now been suspended. Thirdly, the Government says that it is taking a variety of other measures involving prosecutions, the establishment of a special prosecutorial task force and the establishment of the proposed new crime commission to clear away the mess and ensure that it does not recur. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall return shortly to the first point about the adequacy of the legal opinions and legal data available on this matter. As to the other points in the Government's defence-a defence extraordinarily feebly mounted by the Attorney- General (Senator Durack) today-this can be said. As to the suspensions of the officers, as to the procedure with the prosecutions that is now contemplated and as to the establishment of the task force, it is a matter of too little, too late. An ounce of effective prevention would have been, here as always, worth a ton of after-the-event cure. As to the establishment of the crimes commission, I believe that this is not so much a matter of too little, too late, as too much, too soon. That is because there is simply no evidence before us, least of all in anything in the Costigan report, that there is any serious deficiency in our existing law enforcement machinery, either on the investigative side or at the prosecutorial level, in terms of the substantive law and the machinery available to implement that law. All the evidence is in fact to the contrary-that the law was perfectly well equipped, and always has been, to deal with these matters; but what has failed has been the implementation of that law. </PARA>
<PARA> There is much more that could be said about the failure of the Government as a whole in this matter, the hypocrisy of its leadership in these tax avoidance and evasion questions, its incompetence, its apathy, its lack of will, and its lack of performance. I believe that it is appropriate in the circumstances of this debate to come quickly, as the terms of the censure motion do, to the Ministers most immediately involved-the Attorney-General, who has just spoken, and the Treasurer, Mr Howard. </PARA>
<PARA> The nub of the indictment against the Attorney-General can be expressed very simply. In the first place, it is difficult to believe that he did not know what was going on in his own Department, and if he did know what was going on there, he is culpable and obliged to resign. Secondly, if the Attorney-General did not know what was going on in his Department through the latter 1970s, he should have known and should have done something about it, and he is equally culpable in negligence, and equally he should resign. Thirdly, even if he did not know, and even if-which I do not accept-he could not be expected to have known what was going on, then he should offer to resign anyway, because of the magnitude of the disaster involved for the Australian nation as a result of his purported performance of his ministerial duties. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us begin with the first propositions-that the Attorney-General either must have known or should have known about what was going on in his own departmental backyard. The Opposition can accept and understand any claim that the Minister neither knew nor could be expected to know of the Perth test case prosecution strategy before 1977-78, even though the scheme which was the subject of that test case strategy was discovered, as we all know, as early as 1973, and even though a prosecution in that crucial test case was authorised under the Labour Government as early as August 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Treasurer made clear in his statement on 27 June-this is one of the few things that were clear in his statement-the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes involved remained pretty minor, pretty exotic and pretty fringe in character up until 1977-78. It was not until then that the schemes really took off. It was not until 1977-78 that the avoidance and evasion involved in the operation of these schemes really became a problem of enormous magnitude for the government of the day. There is a quite bizarre logic, as I have pereceived it, on the part of Senator Durack in his attempt to put some of the blame on the Labor Government for the now prosecution of and the non-effective dealing with bottom- of-the-harbour schemes. Out of the mouth of the Treasurer, the Attorney's fellow Minister, came a very explicit and lengthy statement in justification of that Minister's own performance-that nobody could have been expected to move seriously and appreciate the gravity of the issues involved until 1977-78; in other words, nearly two years after this Government had come into office. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, as Mr Howard has said, and as everyone knows, by 1977-78 these schemes had taken off. They were running at a blinding pace. The reason they were running at a blinding pace was that every one of the promoters around the country who was getting into this area realised there had been a failure of will , nerve or competence on the part of this Government and there had been no prosecutions, no serious remedial action taken, even though it was known that some of the schemes had come to the attention of the authorities. By March 1978 at the latest, there was a clear knowledge-again, on the face of the evidence contained in the Costigan report-of the nature of these schemes and what was involved in them by the senior man in the Crown Solicitor's division, the Crown Solicitor himself, Mr Neaves. By March, April, May 1978 discussions had been taking place at the highest possible bureaucratic level in this area between the Federal Commissioner of Taxation and Mr Neaves, the Crown Solicitor. Clearly there was high level bureaucratic concern or if not concern, then at least attention being paid to these schemes at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe we must assume that these discussions also involved the ministerial heads of those departments. Even if one does not accept that-Senator Durack for his own sake has denied it explicitly here in the Parliament today-it is certainly the case that both Ministers were involved by 1979-80 in the general area covered by the test case to which I referred regarding counter-action by the Government against bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. Of course, they should have been involved by 1979-80. They should have been involved at least three years earlier. On their own account they were certainly involved at this stage. As John Howard has said, they were involved in working actively on legislative strategies during this period, work which culminated in the probably now unnecessary enactment at the end of 1980 of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It is beyond belief that questions were not asked at this stage, at least and into 1979 by Senator Durack and Mr Howard of their senior officers as to what was going in regard to the prosecution of these schemes under the existing tax law. If those questions were asked it is beyond belief that the Attorney-General for one could have been satisfied with the answers that he was then given. He must have known that a prosecution had been authorised as far back as August 1975 on the basis of high level Queen's Counsel legal advice which was available at that time. He must have known that that prosecution was supported, as I said, by high level legal opinions. He must have known that there were no good reasons , other than incompetence, negligence or corruption, as to why that prosecution had not been subsequently carried through. He must have learnt then in 1978-79 and in the run up to 1980, if not before, of the festering mess in his own Crown Solicitor's division within the Attorney-General's Department, particularly in Perth. I have no doubt that the mess existed in many other parts of this country . I put it on notice now, for the benefit of the Attorney-General, his officers, the Crown Solicitor and the Deputy Crown Solicitors in a number of the States, that in the Estimates committee hearings in this place in two weeks time they can expect a very thorough examination as to the quality of their adminstration of this aspect of the Government bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Two defences are mounted by the Attorney-General and, indeed, by the Government as a whole, to these sorts of allegations about what they either must have known or-if one does not accept that-what they should have known at this period. The two defences are in terms, first, of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act and, secondly, the lawyers' opinions which apparently, it is claimed, were divided on the question of the credibility or the possibility of prosecutions in this area. Let me get the record straight in regard of section 16. In relevant part, sub-section (1), states:</PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of this section, 'officer' means a person who is or has been appointed or employed by the Commonwealth or by a State, and who by reason of that appointment or employment, or in the course of that employment, may acquire or has acquired information respecting the affairs of any other person, disclosed or obtained under the provisions of this Act or of any previous law of the Commonwealth relating to Income Tax. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not read the whole of the legislative scheme; just the relevant parts. So the nature of the information which is not to be disclosed by any such tax official is:</PARA>
<PARA>information respecting the affairs of any person. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a specific provision in section 16-sub-section (5A)-which does deal explicitly with the position of Ministers of the Crown. In relevant part, the sub-section states:</PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of sub-sections (2) and (5), an officer or person shall be deemed to have communicated such information to another person in contravention of those sub-sections if he communicates that information to any Minister or to any Minister of the Crown of a State. </PARA>
<PARA>The legal point which I am making-I hope not too boringly, but it is crucial to the understanding of the credibility of the Government in this debate-is that the only prohibition on the communication of information to Ministers of the Crown by tax officials is information which is described here as 'such information'. The part containing the words 'such information' is a reference back to section 16 (1) which states:</PARA>
<PARA>information respecting the affairs of any person. </PARA>
<PARA>It is absolutely clear from any first year law student's interpretation of that legislation that all the officers are prohibited from doing is communicating to Ministers, or for that matter to anyone else who is not expressly exempt, information which identifies the affairs of a particular person. There is not, never has been and never could be in any rational tax legislation any prohibition on the communication of generalised information or information which has been sterilised of the names of the individuals concerned. There has always been communication to Treasurers by senior tax officials of information about the way in which particular schemes have operated. That information has been put forward on the basis of the experience of the tax officers concerned in particular cases, but has been put forward in a way-just as Mr Costigan's report has been put forward-that does not identify the people involved. Let us have no more of this canard about the secrecy provisions of section 16. Of course they stop the revelation of the names of the people concerned. But they did not and could not have stopped the revelation to the Ministers concerned of the nature of the schemes and the litigation strategy that was being employed to deal with them. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that is made in purported defence of these allegations is that the lawyers' opinions were divided. At Question Time today we dealt with what those lawyers' opinions amounted to. It will be recalled that I asked the Attorney-General to table certain documents so that we could all judge for ourselves the credibility and weight of the respective opinions involved. I did make the point then, which I make again now, that the overwhelming weight of the legal opinion, which we know was given in the context of dealing with these bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, was overwhelmingly on the side of the capacity of the people involved in those schemes-in the particular cases on which the lawyers in question were advising-being successfully prosecuted under the Crimes Act, the Companies Act or under common criminal law. In some cases it was argued by the lawyers involved that civil recovery under the law of misfeasance would apply. I repeat for the record-because I do not think Senator Durack could possibly have heard what I was saying at Question Time-that the opinions that we know about are as follows: Mr Brinsden, Q.C., in January 1975 advised the Deputy Crown Solicitor's office in Perth, which had sought that opinion, that a prosecution in the particular test case could be successfully brought under section 86 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act and that the liquidator could take action successfully for misfeasance to recover the lost tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In June 1975 Mr Brinsden, Q.C., gave a further opinion which concerned the sufficiency of the evidence available in that case to sustain a prosecution. Early in 1976 we have a Sydney Queen's Counsel, in a matter referred to by Mr Costigan at page 40 of his report in relation to Norfolk Island, advising again that there could be prosecutions for conspiracy under section 86 of the Crimes Act in these bottom-of-the-harbour circumstances. In November 1976 we have the Commonwealth Police conducting its own investigation and it is not entirely ignorant, or other than suspicious, when it comes to the applicability of the law to particular fact situations. For what it is worth, in 1976 we have the Commonwealth Police confirming affirmatively the ability of the Perth test case prosecution to lie. </PARA>
<PARA> In July 1978 we have Mr Traill, Q.C., giving strong advice that misfeasance provisions applied at common law and were capable of being set in train in relation to bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. Again, some time during 1978, we had the opinion from Mr Ormiston and Dr Spry, two silks from the Melbourne Bar, referring again, dealing again and confirming again the prosecutability, if you like, of these cases under the law of misfeasance. In September 1978 we had an opinion from a Melbourne Queen's Counsel. I have seen it. I know it exists although I am unable to say who the author of it is because of the circumstances in which it appeared. The opinion was derived by the liquidator, appointed by the Commissioner of Taxation, of Kierad Pty Ltd, again saying that criminal prosecutions could succeed. At the end of 1980 we had some rather self- interested opinions of a general nature, but for what they are worth they should be mentioned, from Mr Forsyth, Q.C., of the Melbourne Bar and Mr Russell, Q.C., and Mr Davies, Q.C., from the Melbourne Bar, supplied by the Law Institute of Victoria as part of its lobbying campaign against the necessity for any new legislation in this area. In July 1982 the Solicitor-General's own opinion was supplied to the Treasurer about the applicability of existing provisions, under the Companies Act certainly, and other areas of prosecution as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Against all those opinions, 10 in total, all that the Attorney-General was able to muster by way of counter evidence, all that Mr Howard was able to muster by way of countervailing material, were the apparently oral doubts and neuroses of the incompetent Mr Gleedman in the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth, the utterly generalised and inexplicit, unspecific letter of the Crown Solicitor to the Commissioner of Taxation dated 3 April 1979, a letter which Mr Costigan refers to in his report as not condescending to particulars, and a further letter from the Crown Solicitor dated 29 September 1980 confirming that earlier advice, again without descending to any detail, any reasoned argument, in support of it. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to all of that material, we have Mr Costigan's own very thorough, very rigorous analysis of the law in the text of the report. It just staggers my comprehension that the Attorney-General could still be expressing doubts, concerns, worries for other than self-interested reasons now about the applicability of the law to these particular cases. Unless he is putting himself on the same legal level as the ill-starred Mr Gledman and his successors in the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth, that kind of reservation, that kind of qualification, that kind of attempt to raise queries about the applicability of legislation that already existed in this particular area just does not stand up. The most charitable explanation for the Attorney-General's behaviour is that he was not corrupt, not looking after his Perth mates, but simply that he was incompetent in his conduct of his portfolio, that he was incapable to the point of culpable negligence of supervising the affairs of his Department in the interests of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had, of course, another attempt by Senator Durack in what he said to deal with the criticisms, the nub and thrust of the objections that have been put again today by the Australian Labor Party. He said that the Government's record in the area of tax achievement, far from being the kind of disaster that I and others have been saying it is and that Mr Costigan said it is, is a proud record of achievement. We have had a long tirade from Senator Durack today about the multiplicity of efforts by this Government, the multiplicity of legislative solutions advanced by this Government, to solve the alarmingly mounting problem of tax evasion and tax avoidance in this community. All I can say about that is that there has been a great deal of debate in this Parliament on a number of occasions, most recently last week, about the effectiveness of this particular strategy on the part of the Government. There are very different views in existence, which I have no time now to summarise yet again, about the whole foundations of the legislative approach that has been adopted by this Government with its multiple piecemeal attempts to close off particular loopholes long after the horses in question have bolted. But there is not only a legislative objection to the nature of the Government's remedial efforts in this area; there is also an objection based on the failure of that performance at an administrative level. There is no better person to quote in expressing that objection than the Commissioner of Taxation himself who, in his sixtieth annual report, for the year 1980-81, had this to say about the quality of this Government's anti-tax avoidance anti-tax evasion effort. I quote from page 12 of that report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> In the 59th year and earlier Reports I recorded the adverse effect that investigations of tax avoidance activities had upon limited staff resources and collections of tax. Unfortunately I am unable to record any significant improvement for 1980-81. The number of experienced staff required to be allocated to the additional work of detecting, monitoring, investigating and contesting tax avoidance schemes continues to make serious inroads into the resources available for other administrative functions. </PARA>
<PARA>Further down the page the Commissioner says:</PARA>
<PARA> As a result, some $973m of tax assessed in tax avoidance schemes that are under administrative challenge remained uncollected at the end of June 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Out of the mouth of the Commissioner of Taxation himself comes yet another indictment of the quality of this Government's tax avoidance-tax evasion strategy, if it can be dignified with that label. There can and has been debate, as I have said, about the merits of this or that strategy for dealing with this or that class of tax avoidance problem as it appears, and there will be many such classes of problem that do appear and will continue to appear. The advertisement from Mr Clyne in the financial Press this week must give the lie to anyone who confidently asserts that tax avoidance in this country is now dead . </PARA>
<PARA> There may be room for debate on the general level, but there is not and never has been any room for debate about what was the appropriate strategy for dealing with the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. The appropriate strategy was to get hold of a test case as soon as one could possibly be found, pick up that test case and run with it, hard and fast, through the courts, with every possible administrative and executive level endeavour behind that process. What was needed, and what was needed no later than 1976, 1977 and 1978 at the latest, were sharp, tough, quick, sure-footed remedial actions-finding the right case, taking that case to the courts and giving it the disincentive effect on other promoters that that obviously would have had. What the Government got from Senator Durack was not sharp, tough, quick, sure-footed remedial action of this kind but action which, at its most charitable, can be described as more like the dithering of an elderly granny. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will add 'grandfather'. The Minister's behaviour was deplorably weak, deplorably late and deplorably insufficient to cope with the magnitude of the circumstances that were presented. The Attorney-General has been, and the record demonstrates it, culpably negligent in the administration of his office, and if the Westminster system means anything his obligation is to pick up his bags and go from that office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us come to the last point. Even if none of that argument is accepted about the role, the personal responsibility, the personal culpability, if you like, of the Attorney-General, even if he did not know anything about what was going on until McCabe-Lafranchi, and even if we accept that he was entitled not to know anything about what was going on or not going on in the prosecution of these schemes, the same conclusion holds. He should pick up his bags and tender his resignation to the Prime Minister of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason is the magnitude of the blunder, the magnitude of the losses that have been involved to the Australian nation, to the taxpayers of this nation and the significance of that blunder, that colossal blunder, to the whole of this country. That puts this case in a very different league from the run-of-the-mill departmental errors that plague the administration of any government, for which Ministers, traditionally in the Westminster system, used to be held liable under the principles of individual ministerial responsibility but which, in current practice, which I readily acknowledge is the case and have said as much in the Freedom of Information Report which I signed, tends not to in fact be the case. But for once in his life I believe that Mr Fraser got the constitutional principles just about right when he dealt with this matter in his 1972 speech- already quoted by Senator Button-to the Australian Institute of Political Science, in the course of which he said, and I will use his exact words:</PARA>
<PARA> But if a major blunder occurred in a department, of real importance to Australia, and if the Minister were unaware of it, the Minister should . . . . accept responsibility for the mistakes of his department and offer to resign. </PARA>
<PARA>Several qualifications are built into that-if it is a major blunder and if it is of real importance to Australia. How can anyone deny that these criteria were satisfied in this particular case? I ask Senator Sir John Carrick, who is going to follow me, whether he accepts Malcolm Fraser's statement in 1972 as an accurate account of that part of the convention of individual ministerial responsibility these days. If he does not accept it I ask him to explain why not , because there is no doubt about its applicability here. Yesterday the Attorney -General was asked at a Press Conference whether he accepted responsibility for what went on in his Department and he replied, as of course he had to, that of course he did. Today, in the House of Representatives, we had Mr Fraser, the Prime Minister, saying that the situation in the Attorney-General's Department was 'inexcusable'. The only honourable thing for this Attorney-General to do, even if we accept-as I do not believe we should-that he did not have any particular personal culpability in this whole sorry affair, is to tender his resignation. </PARA>
<PARA> The failure of the Government and the failure of these two Ministers-Mr Howard' s faults have been dealt with much more elaborately in the other place-to administer effectively the tax legislation of this country is deplorable and contemptible. There has never been a bigger administrative failure in the history of this country and there has never been a better deserved censure motion than this. </PARA>

The people of Australia know, and know quite clearly and without qualification, that the two Ministers under attack by the Australian Labor Party-the Treasurer, Mr Howard, and the Attorney-General, Senator Durack-are men of massive integrity and men of great ability. Let the public judge. They are also men who have done more than any others in this field and in seeking justice and reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps the best thing for me to do is to take Senator Evans's advice. He said that what should have been done by a government-I use his words-was for that government to pick up a test case and run hard and fast through the courts. Let me describe how, for three years, the Whitlam Government picked up a test case and ran hard and fast through the courts. The Opposition's whole case rests upon the fact that action should have taken place and that Ministers should have known-that everybody should have known. Incidentally, both Senator Button and Senator Evans invited us to accept a very simple thing-that Costigan is right; we have to accept Costigan. So let us accept Costigan. According to Mr Costigan:</PARA>
<PARA> This scheme was first detected in a widespread manner by the Australian Taxation Office in 1973. </PARA>
<PARA>That was year one of the Whitlam Government. Indeed, he goes on to say that his investigation reached fruition in mid-1974. So with 18 months to go before being removed from office, the Labor Government had the knowledge. Did in fact the Treasurer of the day and the Attorney-General of the day have the knowledge of this situation to apply this test? Indeed-I will quote Costigan as I go-the report queries whether in fact there were only a few cases then. Mr Costigan said that the belief that there were only a few cases: 'may reflect merely a lack of knowledge as to its full extent'. In other words, here was a government that did not know what was going on. Here is the proof. Mr Costigan goes on to state that on 4 September 1974 the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation said to the Deputy Crown Solicitor:</PARA>
<PARA> The recovery of company tax in this case and other cases . . . . raises issues which could have far reaching implications on the collection of company tax generally. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Costigan went on to say that Mr Brinsden had delivered his opinion in the Christmas vacation of 1974-again, a year beforehand. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> His firm advice was that the promoter and two others should be charged with a breach of Section 86 (e) of the Crimes Act, and that they should be subjected to certain civil proceedings which I will describe later. </PARA>
<PARA>So more than a year before the Labor Government went out of office, by the test of Senator Button and Senator Evans, the officers knew, the Ministers should have known and the case was ready. Indeed, in July 1975, the Deputy Crown Solicitor in Perth was instructed:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it has been decided that action under section 86 of the Crimes Act . . . should be commenced against (the three men) as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>No such action was taken. So, taking Senator Evans's point that the right way to do it is to pick up a test case and run hard and fast through the courts and, indeed, that the officers and the Ministers should know, I took this Senate through three years of Costigan and the Whitlam Government, and throughout that period this case was known and identified and the evidence was given; but nothing at all was done to effect a prosecution. In fact it was not taken. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply recite the history of Costigan over three years. The fact of the matter is that this information has come to hand not by inadvertence but by the actions of Liberal governments. First of all a Liberal State government in Victoria set up the McCabe-Lafranchi investigation and, of course, now the Cain Government is taking credit for it because it tabled the report. It was a Liberal State government that set out to expose these matters because the Liberals believe that if offences are committed, they should be prosecuted. It was a Liberal Federal government which set up the Royal Commission into the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and indeed widened the Royal Commission's terms of reference so that it could do exactly what has been done in terms of tax avoidance and tax evasion. In fact it widened the terms to the extent that the Commission could look at any breach of the law, including tax avoidance. So the two actions that have exposed these matters to the public have been the actions of Liberal governments. No actions on tax avoidance were undertaken during the Whitlam Government's years of office and yet that Government knew, and its Attorneys must have known, on the arguments put forward, that there were breaches. They were the years in which the famous Curran cases were at their height. What did the Whitlam Government do? It did nothing at all. It took, of course, an incoming Fraser Government to take action in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is a classic example of their failures . Indeed, if we take the test of Senator Evans or Senator Button that the Minister must have known, how is it then that the Government of the day did not know that Mr Gleedman was suffering from hypothalamic depression as he had been for many years? Here was the primary reason why this was delayed. If there was a lack of knowledge, why then is this test not applied? Is it true that senior Labor regimes-</PARA>

<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I will have more to say about the desirability of a secrecy provision that has this effect at a later stage in my Report.

<PARA> It has been alleged that we have been protecting people. The fact of the matter is that the McCabe-Lafranchi initiative was a Liberal initiative to expose. The painters and dockers initiative was a deliberate Liberal initiative to expose these practices. Let me remind the Senate what has happened during our term of office. The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Act (No. 2) 1977 contained two main sections on tax avoidance. The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Act 1978 contains six new sections which relate to tax avoidance. The Sales Tax Assessment (Nos 1 to 9) Amendment Acts 1978 contain sections to counter five specific forms of sales tax avoidance. The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Act (No. 4) 1978 introduced provisions to prevent trafficking in current year loss companies, et cetera. The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Act 1979 contains another series of provisions which deal with such things as trust stripping schemes. The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Act (No. 4) 1979 is again directed against tax avoidance. Other legislation includes the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Act ( No. 5) 1979, the Income Tax Laws Amendment Act 1979 and the Income Tax Laws Amendment Act 1980, all of which are aimed at defeating tax avoidance. Legislation in this respect also includes the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Act 1981 and the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Act 1982. The income tax laws were amended four times in 1981 and also in 1982. Senator Button should listen to this: In 1980 the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act was passed. Senator Button quoted Mr Costigan. I recall that Mr Costigan said that after the passage of that legislation those schemes were prevented. The fact of the matter is that from there on the Government made a series of announcements about its intentions . There are six pages of anti-tax avoidance measures-</PARA>

<PARA> 9 February 1982-announcement that 'expenditure recoupment' provisions would be extended with effect from 24 September 1978 to counter further recoupment type schemes involving rebates and deductions for calls paid on shares in afforestation schemes and rebates for moneys paid on shares in petroleum exploration companies. Any rebate scheme entered into after 9 February 1982 will attract additional tax on the same basis as do schemes covered by Part IVA. </PARA>
<PARA> 11 May 1982-statement aimed at making it clear beyond all doubt that trust stripping schemes can no longer have their intended effect of enabling participants to avoid payment of income tax. If found to be necessary, existing legislation aimed at striking down trust stripping schemes will be strengthened and will include provisions for additional tax at least as great as that which applies to schemes covered by Part IVA. </PARA>
<PARA> 25 July 1982-announcement that action would be taken against illegal evasion involved in ''bottom of the harbour'' schemes. Proposed legislation designed to recover tax from vendor shareholders who evaded company tax by stripping untaxed company profits in schemes carried out before the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 made such schemes a criminal offence. Action against promoters of schemes being considered. </PARA>
<PARA> 10 August 1982-announcement of increase in penalty rates from 10% to 20% applying to late payment of tax. New rate to apply from 2 months after the amendments have become law. General review of level of monetary and other penalties still under way. </PARA>
<PARA> 17 August 1982 (Budget announcement)-announcement of a deduction at source system aimed at evasion in cash economy. To apply (from 1 July 1983) to certain cash payments for labour and services in all industries where evasion of cash payments appears to be significant. </PARA>
<PARA> Announcement that the special legislation announced on 25 July would also apply to recover tax payable on undistributed profits under Division 7 (applying to private companies), where tax has been evaded in company strips. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have taken very strong actions to deal with these matters. The Australian Taxation Office has now identified 3,700 pre-tax profit stripping cases, the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. This Government is acting and is bringing legislation into this Parliament that will deal with each of those cases. The great bulk of these cases precede the Crimes (Taxation Offences ) Act 1980. The Government is to introduce shortly special legislation to recover from vendor shareholders the company tax evaded under these schemes. Australian Taxation offices have been working closely with the Royal Commission. They have been identifying from the Royal Commission hearings any evidence of tax evasion or avoidance, whether in relation to companies or to individuals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A brief has been delivered to senior counsel to advise on evidence and draw charges as appropriate in relation to the particular scheme highlighted by the Royal Commission in its fourth interim report. Advice has been sought from senior counsel in relation to possible criminal proceedings against a major promoter in Sydney. The Government has decided to appoint a special prosecutor to concentrate special effort with a view to prosecution of persons directly involved in promotion of and execution of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. He is to be assisted by a task force of lawyers, taxation officers and police officers . He is to work closely with the Royal Commission. The possibility of a joint effort is to be discussed with Victoria. An enormous number of initiatives have been taken. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to put this matter in perspective again. It comes to this Parliament for debate for two reasons. The first is the McCabe-Lafranchi report which was deliberately commissioned and brought about because Liberal governments wanted to find where there were breaches of the tax laws and, where those breaches could be exposed, they wanted to take steps to obviate them in the future and to impose the necessary penalties. It was because of positive action by the Liberal governments that that exposure has been made, no matter how much a State Labor Government now wants to pick it up and claim the exposure as its own. It was a Liberal government which, after years of abuse by the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and years of claims by people about murder and victimisation, set up the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. The report which was tabled yesterday fully justifies that action . Lest anybody should think that this is not a true perspective, I read a section of the report which members of the Labor Party have not even mentioned. The Costigan report states:</PARA>
<PARA> On this basis there has been selected some 15 murders that took place between 1970 and 1979. The two worst years were 1971, when three murders took place, and 1979, when four took place. In addition, there were a further 23 incidents in which death may well have resulted, and in which death would appear to have been the intended result. In almost all of them the weapon used was a gun and the victim suffered serious gunshot wounds. Thus there is a total of 38 serious incidents of violence, almost all of which involved the use of fire arms. </PARA>
<PARA>That is extraordinary. I quote those remarks only because the Labor Party has run away from the main thrust of the Costigan report which was to reveal to the public the terrible Mafia-like actions of that union. Indeed, whether for that reason or whether to deal with white collar crime, the Commonwealth Government has announced that it proposes, with the help of the States, to set up a crimes commission to get to the very heart of crime, wherever it may occur. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If anyone is caught by the bottom-of-the-drawer schemes it is the Labor Party. Let me repeat what was said by Senator Evans. Of course, Senator Button was not here. Senator Evans's words were: 'Pick up a test case and run hard and fast through the courts'. In three years of Whitlam Government, from 1973 when that Government first knew about it, the case never got to the courts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Costigan report exposes that the Labor Administration did not know about it. Indeed, if that is the case members of the former Labor Government should accept responsibility for the delays in that prosecution. Honourable senators opposite fall down in all their tests. In fact, nobody, with any reality or justification, can challenge the integrity of the two Ministers concerned. Nobody can. These Ministers are people who the community of Australia know to be people of outstanding integrity. They are also people who have very great ability and have had great reformist zeal in what they have been doing. They have carried out those things whereas, of course, the Labor Party did nothing on tax avoidance at all. I have listed the volume of matters that have been brought before this Parliament to pursue tax avoidance. We will pursue each of those incidents to the full. If there are breaches of tax laws and if people owe money to the Commonwealth then we will pursue that. The fact of the matter is that under the previous Government nothing was done; under our Government a very great deal has been done. The Government rejects outright the censure motion. There are no grounds for it at all. On the contrary, this Government and those Ministers should be congratulated because we have initiated these exposures, because we have taken the steps we have and because we have set up remedies and measures to pursue tax evaders and avoiders to the full. We will do that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I go on to give the reasons for my support and for the Australian Democrats' support for this motion-indeed before I go on to give the reasons why we approached the Opposition this morning to strengthen its original motion-I cannot let pass some of the more extraordinary statements that have been made by Government supporters in this debate. The first-this is the one which has arisen most frequently-is the statement that because the Australian Labor Government did not do anything in the three years in which it was in Government that is justification for the Liberal-National Country Party Government not doing anything for seven years. That comment, to any parent who is listening to this afternoon's debate, will be depressingly familiar. The comment we hear from just about every playroom in this country is: 'He did it first. Therefore, I am at liberty to punch back'. It is the most childish and the most unsustainable argument of the lot. Then we have the argument that goes: 'We could not hit the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes because there were so many others around the place'. I just wonder how many policemen can argue that they let some particular offender go because they had not been able to collect all the rest in a particular dragnet at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third argument that has been put forward is that the lawyers disagreed. We are all used to lawyers disagreeing. The whole criminal system is based on the fact that lawyers will disagree with each other. They are no different from psychiatrists, or for that matter economists or politicians. As Senator Evans has pointed out, the whole question of lawyers disagreeing with each other would have been solved if only somebody had been bright enought or fast enough off the mark to put up a test case or two to test which of the lawyers was right. It would certainly have been a darned sight cheaper to the taxpayer in the long run . Then we had the argument, which apparently has been put forward by the Treasurer (Mr Howard), that the public was not concerned enough about the problem for the Government to feel any need to act. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Georges" NAMEID="7V4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apart from the fact, Senator Georges, that the public may not have known-I dispute that anyway-I hope we have not yet reached the stage where we are governed by opinion poll. To argue that one does not act until the public is screaming at the doors of King's Hall is one of the most blatant pieces of political expediency that I have heard for some time. The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) argued that Mr Costigan puts the point that the Ministers of this Government were denied access to information which was available to Mr Costigan, which brings one to ask the question: 'Why did Mr Costigan get the information that the Ministers did not?' The answer is simple; he had the intelligence to ask a few pertinent questions and they did not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, the Government comes up with the argument that it does not accept all of Mr Costigan's findings other than the ones that suit it. That is standard practice; governments are notorious for accepting only selectively recommendations of reports. This Government has done it with everything from Senate committee reports through to the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) is entitled to his opinion of some of the opinions that Mr Costigan has put forward. After all, he has a vested interest in rejecting some of them. Nevertheless, it is my belief-I think it is a belief shared at least today by many other ordinary Australians-that Mr Costigan must have had some good reason for coming to his conclusions. If they embarrass the Government, that is a little unfortunate. It is particularly unfortunate, of course, in view of the fact that the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, that we are referring to today-or at least some of us are referring to today-was set up in 1980 by this Government following a series of articles that appeared in March and April of 1980 in the Bulletin. </PARA>
<PARA> Those articles contained allegations of corruption on the waterfront. The articles carried headings such as 'Like Nelson, the navy turns a blind eye-and pays up', 'How the Government Condones Waterfront Graft', 'Australia's Most Dangerous Criminal Tells All' and 'the Unionist Who Ignores The Arbitration Act' . The allegations specifically related to the practice of ghosting and also raised the general question of illegal and violent activities engaged in by the particular union concerned. This in itself raises the question of why the Government had to be forced to act by such articles; why it was not sufficiently aware and on the ball to move prior to these allegations being raised in a national magazine. Surely, if a journalist, an investigator such as David Richards, can come up with this information, then the combined forces-even the individual forces-of Government departments ought to be able to come up with them. Mr Costigan pointed out in his third interim report and-he repeated in this one:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Commission, to the surprise of many, found itself investigating the tax evasion industry. </PARA>
<PARA>It had started an investigation into the violence of the painters and dockers, and those investigations and the two million pages of documents it has acquired by truck and other means led it to the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth and to some extremely disturbing comments about officers in that Department and the results of their actions. In paragraph 3.21, Mr Costigan states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I have observed that some officers of the Australian Taxation Office and of the Crown Solicitor have had difficulty in understanding the mechanism for proving intent to defraud in a conspiracy case. At times I have detected comments that no intent to defraud could be present if the Taxation Assessment had not yet issued, so that if the assets of the company were removed before it was issued, and the books of account destroyed to make its issue more difficult, no crime could be established. </PARA>
<PARA>That, states Mr Costigan, is quite definitely 'an erroneous view of the law'. He points out also:</PARA>
<PARA> It also overlooks the alternative charge of defeating the operation of Commonwealth law, which, as I have said, is also prescribed by the Crimes Act.</PARA>
<PARA>On the following page, under the heading 'The Lamentable History of Non Prosecution', Mr Costigan continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Australian Taxation Office in Perth detected the operation of these schemes as early as 1973, and selected one for intensive investigation. The investigation was done by Senior Investigation Officer Mr Todman. It was done competently and diligently . . . By mid 1974 he decided to seek legal advice. He has told me that his past experience with the appropriate officer of the Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth had not been good; accordingly he asked (through his Deputy Commissioner) for an opinion to be sought from a Queens Counsel. In a letter dated 4 September 1974 the Deputy Taxation Commissioner said to the Deputy Crown Solicitor:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The recovery of company tax in this case and other cases acquired (by the promoter) raises issues which could have far reaching implications on the collection of company tax generally'. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, the Deputy Crown Solicitor was informed of the grave nature of the matter at an early stage. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, it would appear that Mr Todman's apparent lack of faith in the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth was to be more than vindicated by subsequent events. As I mentioned in the debate yesterday, Mr Costigan casts considerable doubt on the qualifications and ability of at least three officers of the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth and questions the intentions and /or honesty of two of those men. </PARA>
<PARA> As has already been pointed out, the matter of these bottom-of-the-harbour schemes first came to the attention of the Australian Taxation Office in Perth in 1973. They were half-heartedly investigated by the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office with the ignored advice of at least one independent Q.C. who delivered his opinion in June of 1975, expressing the view that section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act was no bar to a prosecution. This opinion was transmitted to Canberra to the Commissioner of Taxation in July of 1975 and in August of 1975 the Deputy Crown Solicitor in Perth was instructed that action should be taken as soon as possible under section 86 of the Crimes Act. In paragraph 3.31 Mr Costigan points out:</PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General, and his supporting staff constituted by the legal officers in the Crown Solicitor's Office, have a role to perform different to-</PARA>
<PARA>I would have said 'different from', but never mind-</PARA>
<PARA>that of solicitors in private practice, particularly in the case of criminal prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA>I think this is the whole point of the motion that the Opposition has moved today and which the Australian Democrats support. The paragraph continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Whereas a solicitor in private practice is bound by his instructions subject only to qualification in very restricted areas, the law officers of the Crown are not. Their primary duty is to uphold the law and to do so notwithstanding the effect it may have on the operation of the Government of the day . . . His basic duty-</PARA>
<PARA>Presumably he is referring to the Attorney-General-</PARA>
<PARA>was to determine whether it was in the public interest for the prosecution to be instituted. </PARA>
<PARA>At the end of paragraph 3.33 the Commissioner states:</PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, by these instructions, Mr Gleedman's duty was to report the matter to the Crown Solicitor. Although the Crown Solicitor entered into the matter personally at a later stage, this was after Mr Gleedman had retired. Mr Gleedman never complied with this instruction. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact Mr Gleedman did nothing for the remainder of 1975. According to Mr Costigan, when Mr Gleedman was questioned about this lack of action he said he was 'reading the case', which prompted the rather pithy comment from the Commissioner that he had already read the case presumably to permit him to brief counsel in late 1974. The Commissioner went on to say that when pressed Mr Gleedman indicated a lamentable lack of knowledge about the case that he had apparently read. The situation continued to muddle along under Mr Gleedman's somewhat deficient oversight until that gentleman retired in late 1977 on the grounds of ill health. I point out that, contrary to the assertion made by the Leader of the Government in the Senate Mr Gleedman insisted that his ill health did nothing to impair his ability to act. Unfortunately, as Mr Costigan points out, Mr Gleedman's successor was to prove even worse, resorting finally to his own bottom-of-the-drawer scheme by hiding files in his desk for something like five years. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely, one is permitted to wonder what the Attorney-General was doing during the years 1976 to 1980. Indeed, given the Commissioner's remarks with regard to the validity of the pre-1980 tax legislation, a view supported by the remarks of counsel consulted by Mr Gleedman, what was the Treasurer doing during those years? Why, in the public interest, was no test case picked up and followed through? Why were the stalling actions, the outright actions of sabotage of officers of the Perth Crown Solicitor's office, apparently unnoticed by anyone in the Attorney-General's Department or the Australian Taxation Office which, as had been pointed out repeatedly, had been aware of the problem since 1973. The reasons can only be total incompetence on the part of the officers involved and the Ministers concerned or a deliberate attempt by some people to keep the matter under wraps for personal or political motives. In any event, the cost to the Government of the failure of the departments concerned to act in the public interest has led to the Government, and thus the taxpayer, being defrauded of hundreds of millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> I put to the Senate that this matter is at least as serious as the case of a Minister failing to pay duty on a television set and of another Minister condoning it, for which heinous crimes both have been relegated to the back benches. Surely, allowing the defrauding of the taxpayer of the sort of money to which Mr Costigan refers in his report is as important and culpable a misdeameanour as that of which the two unfortunate Ministers to whom I have referred were guilty. Between 1973, when the scheme was first uncovered, and 1980 when the Government took action to strengthen the laws relating to this form of behaviour-laws which, by the way, according to a number of eminent counsel needed no strengthening, merely enforcing-the number of companies involved grew from 27 to 1,412. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Costigan leaves no doubt in the mind of anyone who reads his report that this was due entirely to lack of appropriate action by the government departments concerned. Again, one is forced to wonder why nothing was done, why the officers employed by the Government were, or appeared to be, so inept, so unsure of the law, so lacking in the background necessary to ensure that the interests of the public were looked after. It has concerned me for a number of years that somehow lawyers and accountants employed by big businesses, by tax evaders, are able enough, good enough, well qualified enough or just sneaky enough to identify and make use of loopholes, anomalies or omissions in the law but that the Government, with all its resources, is either not able or willing to identify the same problems and act to counter them or, better still, identify them before they are given effect by the Parliament and thus ensure that they are not availed of in the first instance.</PARA>
<PARA> The crux of the motion before us today is this: Either Ministers in this or any other government are responsible for their portfolios or they are not. Either they are responsible for the actions of their officers or they are not. If they are-certainly the present Prime Minister, as quoted by Senator Evans earlier, seems to believe that in most instances they are-they must accept the ultimate responsibility for the actions of their senior public servants. In this case that means tendering a resignation regardless of whether they knew-or admit they knew-about the actions of their officers. If Ministers are not held responsible for what happens in their portfolios we might just as well not have Ministers. We could certainly save the taxpayer a certain amount of money by simply allowing the public servants in the departments to run things the way they want to run them. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever else is said to the contrary by honourable senators opposite or anyone else, both the Attorney-General and the Treasurer should have known about the schemes and about the investigations-or what passed for investigations-in the relevant Government departments. Section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act and the privacy provisions therein are no excuse. One is forced to view the photograph of the Attorney-General, which appeared on the front page of this morning's Sydney Morning Herald, as having some truth to it, as expressing some sort of prophesy. It was, for those honourable senators who did not see it, a delightful photograph of the Attorney-General with his finger in his ear. It seems to me that he did not want to hear what had been happening in his Department for six or seven years. As a consequence, he did not know what was going on either because he made no attempt to know or because he did not want to know. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no intention of canvassing the issue of the involvement of senior members of the Liberal Party in Western Australia in these bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. It is of very little moment to this motion. I, for one, do not believe that the Ministers concerned can be held responsible for the actions of Western Australian individuals, whether or not they belong to the Liberal Party-unless, of course, they were aware of them and were covering up for them. I have no intention of even suggesting that that was likely. The Minister may be foolish but I do not deny his integrity. However, it is without question that Ministers are responsible for the actions of their departmental officers. That the Ministers we are discussing today were ignorant of what was going on and, as a consequence, negligent indicates that they must resign. The announcement by the Government of the establishment of a task force is not a substitute for such resignations. It does nothing but close the door after the horse has bolted. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said yesterday during the debate on the report, there has been something less than total frankness on the part of some Government officials and some Government Ministers. There has been, to say the least, a lamentable lack of enthusiasm by officials and the Government to prosecute any of the 1,412 companies operating schemes up to 1980. I suggest that the Government has much to answer for and that the Commissioner, Mr Costigan, is to be commended for exposing the saga of negligence, misfeasance, arrogant disregard for the law and , I might add, the harm to the interests of the general public, a disregard that was probably best summed up by Mr Bercove. According to paragraph 3.59 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA> When it was put to him that this was intentionally dishonest, he was indifferent. In his view, 'everyone does it' and therefore it was good enough for him. </PARA>
<PARA>Any Minister who even suspects that this sort of attitude is rife in the community, much less in his own Department-I suggest that he would have had to have fingers in both ears to have missed the rumblings that were going on in the community-and still allows it to continue is not fit to have the oversight of a department which is expected to act in the public interest. Resignations under these circumstances, unfortunate as they are, are unavoidable. Resignation is the only honourable avenue open to both the Attorney-General and the Treasurer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Senate is considering a motion to censure the Government for its grave failure, and the failure of the Attorney- General (Senator Durack) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in particular, in the administration of legislation relating to criminal and civil offences against the tax laws resulting in multi-billion dollar frauds against the Commonwealth, and calls for the resignation of the Attorney-General and the Treasurer. Conscious of the fact that the success or failure of this motion, for good or bad, may well depend on how I vote, I have listened carefully to every word that has been uttered in this debate. The debate follows the tabling of Interim Report No. 4, Volume 1, of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, referred to as the Costigan report. I believe that that report quite clearly reveals tax evasion on a massive scale which has been perpetrated against the citizens of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that this censure motion misses the mark if the Parliament and the people of Australia are to tackle the problem of tax evasion. Following the McCabe-Lafranchi report the Government has already listed a number of things that it proposes to do in respect of this matter. People in the community can also do a number of things about it. Before I come to the question that is the key to the consideration of this motion of censure-that is to say, ministerial responsibility-I want to put on record that a number of institutions in this country ought to have regard to what Costigan has said in his report and take action accordingly. It is quite clear that professional people, employers and this union are involved in this type of racket. These types of tax evasion schemes on a massive scale could not operate without certain members of the professions being involved. Surely it is incumbent upon the institutions representing the legal fraternity to take action, to charge the persons responsible and to expel them from those institutions. That applies as well to accountants and I guess it also applies to the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party, with which the Ship Painters and Dockers Union is affiliated. </PARA>
<PARA> I have some understanding of what the Ship Painters and Dockers Union is like. Let us not forget what Mr Costigan said about that organisation. On page 109 of his report, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> This sad story is consistent with the image presented by the union to the community. The union has created for itself over the years a reputation for violence and for the community an atmosphere of fear. This has made it almost impossible to obtain evidence against members of the union in relation to their criminal activities. They in effect operate as a state within a state. This union has a positive policy of recruiting hardened criminals, at least in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>Presumably it never takes up its options under section 144 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Such people normally are unattractive to honest people, including the many honest and hard working trade unionists in this country. But to this union such criminals are desirable. It is probably for the purpose of making use of their dubious 'talents'. </PARA>
<PARA>I well recall that, as secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council, I received a call one night from the Ship Painters and Dockers Union in Victoria to say that they would be over on the morning plane to grab what was rightfully theirs in the State of Tasmania. I recall also getting up early the next morning and getting hold of people who were allegedly doing their work, including the Waterside Workers Federation, the Marine Harbour Trust Employees Association and the shipwrights union, calling a meeting of the disputes committee and determining what ought to be done about it. Fortunately the representatives of the Ship Painters and Dockers Union left my State on the evening flight. After that, as a result of a court case, the Ship Painters and Dockers Union was not successful in gaining a foothold, at least in Hobart, at that stage. Nevertheless, it was recognised at that time, by us as an institution, that here was an organisation-the dogs were barking-full of criminals. Of course that has been borne out as a matter of statement by the Royal Commission. We all knew it. Not long before, the previous secretary of the union had been shot and the wags were saying: 'I suppose the committee of management will meet and put an ad in the newspaper saying ''Wanted, Ship Painters and Dockers Union Secretary-$200 a week plus lead bonus'' '. We all knew about it at that time and now the chickens have come home to roost officially. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not beyond those who were attacking the moderate element of the trade union movement at that time to use the Ship Painters and Dockers Union for their own ends. Though the official branch of the Australian Council of Trade Unions in my State, the TTLC, refused affiliation to the Ship Painters and Dockers Union, those who sought to split the trade union movement in my State-they are still seeking to split the trade union movement-granted the union affiliation and support against the opposition of myself at that time and against the continuing opposition of the current secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council, who, incidentally, was expelled by the ALP. He called a point of order on this matter and was told by the representative of the Ship Painters and Dockers Union what would happen to him if he continued in that vein. I give that as an example of what institutions in this country ought to do with people who are robbing blind the community of Australia. As I said, in those institutions are the legal fraternity, the accountants, the ALP and anybody else who has some power to tackle the people concerned, not least of all the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to what I believe this motion turns on-ministerial responsibility. I believe that everything said by the Opposition in support of this proposition could have been said in so far as it deals with the censure of the Government, but when it calls for the resignation of the Attorney-General and the Treasurer it goes too far. That is because this goes to the so-called doctrine of ministerial responsibility. That doctrine is not something, as honourable senators will know, that is written into any Act of Parliament, nor is it something that is included in the Constitution of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> It would, of course, be quite impossible to define for all time and for all occasions what constitutes the doctrine of ministerial responsibility and what are the limits and substance of that doctrine. Senator Haines referred to the most recent case, that of the two Ministers, Mr MacKellar and Mr Moore. I want also to refer to those cases, the last occasion on which the question of ministerial responsibility arose. It was in connection with the incident of the television set and the two Ministers, Mr MacKellar and Mr Moore, last April. A brief review of what happened on that occasion provides an opportunity to place this recent incident in proper perspective. I am now talking about the question of principle and not the question of amount. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that the colour television set incident which resulted in the resignation of the two Ministers revolved around the failure of the then Minister for Health, Mr MacKellar, himself to declare that the television set that he was bringing into Australia was not a black and white set but was a colour set and hence the subject of duty under the provisions of Commonwealth law. It also involved the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Moore, knowing about the incident but not insisting upon the payment of duty. </PARA>

Fundamentally, as the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) pointed out on 19 April, it appeared that a Minister was in a preferred position as compared with other Australians. I am stating this as a matter of principle. I have a high regard for the two members personally. Senator Evans, who today is calling for the resignation of not only the Attorney-General but also the Treasurer, commented in April after the resignation of Mr Moore and Mr MacKellar as follows :</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously they have paid a very serious price indeed, but so they should have paid a serious price because it was a spectacular lapse from the standards of probity, propriety, decency and honest behaviour that one expects of the Ministers of the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA>That was Senator Evans's statement on AM on 20 April 1982. The Melbourne Age, in a comment shortly before the resignation, referred to other aspects of ministerial responsibility. On 19 April 1982 it said:</PARA>
<PARA> Both Ministers, however, have so far chosen to ignore the convention which requires them to resign when called to account for 'serious derelictions of duty which erode the integrity of the Administration'. </PARA>

<PARA> It is necessary, before I proceed further, to draw the attention of those who may read this Report to the circumstances that the secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act apply with equal force to the Ministers who have charge of the enforcement of the law in this area. I refer in particular to persons holding the office of Treasurer, and of Attorney-General. The events to which I am referring took place over a period of 10 years. It will be recalled that during that time there had been a number of incumbents of both those high offices in the State. All of them have been denied access to the detailed information which has now been provided to me, and which has identified the situation described in this report. </PARA>
<PARA>Costigan goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> It is sufficient to say, at this stage, that the secrecy provision has been an effective bar to proper ministerial supervision of the discharge of duty by both the Australian Taxation Office and the Crown Solicitor's Office. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask, therefore: Where is the dereliction of duty? The truth, as has been stated by Senator Durack-and I have to take it on the statement that he has made -is that he did not know about the matters referred to in the Costigan report until the McCabe-Lafranchi report came down, as I understand it, in May of this year. </PARA>

When Senator Durack heard about this matter because of the McCabe- Lafranchi report-I might say that some contention exists between Senator Durack and me on a number of issues-he did not leave the file in a drawer for five years. He announced certain activities which he has detailed to the Senate. The people who are at fault are public servants employed in the Deputy Crown Solicitor's office in Perth. The story of the escort agency and the telephone number belongs to the world of farce or worse.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As somebody says: 'Not necessarily anyhow'. I have taken the trouble to go through the number of censure motions calling on Ministers to resign that have been placed before the Parliament for some considerable time. The censure motions were moved against both sides. On any reasonable estimation of ministerial responsibility, one cannot hold a Minister responsible for all the detail of what goes on in the offices occupied by the hundreds of thousands of public servants, particularly in this case where both the Treasurer and the Attorney-General were denied access to the information by reason of the operation of an Act of Parliament in respect of the secrecy of taxation information. The immediate superiors of those public servants should know. If something is seriously amiss in a regional office the central administration should be informed immediately. In this episode the central administration was not so informed by the Perth office. How could any reasonable person claim that the Minister should have ferreted around and located all of this information?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that on any reasonable estimation of the doctrine of ministerial responsibility this censure motion fails. I return to what I said at the beginning of my address: The Parliament and the people concerned now should track down those who have been responsible over the years for this rort. The professional institutions and others in the community have a responsibility to ensure that those who have been involved in these rackets are debarred provided there is proof, from participation in their affairs. This must happen if those institutions are to maintain their integrity. I propose not to support the censure motion. It calls for the resignation of the Attorney-General and the Treasurer and in my estimation of ministerial responsibility that call is not warranted on this occasion. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate censures the Government for its grave failure, and the failure of the Attorney-General and the Treasurer in particular, in the administration of legislation relating to criminal and civil offences against the tax laws . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I acknowledge the contribution to the debate made by Senator Harradine. It has done a great deal to restore some balance to a debate which has tended to overlook many of the aspects of concern which have been raised by the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. As one would expect, the Opposition has focused its attention on one chapter of the latest report which has been tabled in this Parliament. The Opposition has been careful to avoid reference to the broader questions raised by the reports which have been given to the Parliament. Not merely the tax system has been identified by the Costigan Royal Commission as being under threat from the Ship Painters and Dockers Union. If one looks at interim report No. 3, which was presented in February 1982, one will find a chronicle of other areas in which members of this union are alleged to have taken action which is clearly, and severely, against the public interest. The first area which was identified affected my department, the Department of Social Security. Under the heading 'Social Security Fraud' the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Material already available to the Commission indicates that very large numbers of painters and dockers have been involved in imposition on the social security system. Such imposition involves the receipt of social security benefits whilst workers under false names are either in receipt of workers' compensation benefits or working at other employments. The Commission's ability to identify false names has enabled these investigations to be pursued and will result in the recovery by Government to a large extent of the amount illegally received. It is not possible at this stage of the investigation to state precisely the amount involved but it will be well over $1,000,000. </PARA>
<PARA>The first area identified was the Department of Social Security. We were advised by the Commission that there is a substantial imposition on that system. I suppose that had the members of the Opposition recalled interim report No. 3 they might well have included me in this motion and sought my resignation also. I make the point that these defalcations are made by people who are prepared to behave in a fraudulent way. In a society such as our own, when there are people who are prepared to behave in a fraudulent way it is inevitable that some of those people escape detection, at least for a time. We know that there has been fraud in the area of social security. That matter is being pursued by both my Department and the Australian Federal Police, with some success. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter which was dealt with by the Royal Commission affected the workers' compensation system. Mr Costigan outlined that that system also has been subject to plunder by claims which are described as 'not justified, but also claims which are made involve payment of benefits for periods far in excess of what should be paid'. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> The amounts are very large. At the Williamstown Naval Dockyard alone the amount would be aproaching $200,000 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other areas including the traditional area of ''street crime'', which description covers offences ranging from stealing to murder. </PARA>
<PARA>It may be that the civil libertarians on the Australian Labor Party side of this chamber are not particularly concerned about street crimes and the possibility of murder. I would have thought there was nothing more serious in terms of the victim than the suggestion that people do not have even personal security because of the activities of members of this union. There has already been a reference-not by Opposition speakers, of course, but by Government speakers and by Senator Harradine-to some of the other parts of the report which was tabled yesterday-that is, interim report No. 4, Volume I. In chapter 4 of the report one finds an account of evidence given with respect to the Station Hotel which describes the physical fear of people who are trying to go about their lawful business and the demands that they engage in illegal behaviour. In chapter 5 under the heading 'Violence in the Union' reference was made to a string of major crimes against the person which are sheeted home to members of this union.</PARA>
<PARA> We are dealing with a situation which, in the course of a royal commission into the affairs of a union, has aroused rather widespread concern in the community. There are also very serious exposures of a breakdown in some areas of our own administration. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has not sought to minimise that. I do not think the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) speaking in the other place, have sought to minimise that. Indeed, the actions of the Government since these matters have come to light indicate the very serious way in which we view them. However, I want to make the point that we are in the middle of a period in which the concern about taxation and tax evasion is being used not merely to the proper effect of trying to ensure that the laws are adequate and that there is proper administration; that concern is also being used to great political effect and there is a great and open attempt to make everybody guilty by association. We have heard plenty of statements in the Senate and outside the Senate drawing attention to the affiliations of and the connections between people who are named as having been involved in tax avoidance-not tax evasion-and the Liberal Party. That is, of course, wonderful politics. But there has been really nothing said in this place , even by members of the Government, let alone by members of the Opposition, about the affiliations of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. I have no wish to indulge in this technique of guilt by association. I do not for a moment suggest--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful for the interjection by Senator Harradine. But I was going on to point out to honourable senators opposite that the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union is in fact a union which has affiliations with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Trades and Labour Councils and the Australian Labor Party in the States of New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria . So if one can extend by association allegations of misconduct, let alone allegations of bloody murder as it was described by Senator Sir John Carrick, then I would suggest to honourable senators opposite that they ought very carefully to examine the affiliations which they themselves enjoy. I believe that we do not serve this country terribly well when we seek, for narrow political purposes, to exaggerate situations and wrongly to condemn people who have nothing to do with wrong doing and, indeed, in many cases have done nothing wrong at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would certainly agree that the interim report No. 4, volume 1, of the Royal Commission which has been the subject of debate today, does expose that there have been serious problems in parts of the administration of the Commonwealth. I would simply say that these problems involve areas which have been either attacked before the publication of this report or, where they were not known of before the publication of this report, are now receiving careful attention. It is quite clear that long before the McCabe-Lafranchi report, for example, that very strong action was taken by the Government with respect to bottom-of-the- harbour schemes. I have very limited time in which to speak, but any honourable senator, and indeed any member of the public concerned about the Government's reaction to the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, can have access to the very lengthy statement put out by the Treasurer on 27 June in which he detailed the history of his dealings with this matter and the Government's actions. I merely want to refer to what appears at page 8 of that Press release which sets out the legislative action which was taken by the Government. For the first time, this Government imposed sentences of imprisonment for taxation offences. I refer first to page 4. The Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA> When the Commissioner of Taxation first raised with me in May 1978 the prospect that criminal penalties might need to be introduced in order to deal with these practices, they were still being documented and the full extent of their use was not yet known. Priority was then being given to dealing with other established and damaging schemes, both by the Taxation Office in its administrative responses and advice to me and by the Government in its own legislative processes and response. </PARA>
<PARA>At page 8 the Treasurer goes on to point out that in his second reading speech on 26 November 1980-long before Costigan, long before McCabe-Lafranchi had reported-he introduced the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Bill which dealt with these specific schemes. As he said in the second reading:</PARA>
<PARA> As the task of artificial avoidance has become more difficult, the less scrupulous have added a new and I think most would agree, unacceptable dimension to endeavours to ensure that payment of tax is escaped . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The seriousness of the position cannot be overstated. For example, one promoter is known to have stripped some 2,086 companies during a recent period. In 733 of these cases, the result has been that the Commissioner of Taxation will be unable to collect tax on taxable incomes aggregating over $128m. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that these are statements made long before McCabe-Lafranchi and long before the Costigan reports, and they indicate the sort of action which was being taken by the Government, by the Treasurer and, indeed, by the Attorney- General, who was intimately concerned with the preparation of this legislation against the very areas of abuse which are referred to in these Costigan reports. All that is relevant to this question of ministerial responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank Senator Harradine for his comments on that matter, which I think were practical and accord with the reality of that doctrine in Australia. It occurred to me as I was listening to him and indeed it occurred to me before when I was listening to the quite extraordinary propositions being put forward by Senator Haines on behalf of the Australian Democrats, just what an impossible test honourable senators opposite are trying to establish. A couple of days ago, for example, somebody died in Sydney. That person was found to have a whole series of false bank accounts, false birth certificates and to be claiming in multiple names on the Department of Social Security. That was a clear case of fraud. I sat there and thought that on the basis that has been submitted by the Opposition today I, too, should be resigning. I believe that that is not a standard which can be applied in this case. I believe that when one looks at the totality of action which has been taken, when one looks at the statement that the Treasurer made in June, and when one sees the history of this matter, it is quite clear that the Government, the Treasurer, and the Attorney-General have behaved in a proper manner. What is set out in that statement that the Treasurer made in June is in fact a statement of the painstaking work which has been done by the Government in this field. Earlier this afternoon Senator Sir John Carrick incorporated in Hansard a summary of the tax measures which have been introduced by this Government. I will not go through them again but that summary contains some five and a half pages of specific measures which have been taken year by year through the Parliament to close off tax loopholes. </PARA>
<PARA> The point has been made in the debate that that sits against the Labor Party's own record in this area where, after the 1974 announcement of Mr Crean, no action was in fact taken. I make that point not as an accusation of bad faith against Mr Crean, not as an accusation of bad faith against the Treasurer who succeeded him, not against the Treasurer who succeeded him again, Mr Hayden. I think that is simply a comment on the way that these processes have to be developed and on the difficulty of bringing forward legislation. While some would point to it as evidence of culpable negligence on the part of the Labor Government, I would simply say that it is evidence of the fact that this is a difficult area in which legislation which will meet the problems which have arisen is hard to produce. But we have produced an endless stream of legislation and I believe that any person who is interested in this field and who is familiar with the practitioners in this field would know that the flow of tax evasion has been reduced significantly if not totally stopped. </PARA>
<PARA> The point has been made in the debate that the instruments which are now being used to attack the Attorney-General and the Treasurer, the reports which have been brought out by McCabe-Lafranchi and by the Costigan Royal Commission are instruments which are available to government, to the public and to the Opposition only because of the initiative either of this Government or of a Liberal Government in Victoria. In other words, those very inquiries are part of a pattern of attention to this area of government which gives the lie to the claim in this motion that the Government has failed to come to grips with this area. I believe that the record of the Government in this field is very good. I believe the results are beginning to show and they showed up this year in the fact that no allowance was required to be made in the Budget figuring the loss to revenue because of tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other item with which I wish to deal now. I know that after the dinner suspension we wish to move to the Budget debate. I refer to the action which has been taken since the report of the Costigan Royal Commission was made available to the Government. It is quite clear that that report exposed to the Government facts of which it had not previously been aware, some facts which had been in the knowledge of some relatively junior officers in the Attorney-General 's Department but not the Attorney-General himself or of more senior officers in the Department. I point to the statement which was put down yesterday by the Attorney-General in which he acknowledged that the findings must be taken seriously and that the matter of guilt or innocence of people who are said to be guilty of criminal matters is something to be determined by the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> He has set out in his statement the action which has been taken concerning the matters raised in that report. Attention has been given, as a matter of priority , to the prosecution of offences associated with bottom-of-the-harbour tax evasion schemes which are referred to in volume 1 of the report. In June of this year-that is, before receipt of the report-the Attorney-General and the Treasurer took steps to obtain advice from the Solicitor-General in regard to the availability of prosecution action in the particular case dealt with in chapter 3 of volume 1, the case which has received so much attention in debate today. The Solicitor-General has given an opinion saying that remedies are open, and advice was sought from senior counsel in June on possible criminal proceedings in relation to a major promoter in Sydney, with a final opinion being expected shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Crown Solicitor has sent an officer from his central office to work in association with the Taxation Office with respect to the case referred to in chapter 3 of the report. More generally, it has been decided to appoint a special prosecutor to concentrate special effort on action with a view to prosecution of persons who are directly involved in the promotion and execution of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. The special prosecutor is to be assisted by a task force of lawyers, taxation officers and police. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the action taken by the Attorney-General is the action of a man who is determined to do his duty as Attorney-General. It is consistent with the actions of the Attorney-General over the whole period that I have known him. Indeed, there is a certain irony that the Attorney-General and the Treasurer should be the subject of complaint in this matter. I know of no ministers who have more assiduously devoted themselves to their duties, nor more successfully performed them. The fact that there are significant difficulties in the tax area the knowledge of which is not new is something we should all be prepared to face up to, to ensure that the laws are adequate, that the administration is adequate , and that we achieve the result which I believe is the one commonly desired in this chamber, namely, the proper collection of the taxes which are due to enable us to conduct the proper programs of government. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Government I reject the suggestion that it should be censured in the way put forward this afternoon by the Opposition. I support the actions of the Attorney-General and the Treasurer in the administration of their departments. I ask all honourable senators to support them in the same way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's response to this censure motion has been a mixture of abdication of responsibility, false assertion and false analogy. Two Government speakers used the defence, essentially, that tax evasion of this type started under the Whitlam Government, the Whitlam Government did not do anything about it, and therefore it is all right for the Fraser Government to do nothing about it. Even if that were true it does not, of course, exonerate the present Government. Senator Sir John Carrick asserted that Mr Costigan had said that the 1980 amendments to the Taxation Act had solved the problem. I quote from paragraph 3.89 of the report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Ship Painters and Dockers, in which the Royal Commissioner said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The conduct to which they-</PARA>
<PARA>That is the 1980 amendments-</PARA>
<PARA>are directed is conduct which was already criminal. </PARA>
<PARA>What Mr Costigan said was that the 1980 amendments, upon which the Government has hung most of its defence, were irrelevant. The reason they were irrelevant, Costigan said, was that all laws which are not enforced are irrelevant. The Government was not enforcing the law as it existed prior to 1980 and therefore there was no need for any amendments. The problem was not in the inadequacies of the law but in the inadequacy of government will to enforce the law that existed . Senator Sir John Carrick seemed to say that the Government was not as bad as the painters and dockers. I guess it is not. However, the painters and dockers are not the subject of this censure motion, nor are they in government. I note in passing, with regard to Senator Harradine's comment about the murders for which the painters and dockers are responsible, that the previous Victorian Liberal Government just went through an election campaign in which it campaigned very heavily on the subject of no gun laws at all for Victoria. There seems to be a certain inconsistency. Senator Chaney cited the false analogy of the possibility of a major case of fraud within his Department where somebody had been making multiple fraudulent claims on social security benefits. That, of course, is not a legitimate analogy. It would have been if senior officers in Senator Chaney's Department were aware of such a fraud and did nothing about it, which is exactly what happened in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> Last Sunday the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) denounced tax evaders as ' recipients of stolen money'. Yesterday Senator Durack announced the formation of a crimes commission to prosecute tax evaders. So this Government, which for seven years has presided permissively over a multi-billion dollar tax cheating orgy, has now donned, at least in public, a mask of respectability. With this sort of stunt and rhetoric it hopes to erase the public's memory of the shocking disclosures by Costigan, by McCabe-Lafranchi, and by others of negligence and tax evasion at the highest levels of the Liberal Party. Australia does not need stunts. What it needs is a government with a will to flush the crooks out of their sanctuary in the Liberal Party and into the gaols where they belong. </PARA>
<PARA> For nearly seven years this Government has presided over a bureaucracy-for which, I stress, the Government is responsible-which sat on and covered up advice to prosecute and the evidence to support such prosecutions. For two and a half years from May 1978 the Treasurer sat, inert as a stuffed bullfrog, on advice from the Taxation Office which disclosed massive tax evasion. He has admitted that. His excuse for that gross negligence was that 'public attitudes to tax evasion were only in their formative stages'. In other words, the public was not angry enough. It was his duty to protect the public revenue. On his own admission, he knew for at least two and a half years, in this case alone, that there was serious leakage of the public revenue, and he did nothing. He is still Treasurer. That in itself is sufficient reason for censure of this Government. The Government was ultimately stung into forecasting limited and very belated action against tax cheats by the disclosures of McCabe-Lafranchi. It was moved not by moral outrage but by fear of electoral retribution, and by fear of that alone. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Government wages a pious but phoney war against the tax cheats, some of the most spectacular tax cheats continue to occupy positions of power in the Liberal Party and in public life. For example, the Perth Liberal Party bagman, Denis Horgan, personally evaded $750,000 tax in just one deal. He is one of the recipients of stolen money, a practice which the Prime Minister denounced on Sunday. This Denis Horgan is still a director of the Australian Industry Development Corporation, appointed by the Treasurer and retained by the Treasurer. As well as being a tax dodger, a tax cheat, as Managing Director of Treamog Ltd he set up the small shareholders to be fleeced by the Myer interests . Is that the level of directorial diligence and integrity which the Treasurer wants in a director of the AIDC? If it is, I would certainly advise small investors not to put any money into it. Denis Horgan is still a Commissioner of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and I invite the ABC to report that fact instead of censoring it from the news, as it has done in the past. He still occupies five other sinecures. On 27 June the Treasurer, Mr Howard, excused his failure to take action under the Crimes Act against tax evasion with pusillanimous legal waffle about the problems of securing evidence of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth. He does not need evidence of conspiracy to sack Denis Horgan. All he needs is guts. Asked last week about the sacking of Denis Horgan, he replied: 'Just because a man is named in a report doesn't mean he is guilty'. </PARA>
<PARA> Denis Horgan's name was not just mentioned in a report. He was identified as a participant, as managing director of a company which got involved in a tax evasion transaction as a result of which $1.7m of a current year tax liability was evaded. That evidence and Corporate Affairs Office documents in Perth record that Denis Horgan personally evaded three-quarters of a million dollars. The Treasurer's attitude in the face not of a mention of someone in a report but evidence to document the accuracy of what I have just said, seems to be: If Denis Horgan is not actually in gaol he is fit to remain a director of the AIDC. Perhaps Mr Howard is puzzled by the Prime Minister's sudden antipathy to people who are recipients of stolen money and wonders what has happened since 19 September 1980 to change the Prime Minister's mind. What has been said of Mr Howard, of course, applies to all other Ministers who appointed and retain Horgan in government sinecures. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to Senator Durack, I leave aside at least for now the detailed facts presented in the Costigan report and reported on competently and in some detail by previous speakers on the Opposition side. I note, however, that the negligence which was documented in that report continues still. The report was received by the Government on 27 July. At midday last Wednesday, three weeks after the report was received, the Attorney-General got around to standing down O'Sullivan and Bercove in Perth. For three weeks at least those two officers whom the Attorney-General knew to have been shown to be grossly negligent if not worse-one, indeed, was described as 'a dishonest man'-were given the run of the files of the Solicitor-General's office in Perth and for that Senator Durack is entirely and inarguably responsible. How do we know that they did not shred the files in that three-week period when Senator Durack knew what the Costigan report had shown about them but took no action? I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) for enabling me to speak without limitation of time. It seems strange to say this at the end of a week since the Budget was brought down but this Budget is a sort of end of the road Budget. It is the end of the road for a government which has lived on rhetoric of one kind or another varying, of course, with each election over the last seven years-seven lean years for the people of Australia. Now in this Budget, the Government is scraping the bottom of the barrel for new and suitable rhetoric, having failed to find any in the economic field because everybody is waking up to the emptiness of that rhetoric. It is thrashing around in other areas of mischief-making; hence, the numerous attempts in the past week to introduce legislation into this Parliament which are intended to divide the political opposition, particularly in the Senate and elsewhere, as though the economy were something about which the Government was not even particularly concerned. I think a measure of the Government's desperation is the lack of priority it gives to economic issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is worth while looking at this Budget in the context of the previous Budgets. I remember being told in 1975 and 1977 that Budgets were about good housekeeping on behalf of the people of Australia, for whom the Government supposedly brings down Budgets. Let us look at the record in terms of the budgetary performances of the Fraser Government. It was said in 1977 that the election issue was tax cuts and tax indexation. Still dining out lavishly on the perceived sins of the Whitlam Government, about which we still get lectures even today from Senator Sir John Carrick-one wonders whether, if he were here till the year 2000, he would still be playing the same old tune-the Fraser Government said that the essence of the 1977 election campaign was that tax indexation was necessary to keep governments honest. It did not keep itself very honest for very long. Having achieved the objective of winning the 1977 election, the Government felt quite free to be dishonest. In July 1978, just seven months after the election and 12 months after the much vaunted introduction of full indexation of taxation, the Government reduced that to half indexation. It decided to be half honest, not fully honest. In addition to that, it discounted the consumer price index of 13.9 per cent by 3.3 per cent, thus excluding the combined effects of indirect taxes and the health insurance levy. How these extra tax imposts can fail to be regarded as additions to the cost of living quite escapes me and I am sure the Australian people who have to pay them. </PARA>
<PARA> A few months later in November 1978, 11 months after the election, the Fraser Government raised the marginal tax rate within each bracket by adding an extra temporary surcharge of 2.57c to each of the rates. That was a fundamental lesson in electoral dishonesty-a lesson which should be borne in mind by anyone who thinks that the income tax relaxations in this Budget will endure if this Government is re-elected. This Government cannot be trusted on questions of taxation policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1977 context we also had the term 'rubbery' introduced in connection with Government figures by the inestimable Minister for Industry and Commerce ( Sir Phillip Lynch). That was his way of saying that some of the hype associated with the Budget came from the Prime Minister's Department and not from the Treasury. Even in this Budget the Government's arithmetic is suspect. The Budget Papers, for example, forecast rising unemployment perhaps as high as nine per cent. Yet, the average number of people receiving unemployment benefits is estimated in the Budget at 395,000 for the year. In July of this year, the first month of the year in which the average of 395,000 was struck, there were 405,000 people registered as unemployment beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> No tax indexation was applied in 1979-80, a safe mid-year term between elections, but partial indexation was reintroduced in July 1980 with an election due in the latter half of that year. The tax brackets were increased by 3.8 per cent compared with the consumer price index increase of 9.7 per cent for that year. So again, the illusion of getting something back was created, while in fact the reform made up slightly only one-third of the CPI increase. But in that election year something else had to be drummed up, so the resources boom was summoned up from the deep. Vast and largely illusory sums were trumpeted. In 1980 before the election, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) said:</PARA>
<PARA> Tens of thousands of new jobs will be generated. </PARA>
<PARA>The millenium was to arrive via a mining investment led recovery. New infrastructure was to be created. All was to be well. The country was going to take off again. Of course, the objective of all that was to push into the background the rising unemployment, the lack of action on jobs for school leavers, the continued high inflation and the basic underlying problems of the Australian economy. It was all cosmetic and it only worked by a squeak. In Fraser Government terms it was a successful policy because success is measured by the ability to win enough people over at election time. But again, after the election came the truth. There was some development in mining, of course, most of which was on the slipway long before and had little to do with the election or the policies of this Government. But the boom, the South Sea bubble bit, evaporated. After all, it had to subside. It would not have done to keep expectations up. They had to be lowered and the whole thing decently buried. The Government, for its own reasons, deflated its own boom. The mining industry helped a little but, for reasons of truthfulness, it was, I suspect, a little embarrassed about the whole process. </PARA>
<PARA> On 29 April 1981, after that election, the Government announced the future abolition of tax indexation. Mr Howard said that discretionary adjustments to taxation scales and allowances were preferable to tax indexation. What he really meant was that the Government had finally come to the conclusion that a great number of people did not understand tax indexation and, therefore, it was not a good election gimmick. The catch-cry 'Keep governments honest' had been exhausted because this Government had been so manifestly dishonest itself. Instead of tax indexation there was talk of discretionary adjustments to tax scales. The reason, no doubt, was that they could be introduced just before an election and the Government could make up for lost revenue in other ways or by changing the tax scales again after an election. The point I am making is that no one who looks at this Budget for the year 1982 and at its cynically manipulative tax cuts should forget that had the Government kept its simple promise of tax indexation taxpayers in this country would have benefited this year by $1,500m. Of course, that has not happened. I do not want to quote Professor Russell Mathews excessively but I do want to quote what he said about that and the administration of the tax system under this Government. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Australian taxation and social welfare system, far from contributing to greater equality in the distribution of incomes and wealth, has become a major instrument for redistributing incomes from the poor to the rich and from wage and salary earners to other income recipients, as well as a major cause of the budgetary problems of all Australian governments and a source of growing social, business and economic instability. </PARA>
<PARA>We have been told by the master of economic theory, the landlord of Nareen, that there are two sides to a Budget. He says that a Budget involves good housekeeping; so there is a receipts side, the revenue side, and an expenditure side. If one takes not my words but the words of Professor Mathews, the receipts side is absolutely crucial to the heart of the economic management for this country. It is absolutely crucial in that sense and in the sense that it is at the heart of the issue of any social justice or equity. It is absolutely crucial in both those senses. According to Professor Mathews, the receipts side is in a mess. Professor Mathews did not have the advantage of the latest evidence, which was debated in the Senate this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> The backdrop to this Government's Budget is its record of broken promises. It has no credibility on the question of the revenue side of the Budget and not much on the expenditue side either; but I will come to that in a minute. It is only in the context of this Government's credibility, or lack of it, that this Budget can be understood. The whole history of this Government has been one of economic failure. Its slogan was 'turn on the lights'. Liberal politicians might whisper that quietly to their children in 1982 but there is no cry of 'turn on the lights' any more because seven years of disastrous economic management have rendered that slogan abortive. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has had a chronic failure to bring about a recovery in the economy and a chronic failure to provide jobs for Australians. But at election time they have been a little more successful. We are now in 1982. The Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, and his fellow jugglers such as Mr Eggleton, Mr Anthony, Mr Howard and whosoever happens to be in the reigning guru group in this Government sit down and say: 'What will we do this time in 1982?' The options are fewer; they have receded. A lot of whistles have been blown. Another mining boom is just not on; it cannot be reinvented at this stage. The situation is pretty desperate. There is widespread talk of recession. So it is back again to tax cuts. But this time there is to be a different way of going back on the income tax cuts and that is by the imposition of indirect taxes. So all the recoveries that have been projected in various Budgets of this Government in the past are now reduced to the sordid possibility of a tax evasion led recovery which is the only thing the Government has to fall back on at this point. </PARA>
<PARA> So what we have now is the introduction of increasing indirect taxes preceded by a campaign on the necessity to broaden the tax base, something which in principle I do not think there is any fundamental quarrel about; perhaps there is quarrel about the way in which it is done. Of course, those people I referred to a minute ago think that this may work. But at present they want to try a few sideshows as well in the hope that it will all blow away; hence the number of pieces of legislation and resolutions that have been introduced which have no relevance to the great matters of managing the economy of this country. It is considerations such as those-not good economic management, not proper government , nor any other responsible motive-that activate this Government because in the meantime the real problems continue. </PARA>
<PARA> From 1975 to 1980 income per head in Australia grew by 1.2 per cent per year while in the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as a whole it grew by 2.7 per cent-more than twice as fast as in Australia. Australia slipped from being fifth in 1950 in the income per head table among Western countries to being sixteenth in 1979. We slipped from fifth to sixteenth. By 1979 we were exceeded by Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Belgium, Norway, United States of America, Netherlands, France and Canada. Over the period 1970 to 1979 growth rates in Australia were lower than those in nine of the leading countries of South East Asia. Again, in the period from 1950 to 1973 our growth was about 20 per cent lower than the OECD average. The cumulative effect of that over 23 years of Liberal governments is very great indeed in terms of a country going down the hit parade. In that period we had a 20 per cent lower growth rate than the OECD average. What is the significance of that in a debate about the Budget of the Fraser Government in 1982? It is simply this: For 30 out of the last 33 years this sort of thing has gone on under Liberal-National Country Party governments-governments like Mr Fraser's Government-which are more interested in gimmickry and rhetoric than real government. They cannot escape responsibility for this. Indeed, the 23 years to which I refer correspond exactly with the Menzies, Gorton, McMahon and Fraser years. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government and this Budget is in that inglorious tradition, riding on mindless ideology, while the real problems run on. It purports to be a free enterprise government but, if so, it is not a good free enterprise government because the enterprises which should have made us world leaders, with the vast resources which this country has, have not prospered under this Government and have not prospered under Liberal governments in the past 30 years out of the 33 in which they have governed. The situation is similar with manufacturing industry. Australian manufacturing industry is sick. It passed its peak of employment in 1965 and has been going downhill ever since. In 1965, 28 per cent of the Australian work force was employed in manufacturing industry. It is now down to something of the order of 19 per cent. In only two years, 1973 and 1974, did that figure flutter up for a brief period. </PARA>
<PARA> Manufacturing industry is in the doldrums and the seven years of Fraser Government have done nothing to pull it out of the doldrums. There has been no investment led recovery-not even a jawboning led recovery, despite the Prime Minister's best efforts. There are real long term problems and the Budget Papers admit failure in relation to all of these problems. This is a no growth Budget. This Budget is an admission that the Government has no idea what to do next. It has surrendered control over the economy and it represents a turn-round in economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government should have been doing in this Budget was to set a long term foundation for growth. It would have been a bit late. The Government should have done that in its first Budget in 1976 when it was elected with the biggest majority in Australian history. That was the time to lay the foundation for long term economic growth in Australia. But none of the Budgets to which I have referred have addressed themselves to that question. What is needed is a set of policies to get the economy back on the path of recovery, not the cynical ad hoc policies represented by this Budget. The Budget itself speaks of the Government' s failure. I refer now to some of the forecasts contained in it. First, there is to be a contraction in the building industry. We are promised that in the Budget Papers. Second, there is to be a decline in business investment. Third, there will be no growth at all in the non-farm sector of the economy. Fourth, inflation will increase to 11 per cent. Fifth, there will be continued high interest rates. Sixth, there will be no growth in employment. Seventh, there will be a massive rise in unemployment. These are not my predictions; they are contained in the Budget Papers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's answer to all of this is again to try to lay the blame elsewhere. A variety of scapegoats can always be invented by this Government to account for its own inefficiencies and ineptitude. For example, wage demands are currently a favourite scapegoat. I have no doubt that, in the current economic climate, it is quite true to say that many employers cannot meet higher wage demands. At the same time, it is not always so easy to blame unions for trying to maintain their real standards of living. They are not fooled by such underhandedness as the Government has shown, for instance by omitting from consumer price index figures the effect of indirect taxes-taxes which bear on the level of income of every family. A simplistic reaction to our situation is to blame high wages, to say that they make this country uncompetitive. It would be interesting-I note that no one in the Government has ever attempted it-to work out how low wages would have to be in Australia to make this country actually competitive with some of the countries that are used for comparison. Of course, the real culprit is lack of growth of the Australian economy because, by cutting back wages, the Government is also cutting back consumer spending- indirect taxes have the same effect and thus accentuating the downward spiral. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the reason why the Government blames the excessive wage demands is that it has itself no wages policy. There are plenty of authorities for that proposition. I suppose that the closest to the heart of the Prime Minister would be the statement by Mr Andrew Peacock, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Industrial Relations, who has said quite explicitly that the Fraser Government has no wages policy. What his country needs is more than anything else a sound approach to prices and incomes, based on some notion of social equity. The Labor Party's prices and incomes policy would take that path, as have all other countries of the OECD with successful or relatively successful economies in the early 1980s. That course is rejected by the present Government on what one can only presume to be ideological grounds.</PARA>
<PARA> Growth in the Australian economy would allow wages and spending to be maintained or increased and would also allow for business profitability. Yet after seven years we find in the Budget Papers, as recorded at page 137 of Hansard of 17 August 1982, the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . in 1981-82, the Australian economy moved into a period of low growth and high inflation . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>As if that was some dramatic development which had not been taking place for years. The statement continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The factors giving rise to that development persist and the outlook for 1982-83 therefore contains little to suggest improvement. </PARA>
<PARA>Such is the state to which we have come after seven years of this Government's administration. We have witnessed a series of electoral tricks, but the underlying problems of Australia remain untackled in this Budget, as in all other Budgets of this Government, though the Budget is the basic instrument of economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In planning for a no-growth economy, the Government is saying that every Australian who is out of a job will just have to get used to it. It is saying by way of comfort to the unemployed: 'Do not worry. You will soon be joined by many others.' The Government has failed to discharge its fundamental responsibility to provide for the Australian people. Apparently it lives on some sort of blind faith that if we can cut back everything enough, private investment will take over and we will have a recovery. It is not a government that should talk about recoveries. It has done so for too long, yet there have been no significant recoveries with any staying power at all. Only now, after having created the mess in which this country finds itself, does the Government show any signs of wavering in relation to those matters. Its policy has produced no positive results, rather an enormous negative effect at an equally enormous economic social cost. That social cost is before the Government's eyes in the form of lengthening dole queues, increasing poverty and falling living standards. No one denies that the increases provided in the Budget in respect of some social welfare benefits are necessary and very welcome. Nobody could deny that at all. But it should never be forgotten that they are not a proper substitute for prosperity, and in this regard the Government has failed. What they represent is a government saying: 'We can no longer manage this economy so we will try at least to look good by giving you increases to disguise our incompetence in economic management'. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment now runs at record levels and is likely to reach 9 per cent before the end of this year. That is just a figure but it represents an increase of 130 ,000 in the number of people who are out of work. That is not a mere statistic; it represents people. This is masked by a decline in the work force participation rate. Since September 1980 there has been a continuous decline in that rate from a figure of 61.6 per cent to 60.7 per cent at present. In other words, no longer are people bothering to look for jobs. That has become pointless because it is recognised that the jobs are not there. Even the Budget Papers admit it. At page 135 of Hansard of 17 August 1982, the following statement appears:</PARA>
<PARA> It follows that there is unlikely to be any growth in employment in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, no growth of employment, not withstanding that in excess of 100,000 people will come onto the labour market after the schools close at the end of the year. So, despite the rhetoric of seven years concerning fighting inflation first, we still have an enormous unemployment problem, one that is becoming worse while inflation continues largely unabated. The consumer price index is expected to rise by about 10.75 per cent during 1982-83-a figure which does not take account of the impact of indirect taxes. That figure is marginally greater than the 10.4 per cent rise experienced in 1982-83. The Budget Papers themselves predict:</PARA>
<PARA> Indirect taxes contained in the Budget will increase domestic prices, probably adding directly around 1 per cent to the consumer price index . . . </PARA>
<PARA>One of the most disreputable parts of the rhetoric of the Howard-Fraser Budget- or I guess one should call it the Fraser-Howard Budget this year-is its cynical insistence that it is a Budget for Australian families. The Treasurer has wheeled out the family in some sort of heart-on-the-sleeve fashion as though the Government had ever had any real concern for ordinary Australians. If it had it would have listened with a little greater diligence to what the Labor Opposition had been saying for four years now about the plight of Australian families. Since 1978, the Labor Party in this place has been drawing attention to the decline in the living standard of the average Australian family. For four years that call, which is supported by massive evidence, has gone unheeded by the Government. Yet at this time, when the country is in its greatest plight in regard to sense of direction, economic management and a government prepared to deal with basic realities of the economy, some genuine concessions have been made for the first time to those who have suffered as a result of declining living standards. Since 1975-76 living standards in this country have continually fallen. Australian families are $40 a week worse off. The indirect tax rises and the acknowledged high rate of inflation in this Budget will destroy any marginal gains to families, or anyone else, obtained through small income tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> Needless to say, the Government skips over the sneakier facts of other increased charges in the Budget. The classic illustration is the increase in telephone charges. The big losers out of the rise in telephone charges will be people in rural Australia, the Government's taken-for-granted supporters. People in rural Australia are obliged to make short distance subscriber trunk dialling calls, which are to rise by between 4c and 7c a call. The Budget contains a number of other impositions on people living in non-metropolitan Australia. The new petrol tax and the reduction of the freight cost subsidy will add 1.5c a litre to country petrol prices. The abolition of the exemption from excise duty on diesel fuel for off-road use will mean despite the rebates, a net cost of $ 176m will be borne by a wide range of rural industries. The Budget is another example of how this Government punishes country people by taking them for granted. </PARA>
<PARA> So despite the promises and the rhetoric, inflation, rising interest rates and lack of growth have affected the economy of this country as a whole since 1976. The Budget document speaks with a massive silence about any possible solution to those problems. Inequities and inequalities within this society have been magnified by this Government. The personal income tax system has placed a greater relative tax burden on lower and middle income earners. On the other hand, those on higher incomes of around $30,000 or more are now experiencing a lower average tax rate. For example, a single person earning $10,700, in 1980-81 figures, throughout the six years to 1981-82 experienced a rise of 21 per cent in the proportion of income paid as tax. For a person on the average wage the proportion increased by about 11 per cent. On the other hand, the rate for a person earning $32,000 remained the same. For higher incomes still, the rate actually fell. </PARA>
<PARA> Lest it be put about that this is a government with concern for families, it should be pointed out that that families too, if in the lower or middle income brackets, did not escape. A taxpayer with a dependent spouse and two children, earning average wages, recorded a 73 per cent increase in the proportion of income paid in tax. By contrast, a person in the same family situation but earning $32,000 per annum saw an increase of only 3 per cent in the same period. The real policy of this Government is to transfer money to the better off, whether by Government action, by Government fiat by explicit policy or by ignoring tax evation. Perhaps it does this because of prejudice and general Liberal Party interest group pressures. But above that, if it has an economic policy it is just a hope that investment of that money will lead a recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> If anyone doubts its general party philosophy, as distinct from the cant of its members' speeches at election time, that person should look at what is happening inside the Liberal Party over tax evasion. From sheer embarrassment the Government has had to try to do something, after a little prodding from the Victorian Premier and others. What was going on was becoming just too obvious. Then reality within the party surpassed the real nature of much of the party itself. It all looked a bit serious, a bit too close to the bone, so now we have a very revealing debate within the Liberal Party about the issue of retrospectivity-even to the extent of the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party coming out openly against it. That may be a technical matter, but of course it is a matter which indicates deep-seated division of views about all sorts of issues involving social equity and social morality in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the majority of people in society are not well off the Liberals obviously cannot declare their real policy, so they have to think up excuses which disguise it, such as what they would do on tax indexation, as they did prior to previous elections, and like the resources boom which, prior to the election of 1980, they said would take place. There is no reason to believe that this Government has changed its colours in any way on these fundamental issues. The Budget continues the basic policy. All that has changed is the thinking up of a new public presentation. The issue is one of credibility. It is the issue over this Budget and over this Government, and will be the issue in the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> It is noteworthy that the newspaper reaction to the Budget played up the election gimmickry of it all. Of course this has happened before; election gimmickry in a Budget before an election is nothing new. People are being offered indirect taxes now with some income tax relief in the future, and so on. But, as the Australian Financial Review put it, 'It is no longer possible to deliver three-card tricks and not have them seen for what they are.' The Financial Review was talking about this Budget, and this Government's time is running out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has just heard a typical repetition of the remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden, in the House of Representatives last night which, again, in truly panic-ridden and negative fashion, draws upon a bankrupt series of propositions which obviously do not stand in the public gaze. I hope a little later during my speech to attend to some of the points mentioned by Senator Button, but first of all I turn to some of the fundamental issues which he raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First and foremost Senator Button drew attention to the fact that growth rates in Australia in the last few years have been somewhat lower than those of our South East Asian neighbours. There is absolutely no argument about that, but the reasons that has occurred are an excessive wage push by the trade union movement and a lack of competitiveness of Australian industries which has developed in recent times. That is a very significant point which deserves repetition. But, of course, it underscores the fundamental premise of this Budget at this time. Senator Button has recognised very well, without saying so, the great truths which are written into this Budget-that it is aimed at assisting those most in need and, at the same time, assisting to restrain wage growth. Those things obviously have been recognised-I am sure unconsciously in Senator Button's case- as the fundamental truths behind this Budget. I will address myself to those issues a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> As for gimmickry, I am surprised to hear a member of the Australian Labor Party argue that assistance of the order being provided in this Budget for families can somehow be labelled as gimmickry. If any issue has been running around the community over the last year or so it has been issue of the difficulties of families meeting mortgage repayments due to rising interest rates and the problems of increased taxation. Since time immemorial the Opposition in this place has represented those problems as the fundamental issues which concern Australians. Yet when the Government addresses itself to those problems it is criticised by the Opposition on the ground that it is some kind of electorial gimmickry, a gerrymander or an attempt to get the electorate ready for an election. That seems to me to be so recognisably hypocritical that it does not even deserve comment, but it needs to be raised in this place in order to draw people's attention to the kind of cant that comes from the Opposition when it has nothing else to talk about. As I have said, the Opposition recognises the strengths of this Budget, and has supported it here tonight in the remarks of Senator Button. </PARA>
<PARA> If anyone was listening last night to Mr Hayden's remarks and expecting some kind of reasoned, rational criticism of the Budget, he would have been terribly disappointed. Furthermore, if he was looking for some kind of alternative economic program, he would have been even more disappointed. All we got from Mr Hayden was that over-rated, exaggerated stream of invective and unsubstantiated criticism which really stood up to no kind of criticism itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at a couple of the points. These things have been reiterated tonight by Senator Button. Senator Button mentioned, for instance, that unemployment would rise by 130,000 this year. What then is the basis of his figuring? This figure is gaining some currency around the community by virtue of the Labor Party reiterating a point which it is unable to substantiate in any way. It has criticised the way in which the Government has calculated the amount of unemployment benefit that will be paid, yet those figures rely upon expert Treasury opinion and expert Treasury calculations. Yet the Labor Party is prepared to come into this place knowing that it is free from criticism and spout out numbers off the top of the head which indicate what the level of unemployment might be this year. It has no expert advice, or if it has, it is not prepared to tell us what that advice is. Labor senators are not prepared to tell us who did the calculations. As I read the Bulletin today, perhaps they come from the gentleman in Mr Willis's office who is under so much strain at present. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps it is, but I am glad to hear that Senator Coleman is prepared to deny it. Let us proceed to one or two other matters which are of greater concern to Australians, and are the issues in this Budget. Without being terribly downcast by the proposition of the world recession which is about us, we have to develop a realism and sense of prudence based on what we expect to be international developments in the next year. Clearly there are problems overseas . We know that the international recession is deepening. We know that Australia' s overseas markets have shrunk; we see that every month from the export and import figures. We have seen unemployment rising. We see that inflation is far too high, higher than we accept. We know that interest rates are still unacceptably high. Yet the reasons why this is so and the reasons why these things are problems for us are clearly issues that we have to take into account in designing any Budget. It is not to be downcast at those propositions. It is indelibly clear that we need to be able to have clearly in our minds those factors when designing a Budget that will stimulate development in the longer run in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly, we have a problem in competitiveness. Over the last few years we have seen a gradual decline in the ability of Australian industry to sell on world markets. Never could that be truer than in a situation in which we have a market that is shrinking on the world sceen in the way in which it is. Clearly that is as a result of excessive wage demands and developments that have occurred on the world scene. That is the kind of proposition to which the Budget addresses itself. It clearly recognises the fundamental problems associated with this difficulty of our lack of competitiveness on world markets. Clearly it offers a means by which that question can be addressed. It offers an opportunity for there to be a trade-off between tax cuts and benefits for families in such a way as can be taken into account in settling wage claims in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> If one is to have regard to those particular elements, one sees that these changes that have been occurring recently are very significant. To quote a particular comment of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) during his speech, after taking into account the benefits of the housing loan interest rebate, the family allowance increases-by the way, not introduced by the Labor Government but by this Government-and the family income supplement, and the effect of indirect tax increases, we find that a family on, say, $300 a week will benefit to the net extent of $17.76 a week. That is a very significant change in the net disposable income of families and clearly it is a very significant incentive for workers to take into account in any future wage claims. That kind of restraint which can be exercised by unions and by wage earners will be fundamental to the regaining of a degree of competitiveness in world markets for Australian industry. It is somthing which this Government is directly addressing and is strongly supporting in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at a family that is in less fortunate circumstances and perhaps has an income of only $180 a week, one finds that the net effect and net benefit to that family, after taking into account the new initiative of family income supplement, will be $30.10 more than the family would have had before the Budget . That means a change in its disposable income of about 17.5 per cent. That is a very significant change, and it clearly shows that the Budget is not only attempting to address itself to the fundamental problems of wage restraint but also is addressing itself to those on the lowest incomes who are in the greatest need. That is the other thrust of the Budget, to which I now turn. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider in some detail how the Government will be addressing itself to the issue of need. As to family allowances, we note that the rate for first and second children will be up by 50 per cent from November. The cost of that to the Government will be about $250m in this financial year. That, however, is not the major consideration. The major consideration is that there will be two million Australian families benefiting from that proposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have that figure before me. The question and problems of unemployed youth, about which we hear a great deal in this place, are at present of very considerable concern. It is acknowledged that this has been so for some time. Expenditure on work experience during 1982-83 will rise to $74m. That will allow for 74,000 new work experience placements and increases of up to 36 per cent in the rate of subsidy to employers. In addition, the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training expenditure will rise to $84m, which will enable employers to receive assistance in respect of some 111,000 apprentices this year. That compares with the figure of 99,000 for last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to some of the very real problems of taxation which have been spoken of in this place by the Opposition and which are clearly areas of great concern within the community. A greater degree of assistance has been offered to low income families by the raising of the tax free threshold from $4,195 to $4,595. </PARA>

At the same time, workers in this area will benefit from the tax free threshold being lifted to $4,595.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chipp has deliberately misrepresented the point I am making. I am talking about those people whose incomes range up to the point at which 46 per cent applies. Additionally, the Treasurer announced in March that there would be a scheme to help first home buyers. That has been discussed in this place for some months. This benefit represents a clear advantage to young couples and those seeking their first home. In addition, the Budget has brought in a new range of benefits for all taxpayers. People paying off a housing loan mortgage will be entitled to a rebate on the amount of interest they pay on the loan over and above 10 per cent up to a total limit of $60,000. Clearly that is a benefit aimed at assisting those who are most in need. To those families who are short of a deposit and are forced into borrowing the greatest amount of money, possibly at higher rates of interest than might otherwise apply, those in greatest need, this scheme represents a very significant advantage. The benefit that will apply for a family on average weekly earnings will be in the order of $5.05. This figure will be significantly higher in other groups of need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In repatriation benefits for veterans, my area of responsibility, we have seen some very significant changes. I believe they will address many very long term needs of veterans, particularly as they grow older. Firstly, the Government will be undertaking major new works in two repatriation hospitals-one in Perth and one in Adelaide. We will be updating facilities and improving operating theatres and wards. Secondly, the Government will be undertaking the reopening of five wards in repatriation hospitals across Australia. They will be specifically nominated for veterans. This will require the creation of 115 nursing positions and 175 trainee positions within the hospital system across Australia. That is a very significant benefit. I am sure that it will contribute greatly to the reservoir of nursing and medical skills available in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably the most significant benefit which has flowed from the Budget for veterans concerns a decision to disregard to the extent of 100 per cent-in other words, totally-the amount of a person's disability compensation in assessing eligibility for the service pension and fringe benefits. I believe that is a most welcome change in the approach of governments over the past few years. It follows the principles that have been established by this Government since 1980 in gradually relieving that situation. Furthmore, there has been an extension of free medical and hospital treatment to service pensioners who receive a disability pension of not less than 50 per cent. This benefit will provide treatment and care mainly for World War II veterans, people who are growing older as time goes by. I am sure that their minds will be eased to a great extent as they seek medical help and as the need for that help increases. </PARA>
<PARA> Other benefits based on the rate of inflation will be available to those in greatest need. I think of the most severely disabled veterans, those who need special care and aids from the Department to enable them to go about their normal lives. In that way this Government is contributing very worthily to those who are in greatest need. Of course, that is one of the fundamental questions to which this Budget addresses itself. It is clear that my area of repatriation is like a microcosm of the whole approach to the Government's Budget. It is seeking to help those who are the most disabled, those who are the most handicapped, those who face the greatest problems in the community and those who require the sorts of things which government can deliver. </PARA>
<PARA> I said earlier that nobody can deny the effects on Australia of the world recession or the fact that Australia's world markets have shrunk. It would seem axiomatic that Australian industry should be doing everything in its power to become more competitive in the international market. It is clear-even the Opposition, in its own way, has acknowledged this-that excessive growth in wages has undermined Australian competitiveness and has resulted in Australians pricing themselves and their jobs out of the market. Senator Walsh will acknowledge that in 1975 the average net disposable income in real terms was of the order of $12,742. This includes government supplements and so on. This was the figure after net medical and insurance costs had been taken into account. Let us compare that with the situation as it applied in 1981-82. Using the appropriate deflators, that figure had grown to $13,633. In other words, there was an increase in net disposable income over that time of the order $900. That demonstrates a significant growth in real incomes over this period. It also demonstrates that there has not been the kind of gloom and doom in the wage earning section of the community, that Senator Button, in his speech, would have had us believe there has been. In fact, there was a general improvement in living standards over that period. Senator Elstob may scoff, but the facts are demonstrated clearly in the figures that I have given. There was an improvement of some $900 in real terms in net disposable income over that period. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the 1982-83 Budget will make a very positive effort in encouraging wage restraint in the Australian community. I assure the Senate that this is vital if the slide in competitiveness in our import competing industries is to be halted. We now have conditions for moderation and, therefore, the potential to hold down inflation and to maintain and develop competitiveness. We must not forget the other measures that have been taken in the Budget to assist an encourage Australian businesses. This should be read in direct relationship to these questions. These Budget measures include the rebate that has been provided for the first $1,000 of dividends paid by resident companies to shareholders. Secondly, there has been an extension of the retention allowance of up to 80 per cent from the previous level of 70 per cent for the purposes of Division 7 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. This will be of major benefit-to the extent of some $30m-for small businesses and private companies in particular. In order to encourage the worker ownership of smaller businesses-and larger ones for that matter-employer companies approved under the schemes will be able to issue shares to employees in such a way that when those shares are resold for any purpose the profit on them will not be taxable. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably one of the most significant things that has been done, particularly in my State of South Australia, is the changed method of treating companies within company groups by offsetting losses against profits. This will now be done under the changed law. I draw the attention of honourable senators to that, particularly in relation to South Australia. It is a matter of concern to people in Whyalla who are worried about the future of the steel industry run in that town by Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. The benefits in this area are of particular significance to them in terms of being able to offset profits against steel making losses in that town. This is all happening against the background of other industry measures which have been announced in previous weeks and which , of course, touch upon the question of changed methods of calculation of depreciation and deducations which will provide significant encouragement to manufacturers for capital spending and also for those engaged in mining and rural activities. This of course is again part of the overall package of industry assistance measures announced recently, which included the changed levels of protection for industry generally. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the Government has brought down a Budget, the key objectives of which are to assist families to meet unforeseen burdens, to give special help to those most in need, to boost employment where possible, to assist industry and to encourage wage restraint. In contrast, last night the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and tonight the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate ( Senator Button) attacked our policy on wage restraint and trotted out yet another arrangement with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. I quote from that respected economic commentator Syntec, in this regard. This comment appeared in the July edition of the monthly newsletter:</PARA>
<PARA> Thus in the absence of an international recovery much stronger than any that seems in prospect, recovery here depends on the speed with which we can cut the rate of increase in our domestic cost structure, particularly wages. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a very clear argument for wage restraint and it is clearly acknowledged by the Opposition, although it is not prepared to say so as clearly as all that. Furthermore, the Opposition in this place and in the House of Representatives has denigrated the assistance given through the Budget to those in need. Honourable senators opposite in fact called it gimmickry and electioneering. They used words of that kind. They have addressed it as being cynical and ad hoc . Yet clearly, as I have demonstrated tonight, these are very significant benefits. As I have said, a person receiving an income of $180 per week will benefit to the extent of an extra $30 per week in his hands. That is a very significant help and is clearly being exploited by the Opposition without studying the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has continued to put forward a vague package which no doubt the Leader of the Opposition sees as electorally attractive. Anybody can offer jobs on the scale that he has without having to back up his claims in any way or show any calculations as to how he may do it. He can make if appear that it is somehow economically viable. Yet of course we all recognise that as another economic fairy tale which he trots out in this place from time to time. The benefits to individuals, families, companies, the economy and those in greatest need are considerable. That is the thrust of the Government's Budget. The alternative Budget strategy put forward by the Opposition boils down, in the main-I think these figures are conservative-to a doubling of the Government's deficit, fully financed by the printing of money. Mr Hayden announced last night , quite clearly, that he expected to be able to fund the deficit by virtue of selling bills to the Reserve Bank of Australia. That is precisely how the Labor Government achieved its objective in 1974 and 1975. It is called printing money. That is precisely what it is about-the making of inflation through increasing the money supply. The limited Budget figuring that it has provided suggests that the deficit will be of the order of at least $3,000m. If one takes into account other figures which relate to what the Opposition claims are deficiencies in our calculations, that might add at least another $1,000m. But I do not acknowledge that at all at this stage. This clearly is an objective which is inimical to the kinds of objectives which the Labor Party claims it has, that is, to achieve lower interest rates. Clearly, there is no way that that kind of deficit, financed in the way that it is suggested it might be, will lead to lower interest rates. Nor will it, as the Opposition well knows, create more jobs. What it will do is create more inflation and not lead to more wage restraints which is the essential feature of our Budget. It is aiming towards a situation where we can achieve a more competitive position on overseas markets. The ALP economic package is a prescription for more and more inflation, not less. It is not a prescription for more growth; it is a prescription for a higher deficit and for higher interest rates, not lower interest rates. That is the message which we have to leave with the Australian people tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In spite of the comments by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner), this Budget does not represent a change of direction by the Government. It may well be a vote catching Budget but it is not a Budget designed to stimulate the economy. The mirage of goodies conjured up by carefully contrived Budget leaks is nothing but a confidence trick. They are boiled lollies for the purpose of hiding the real medicine. Last year, in a speech on the 1981 Budget, I said that it was time for the Herbert Hoovers in the Government to be thrown out and for men of vision like Franklyn D. Roosevelt to come to the fore. Little did I realise how urgent that call was. But, alas, the Hoovers in Australia and around the world are still presiding over the destruction not only of our economy but also that of the United State of America , the greatest power-house in the world. We are now on the brink. An article by Maxwell Newton in the Australian on Monday last stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yet the economic policies of the administration-both tax and monetary-are daily taking on more the aspects of the policies implemented by President Hoover in the early 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> Under Mr Hoover, the money supply was drastically restricted at a time of economic recession. </PARA>
<PARA>At that time, the American federal reserve, fearing inflation, strongly restricted bank reserves and starved the economic system of money. In 1932, the Hoover Administration increased income tax by $900m, or nearly 30 per cent, and a severe recession turned onto the Great Depression. I need hardly remind honourable senators of the result. Extremism flourished, demagogues who promised easy solutions came to power and the world was plunged into catastrophe. </PARA>
<PARA> I said we were on the brink of an abyss. Until this year nobody thought that was possible. Had we not learned from the past? Did we not know how to stimulate the economy when times were tough and dampen it down when times were good? The counter-cyclical approach has virtually been abandoned in this Budget. Instead, the Government has brought down a Budget which has been described by some commentators as neutral in its impact on the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time when the economy is desperately short of demand and cash, a neutral Budget is the best that the Government can do. The critical problem of this Budget is the domestic surplus of $230m. This means that the economic screws are being tightened at a time when the economy demands that they be loosened. I quote from page 317 of Budget Paper No. 1:</PARA>
<PARA> The domestic deficit measures the Budget's immediate contribution to liquidity in the economy . . . the domestic deficit or surplus is of key significance for monetary conditions and monetary conditions and monetary management in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA>I intend to focus my remarks on the Government's domestic surplus. In simple terms the domestic surplus means that the Government is taking $230m more out of the economy in the form of various sorts of taxation than it is giving back to the people in the form of social welfare and other payments. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8R7">Senator SIDDONS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am coming to that. I ask the honourable senator to be patient . The Government is taking money out of the economy and restricting liquidity at a time when the economy is balanced on the brink. We have heard forecasts of 8 per cent unemployment. In fact, Senator Button said 9 per cent. The Government has not revealed these sorts of forecasts; in fact, it has gone out of its way to tell us that we are in for a bad time. What possible justification could the Government have for coming up with a Budget with a strategy almost identical this year to the strategy we had last year? Last year the Government was talking of a resources boom. If a domestic surplus was justified last year, how can the Government possibly justify a domestic surplus of about the same magnitude this year when the economic conditions are so much worse and everybody realises that they are?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The answer to this strategy by the Government is simply this: It is justified on the basis that the only way to get rid of inflation is to tighten the monetary screws, irrespective of the hardship that this approach can cause to the community generally and irrespective of whether it creates massive unemployment. The tragedy is that the Government has had three unfettered years to solve inflation its way-through tight money-and it has failed. The problem of inflation has not been solved in Australia. Let us look at other countries. In recent years Germany has budgeted for very substantial deficits. It has been one of the most successful countries in the Western world in fighting inflation. The same situation applies to Japan and Austria. Those countries have budgeted for domestic deficits well in excess of 3 per cent of gross domestic product. So we have to ask the question: How long is the Government going to persist with policies that are just not working? There is another way. It is a way that many financial institutions do not particularly like but it is the alternative. That way is to loosen the money screws. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Government's Budget strategy over recent years. Between 1974 and 1975 not once did Budget deficits as a percentage of gross domestic product fall below 3 per cent. Over the last three years Budget deficits have been dramatically different, as the deficit is this year. In the past three years the deficit has been respectively 1.8 per cent, 0.9 per cent, and 0.4 per cent of the gross domestic product. This year it is one per cent of GDP. So we see that since 1979 there has been a dramatic change of policy by the Government in its handling of the economy. The Government's tight money supply started then, and it has persisted with that policy right through to this Budget, in spite of our rapidly deteriorating economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Some weeks ago I advocated that this year the Government should budget for an overall deficit of 3 per cent of gross domestic product. We have seen that this was modest even by the Government's own standards. In 1976 its deficit was 3.1 per cent of gross domestic product, in 1977 it was 3.7 per cent, and in 1978 it was 3.4 per cent. One media commentator pointed out that a deficit of 3 per cent of GDP would represent the highest in this country's history. In purely money terms that is certainly true. Today, three per cent of GDP would represent a deficit of $4.8 billion, whereas a deficit of 4.2 per cent of GDP in 1974 represented only $4.5 billion. However, a $4.8 billion deficit in 1974 values is equivalent to a deficit of only $1.9 billion today. So in constant money terms a deficit of 3 per cent today would be less than the deficits brought down by this Government in 1977 and 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer now to cyclical adjustments, a term used in economic management circles around the world, but not in this country. Earlier I said that one commentator claimed that the Budget was neutral in its effect on the economy. But is it neutral? I put it to honourable senators that it is in effect far from neutral on jobs, inflation and interest rates. A small exercise with a pocket calculator will show that on a constant employment basis, which is the only reasonable way to look at a Budget, this Budget is grossly contractionary. On a constant employment basis revenue in this Budget would be about $48 billion and expenditure about $46 billion. In other words, on this basis the Government has budgeted for something like a $2 billion surplus overall or a nearly $4 billion surplus domestically. What do I mean by a constant employment Budget? I put it to honourable senators that the nominal figures given in the Budget are a mere bookkeeping exercise, almost totally unrelated to the Budget's impact on the economy. This impact can be measured only by a constant employment analysis, which shows how the Budget would be if it were adjusted for a constant level of activity and employment. This sort of analysis evens out the distortions caused by swings in the economic cycle. Obviously in a recession this cuts tax revenues and boosts social security payments. In a boom the reverse happens. Constant employment analysis evens out these fluctuations. </PARA>
<PARA> In case honourable senators think this is a novel idea, I point out that it is widely used around the world, and even, I understand, in Mrs Thatcher's Britain. The Australian Treasury has consistently opposed such an analysis on the grounds that any adjustments are somewhat arbitrary and that the figures can be fudged. This is true. It is also true that the Treasury is getting away with the ultimate fudge in the form of crude and meaningless figures. If we modify the Budget to take account of the situation that would apply under constant employment of, say, 2 per cent and 5 per cent greater economic activity-these aims surely are quite modest-we get the sorts of surpluses I mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn briefly to government sector borrowing. I want to do this before I comment on one or two specific features of the Budget. We have heard on many occasions that we have to be concerned about Government sector borrowing to make way for private sector borrowing. There is one point that completely explodes this shibboleth. If we look at the national debt indexed for inflation, the facts of the matter are that Australia has been reducing its national debt since the conservative Government came to power and this is a feat that has not been achieved by any other member country of the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Where has that got us? Australia has applied the monetarist policy more rigidly than any other OECD country and what do we have? Where has it got us? Where has the big deal got us? In November 1975 the level of inflation was 14.6 per cent. In 1982 inflation is rising dramatically. In November 1975, 232,400 people or 5 per cent of the work force were registered as unemployed. At the beginning of 1983 it is anticipated that at least 8 per cent will be unemployed. In November 1975 the overdraft rate charged by trading banks was 11.5 per cent and the interest rate on the average home loan was 8.5 per cent. Today the interest rate on overdrafts is 13.5 per cent and the interest rate on the average home loan is 14.5 per cent. All taxes and revenues collected by the Federal Government in 1975-76 were only 23 per cent of gross domestic product. Today they are 29 per cent of GDP. To rub salt into the wound we are getting less for it. We do not even have Medibank for a start.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a way that we can have a synthesis between Keynesian and supply-side economics. The argument generally applied against deficits is that they create excessive liquidity and therefore contribute to inflation. In a time of unused capacity such as we have at the moment I doubt that this argument is valid. But just assuming it is, I suggest that the Government could readily soak up any excess liquidity that a large deficit or even a modest deficit may provoke by the sale of bonds indexed for inflation. For instance, if we had a domestic deficit of, say, $3 billion this would, of course, increase liquidity in the economy by $3 billion. But this could be reduced if, for instance, the Government were prepared to offer, say, $2 billion worth of bonds indexed for inflation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am coming to that. One might ask whether this would put pressure on the loan market, whether it would increase interest rates and whether the economy is capable of taking up $2 billion worth of government bonds . The answer to that last question is, yes, the economy would be capable of taking up $2 billion worth of indexed bonds for the simple reason that we would have already put $3 billion into the economy via the deficit and we are taking out $2 billion via the sale of the bonds. One might ask: Why put money in and take it out? There is a very simple answer to that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8R7">Senator SIDDONS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has budgeted for a domestic surplus. I can only go on the figures as they are set out in the Budget. I am not commenting on whether the figures are rubbery or not. I am saying that the Government's strategy is based on a domestic surplus, and that is what I am commenting on. What is achieved by putting money in and taking it out? It achieves this: If we put money into circulation via a deficit this money goes directly to where it is needed most. Say, for instance, $1 billion of a $3 billion deficit went to the social security area where it is urgently needed. This money would be spent there immediately and this would immediately stimulate demand and consumption. Further, $1 billion of a $3 billion deficit could be directed towards reducing payroll tax-an iniquitous tax on labour-which would immediately stimulate production and have an immediate effect on unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Would such a deficit increase interest rates? First, the major factor affecting interest rates in this country is the level of interest rates overseas, particularly those interest rates in the United States of America. So selling bonds will not affect interest rates one way or the other. The other major factor causing high interest rates is undoubtedly inflation. The level of inflation will not go down until unemployment is reduced and unemployment, of course, represents an enormous unproductive cost to the community. If bonds were indexed for inflation they would be a very attractive investment to the public even at very low rates of interest-say, 2 per cent. The report of the Commitee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System-the Campbell Committee- recommended the sale of indexed bonds. This leads us to the question: Why has the Government been so quiet on this aspect of the Campbell report? I suggest there can be only one answer to this: The Government itself does not believe it can get inflation down quickly. The Government's financial advisers cannot have it both ways. If they are confident that a tight money strategy is the way to reduce inflation they should be delighted at the chance to sell inflation indexed bonds at low rates of interest. I challenge the Government to explain why else it has refused to index the sale of its bonds. I conclude with these comments: The price of economic bigotry is high. Does this country, does the Western world, have to plunge into the abyss before this Government sees the light?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the debate was adjourned shortly before half-past six I was pointing out that the appalling record of bureaucratic and ministerial negligence revealed in the Costigan report had continued, at least as far as the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) was concerned, after the report had been received by the Government. The covering letter from Mr Costigan to the Governor-General carries the date of 27 July. On that day, or at the most the day after, the report was received by the Government. It identified two officers of the Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth, one of whom, Mr O'Sullivan, was described as at best grossly negligent. Another person, Mr Bercove, was described as a dishonest man. The Government received that report on either 27 or 28 July. Last Wednesday, three weeks later, the Attorney-General finally got round to suspending Mr O'Sullivan and Mr Bercove. For three weeks the Attorney-General, in the full knowledge of what these officers had done and had not done allowed them free access to the files of the Deputy Solicitor-General's Office in Perth. One can only speculate as to what damage those officers may have done to those files in the three weeks during which they had complete access to them with, I repeat, the full knowledge of the Attorney-General that those officers had been identified as both negligent and dishonest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The case for censure against the Government is established on the grounds of the negligence of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) alone. It is doubly established by the clear demonstration, the clear proof, of the continuing negligence of the Attorney-General after he had received the Costigan report. I note in passing that the officer described by the royal commissioner as 'a dishonest man' has an interesting background. Mr Bercove was the chief prosecutor who prosecuted, or persecuted if one likes, draft resisters back in the 1960s. I think it is appropriate that someone who did the dirty work for the Liberal Government of that time, someone who sent conscripts to Vietnam while Ministers of military age themselves remained in Australia as Defence or other Service Ministers-I instance Mr Peacock, Mr Fraser and Mr Lynch-by prosecuting draft resisters should subsequently be identified as both a brothelkeeper and a tax cheat. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier today my friend and colleague John Dawkins spoke in the House of Representatives on the censure motion. In the course of his speech he identified nine members of the Liberal Party in Western Australia-both parliamentary and other members-whom he described, I understand, as crooks. Subsequent to that, the Liberal member for Moore, My Hyde, who was not so described, issued a Press statement which said:</PARA>
<PARA> Today under the shield of parliamentary privilege the member for Fremantle-</PARA>
<PARA>That is John Dawkins-</PARA>
<PARA>accused two Western Australian citizens of being 'crooks'. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hyde did not specify the two citizens in question but he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> If there was any wrong doing then the courts should decide. Any tax avoided by Slutzkin type arrangements should be recovered but Mr Dawkins had no justification for impugning the honesty of two citizens-not Ministers of Parliament-who thus have no chance to rebut his accusations. </PARA>
<PARA>In that paragraph it seems to be fairly clear that Mr Hyde and his statement were referring to Syd Corser and Denis Horgan. I observe in passing that apparently the honourable member for Moore has no objection to the other seven prominent Liberal Party members from Western Australia whom my friend and colleague John Dawkins also named in the House of Representatives as crooks being so described. If I attempted to repeat those names here somebody would probably raise a point of order under the relevant Standing Order which, I think , is Standing Order 408. </PARA>

Mr Horgan, in particular, has had ample opportunity to rebut not the accusations but the facts about him as disclosed in the McCabe-Lafranchi report and his involvement in Treamog Ltd and the fact that Treamog, as a result of a sale of shares presided over by Denis Horgan as Managing Director of Treamog, resulted in the evasion of a $1.7m current year tax liability by the company and resulted in the evasion by Denis Horgan personally of three-quarters of a million dollars because he, directly and indirectly, owned 40 per cent of the shares of the company.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a point of order, Mr President. I think this has just about gone far enough. I am almost tempted to ask that we permit Senator Walsh to proceed under Standing Order 404 which provides that the Senate may, by special indulgence, permit a senator, who for reason of sickness or infirmity needs to speak from his seated place. If he continues to throw personal abuse in the way that it has been thrown I think that you could almost describe Standing Order 404 as applying. I have a feeling that this is becoming a little personal, to the degree that it is not enhancing the stature of the Parliament or of this chamber. I suggest that Senator Walsh's accusations be kept to those which were accepted and which were debatable, rather than those which were the cause of the objections which have been rather evident. If we could keep it to that, I think probably a useful debate could take place about some of the problems that exist in Australia. If it gets to the stage of personal abuse back and forth across the chamber, I rather feel that we will have a situation which will not be conducive to the resolution of the problems which we are supposed to be concerned about. Mr President, by way of speaking to a point of order, can I invite just a little consideration of what is the major perspective, as opposed to what is the fine point-the bit of interjection and the bit of crossfire. I hope that those comments will induce a situation which will enable the debate to continue.</PARA></TALK.START>

A couple of weeks ago Senator Withers said that he would not be surprised if most of his colleagues were up to their ears in tax avoidance. A couple of years ago another prominent member of the Liberal Party from Western Australia said that the Liberal Party in Western Australia was not the party he had joined some time ago but was a party dominated by white collar criminals who hide their real objectives behind a smokescreen of States rights. I pass no judgment but I do note that there is a mounting volume of evidence to support both of those assertions.

<PARA> The President may order a complicated Question to be divided. </PARA>
<PARA>By way of evidence to support the proposition that this is a complicated question, I refer to the debate that has taken place in the Senate. Some honourable senators have made it quite apparent that they have been confused by the two issues involved in the censure motion. Two distinct propositions are involved. The first is that the Government should be censured for its failure in relation to the tax avoidance industry and the administration of legislation relating to those offences against the tax laws. The second is that the resigntions of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) should be tendered by those Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> The first proposition constitutes an expression of opinion by the Senate about the Government's failures in the administration of taxation laws. The motion asks the Senate to express an opinion that the Government has failed. The alternative is to express the opinion that the Government has succeeded, which I would have thought an extraordinary proposition in light of the conclusions of the Royal Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was making the point that the motion was in two distinct parts . The first involves an expression of opinion by the Senate in relation to the performance of the Government. One course is to agree that the Government has failed in relation to tax avoidance, and many government supporters agree with that because the excuse used has been, 'We did not know about it', which is exactly the same as saying that the Government failed in respect of administration of the tax laws. That was the Government's case, not mine. That involves an expression of opinion. The second part of the motion involves the Senate calling for action to be taken in respect of those failures-for the resignations of the Attorney-General and the Treasurer. To that extent the Senate is faced with a complex question. Two issues are intermingled in the substance of the motion but they are nevertheless distinct and may logically be separated.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>DEFENCE FORCE DISCIPLINE BILL</PARA>
<PARA> Since World War II repeated efforts have been made to consolidate and modernise the disciplinary law of this country which applies to the Services. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides new disciplinary legislation for the Defence Force and contains, for the first time in one Act, the disciplinary law applicable to the 3 arms of the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill replaces the existing legislation which has come in for well-merited criticism over many years on various grounds. I will deal with the existing legislation briefly before describing the contents of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing legislation is contained in the following:</PARA>
<PARA> 3 United Kingdom acts, 2 of which have ceased to operate in the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA> 4 sets of United Kingdom rules or regulations, all of which have ceased to operate in the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> 3 Australian Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> 9 sets of regulations under the Australian Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> The United Kingdom acts, rules and regulations do not apply in their original form but are subject to extensive modifications, adaptations, exceptions and additions prescribed in the Australian regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Oddities and inconsistencies abound. I will give some examples:</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the Navy and the Air Force, some provisions of the United Kingdom legislation apply in parallel with corresponding but not identical provisions of the Australian legislation, with conflicting directions in the latter as to which is to prevail. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic law for the Navy is contained in a modern United Kingdom statute (the naval Discipline Act 1957) whereas Army and Air Force law has its basis in, or is modelled on, the superseded United Kingdom Army Act of 1881, with all its archaisms, such as offences of ''duelling'': ''Behaving in a scandalous manner unbecoming the character of an officer and a gentleman''; ''by beating drums negligently occasioning false alarms on the march''; and ''conniving at the exaction of any exorbitant price for a house or stall let to a sutler''. I would have thought that one who follows an army and sells provisions to soldiers-an activity which held some prominence in the 16th century-commands little relevance today. Sutlery may have brought its own unique perils. Contemporary Australia gives me the impression it is not greatly troubled by them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Army is provided with 2 sets of disciplinary laws, one of which applies when members are serving in Australia in peace time; the other when members are serving outside Australia or on war service. </PARA>
<PARA> Civil offences may be tried by Service tribunals, but not by Army tribunals in Australia in peace time. </PARA>
<PARA> The civil offences that may be tried are offences against the laws of England, but Navy tribunals may also try offences against the laws of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Army and Air Force tribunals apply the English rules of evidence but Navy tribunals apply the rules of evidence applicable in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Offences involving stealing are dealt with according to the concepts of theft in the United Kingdom Theft Act 1968, except in the case of trials by Army tribunals in Australia in peace time when the common law concepts of larceny are applied. </PARA>
<PARA> The maximum punishments that Navy commanding officers may impose greatly exceed the powers of Army and Air Force commanding officers. </PARA>
<PARA> The maximum punishment imposable by an Army court martial in Australia in peace time is imprisonment for 3 months regardless of the nature of gravity of the offence. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fair to say that any person who is not familiar, through practice, with the operation of these laws, who tries to find a way through the labyrinth of statutes, regulations and extensively modified United Kingdom legislation, faces a daunting task indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing law requires Service lawyers to maintain a continuing and full awareness not only of Australian law and its developments, but also of English criminal law and its developments, a task more difficult and demanding than may be generally recognised. </PARA>
<PARA> A change to a United Kingdom criminal statute or to the English law of evidence may take place, temporarily passing unnoticed in Australia. Such a change may cause an offence to be tried quite wrongly and thereby rendered nugatory. </PARA>
<PARA> The admixture of United Kingdom and Australian law provides ample scope for errors to occur. This is no fantasy. There has, in fact, been one naval conviction quashed because the judge advocate advised the court martial on the basis of an English decision which had not been followed in Australia by the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA> Returning now to the Bill, this is based on the report of the 1973 working party on the Defence Force Disciplinary Code which was tabled in Parliament on 2 April 1974. The Bill takes account of subsequent work done by the working party as a result of comments by members of parliament, the public and members of the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> It also has regard to guidelines determined at a conference chaired by the then Minister for Defence in November 1978 and attended by three Judge Advocates General of the Services, Senior Service Officers of the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The working party attempted to produce a Bill that would be Australian, modern and uniform. The Bill that I am now introducing is Australian and modern but it is not quite uniform. I will have more to say on that point later. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill deals with 3 principal matters and a number of ancillary matters. These may be briefly described as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> It prescribes offences that apply to members of the Defence Force and certain civilians who accompany the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> It creates tribunals for the trial, conviction and punishment of such offences.</PARA>
<PARA> It provides machinery for appeals against, and reviews of, convictions and punishments. </PARA>
<PARA> It deals with ancillary matters such as investigation of offences, trial procedures, and serving of sentences. </PARA>
<PARA> Against that background I will now discuss the Bill in more detail. </PARA>
<PARA> The offences have been completely revised and several new offences have been included, for example, offences involving the use of vehicles or the possession and use of narcotic drugs. Obsolete offences have been eliminated and all offences have been restated in modern language. </PARA>
<PARA> The maximum punishments have been reduced to modern levels and serious offences have been distinguished from mere breaches of discipline by the provision of much lighter maximum punishments for the latter. </PARA>
<PARA> The scale of punishments has been revised and several kinds of punishments have been abolished, such as cashiering and dismissal from ship. </PARA>
<PARA> The law of the Australian Capital Territory has been substituted for the law of England as the appropriate law for the purposes of civil offences triable by Service tribunals and for the law of evidence and the principles of criminal responsibility that are to apply. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the investigation of offences, the Bill applies, with some exceptions, the Criminal Investigation Bill. The Bill also reduces the present powers to arrest alleged offenders and retain them in custody. </PARA>
<PARA> All the differences between the Service with regard to the kinds of court martial and their procedures, including review procedures, have been abolished. Two levels of court martial are provided. A new form of tribunal is that of the Defence Force magistrate who is to have jurisdication equivalent to that of the lower level of court martial. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision is made for a Service lawyer to be appointed as judge advocate at every court martial and to make rulings on questions of law or mixed law and fact. Such rulings will be binding on the court martial. </PARA>
<PARA> Three levels of summary authorities are provided. The extensive summary powers conferred on Navy commanding officers have been substantially reduced and there has been some increase in the powers of Army and Air Force summary authorities. Greater supervision has been provided over the imposition of the more severe summary punishments. </PARA>
<PARA> Several new procedures and requirements in relation to trials and reviews have been provided. A judge advocate may conduct a preliminary hearing to dispose of certain legal issues. Service tribunals are to be required to observe sentencing criteria. Provision is made for recording a conviction but no punishment, for suspending the punishment of a fine and for setting non-parole periods. Provision is also made for automatic reviews of convictions and punishments and for ordering a retrial. </PARA>
<PARA> As a safeguard on the restriction of the right to elect trial by court martial or Defence Force Magistrate where the exigencies of service dictate, a reviewing authority is required to quash a summary punishment where, in his opinion, trial by court martial or Defence Force Magistrate should have been arranged. </PARA>
<PARA> Certain requirements or rules under existing Army and Air Force law are abolished. These are the requirement for the proceedings of a court martial to be confirmed before coming into force; the rule that conviction by an Army or Air Force court martial is not a bar to subsequent trial by civil court for the same offence; and the rule that the condoning of an offence by competent Service authority is a bar to subsequent trial for the offence. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision is made for one Judge Advocate General for the Defence Force and for the appointment of Deputy Judge Advocates General. It is the function of the Judge Advocate General, when disciplinary proceedings are reviewed by reviewing authorities, to be the final arbiter on questions of law, or mixed law and fact, that may have arisen at a trial by a Service tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> A Bill such as this necessarily has regard to the organisation, administraton and operation of the Defence Force. When there are substantial differences in this regard between the three arms of the Defence Force on a matter to which a provision of the Bill relates, the difference is liable to be reflected in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, because Naval Police do not serve at sea, it is necessary for the Bill to retain the special powers of arrest conferred on members of the regulations staff or the staff of the officer of the watch of a ship. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, because promotion from the rank of captain to the rank of major in the Army takes into account service in rank instead of seniority, it is necessary to provide a special punishment called 'forfeiture of service for the purposes of promotion' because the punishment of forfeiture of seniority cannot apply. </PARA>
<PARA> The only important area in which the Bill fails to achieve uniformity is in the powers of summary punishment conferred on commanding officers and subordinate summary authorities in relation to sailors, soldiers and airmen. The powers conferred on these authorities in relation to sailors exceed those conferred in relation to soldiers and airmen. </PARA>
<PARA> Closely related to this is the right to elect trial by court martial or by Defence Force Magistrate. The right provided in the Bill is more restricted for sailors than it is for soldiers and airmen. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for conferring more extensive powers on commanding officers in relation to sailors and restricting the right of sailors to elect trial by court martial or Defence Force Magistrate is the difficulty that would be encountered in conducting numerous such trials without adversely affecting navy operations or, alternatively, causing lengthy delays in bringing offenders to trial. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of subordinate summary authorities, the relevant factors are the organisation of the Navy; the command structure in Navy ships and establishments ; and the nature of the duties of and responsibilities of commanding officers of ships. </PARA>
<PARA> A matter in the 1973 report that engendered particular comment was the treatment of the question of obedience to superior orders as a defence to a charge of committing an offence. The report restated the traditional position under British Service law that a member of the armed forces can be convicted of disobeying a superior order only if it is lawful and cannot be convicted for the consequences of obeying a superior order unless the order was clearly unlawful. </PARA>
<PARA> Consideration was given to whether there should be a provision imposing an obligation on a serviceman to refuse to obey an order which is unlawful. </PARA>
<PARA> However, such a provision would impose on every serviceman the impossible burden of knowing whether obedience to a particular order would contravene some obscure customary law of war. Not all customary laws have been codified nor, on some questions, is the law settled. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill gives effect to the traditional position, except that it excludes the traditional defence where the accused knew or ought to have known in the circumstances that the order was unlawful. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I mention the Courts-Martial Appeals Act 1955, which provides a convicted person with a right to appeal against his conviction to the Courts Martial Appeal Tribunal. This Act is being retained with necessary consequential amendments and certain improvements that will be made by the Defence Force ( Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill that I will introduce next. </PARA>
<PARA> The Defence Force Discipline Bill is the result of a prolonged and thorough review of the existing law involving officers of the Defence Force, the Department of Defence and the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will, when it comes into force, provide a much needed modernisation and simplification of the law in this area. It moderates the severity of the existing law yet should be more effective for the reasons I have given and because it has been designed for present day circumstances of service in the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>DEFENCE FORCE (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is complementary to the Defence Force Discipline Bill 1982. It deals with three matters. In the first place, it repeals existing Defence Force disciplinary legislation and makes other amendments to various Acts consequent on the enactment of the Defence Force Discipline Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it makes amendments of a policy nature to the Courts-Martial Appeals Act 1955 designed to widen the right of access to the Courts-Martial Appeals Tribunal, to expand the range of powers available to the Tribunal, to improve certain procedures relating to the Tribunal and to provide a right of appeal to the Federal Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it provides transitional provisions for the disposal of offences committed under existing Defence Force disciplinary legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from amendments designed to achieve consistency between the Defence Force Discipline Bill and the Courts-Martial Appeals Act, significant changes to the Courts-Martial Appeals Act include:</PARA>
<PARA> A person convicted by a Defence Force Magistrate will be entitled to appeal to the Courts-Martial Appeal Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> A person acquitted on the ground of unsoundness of mind at the time of the offence will be entitled to appeal against the acquittal, provided that the defence of unsoundness of mind was not raised by him. </PARA>
<PARA> A convicted person will not be required to petition a Service reviewing authority before becoming entitled to appeal to the tribunal; instead his right to appeal will arise when the automatic review by the Service reviewing authority is completed or the period allowed for automatic review expires. </PARA>
<PARA> An appellant or a Chief of Staff may appeal to the Federal Court of Australia on a question of law from a decision of the appeal tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The appeal tribunal will be empowered to substitute a conviction of an alternative offence of which the appellant might have been convicted on the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> The appeal tribunal will be empowered to quash a conviction and order a new trial in appropriate cases. </PARA>
<PARA> A reserved decision of the appeal tribunal may be delivered by one member of the tribunal sitting alone. </PARA>
<PARA> The membership of the appeal tribunal will be restricted to the holders of judicial office. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed to the Courts-Martial Appeals Act 1955 include a retitling of the Act as the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Act 1955 and a renaming of the appeal tribunal as the Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA> This is a consequence of the provision of a right to appeal to the tribunal against convictions by Defence Force Magistrate. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendments and transitional provisions made by the Bill do not warrant detailed mention in a second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave- Honourable senators will recall that on 21 April 1982 I announced that, following a study of the approach adopted by United States of America authorities, I had concluded there was scope for helping Vietnam veterans who feel alienated from the 'system' by setting up facilities separated from departmental premises and staffed by personnel who know well the Vietnam experience. I now wish to inform the Senate of the present situation with the Vietnam Veterans' Counselling Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A centre has now been established in each State capital city and Darwin. The first was opened in Adelaide on 29 January this year and the last to open was in Brisbane on 21 July. Except in Hobart the service operates from premises which are physically separate from normal departmental premises and contact with counsellors is provided in an informal atmosphere at locations as accessible as possible to veterans and their families. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of the centres is clear evidence of the Government's genuine concern to establish communication with Vietnam veterans and their families who have difficulties. The Government's approach has been to concern itself not necessarily with the cause of whatever problems exist but rather to acknowledge that there are problems, to seek out those with difficulties and to assist them.</PARA>
<PARA> Consideration is being given to the need to provide the service in areas away from the capital cities. Initially these areas will be catered for by visits to from the capitals and by establishing service contacts in them and I have sought advice as to whether facilities of some more discreet kind should be available in areas such as Townsville and Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> Each centre can provide or is developing the following activities: Firstly, counselling services in matters such as marital relations, genetics, vocations, education, finance and careers, and parental skills. Other activities include self-help programs, pensions and legal help, community relations and crisis help . Each centre has developed extensive contacts with community and departmental facilities so that specialised professional assistance may be sought where necessary. Through the service wives and children of Vietnam veterans have access to repatriation general hospitals at no cost for emergency treatment. Vietnam veterans themselves can obtain emergency treatment at no cost at these hospitals and also at country hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> From the latest figures available to me, 448 individual clients have contacted the service, involving 3,321 client contacts. These may vary from lengthy face- to-face interviews or form part of a series of counselling sessions with a veteran over a period which may involve not only the veteran but also his dependants. The centres have proven valuable and are busy and I have therefore approved the extension of the employment contracts for the 22 staff to be extended to the end of 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to give the Senate some indication of the nature of the problems which are presenting at the counselling centres. Broadly speaking the most common problem, occurring in 26 per cent of cases, is family matters embracing both marital and parent/child relationships. Next, at 25 per cent are what might be termed behavioural problems, covering such things as violent behaviour, withdrawal, irritability or moodiness, insomnia, bad dreams and flashbacks and depression. Finally, 22 per cent of cases have reported problems of a social nature such as housing and accommodation, employment and finance. </PARA>
<PARA> The experience to date enables my advisers to draw tentative conclusions about the causes of the problems which many Vietnam veterans are experiencing and I want to outline briefly the nature of those conclusions. Many veterans have suffered psychological torment over their involvement. That torment seems to stem from anger at the fact that they did not receive proper community recognition or support for their efforts. In many cases, the veteran was translated from the service environment in which he was trained to be aggressive , violent and single-minded back into a normal civilian situation without the benefit of any deprogramming. In the civilian situation many people either wanted to ignore the fact of the war altogether or did not support the veteran who took part in it and so the veteran had little choice other than to suppress the fact of it and his feelings. It is that suppression which seems to be at the base of many present difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> Another suggested cause is called post traumatic stress disorder. This is a label used by professionals to describe the symptoms which flow from being involved in an event outside the range of usual human experience. Its symptoms may include problems such as as anxiety, rage, isolation, depression, sleep disturbance and recurrent nightmares or flashbacks which, as I have mentioned earlier, the statistics indicate as being major problems in the Service's clientele. This disorder can occur at any stage after the trauma. Many of the veterans attending the centres seem to be suffering from it and, as a consequence, are experiencing marital or family problems and relationship difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> Now they feel that there is an agency to help them and that they are not alone in their problems. They feel too that they are owed this service and they welcome the easy access and the centres' non-bureaucratic style. Some have never talked of their experiences to anybody but they see this service as their own. There is an air of confidence in the counsellors. Many veterans have been assisted through this service and every effort is being made to ensure that its existence is known to all Vietnam veterans. It has been a most worthwhile exercise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to make a few brief remarks about the statement. The Opposition welcomes the extension of the contracts of those involved in the Counselling Service and accepts the remarks of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) that the Counselling Service has been successful in dealing with the problems of some Vietnam veterans. I have, therefore, no objection to the first part of the statement. I wish to comment briefly, however, on the second part of the statement. It seems to be so typical of statements that the Minister has made in recent times. What the Minister says is that as a result of four months experience of these counselling services, he can quite confidently, apparently, state that most of the problems of Vietnam veterans are, firstly, psychological, and secondly, are due to what he calls the post traumatic stress disorder-which I believe is also partly a psychological condition. </PARA>
<PARA> In the language of the statement and in the rather glib way in which the Minister refers to the problems which he lists in these two generic groups, I suggest that he is trying, as he has done so often in the past, in letters recently to members of this Parliament and in addresses to various organisations , particularly the Vietnam veterans organisations, to gloss over the very real problems which face the Vietnam veterans. First, he glosses over the problems which are not explicable in terms of these two groups of syndromes which the Minister describes tonight. Secondly, he glosses over the problem which faces many Vietnam veterans as to what happened to them as a result of their exposure to herbicides and the contaminants of those herbicides, particularly dioxin. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot let this statement go without pointing out that there is no reference to that potential problem in it. First, there is no reference to the very real concern of Vietnam veterans in this country that they may have been affected by their exposure to herbicides, their exposure to it in concentrations far higher than were ever used in commercial use in this country, and their exposure without proper protection. Secondly, there is no reference to the very real anxiety in the minds of these people as to what has happened to them and what may happen to their children as a result of that exposure. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that four months' experience of the Counselling Service and the records of the people who have been in that Service allow the Minister to imply, as he certainly implies in this statement, that all of the veterans' problems are due to psychological torment and to the posttraumatic stress disorder. There is a grave disquiet among Vietnam veterans in Australia that they have been affected by their exposure to herbicides and maybe to pesticides in Vietnam, and that anxiety can be relieved only by a proper inquiry into, first, their exposure and, secondly, the possible results of that exposure, an inquiry that can look at the vast amount of information available about the effects of these substances since they were first produced in the late 1940s-and they were first produced as a weapon of war. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I welcome the extension of the contracts of the people involved in the Counselling Service and although I believe that with some modifications the Counselling Service will continue to provide a very useful service to Vietnam veterans, I would not like anyone in this place to believe that my welcoming of that detracts from the call that I have made on behalf of the Labor Party for a proper independent judicial inquiry into just what happened in Vietnam and what may happen to these veterans in the future. That is the only reason I rose to speak to the motion tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Messner knows, there are problems with the Counselling Service. I accept that in consultation with the Vietnam veterans' organisations, those problems will be alleviated. But in no way does the establishment of this Counselling Service detract from the very real desires of the Vietnam veterans to sort out just what happened to them and what may happen to them and their successors in the future. </PARA>

It seems to me, as it must seem to all who have been concerned about this matter, a matter of relief that indeed we may have hit on a reasonable approach to what has been in Australia a problem of great concern to a very large number of people. My concern is somewhat similar to that of Senator Grimes, but also I wish to comment on the last part of the Minister's statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that we in this country have at least, and very begrudgingly, turned our attention back to the Vietnam veterans. When one speaks to them, one still finds them extremely angry at the way in which they have been treated. Having become increasingly vocal and increasingly visible, refusing just to fade away with the war, those veterans themselves are in large measure responsible for the types of government attention that is now being paid to them. There is no doubt that with the paucity of support that has been given in the past, the very weakness of any coherent approach to the problem and the continuing unwillingness on the part of the Government to accept its responsibilities for many of the veterans' problems, particularly those which flow from agent orange, it is incumbent on those people to continue prodding the conscience of Australia so that it will respond to the types of problems that those veterans are suffering. I supose that in many ways veterans of all wars have felt that they have not been accepted for what they have done, but in what probably must be the most morally suspect war that we have ever encountered, I think the Vietnam Veterans feel this acutely within our society. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's statement refers to post traumatic stress syndrome-or, in the American terminology, delayed stress syndrome-about which an enormous amount has been written. I do not wish to enter into a discussion on that except to raise one point: It does seem to me that in many cases we put psychological labels on to something which we do not wish to face ourselves. When one contemplates that many of these veterans saw their comrades killed in a brutal war and then could not settle back into an even society and accept the glossy television commericials, one should not necessarily believe that such a person is psychologically unbalanced or is difficult to comprehend. It seems to me to be a rather natural approach of trying to find an even keel after what must have been a most traumatic type of experience. If we believe we are superior we could, in the long run, defeat the purpose for which these centres are being set up. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise one image that probably all of us have tucked away. It is raised constantly in my mind when I think about it in a very strong way. I refer to the image of men, women and children trying to clamber on to those last helicopters which flew out of Saigon and seeing women and children falling off to their death as the helicopters rose into the air. That type of image, if its horror affects us, at least assists us in some way to capture what those veterans have been through. I believe that society in general must be very careful not to take an approach of looking down, an approach of kindly assistance to a group of people who have faced and have seen so much. As far as we can, we should go with them; where we cannot, possibly we should follow. It may be that they have a wisdom to offer that we find it very difficult to grasp. In response to the last part of the Minister's statement, as these counselling services go on, I hope that we do not use them as an excuse to talk down the experiences that those veterans have had but rather we should accept that they have had access to a wisdom that we do not have and that it might be something from which we can all learn rather than something we should treat as an illness.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the 1982-83 Budget. This is the seventh Budget which has been brought down while I have been a member of parliament. It is easily the best accepted Budget yet. I wish to cover a few matters relative to it. Before I do I draw the attention of the Senate to the news reports. Generally they have treated the Budget very well. I only compare that with the rather pathetic coverage in today's Press of the non-response that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) made last night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was somewhat surprised tonight when I heard Senator Button make comments to the effect that it was a Budget designed to transfer money from the poor to the better-off. Had he had time to read the Budget he may well have found that that was an unwise thing to say. Many aspects of the Budget show the complete reverse to be the case. We have only to look at the way in which the Government dealt with matters such as housing, pensions, education and tax rates to see what an unfortunate comment that was. I entered the chamber when he was talking about deep seated divisions of views within the party. I think we could all be excused for believing that he was talking about the Australian Labor Party. From the news reports that are available at the moment one can see that in my State of Tasmania-as Senator Grimes would certainly attest-and in Victoria there are deep seated divisions within the Labor Party on a variety of issues such as a capital gains tax and uranium. I venture to suggest that if Senator Button really tried to find the sorts of matters on which he claimed there are vast and deep divisions he would stretch to find them. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point I wish to raise in the Budget context concerns housing. In the seven years that I have been a member of parliament many changes have been made to housing policy. Every one of those changes has been required to meet the changing sociological and economic conditions of the country. As the conditions have varied so has the need to change the housing policy. In that time there have been many changes in the costs of housing, housing sizes and facilities, land prices, mobility of the family unit, the size of the family unit and so on. Anybody who has followed the housing market will know that the demand for various types of accommodation has changed very consistently. In these few years it became obvious that we needed to change the policies from time to time to match up with these changes. As far as I am concerned, the changes that have been made in 1982 have been in keeping with the needs of 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> In the housing package that started two or three months ago and included the Budget an amount of $571m was allocated for housing, which is an increase of almost 25 per cent on last year. The increase of 25 per cent in funding represents the second highest rate in any division of the Budget. This increase includes interest rate subsidies, first home deposit assistance grants and higher direct housing assistance for those who are in need. I do not think Senator Button could say that that represents a means of transferring money from the poor to the better-off. The same situation applies with respect to the housing interest relief. The interest rebates will represent a saving to the average mortgagor of between $5 and $8 a week. That is very good. A 30 per cent rebate will be payable on all housing loan interest above 10 per cent on loans up to $60,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure on welfare housing will be $333m, which is an increase of 27 per cent. Of course, $147m will go to first home buyers. The package which was anounced on 18 March provided first home buyers with a rebate of $700 for the first year and with a reduction of $100 a year thereafter. Statutory reserve deposits in the banks have been reduced by one per cent so that there will be money in addition to the $400m announced on 18 March. There will be an increased supply of money for housing whether it be in the welfare area or in the ordinary home ownership area. For those at the lower end of the scale, contrary to what Senator Button would have us believe, the rental subsidy increase has been increased from $112m a year to $150m a year, a rise of 34 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, business generally will benefit from this Budget. In this country we depend very heavily on small business and for small business there is a considerable amount of good news. Not all of it is good news but a considerable amount of it is. Business in Australia depends very heavily on equity involvement and private investment is necessary. We need to encourage private investment so that we can accommodate the risk that is needed. Business has not been easy for many years, and it became necessary that we should do something to improve opportunities and to encourage people to intensify their investment in this area. Accordingly, there has now been a move to remove the double taxation of dividends, and a 30 per cent rebate on the first $1,000 invested will make a great deal of difference to many small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know how many representations I have made to the Government in the last few years about the depreciation allowance which allows the claiming of depreciation on non-residential income producing buildings. I am very pleased to see that such an allowance has now been introduced. It will make a lot of difference to many people and encourage them to develop or expand their business , as will the improvement under Division 7 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which deals with retention of profits earned. The retention allowance is now to be increased to 80 per cent. This will allow more money to be retained in the businesses, as will the groupings of profits and losses in the 100 per cent common ownership of companies. Then there is the general reduction in the basic tax rates in the area where small business is usually associated. That will help small businesses even further. That is a pretty good bundle for business generally. I hope that the people concerned will seize the opportunity, make the most of it and plan now for the time ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> I was recently travelling outside Australia. In one country I visited I found that considerable work was being done to encourage people by way of advertising along the lines 'while we are down is the time to develop. Be ready for when we are on top and you will be there first'. I would encourage many people here who are in the position to be able to, to be ready for when the world economic situation makes it possible for them to get back into business in a big, profitable and better way. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make one or two comments on the benefits in the Budget relating to Tasmania. Tasmania has four major airports Hobart, Launceston, Devonport and Wynyard, all of which have received assistance in the Budget. Air services are absolutely vital to Tasmania for the Tasmanian who moves about only occasionally , for the businessman who moves regularly, the tourist who comes into Tasmania for special occasions and, of course, for the freight business. It is necessary that Tasmania should have an airport capable of dealing with aircraft from overseas, particularly to cater for the freight aspects. It is possible for Tasmania to participate in various world markets provided it does not have to trans-ship and suffer the extra costs involved. Provided we have one airport in Tasmania that is capable of catering for aircraft from overseas of sufficent size to be used in this trade, the other three airports need be of a standard that they can adequately cope with suitable jetliners to look after the passenger trade. I think all Tasmanians should remember this and be quite thankful that their needs in this regard have been so adequately recognised in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> This year there is also a special allocation for tourist roads. The $10m which has been allocated especially for Tasmania will allow the beauty and individuality of Tasmania to be opened up further. This will allow more and more lucky people to be able to share with Tasmanians the beauty of their State. We hope that it enables many people from interstate and overseas to have a better look around Tasmania. Again, every Tasmanian will benefit from this expenditure. The greatest single benefit that has ever been provided to Tasmania from the Federal Government, of course, is the freight equalisation scheme. The freight equalisation scheme is the means by which the extra disadvantages Tasmania suffers by virtue of its dependence on expensive sea transport are reduced to some extent. A renewal of this scheme for another year will have tremendous benefit and, again, I think every Tasmanian will thank the Liberal Government for the implementation and continuation of this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a couple of other groups I would like to mention which have improved their situation as a result of good representation. The beef producers of Australia have had the $23m debit for their brucellosis and tuberculosis account written off. This will certainly remove quite a burden which has been behind them for some time now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it will affect all breeders in every State. The other group I mention is fishermen. In this Budget fishermen receive $6.1m, an increase of 56 per cent on the $3.9m they received last year. In my opinion they received that money as a result of good representation and unity of approach. I congratulate them on being able to get together sufficiently to be able to carry their case and to get greater recognition. The industry is expanding and developing. It has a mass of problems. I believe that the recognition the fishermen have had of the methods to be adopted and the recognition the Government has given the industry should now be able to make the operation work in partnership very well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the trade area export expansion grants and the export market development grants have been allocated $255m. This will provide for improvements in many areas. Trade is absolutely vital to Australia. We must compete and we must have access to the markets of the world. We must be able to do this as expeditiously as possible. We have a lot of water to cover. Access is very expensive and it is necessary for the exporters from Australia to be able to visit countries to do their promotions. This is expensive, and the extra money allocated in this Budget will allow them to spend more time establishing these markets. I deal with many exporters; they are a rather diverse group. It can be a very expensive operation for people to go overseas to try to merchandise one product. Amongst the people with whom I associate are clothing manufacturers, who may be exporting only a very limited line of two or three items; specialty cheese manufacturers; a gentleman who makes rock breakers; and people who export cut flowers and things like that. As well, there is a person who exports fruit cake.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will see about that. There may be an opportunity somewhere. All these types of industries can really expand only with a little encouragement and assistance. The encouragement and assistance the Government is giving them will certainly improve their chances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the industrial research and development area $50m has been allocated this year. I will certainly do all I can to see that it is not only fully spent but also, in fact, overspent if possible. We have a rather poor performance record by world standards in research and development. So many magnificent projects are possible in Australia that we need to look at them more carefully and treat them in a much broader way. I am always looking for more and more projects where people are trying to get industry and export going. They need assistance to obtain the sort of information they require. Most of them are first-up operators and we cannot possibly run the risk in an economy such as ours of allowing them to get into economic difficulties before they have even got off the ground. Our whole approach to industrial research and development needs to be revitalised. We need to be able to deal with prospects quickly and effectively. I believe that we need to do a lot more in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to say a little about employment, education and training. The economic and social implications of Australia in a global situation are, I think , clear to all. It pays us to look back a little and realise that anybody who is younger than I am really does not have any idea of even the tail end of the Depression, and anybody who is less than 40 years old does not even really remember what the war was all about. Since then there has been a remarkable downhill run, almost all the way. Not many young people have had an opportunity to face such difficult times and to learn the strengths that come from adversity of that sort. </PARA>
<PARA> The education system and social perceptions have accepted the situation. While the educators of the country have gone a long way towards trying to give the rising generation a new range of concepts and subjects, I believe that they may have taken things a little far in some directions. Educators and schools generally need help from outside. I believe that people whose lives have been spent in the field of education are inclined to the theory that education may best be for education's sake. There is a lot of difference between that and the perception the community has about the purpose of education. I am impressed far more by the range of studies at the higher school certificate level than I am by the application of those subjects at a practical level. I have seen teaching computer studies to students who probably have no idea of ordinary arithmetical tables or who in some cases may not even be able to count the change in their pockets. It is a bit like building a spire on a building that does not have a foundation. </PARA>
<PARA> With the dramatic numbers of unfortunate people looking for work, it surprises me every day to find that vacancies exist that apparently we cannot fill. We need to take account of the fact that education should fit people for the world and that, whether we like it or not, the world includes work. More concentration on this aspect is certainly desirable. I am just as appalled in 1982 as I was in 1979 when in answer to a question during the Estimates committee hearings I was told by a representative of the National Capital Development Commission that the Commission was buying word processors because it was unable to get typists. I am equally appalled in one respect and gratified in another that I now have a secretary to one of my Senate committees who, having been in Australia from England for two weeks, was engaged as a typist because no other typists in Canberra were capable of doing the work. I find that absolutely extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a regular routine that on Wednesdays, as a rule, I read the job vacancies in the Age. Today was no different from usual. There are five pages of job vacancies in today's Age. Not all of these are jobs that require enormous qualifications. Most of them are very ordinary jobs. I took out a few figures. There are 15 typists' jobs, 53 secretaries' jobs, 25 cooks' jobs, 29 advertisements for clothing operatives which, on previous investigations, would indicate vacancies for possibly 200 people, 16 drivers' jobs and a great collection of jobs for waiters, watchmen, painters, bricklayers, butchers, cleaners, nightwatchmen and virtually the whole gamut. It surprises me that there can be five pages of vacancies listed of which, say, three pages would be available to people of moderate skills if they wished to do the work. I believe that we need to make much more of this, not only at the political level of consideration for retraining and so on but also at the fundamental education level. In the employment scene, more and more employers seem to be turning to older people. In the case of females, married women are employed instead of junior girls because their basic credentials are so much better. I think this is most unfortunate. Some of the time that is spent on broadening people's education would be better spent on providing a better basis for their education. In later years it becomes important that the marketable skills and the realisable goals be brought together. </PARA>
<PARA> I cut an advertisement out of the newspaper a couple of years ago. It says a great deal. It states: 'Mature 16-year-old girl, higher school certificate with passes in ancient history, social psychology, English literature, credit art, wants work. Will do anything.' Frankly, I ask honourable senators: What can she do? It is very difficult for a girl like that to place herself on the market with absolutely no marketable skills and a very narrow range of talents. Higher education in particular needs to give some consideration to work skills. Lower education has to be regenerated into providing the fundamental basic necessities . If a person is no good with figures and letters, the opportunities are limited . Unless we are able to match up the desires of the educators with the necessities of the world at large and the market in general, the gap will only increase. There has to be some talking between the two groups to provide the best that is possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Anybody who looks at the Budget can see that quite deliberately it helps people at the lower end of the scale. It helps the people who need the help most. It has been well received. It is appropriate for 1982 and I certainly support it. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill to amend the income tax law covers a range of subjects. </PARA>
<PARA> It contains amendments to effect income tax exemptions for certain foreign pensions payable in consequence of persecution during the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal announced on 23 July 1982 to exempt profits from the sale or redemption of discounted securities acquired on or before 30 June 1982 is also being given statutory expression. </PARA>
<PARA> Exemption is being provided for income derived by the phosphate mining company of Christmas Island Limited. </PARA>
<PARA> Some extensions of the gift provisions, foreshadowed in recent announcements, are being made. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments foreshadowed on 9 February 1982 to deal with further tax avoidance arrangements of the 'expenditure recoupment' type are included. </PARA>
<PARA> Other provisions of the Bill will clarify the operation of anti-avoidance provisions enacted in 1978 to deal with schemes which circumvent the sufficient distribution requirements for private companies</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, a minor amendment to the secrecy provisions of the income tax law concerning the supply of information to the Australian Statistician is also being made. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the details of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Foreign Pensions Related to War-time Persecution</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> On 3 March 1982, the Treasurer announced the Government's intention to extend an existing exemption of pensions paid from the Federal Republic of Germany to Australian residents in compensation for Nazi persecution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will extend the exemption so that it applies to payments of pensions from the Federal Republic where the entitlement arises wholly or partly because periods of Nazi persecution, or flight from such persecution, have been treated as periods during which the recipient contributed to the Republic's pension scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Had such contributions actually been made there would have been relief from Australian tax under other provisions of our law. </PARA>
<PARA> As also announced on 3 March, the extended exemption will also specifically cover pensions from the Netherlands paid as compensation in respect of Second World War persecution by, or disablement from resistance to, enemy forces occupying the Netherlands or the former Dutch East Indies. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, however, a need to give the concepts underlying the extended exemption a general application. </PARA>
<PARA> For this reason, the Bill provides that the exemption will apply to other foreign pensions received by residents of Australia, which are found to relate to, or take into account, Second World War persecution or disability arising from participation in a resistance movement. </PARA>
<PARA> The exemption will apply to payments made to the person who suffered or to his or her dependants. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that payments derived on or after the date of the foreshadowing announcement-3 March 1982-will be within the scope of the extended exemption. </PARA>
<PARA>Sale or Redemption of Discounted Securities</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year, the Commissioner of Taxation publicly affirmed the view that profits arising from the sale or redemption at par of securities issued or acquired at a discount are assessable income. </PARA>
<PARA> It is accepted by the Government, however, that a significant number of small investors had purchased discounted securities in the bona fide belief that the profit on sale or redemption would not be assessable. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the tap stock prospectus of May this year, which contains no indication that the discount component of the amount receivable on redemption of the stock is assessable income, may have contributed to this belief. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, it is proposed by this Bill to amend the income tax law to exempt from tax profits made on redemption or sale of any securities acquired at a discount on or before 30 June 1982, other than profits made by traders or dealers and profits to which section 26AAA, section 26C or paragraph 26 (a) of the Income Tax Assessment Act applies. </PARA>
<PARA> The exemption will not affect the tax treatment of profits on the sale or redemption of securities purchased after 30 June 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>Phosphate Mining Company of Christmas Island Limited</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As part of new arrangements for the mining of Christmas Island phosphate, the Phosphate Mining Company of Christmas Island Limited-an Australian Government owned and controlled company-was incorporated on 25 June 1981 to replace the British phosphate commissioners as managing agents for the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that amendments incorporated in the Christmas Island Agreement Amendment Act 1981 made this replacement possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The new company has been acting as managing agents since July 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> That was an initial step pending the winding-up of the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The next step under the proposed arrangements is to obtain the Parliament's approval of a new Christmas Island Agreement between Australia and New Zealand which, together with an exchange of notes between the two governments, will enable the Phosphate Commission to be wound-up and the company to assume resonsibility for the mining operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Introduction of the necessary Christmas Island Agreement Amendment Bill is proposed for the current sittings of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Income of the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission is exempt from income tax under the Christmas Island Agreement Act 1958. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment proposed in the present Bill will provide a corresponding exemption from income tax for the Phosphate Mining Company of Christmas Island Limited. </PARA>
<PARA> The exemption will apply to income derived by the company on or after a date to be notified in the Gazette. </PARA>
<PARA> The date intended to be notified is that on which the company replaces the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission as the Island's mining operator. </PARA>
<PARA> Until then, of course, the income from the operations will remain that of the Commission and will continue to be exempt under existing provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>Gifts</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The gift provisions of the income tax law allow deductions for gifts of the value of $2 or more to specified funds, authorities or institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Details of each of the proposed extensions of this concession have been the subject of previous statements and I need mention them only briefly now. </PARA>
<PARA> One extension will authorise deductions for gifts made after 31 May 1982 to the Connellan Airways Trust. </PARA>
<PARA> Another will authorise deductions for gifts made after 30 June 1982 to the Queensland Cultural Centre Trust. </PARA>
<PARA> Further changes will authorise deductions for gifts made in the 1981-82 financial year to Polish relief appeals and to relief appeals established in response to the cyclone disaster in Tonga. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there are provisions which will authorise deductions for gifts made during the 1981-82 and 1982-83 financial years to appeals established for the provision of relief to Falkland Islanders, British servicemen or the families of islanders or servicemen affected by the Falkland Islands dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>Expenditure Recoupment Schemes</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Anti-avoidance provisions of the income tax law apply to a wide range of losses and outgoings with effect from 24 September 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> Put broadly, the legislation denies a deduction for a designated loss or outgoing that is incurred under an arrangement whereby the taxpayer or an associate obtains a benefit the value of which, taken with the sought-for tax savings, effectively recoups the claimed loss or outgoing. </PARA>
<PARA> Variants of recoupment schemes with which this Bill deals are ones that attempted to exploit the income tax rebates and deductions for calls paid on shares in afforestation companies and the rebate for moneys paid on shares in petroleum exploration companies. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed by the Bill will extend the expenditure recoupment provisions so that no rebate or deduction will be allowed in these further categories of schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments are to apply with respect to expenditure incurred after 24 September 1978 under tax avoidance schemes entered into after that date. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to do this follows the clear warning given on that day and repeated on several subsequent occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I think it is now generally recognised that the Government's unrelenting campaign against blatant forms of tax avoidance, culminating in the enactment of the general anti-avoidance provisions of Part IVA, has put paid to such activities, the obligation to the general body of taxpayers to prevent the success of any expenditure recoupment type of tax avoidance scheme entered into after 24 September 1978 must, however, be recognized and assumed.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I point out that any schemes which seek deductions for calls paid on shares in an afforestation company and which are entered into after 27 May 1981 will not be subject to the proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Such schemes would be struck down by the general anti-avoidance provisions of Part IVA which took effect on 28 May 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions I now introduce will also ensure that there can be no remaining incentive for proliferation of rebate schemes that are outside the scope of Part IVA. </PARA>
<PARA> As foreshadowed in the Treasurer's statement of 9 February 1982, any rebate scheme entered into after that date that comes to be covered by the expenditure recoupment provisions of the law will attract 200 per cent additional tax on the same basis as do schemes covered by Part IVA. </PARA>
<PARA>Dividends Satisfied by Share or Debenture Issue</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> A private company is liable to pay additional tax on its undistributed profits if it does not, by way of dividends, make a sufficient distribution of profits to its shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> Anti-avoidance measures were introduced in 1978 to counter arrangements under which a dividend, which was not capable of being taxed in the shareholders' hands, was formally paid and that ensured that a substantial benefit flowed back to the company. </PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances there was no real distribution of profits. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1978 measures may, however, operate too widely where dividends are satisfied by an issue of shares or debentures that legitimately have a market value appreciably less than their face value. </PARA>
<PARA> If such dividends are effectively taxed in the hands of the shareholders, there is no tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> A reduced market value may legitimately exist, for example, because of factors such as lack of security, lack of ready marketability or uncertainty as to the date of redemption of the debentures or redeemable shares. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned that the law should clearly not compel private companies to pay cash dividends in such cases. </PARA>
<PARA> Appropriate relief will be provided by the Bill so that, where the Commissioner of Taxation considers it unreasonable for the anti-avoidance provisions to apply to a dividend paid after 20 January 1982 and satisfied by an issue of shares or debentures, the dividend will be taken into account in determining whether or not a sufficient distribution has been made. </PARA>
<PARA>Disclosure of Additional Taxation Information to the Australian Statistician</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Under the secrecy provisions of the income tax law, information available to the Commissioner of Taxation about the name, address and industry classification of an employer can be provided to the Australian Statistician, but only for purposes related to employment statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistently with its policy of seeking to reduce, wherever practicable, the burden on businesses of responding to statistical requirements, the Government has decided to amend these provisions in two respects. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the limitation to use in employment statistics will be removed in order to enable the information supplied to be used for a number of related statistical purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Bill will authorise the provision of additional employment information to the Statistician, namely the numbers of male and female employees of persons who are employers for PAYE purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> An explanatory memorandum providing fuller details of the various measures contained in the Bill has been made available to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to touch on some matters only briefly because I intend to pursue them at a later time. I refer the Senate to some comments made earlier in the day in another place. In essence the thrust of the allegations made by Mr John Dawkins, the honourable member for Fremantle, was that I as a State President of the Liberal Party of Western Australia put pressure on the Attorney-General (Senator Durack)-this is new to me; I did not know I had-to ensure that he did not take certain action in a proper manner against a Mr Corser and a Mr Horgan. I have no knowledge of what these two people have done wrong. I have no knowledge either of what it is implied they have done incorrectly or with impropriety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Dawkins, with his normal capacity for alluding to matters without being articulate and precise and in seeking to cast aspersions which are not in any way borne out by the facts, left it at that. But the thrust of his proposition was that there had been some impropriety in the party. He made a number of comments. He said that Crichton-Browne was President of the party at that time and that I did not know what Horgan and Corser knew. He said that honourable members could not tell him that I was not applying pressure and preselection threats to Durack, to use his expression, in relation to these matters. I should want, just for a moment, to put a couple of these propositions quickly to rest. Firstly, I have never had, never would, never will and never intend to have any discussions with the Attorney-General or any other Minister of the Crown, either of Liberal persuasion or Labor persuasion, in terms of his duties as a Minister. I have no knowledge of what has taken place, will take place, or might take place regarding any activities of a Minister in respect of the discharge of his duties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, that is a judgment that the honourable senator can best make. I conclude by saying that my judgment-and I can draw from the period in which I have been State President, immediate past President Senior Vice-President and Junior Vice-President, of the Liberal Party-is that Senator Durack is a man of impeccable integrity. There is no question whatsoever that, had I even approached him on any subject, I would have been thoroughly rebutted. Least of all would I have even sought to do that. What I find absolutely disgusting, diabolical and evil about these allegations is that people such as Mr Dawkins do not have the courage, the capacity or the integrity to seek in any place other than what has been described as cowards' castle to crucify people outside the Parliament who cannot defend themselves. Prior to my entering the Parliament, on a number of occasions I said of people such as Mr Dawkins, in the same way as I said of Senator Walsh, who is sitting opposite, that if such people have something to say, have a revelation to make or are concerned about the truth of something, they ought to say so outside the Parliament. I hear a resounding silence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I repeat: If there is any suggestion to make about any matter, let them articulate it, let them detail it and let them do so outside the Parliament. Let them provide circumstances and facts about which one can draw some conclusions. Quite frankly, I find this situation very unhealthy, particularly in view of the Australian Labor Party's proposition at present that we ought to have a new code of conduct in the chambers of the Parliament. At a time when the Labor Party is claiming that we ought to have a new look at parliamentary privilege, we still find this disgraceful behaviour going on. If members of the Labor Party are serious and genuine about that, they ought to reconsider how they flaunt the law and seek to abuse privilege. I conclude by saying that I find it absolutely reprehensible that these sorts of allegations are made without fact, without substantiation and without the slightest substance. Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) It is a long standing practice of the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) to treat information concerning the nature or level of transactions with individual employers or jobseekers as confidential.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) On 18 May 1977 the Queensland Premier, in reply to correspondence on the ownership of land aspects of the Convention, informed the Prime Minister of his Government's view that the position that obtained in Queensland accorded with the spirit of the Convention, and that the Queensland Government had no objection to the Commonwealth Government proceeding to its ratification. In this connection, I invite the honourable senator's attention to the answer Mr Viner provided to part 4 of her Question No. 1558 (Senate Hansard, 27 November 1981, page 2764).</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Government has had under further examination the thrust of the provisions of the Convention. It considers that there are a number of outmoded concepts in Convention No. 107. The Convention's emphasis on 'integration' does not for example accord with the Government's policy of recognising the fundamental right of Aboriginals to retain their identity and traditional life style where desired. As indicated by my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in reply to the honourable senator's Question No. 1900, (Senate Hansard , 19 May 1982, page 2208) we understand that the ILO is looking at the possible need to redefine the objectives of the Convention, replacing the present emphasis on integration by the principle of respect for the indigenous population's identity and wishes.</PARA>
<PARA> As things stand, the Government feels that there are other international Conventions to which Australia is already a party, viz. the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and the Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which better serve the interests of Australian Aboriginals. Moreover, in the United Nations context, Australia has also been active in the field on indigenous peoples affairs. Most recently, at the 38th Session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, our delegation firmly supported a decision to set up a Working Group. This Group has been charged with drafting a set of international standards to protect the rights of indigenous peoples. We will be following closely the activities of this Working Group.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Convention has been considered not to be relevant to Tasmania. However, as already indicated in Mr Viner's reply to Question No. 982 by the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives (Hansard, 29 October 1981, page 2807), since the Government of Tasmania stated its intention to introduce certain legislative changes which may be relevant, the Department will be examining these if and when they are passed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The article referred to has been drawn to my attention.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) It is my understanding that the events reported in the article are basically accurate.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) No, the Australian Government has not expressed an attitude to the Malaysian Government about the use of capital punishment. A state of emergency has existed in Malaysia since May 1969. The Malaysian Government has cited the persistent threat of communist insurgency and internal security as justification for the continued existence of relatively stringent internal security legislation such as the Essential (Security cases) Regulations. In all other non -security-related cases, accused persons are afforded the traditional legal safeguards including public trial. While Australia remains concerned about curtailment of civil liberties wherever they occur, the Government appreciates the circumstances which formed the background to the security legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's broad concern in this context is that proper judicial proceedings in accordance with the duly constituted laws of Malaysia should be completed before any executions are carried out. I am advised that the Internal Security Act (and the amendments referred to in the article above) are properly constituted laws of Malaysia, having met the appropriate constitutional and parliamentary provisions and procedures of that State. Furthermore, I understand that under the Federal Constitution of Malaysia, certain legal protections are guaranteed, even in the case of public emergency, summary executions are not carried out and convictions carrying the death penalty are automatically subject to appeal to the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA> In the broader international context of the United Nations, Australia has made its position on the need for respect for due process in the treatment of offenders well known. At the 38th Session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights for example, Australia actively supported a resolution condemning the practice of summary and arbitrary execution and appointing a Special Rapporteur of the Commission to investigate this phenomenon.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 May 1982 (Hansard, page 2375) Senator Siddons asked me, as the Minister representing the Treasurer, without notice, the following question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Has the Treasurer's attention been drawn to the concern expressed by senior members of the Australian computer industry about the possible retrospective application of a sales tax to packaged computer software? Can the Minister explain why the computer software industry has been told repeatedly over the past 14 years that its products were service and not goods and were therefore not eligible for research and development grants, grants in aid or tax incentives? Can the Minister further explain why in the last 12 months several- but only a tiny minority-of the firms have been told the opposite? Why has computer software suddenly become a good and thus liable for sales tax? Will the Treasurer examine the possibility of exempting computer software from sales tax as an incentive to a rapidly developing industry which uses Australian technological skills, which is labour intensive and for which Australia is rapidly acquiring a high international reputation?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has supplied the following answers to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation has advised me that certain types of packaged computer software are goods in their own right and have always been subject to sales tax. There is no retrospectivity involved. Other types of software are not goods and are not, therefore, subject to sales tax. In the absence of details the Commissioner is unable to offer any comment on the cases to which the honourable senator has referred and which are said to be ones where, in the last 12 months, firms have been advised that sales tax is payable on computer packaged software.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator's request for all computer software to be made exempt from sales tax has been noted but I cannot give any assurance that the Government would find it appropriate to meet the request.</PARA>
