<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister representing the Minister for Defence seen reports that damage suffered by HMS Sheffield following the Argentinian missile attack was exacerbated by the aluminium superstructure of Sheffield? Is the Minister aware that Australia's FFGs have an aluminium superstructure? Has the Royal Australian Navy considered the relatively vulnerable nature of such a material? If so, what steps have been taken to reinforce the superstructure with special damage control measures to minimise the effect of the vulnerability of the FFGs? If none has been taken, will the Minister review the follow-on destroyer program to ensure that light steel replaces aluminium in subsequent construction?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question concerns immigration. Whilst Senator Durack will probably take it on board I think Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle will remember the incident to which it relates. I refer to a statement made by Mr Menadue that in the light of the expanded family reunion program and all its complexities the Public Service Board had been asked to add considerably to the work force of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in Melbourne and Sydney. Following the failure to do so by yesterday, can the Minister tell me whether the Public Service Board has at last responded to meet the tremendous demands that will be made on departmental staff in order to maintain adequate processing?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to talks recently held between the land councils in the Northern Territory, the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Authority, the Northern Territory Government and the Commonwealth Government on the question of protecting sacred sites in the Northern Territory. I refer particularly to claims concerning sacred sites over the new development area of the Sadadeen Valley in Alice Springs.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Talks were recently held in the Northern Territory between the Northern Territory Government, the Commonwealth Government, the Central Land Council, the Northern Land Council-which was included because of the principles involved-and the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Authority. That meeting was not designed to discuss the particular issue of the proposed subdivision of the Sadadeen Valley but it looked at a whole range of issues relating to the protection and identification of sacred sites and the means by which any disagreements could be resolved. I advise the Senate that at that meeting considerable agreement was reached between all parties-the Northern Territory Government, the Aboriginal groups and the Sacred Sites Authority-as to an appropriate way by which difficulties of this kind could be avoided and overcome . As a result, it is now up to the principals involved to see whether they can hammer the agreement into an appropriate form in case any legislation is needed or governments have to take decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the Sadadeen Valley subdivision, I understand that similarly constructive talks are going on between the parties involved but no action is imminent in the valley which would disadvantage the Aboriginal communities. The Northern Territory is quite sensitive to the concerns which the local people have about the sites which have been identified and which the Authority in the Northern Territory has at least registered.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Social Security to place himself, if he will, in the position of an unemployed 17-year-old male living away from home and not being assisted by his parents financially in any way. He may even have no parents. Out of the $36 per week unemployment benefit he would receive, could the Minister tell me how much per week he would spend on food, rent, clothing, and heating? How much would he be able to spare on fares in order to find a job?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chipp posed the question in a way which is difficult for any politician to answer. We are paid handsome salaries. The same question about how we would live on the old age pension or anything else would be similarly difficult to answer. The question he raised is serious. It concerned the situation of a 17-year-old receiving a rate of unemployment benefit which is fixed for those under the age of 18 years and who are not living at home. That rate of benefit is $36. It has been fixed for some time and not altered. I understand the point which the honourable senator made in his question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am happy to say that the group to whom the honourable senator referred is very much a minority of that age group. The most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics figures indicate that the great bulk of people under the age of 18 live at home and have parental support and assistance. That is one of the factors, of course, which influenced the Government in decisions which it has made in determining the level of that benefit. The level of the benefit was last considered last year. There was a general examination of the position of 16 and 17-year-olds by the Government initially by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Social Security and their respective departments. The matters which arise to be considered are the questions of the comparative position of a young man or woman who chooses to seek employment as against a young man or woman who chooses to stay in education . Quite difficult questions of balance have to be established.</PARA>

I very rarely interrupt Ministers answering questions, but one of the few tests which a Minister must meet in answering a question, with great respect, is relevance. The Minister is giving a first class rationalisation of Government policy but he is not answering the simple, specific question I asked: How much would he spend on rent, food and fares out of $36 a week?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was endeavouring to give a reasonable answer to the honourable senator. Of course, his precise question does not admit of a specific answer in the form in which he has requested. What arrangements a 17-year-old might make with respect to living, whether in a group situation or otherwise, are infinitely variable. I am not capable of giving an answer on precisely how I would budget that amount if I were in that position at that age. I was trying to explain to the Senate the factors which have been taken into account with respect to the setting of levels of benefit. If that is not what the honourable senator requires, I can only say that it is not possible for me to present a budget which would apply to any social security beneficiary, bearing in mind the infinitely variable situations in which such people find themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TITLE>QUARANTINE: IMPORTED RICE</TITLE>
<QUESTION PAGE="1904" SPEAKER="Teague Sen B.C." NAMEID="PJ4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="SA" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Health and concerns quarantine arrangements. I refer to the Australian rice industry and to the necessity to maintain continuing vigilance of Australia's quarantine barriers. Has it been brought to the Minister's attention that in the past week Mr Davidge , the Chairman of the Rice Growers Co-Operative Mills Ltd, said that he was deeply concerned that tests carried out in Sydney had revealed that samples of imported rice had contained wheat seed, dead insects and unmilled rice grains? He said the samples of foreign rice had up to six grains of unmilled rice a kilogram and that this unmilled grain could carry diseases such as blast and viruses which could destroy the $150m New South Wales rice industry. Can the Minister assure the Senate that there has been no lowering of quarantine barriers with regard to rice and that these recent allegations have been fully investigated?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1904" SPEAKER="Baume Sen The Hon P.E." NAMEID="ME4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS; HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although Mr Davidge's comments have not been drawn to my attention, a week or two ago I did meet with representatives of the industry, who expressed concerns about these matters. I take it that they are the same concerns. The importation into Australia of unmilled rice is not permitted because of the potential it has to introduce diseases as set out in Senator Teague's question. Milled rice is allowed in. Certain standards are applied to ensure that it is safe. These include the fact that there should be no unmilled paddy grains. Standards are set. Five grains a kilogram is the upper limit of what is permitted for paddy grains in imported milled rice. Some rice has been imported recently about which concern has been expressed, but my officers have investigated this. They assure me that there has been no relaxation of standards , that the rice which was imported was tested under normal conditions, that it passed the test and that no sample contained more than the permitted number of paddy grains.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand some tests may have been carried out subsequently by the rice growers. There could have been a sampling problem. They said one of their samples showed six paddy grains a kilogram. We are going back and investigating the matter again. I think another matter of even greater concern was associated with this imported rice; that is, that some of it was taken by wholesalers into retail outlets inside the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Teague" NAMEID="PJ4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is serious. Taking imported rice into a rice growing area is prohibited. That, however, is a matter for the State administration of New South Wales. The Commonwealth is responsible for the quarantine arrangements at the port of entry. The rice in question met all quarantine requirements and passed all requirements. That it then got into the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area is a matter which I understand the authorities in New South Wales have addressed themselves to. They have impounded the rice. The regulations have been tightened up and the retailers and wholesalers are now aware of the situation. I add that although I can say again that all quarantine requirements have been complied with, the local industry now says that it can achieve a much higher degree of milling so that there is almost no paddy rice present in milled rice. We are investigating now whether our quarantine standards should be re-examined and maybe redrawn.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. It refers to a statement by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence that the media misunderstood explanations on rearrangements for defence spending and the Prime Minister's attempt to explain the same to the Returned Services League national executive at a luncheon on 4 May. In view of the fact that the RSL National President, Sir William Keys, said after his meeting with the Prime Minister that the RSL was not reassured, when will the Government explain its defence spending plans in such a way that the RSL, the Australian media and the people of Australian can comprehend them?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it was very useful for the Prime Minister to have discussions with the executive of the RSL. Naturally, it would have a particularly close interest in details of the matter. I was not present at the luncheon so I do not know of the matters about which Sir William Keys said he wanted further reassurance. However, I will refer that part of the question to the Minister for Defence to see whether he wishes to add anything to the answer. The fact of the matter is, as the Prime Minister pointed out and as I pointed out in answer to a question asked yesterday by Senator Lewis, that in this financial year there will be a 19 per cent increase in overall expenditure on defence compared with the figure for the previous financial year. That is the fact of the matter. I do not think anything more can be said to highlight the commitment of this Government to defence.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Attorney-General. I refer to the Government's recently announced intention to create a national crimes commission and I refer more particularly to the following comments by the Prime Minister:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that if the Commonwealth were to wait until it had the total agreement of all States, through either the Premiers Conference or the Attorneys -General conference, the youngest members here might be grey with age before that would be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not really believe that as a nation we have time for that . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Is the Minister aware that very effective co-operative working arrangements have been developed between the States and the Commonwealth in the last two years through the Australian Police Ministers Council? Is he further aware that the Council has established the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and is close to finalising agreement on a national police research unit? Inasmuch as no discussion or consultation took place with the States before the Prime Minister made his statement, is it his intention to set up a national crimes commission in consultation and co-operation with the State governments, which have considerable constitutional power in this area? Does he concede that the effectiveness of such a commission would be considerably diluted without proper Commonwealth-State consul- tation and co-operation?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1905" SPEAKER="Durack Sen The Hon P.D." NAMEID="8G4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="ATTORNEY GENERAL" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation is that the Prime Minister has had some discussions with me and, I think, other interested Ministers in regard to a proposal for the establishment of a national crimes commission. The matter is being studied and a detailed report on the proposal will be made to the Cabinet in the near future. In the matter of a crimes commission as a matter of principle, the Commonwealth would be perfectly free to establish and could usefully establish a commission on its own account because there is an enormous responsibility for the administration of criminal law at the Commonwealth level. We only have to consider the nature of the Customs laws to realise that the drug area of crime is an enormous one for which the Commonwealth has, under its laws, a major responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, that having been said, the fact of the matter is that, ideally, law enforcement and the administration of criminal justice are matters which deeply involve the States. They have traditionally had responsibility for criminal justice and police investigation. The matter will certainly be discussed with the States when there is a sufficiently detailed proposal to discuss with them. No discussion has taken place with the States at this stage because the matter is only an idea in principle. The Cabinet has yet to finally consider and decide the form that the matter will take. It is far too premature to discuss the question with the States.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The review referred to by Senator Grimes is again an internal departmental review. It has been used by the Department of Social Security in the course of examining the operations of the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act , a process which I think commenced under my predecessor, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. That paper has not gone to NACH or to any body outside the departmental process. The review is still under way. In fact I was to see officers this week to discuss the review further. One result has flowed from it so far, that is, the change to payment in advance of subsidies under that Act. That change was of benefit to organisations receiving subsidies and was not a matter which required wide consultation. I had received many representations suggesting that that would be helpful to the organisations concerned. However, should there be substantive changes in our approach to the handicapped persons assistance program I certainly would envisage exploring those proposals with NACH and indeed with the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of the Disabled before coming to any final decision on them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The use of methane from various sources is under consideration in this country and in many other countries. For example, I am advised that outstanding evidence of its use is that in China up to 90 million people in various communities use methane gas from human, farm and community wastes. That process would be capable of adaptation not only in developing countries but also in developed countries. In Australia coal seams are tapped for what is called firedamp-methane gas. The Australian Gas Light Co. is looking towards augmenting its Sydney supplies from the coal mines close by. In Germany methane is produced from garbage dumps and sewage waste decomposition. In West Germany there is a major undertaking in Schleswig-Holstein. The United Kingdom's Greater London Council and the National Coal Board are investigating tapping a 70-acre land fill site in Essex.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Australia we produce methane from sewerage plants in Adelaide, Carrum near Melbourne, and at Malabar and Bondi in Sydney. The production meets the sewerage plants' own power requirements. There is only a limited surplus for gas purposes . Considerable methane could also be produced as a fuel supplement from food waste produced by Australia's canning industry and from intensive cattle and piggery operations. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is doing some research in each of these areas. A project on methane digesters has been funded under the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council program. The use of biomass in any form, the use of renewable sources of energy, has enormous significance for the long term future because we should not be complacent about the present apparent surplus of oil. The methane from renewables could be a very valuable addition for the decades ahead.</PARA>

With many of those gifts the giving is what is important, and they may be of relatively minor value. I am not suggesting that $250 is token value.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that one of the matters which the Trade Practices Commission is investigating is the question of brokerage based on turnover in respect of stock exchanges. The Australian Associated Stock Exchanges is seeking from the Commission authorisation for a provision allowing stock brokers to undertake this activity. If the fixing of brokerage rates is not authorised by the Trade Practices Commission on appeal to the Trade Practices Tribunal, brokerage rates will become a matter for negotiation between stock brokers and clients. The viability of any stock exchange depends not only upon this factor, of course, but also on a number of other factors. Recognising that the Trade Practices Commission's decision may affect the structure of the whole industry, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, pursuant to section 29 of the Trade Practices Act, directed the Trade Practices Commission, when deciding the Australian Associated Stock Exchanges' application, to give special consideration to, amongst other things, the desirability of the continued existence of stock exchanges in cities other than Sydney and Melbourne-of course , including Adelaide.

It is as a result of those kinds of discussions that the telephonists have decided that it is proper to take their case to the public, to make their side of the case known. There is no concern on the Government's part that they should do this, but I emphasise again that the resolution of these issues is one step along the way to providing a better telephone service.

Has the Australian Government given any consideration to the possibility that, if the Falkland Islands crisis continues, it offers to send to the area a hospital ship under the Australian flag so that there would be in the area a strictly neutral vessel able to give aid to the wounded from either side?</PARA></TALK.START>

Did the Treasurer recently correspond with the Chairman of the Australian Bankers Association to inform him that the Government intends to replace the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme with a comprehensive loans scheme? Was the interest rate for the student loans scheme initially set at 13.5 per cent? If so, has there been any adjustment in the light of recent increases in interest rates?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand the question, the first part relates to an education matter about whether a piece of correspondence indicated that there was an intention to replace TEAS with a loans scheme. I say quite emphatically that the Government's policy is that there should be a loans scheme which is supplementary to TEAS and not a replacement of TEAS. Therefore, any such correspondence would not have taken place. I think the other half of the question was a matter for the Treasurer.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I thank the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) for enabling me to speak to the 1980-81 annual report of the National Energy Advisory Committee. I have only a few words to say. It was impossible to speak to the report last week because it was not available to honourable senators at that time. The report is one of a number which come to the Government, and specifically to Senator Sir John Carrick as Minister for National Development and Energy, from this Committee, which is one of a plethora of committees which advise the Government on energy matters. But it is regrettable that, even with the great range and number of committees and expertise available to the Government, as can be readily seen by perusing the membership of the Committee outlined in the report, the Government is unable to produce a comprehensive policy, as has been produced and will be published by the Australian Labor Party in the very near future. Even with our very meagre resources the Caucus of the Australian Labor Party has put together a most comprehensive paper on energy and resources development issues facing Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>National Energy Advisory Committee</PARA>
<PARA> It is not my remark only which leads to the conclusion that the Federal Government has failed Australia in not producing a comprehensive paper covering all aspects of resources development in Australia; it is also the opinion of the Bank of America which, in its Economic Report of the Asia Division, dated 8 July 1981, concerning the effectiveness of Australia's energy policy, states that it has had three positive impacts-I acknowledge this: Firstly, import parity pricing of oil and its subduing of the demand for petroleum products; secondly, the introduction of natural gas into Sydney; and, thirdly, the upsurge in investment, which was then tabulated by the Government, in alternatives to transport fuels in particular. Whilst it had those three benefits, certain weaknesses were identified. The conclusion was that all in all, therefore, the Government's energy policy is fragmented and not without inconsistencies. This suggests that there is a pressing need for the formulation of a national energy plan covering both near term as well as long term problems and aspects. I simply say that that is the opinion of the Bank of America's Asia Division. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to see that the Committee has produced some four or five major reports in the period up to mid 1981. In the time available to me I think I will comment on some aspects of two or three of them. One report is on alternative liquid fuels. It identifies, as is well known in this chamber, that whereas Australia, generally speaking, is energy resource rich, in the area of transport fuels, we certainly need to make investment decisions that will allow us, when the Bass Strait oil fields become depleted, to rely on our own indigenous sources for transport fuels rather than being dependent on the vagaries of overseas suppliers. To that extent, I must say that the report of the Committee, entitled 'Alternative Liquid fuels', although I have not read it in detail, is to be welcomed. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government should, as a fundamental responsibility, ensure an investment climate conducive to the commercial development of alternative liquid fuels by the private sector . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Generally speaking I support that policy. But the Government should not artificially create a market situation, should not overly subsidise an earlier introduction of alternative transport fuels into the Australian mix than would be occasioned by the operation of market forces. We have already seen how the great predictions relating to shale oil, for example, have been severely retarded by the changes in market conditions. It is my view that the Government and its committees ought to be looking more closely at the possibility of methanol coming into the Australian transport fuel mix as an extender of our transport fuel resources or, indeed, as a substitute entirely in some vehicles. The Volkswagen organisation, which gave evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources about this matter, indicated that a lot of the fears which have been held as to the use of methanol were unfounded. I am talking of such things as the water content inducing phase separation. If seems to me-I have no doubt that the National Energy Advisory Committee could verify this-that fears as to phase separation have proved not to be as great as was originally thought. It may well be that rather than an alcohol extender of fuels being produced from vegetable products-in other words via ethanol-we should use our great resources of natural gas to produce methanol as a transport fuel for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to another report entitled 'Motor Spirit: Vehicle Emissions, Octane Ratings, and Lead Additives-Further Examination'. It seems to me-without, once again, having had an opportunity to read its report-that NEAC has reversed an earlier opinion it held and has now become more sensitive to the health and environmental aspects of the problem of lead emissions. As honourable senators know, lead compounds are added to petrol to increase the octane rating thus enabling engines to operate with higher compression ratios which is turn are said to give better fuel economy. This also provides upper cylinder lubrication. The report of the Senate Standing Committee recommended that by varying the excise rate applying to standard and 92 octane petrol to establish a 2c or 3c incentive to use standard fuel-in other words, a lower octane rating fuel-we would be going some way to reducing the problem of the emission of lead salts in both gaseous and particulate forms. We recommended that a research project be established to determine the relationship between lead additives, fuel economy and exhaust emissions under normal usage, and said that it ought to be a matter of urgency. But reading between the lines of the annual report it appears that an unleaded strategy is the conclusion. In the report it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> An unleaded strategy would therefore be appropriate if emission standards were set to meet the National Health and Medical Research Council's recommended long term guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA>That seems to be an admission that, when determining how most efficiently to use our meagre transport fuels, perhaps health and environmental considerations have to be given some priority. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the report entitled 'Nuclear Power in Australia: Regulation and Control' concluded that legislation, regulation and inspection functions should be identified and responsibilities for these assigned before nuclear electricity generation proceeds in Australia. Whilst in no way wanting to indicate anything other than Australian Labor Party policy in this regard, it has been clearly stated by Labor Party spokesmen in this chamber over the last four years since I became a member of this chamber that it is imperative that the Government clearly separate for legislative attention the various aspects of the nuclear industry that might be undertaken in Australia. At the moment the legal framework within which the uranium industry in Australia operates is based on a 1950s piece of legislation which was designed when uranium was mined in Australia to fuel the nuclear weapons programs of our allies. Therefore, particularly in relation to civil liberties, for example, it has a quite different and contrary thrust to that which one would expect were uranium being mined, as it is claimed, for peaceful purposes for the production of electricity . Given that the goal is that Australia's uranium energy resources should be used in future for the generation of electrical energy for peaceful purposes, it is imperative that the Government-the Minister ought to be able to tell us when legislation will come into this place-provide that legal framework that is so necessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tate has referred to the report of the National Energy Advisory Committee and has made a number of comments about it. It would not be possible for Senator Tate to evaluate that report properly and indeed the whole work of the Government without his having studied each of the reports that NEAC has produced over the years and the work of the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council and other bodies. I commend them to Senator Tate and honourable senators. Senator Tate referred also to some comments made by the Bank of America. He ought to look at the repeated comments of the International Energy Agency, which has more expertise in this matter, and which encompasses, for comparable values, the work of the other 20 member nations, being the key developed countries of the free world. He will find that the International Energy Agency has very substantially praised Australia for its overall policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been suggested by Senator Tate that Australia does not have a comprehensive policy. I refute that entirely. I will put forward four tests of the long term balance of any energy policy. Firstly: That what we do is conserving the energy resources we have, particularly the petroleum ones; secondly, that there is created a stimulus to substitution to get off petroleum, particularly oil, and on to other sources; thirdly, that there should be exploration; and, fourthly, that there should be a use of synthetics, including renewables. On every single test of those principles our policies are working, and working very well indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The International Energy Agency has said that the primary test for any energy policy of any country must be that it should charge its petroleum products at world scarcity prices-that is, import parity pricing. Australia has done this. Australia has been able to provide petroleum products at a price less than half that which is operating in most European countries and in Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate raised the matter concerning the conservation of fuel. Clearly there has been conservation. Anyone who tries to test these things should know, for example, that the arrangements with the automotive industry are working well . We have an arrangement whereby more fuel efficient vehicles will be produced; there will be a fuel savings of some 12 per cent by 1987. In 1979 an average vehicle consumed 11.2 litres of fuel every 100 kilometres. Its consumption will be reduced to 9 litres by 1983 and 8 litres by 1987. It is now 1982 and the average is below 10 litres and, therefore, well on the way to nine. We see a major movement in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators would also be aware of this Government's liquefied petroleum gas policy and the conversion of vehicles and the huge potential conversion, particularly of commercial vehicles, if the necessity arises to LPG. Liquefied petroleum gas is provided at a rate very competitive with petrol. In Canberra, 90 per cent of taxis are using LPG; in Melbourne 80 per cent; in Sydney something like 70 per cent; and in Brisbane a growing percentage. It is possible, when there is not the complacency of the present temporary glut, for LPG to absorb some 14 per cent of the transport fuels. I say this against the fact that Senator Tate said that there was no real plan for the long term assurance of transport fuels. My Department has indicated in a variety of publications that, whereas in 1978-79 it was believed that there would be a considerable falling off over this decade and through to the end of the century in the supply of indigenous oil, now there is some quiet confidence that there could even be a levelling out during this decade. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will know that again there is some cautious optimism in oil exploration. In substitution, the development of gas pipelines throughout Australia has gone on apace. The linking of Young, Cootamundra and Wagga Wagga and subsequently, we hope, Albury; the extension of the Dalton pipeline to Canberra; the potential extension to Lithgow, Bathurst and Orange; the virtual completion of the Sydney-Newcastle pipeline; and the foreshadowing of the pipeline from the North West Shelf to Perth are all major substitutions. The drop in the consumption of fuel oil in Australia has been spectacular. Substitution has gone on apace in Australia. Exploration is at all time record levels. Whilst one can never be optimistic on a continent the size of Australia, the fact of the matter is that one in four wildcat wells being drilled at this moment are producing evidence of oil. There have been very significant discoveries of gas. Exploration has been at a very great level. </PARA>
<PARA> The International Energy Agency is recorded as saying that the incentives that Australia offers to exploration companies could scarcely be improved upon. Those were the words used by the IEA. Of course, policies can be improved but one should look at these matters in a broad way. Step by step it is true that it would be desirable for more progress to be made throughout the world in connection with synthetic crudes produced from coal, shale or biomass. The simple fact is that it is very difficult to persuade any commercial venture to take a project through to its commercial point at a time when the real price of natural oil in the world is falling. Nevertheless, by arrangement with the Americans, the Japanese and others, we in Australia are having the technology of synthetic crudes taken to a point at which the lead time for bringing on a commercial undertaking could be halved in the likelihood of the need to do so. For example, a shale plant that might take eight years to develop would involve a pilot plant and general feasibility studies for four years and another four years of actual construction before it came on stream. One hopes to halve this lead time with shale and coal. </PARA>
<PARA> A very considerable amount of development is going on into alternative fuels- the renewable fuels, such as ethanol and others. Senator Tate mentioned methanol . It is quite feasible to take natural gas-provided that one is assured that one has enough of it-and turn it into methanol. It is quite possible for automotive vehicles to run on methanol. Senator Tate raised one problem, that of methanol's water compatibility. That is one matter that is being looked at. Another problem is that methanol does not like plastic parts; in a vehicle there would be a need for substitution in that regard. There are no great difficulties. Senator Tate would be aware, I think, of the Maui gas process in New Zealand where Australia is looking over the shoulder of the New Zealand Government and the Mobil people in the development of a plant to take natural gas, convert it to methanol and then to gasolene. Indeed, a very great deal is being done at this moment. The subject is, of course, far too big for comment in a simple paper. I make these comments just to show that a great deal is being done. Finally, on the nuclear situation, I draw attention to my reply to a question yesterday. We are well advanced on work to bring in a new atomic energy Act to bring about the regulation of nuclear fuels. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to say just a few words on the report. For too long the fisheries subject has been treated in a very offhand way. Responsibility for fishing is divided up between the Federal and State governments-each has legislation to cover its various areas. It has been unfortunate in the past that much of the legislation has not interlocked. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian fishing industry is not a very big industry. It is a worthwhile industry if safeguarded. If any area is over-fished the industry simply will be lost. Because of the nature of the country the Australian fishing industry could never be a major industry, as it is in overseas countries. We have not managed our fishing very well in the past, nor have we treated the fishermen with any respect. They should be on the same footing as people in other industries. Agricultural industry has been given a lot of help in the past but the fishing industry has received very little help. It receives very little help in getting finance to build the boats that are needed. We are now allowing foreigners to come in to fish in deep waters, in the blue water. I believe the fishing industry should be better supported by government than it is. Fishermen are paying a very high interest rate-something like 20 per cent-to build ships that will cost from $1m to $1.5m. We will not be able to encourage the fishermen to build the ships if they are not protected. </PARA>
<PARA> We allow foreigners to fish in our waters, especially for tuna and squid. There is not enough scrutiny to see that the foreign fishing vessels take only the large fish. They are taking the juvenile fish before those fish are allowed to reproduce. This will eventually destroy the whole of the fishing industry. I believe that it is in Australia's interest to encourage Australian fishermen. A 200-mile limit is now in effect off the Australian coast. The Australian fishermen should be the eyes of the Australian Government. If we encouraged more of our own people to fish in the deep waters off the continental shelf we would probably restrict the smuggling of drugs and other materials into this country. We are quite capable of building and maintaining a reasonable fishing fleet; in fact, we could probably build more than we would ever need. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is important for the State and Federal governments to get together concerning many areas off the Australian coast. Because of differences in legislation areas have been fished out. In my own State of South Australia, because Federal legislation has allowed Commonwealth registered boats to fish for juvenile prawns, the number of prawns in St Vincent's Gulf is being depleted at a very fast rate. I think this is unforgivable. I think there has to be uniform legislation which contains some sense. Fish do not care whether waters are federally controlled or State controlled; it is the fishing industry that I am concerned about. It is the fishermen that we should protect. We need industries such as this. They operate in outports where work is not plentiful and they can generate a lot of work in those areas. I believe that if the industry operated on a more scientific basis, if long term help were provided for our fishermen, great benefits could be derived for this country. I will not close the debate as I know that some of my colleagues want to say something about this industry. I ask the Government to consider seriously in consultation with State governments, the enactment of sensible legislation that will protect this industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish also to speak to the resolutions of the eleventh meeting of the Australian Fisheries Council held in Adelaide, South Australia. I support my colleague Senator Elstob in what he has said about the problems that exist in the fishing industry, particularly in our own State of South Australia, which has a very big industry. It is a great dollar-making industry because of the exports, particularly of lobster, from that State. Our colleague Mr Wallis has in his electorate of Grey a very good fishing industry which operates from Ceduna to Port Lincoln, where there is a huge fishing fleet. The Australian Labor Party resources committee held a meeting in Port Lincoln some years ago and, learning of the problems associated with the fishing industry, had a discussion here and recommended to the Senate that an inquiry be held into the fishing industry. I am hopeful that when that inquiry is completed and the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce is tabled in this Parliament there will be a better understanding of the problems of the fishing industry and that the government of the day will take heed of the Committee's recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know how far along the track the Committee is with its inquiry. Sentor Elstob and I had the pleasure of being invited to the public hearings which were conducted last year in Port Lincoln and Adelaide. We participated in the inquiry , as honourable senators are allowed to do even though they are not elected members of the committee concerned. We took the opportunity of saying a few words at the inquiry. As I said, I am hopeful that when the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce tables its report in the Senate it will contain some very worthwhile recommendations to the Government. If the Government acts upon them we might be able to solve many of the problems that exist in the industry at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the States that were represented at the meeting on 25 September, I note that there have been some changes of Ministers since it took place. Mr Rodda, who was the South Australian Minister of Fisheries at that time, is no longer the Minister, having resigned his portfolio. I am not sure who is the South Australian Minister at present. Of course, because of the recent massive win by the Australian Labor Party in the Victorian election, Mr Houghton is no longer the Minister for Fisheries in that State. A Labor member now represents that State at these Council meetings. I am sure that the Victorian member will make a very worthwhile contribution in an endeavour to solve the problems which have existed in the fishing industry for quite a long time. As my colleague Senator Elstob pointed out, there needs to be some assistance in the building of fishing boats, which is very costly. If we are to compete with overseas people, particularly the Japanese and Taiwanese who came into our waters, sometimes with permits but most times without-particularly the Taiwanese-and take out only the best of the fish--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of that, but now that the honourable senator has reminded me, I will have to look at the strictures that are imposed upon people who get permits to fish in our waters to see whether they are issued at the expense of our own local fishermen and whether they are suffering because permits are being offered to overseas companies. We know that the Australian taxpayer in the past has been put to very great expense because the naval ships have to apprehend the Taiwanese boats. I have asked many questions, both at Estimates committee hearings and in the Parliament, about whether we are fully compensated for the cost of the naval vessels having to apprehend these people and take them to court where they are fined. I have expressed the view in the past that the fines imposed are not heavy enough to deter people who do not have permits from raping our fishing grounds. This is to the detriment of the Australian fishermen. As a true Australian I have said at all times, and I say again, that we should be protecting our own people and our own industries. If there is anything left, let other countries have a slight serve of it; but until our own people are properly protected we should not allow these people to come into our fishing waters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, I look forward to the report from the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce. I hope that some time before the end of this year Senator Archer, the Chairman of the Committee, will table the report and that people, particularly from South Australia such as Senator Elstob and I, who have always had a great interest in the industry, will have the opportunity to make some comments upon it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on the same subject for a moment or two to highlight my concern with respect to the netting practices that are carried out in the northern Spencer Gulf area which, after all, is a spawning area for fish. A lot of local concern has been expressed over a long period that people come to this area with nets and take by that method all the fish that are available. It seems to me that it is important that governments take a serious interest in this matter. I realise that it is a matter that comes under State jurisdiction. Nevertheless, I think I ought to remind the Senate that these spawning areas are of vital significance to the areas that were referred to by my colleagues on the Opposition side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently the State Government introduced measures that require limitation of netting in certain parts of the gulf. I do not think they go far enough. I believe that the idea is to have a trial period of 12 months to see whether it is a successful operation. I noticed the other day that the State Government is advertising for a helicopter to survey the area. I think that is a good thing. The area could be surveyed at night. The authorities would use the 'midnight sun ' spotlight device that has been perfected. This may discourage indiscriminate and illegal netting. Of course, fishermen generally net during the night or in the wee small hours of the morning when there are not many people about. I think it is important that those concerned about this matter act as surveillance people as it is in their own interests to preserve the fishery. If anyone is seen transgressing and netting in areas where netting is forbidden he ought to be reported. I look forward with great interest to seeing how this trial period goes. But I think, although it is a State matter, we quite properly should take an interest in it because it has far reaching effects on the South Australian fishing industry as a whole. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to speak briefly to the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. I will go through the recommendations and make some comments on them. The first recommendation is that an inquiry be made into the capability for expansion of the defence forces. This is a really crucial question. I am disappointed with the Government's response on this issue. The core force concept is the concept in vogue, quite strongly, with all three Services at present. One wonders what it does really mean. Basically, according to the Services, it is the capacity to retain certain skills that can be expanded in time of need. I wonder, in today's age, how much time one has. Obviously we cannot reject a core concept out of hand; it has to be severely qualified. But the requirement of this country is to have resources instantly at hand to cope with the needs as we see them. Inevitably, that means that there has to be some risk taking. We cannot cover all eventualities; it is a matter of judgment. we have to accept that we run some risk in defence. We have to live with that, but be flexible enough to change as the need arises and the environment changes. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing about a core concept is that the same level of readiness is not applicable to all three Services. Quite obviously, in the case of the Royal Australian Air Force there has to be an instant capacity for air superiority because if we cannot guarantee air superiority we will not be able to move on the surface, whether it be on land or sea, in time of hostilities. We cannot wait to develop that capability. Probably the lowest requirement for a core force concept is in the Army, although there again we have to be able to put forces into any area of Australia's responsibility-whether it be Cocos Island, Broome or Weipa-in 24 hours. We cannot allow forces to come in and consolidate. We have to be able to put something in to dig them out and kill them off within a very short time. Obviously, in regard to the Army the numbers involved are beyond the maintenance of a standing force. The great need in Australia today is to reform the Army Reserve and to get the Reserve to a level of operational readiness at which it can move in about 10 to 14 days. That should not be a difficult goal for us at all if we address it properly. For that we have to have a complete rethink of how we run the Army Reserve. We have to assign tasks to it . We have to organise it on the basis of being a functional service. </PARA>
<PARA> The second recommendation of the Committee deals with more support for local industry in the face of overseas purchases. The only point I make about that is that it is time the Government abolished the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. That enormous scientific resource in this country is second only to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. It employs about 3,000 scientists and, quite simply, it is not a cost-effective organisation for use. What the Government needs is an advisory scientific body so that impartial, objective advice can be provided to the Department of Defence on weapons systems. But the business of research and development of the weapons systems should be taken entirely out of the hands of DSTO and put into two different areas. Firstly, basic research should be done by the universities. The universities research programs, as everyone knows, are underfunded at present. The hard core science and engineering faculties would benefit enormously if the money at present spent by DSTO on basic research was put into the Australian universities. The applied research, the development of weapons systems, should go to private industry which has the resources and the ability to cope in these high technology areas. We are wasting an enormous resource by persisting with the DSTO. </PARA>
<PARA> I say in passing in relation to the second recommendation that quite clearly we have come unstuck with the support programs for the Leopard tank and for the Invincible with regard to offsets. Krauss Maffei, the producer of the Leopard tank, is an assembler. It is not a prime producer. Support for the Leopard tank is very difficult because all the subcontractors who came and supported Krauss Maffei at the time simply do not want to know about Australia and they do not want to honour the obligations that they should have entered into with regard to offsets in that purchase. Recommendation 3 gets back somewhat to the core force concept and the nature of the forces themselves. One of the topical things at present is the anti-submarine warfare capacity of both the Air Force and the Navy. Quite frankly, I do not know what the answer is. I do not know whether we have the right balance in this country, whether we are putting too much resource into one area and what that priority should be. But these are areas that I think will benefit from further discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendations 4 and 5 deal with the acquisition times for equipment. The basic issue in this area is that weapons systems and defence capabilities are long term requirements. They last for much longer than the life of a parliament. In this parliamentary democracy we must find a way of looking at large capital expenditures and relating them to a need over a time cycle that is longer than the life of a parliament. Obviously we need some flexibility in that but the long term view has to be taken because the funding is now so enormous. </PARA>
<PARA> The reference to bipartisan, bilateral support from both sides of the chamber is most important. It is something I have unswervingly supported in all of the speeches on defence that I have made in this place. I have never scored political points off the Opposition on the matter of defence because I think it is far too important for that. It is a matter of the national security. The important point with the bilateral and bipartisan support is that discussion takes place. In the four years that I have been in this chamber there has been very little informed discussion on the two huge purchases we have made-the new tactical fighters and the Invincible. Debate has been quite minimal. I think one of the ways of addressing that is to reform and modify our committee system in the Senate because it is the only place, really, where informed debate can take place in any detail. </PARA>
<PARA> We should get rid of the present Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and hive off foreign affairs to one committee and have a Senate armed services committee in the way the United States does to look at specific defence matters. There are problems with that but I would see that committee being a valuable acquisition of the Parliament. It would allow us to call experts to put the cases both for and against equipment that was projected to be bought by the Executive Government of the day. Obviously we have problems when we get into highly technical areas and obviously, again, we have problems with confidential or secret information, but neither of those problems are insuperable. They are problems we have to tackle. Recommendation 7 deals with procurement. There is a general feeling that the procurement procedures of the Department of Defence are very involved and entail far too many committees and too long a period. I hope the Utz committee comes up with a recommendation which streamlines that process. I think the proposition that the purchasing of defence equipment be a function of the Department of Defence is common sense and long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA> The final recommendation deals with the procurement of weapons. I think there is a great case to be made for developing more Australian weapons systems. We live in a particular geographic environment with marked climatic and other environmental differences from northern Europe. Most weapons systems in both the Western and Soviet spheres of influence are optimised for the northern European climate. I believe that Australian industry has the capacity to devise and design weapons at a lower and more manageable research and development cost than that of the United States or Europe. I believe that in developing more Australian weapons our security would be enhanced because we would have better performance from those weapons systems and, most importantly, because they are Australian produced and because Australia will never be an offensive threat to any of the super powers, we would be guaranteed some protection from the development of electronic counter measures and all the counters automatically provided by Russia or the United States to existing weapons systems. Whatever the rights or wrongs of this report on the Government response, I welcome it because it is a most opportune time to look at our defence capacity. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The matter of research and development has been worrying me for a considerable time. Recently I asked the relevant Minister a question which suggested that the Government become involved with greater interaction between industry and universities in the form of joint research grants. At the same time I suggested that it should provide additional funds for university projects. Senator MacGibbon pointed out a couple of underfinanced areas-science and engineering- in some of the universities. Funding of those areas could help with regard to research and development in this country. Of course, the Commonwealth provides recurrent funds to universities and colleges of advanced education in the form of block grants on the advice of the Tertiary Education Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> As autonomous bodies, established under State legislation, universities and colleges of advanced education make their own decisions as to the detailed allocation of funds amongst various activities. The level of funding for certain courses is, quite rightly therefore, a matter for the institution. But the Commonwealth does not provide funds for individual courses. I am not sure whether that policy should remain. There is a lot of room for development of Australia's maximum potential level of research and development. This should be done in support of the creation of new industries based on science and high technology because it is vital to our economic and social growth. I propose that this development could be accelerated by fostering a greater interaction between industry and tertiary institutions through the management and allocation of government grants for industrial research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not always agree with Mr Hayden-in fact I very rarely do-but in a speech in the House of Representatives on 21 October last year he suggested that a national research development and innovation corporation should be set up to administer grants for industrial research and development, to co-ordinate government-supported research and development programs for manufacturing industry, to advise the Government of ways to improve Australian industry through technological innovation and to direct the Government's support to programs which increase the ability of Australian-owned firms to capitalise on new industrial technology. I am not sure whether we really need a corporation set up to do that, but if one were set up it could be responsible for the allocation of research and development grants to both tertiary institutions and industry. As such, it would be in a position to offer more efficient management of the funds which are to be allocated in the future. Firstly it could give special consideration to grant applications which foreshadow the involvement of staff and facilities of tertiary institutions in conducting individual industrial research and development grants; secondly, it could urge the business community to invest and participate in research perhaps by endowing chairs to universities and institutes of technology; thirdly, it could create a semi- competitive atmosphere in which educational institutions should be prepared to assess the quality of their performance at a research level; and, fourthly, it could encourage industry by means of incentive for grants to pursue a greater interaction with these tertiary research establishments. </PARA>
<PARA> At present tertiary institutions are not eligible for IR and D grants under the Australian Industrial Research and Development Incentives Scheme, but they can take on, under contract, research work for companies that are eligible. I believe they should be encouraged to do just that. The business community should be encouraged also to contract out research work to these institutions through incentives for such grants and the management of the grants. In the magazine Search for February and March 1982 it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1979, as a result of discussions between the Australian Industry Research Group (AIRG) and the Inter-University Committee on Research (IUCR), two listings of research topics were distributed: Basic Research of Relevance to Australian Industry, which gave 106 research topics which could usefully be investigated in universities; and Industrial Research Projects Available in Australian Industry, which gave 27 potential special studies programs for academics willing to work for a time in industrial laboratories. It was hoped that, in addition to action on those particular subjects, the result would be improved interaction between universities and industry in general. </PARA>
<PARA>Referring to Professor Birt, who is the Chairman of the IUCR, it stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the response to both documents was disappointing, writes Professor Michael Birt, Chairman of IUCR. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . the newspaper of the University of New South Wales (of which Professor Birt is Vice-Chancellor). Nevertheless, AIRG and IUCR have not abandoned hope of some progress in this frequently recommended direction. 'Accordingly, it is proposed to circulate within universities in the near future further information about basic research of interest to industry and special studies opportunities in industrial organisations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was said by Professor Birt. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Professor Birt has no criticism of the University of New South Wales, which ' has an enviable record of effective interaction with Australian industry', although there he believes it might be possible to do better. </PARA>
<PARA>It is possible for industry to co-operate with universities. I believe that it is something that should be promoted by the Government. In view of the time, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard page 31 of a report by the Australian Science and Technology Council to the Government. It is just a formal document. It makes some recommendations along the lines of which I have been speaking. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Performance of Fundamental Research Projects of Interest to Industry and Tertiary Education Institutions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> 5.29 Initiatives by the Australian Industrial Research Group (AIRG) to generate enthusiasm in universities and colleges for research projects of interest to industry have been only moderately successful to date (see Appendix A). One reason is that no financial incentive is provided. ASTEC supports the proposed AIRG program as a means of aligning a proportion of academic R&amp;D activities with industry, but suggests that some incentive is needed for the individual academic . The Council has examined the Special Co-operative Research Grants program operated by the Science Research Council (SRC) in the UK (see Appendix B); this is an effective mechanism for encouraging closer links between industry and higher education. Not only would this increase interaction between universities and industry, but it would also be an appropriate program for encouraging interaction with colleges of advanced education where staff should have a greater involvement in applied R&amp;D. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.30 After examining the most appropriate means of introducing the scheme into Australia, ASTEC has concluded that such a program would best be implemented as a grants sub-program of the Australian Industrial Research and Development Incentives (AIRDI) program, with any necessary amendment of the Australian Industrial R&amp;D Incentives Act. The awarding of such grants might subsequently lead to program grants rather than project grants and could eventually have the effect of establishing industrial co-operative research centres, not dissimilar from the UK's experience with the Marine Technology Directorate. ASTEC believes that such co-operative research grants should be made relatively more attractive than the usual AIRDI project grant, and this could be done either by allowing companies involved to receive more than the 50 per cent of total project costs currently met by the AIRDI scheme, or by setting aside a proportion of AIRDI funds for the co-operative grants. The Council believes that, following a study of the operation of the UK Science Research Council's Special Co-operative Research Grants program, a pilot program needs to be established under the AIRDI Act. In the first instance, an amount of approximately $0.5m per annum is suggested, sufficient to support 10 to 20 major projects. </PARA>
<PARA> ASTEC recommends: That a pilot program of co-operative research grants be established under the Australian Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act 1976 (amended as necessary), taking into account the operations of the UK Special Co-operative Research Grants program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Finally, there is one matter I believe the Government should take note of. It is a final point about research and development which I think is important. It concerns the overall objectives of government and private industry. It seems that on the whole, while private industry is in business to make profits, governments should not necessarily be concerned with the overall well-being of the profit side of the matter; they should be more concerned with the overall well-being of the nation. In terms of research and development investments, these aims do not always coincide. A little later in the day I hope to be saying something about the amount of money that is being spent by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. In that area too I believe this country-not necessarily the Government-needs to be prepared to put up money to keep research going at a rate that is suitable for getting the best out of the technological advances that are so common now around the world.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to make a few comments regarding the activities of the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs. In the Department's annual report it is stated that the tabling of the report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions was an event of major importance for the Commonwealth Employment Service in 1980-81. I would like to consider two of the recommendations of the so called razor gang which I believe seriously reduce the quality of services and information provided by the Department. The first of these is the abolition of the CES statistics. It is quite obvious that the CES data series was discontinued simply because it was politically embarrassing to the Government. Time and again the CES figures showed a higher unemployment level than the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures and, as such, were closer to the real level of unemployment, which at present is around 800,000. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that the Government has done everything possible to hide the true level of unemployment in this country. The abolition of the seasonally adjusted figures was the first step and now we have the complete abolition of the very useful CES data series. The CES figures, like the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, were not deadly accurate. Nevertheless, they were very useful for showing regional and occupational variations in the labour market. The CES figures were the only ones which gave in any detail the level of unemployment in particular regions and in particular occupations. They were regularly used by manpower planners to calculate the unemployment rate in specific occupations and over time provided very useful information for researchers. Now there is nothing available to measure the variations in occupational demand, information which is essential for effective manpower and economic planning. In Britain the Department of Employment regularly publishes very comprehensive figures on unemployment, both on a regional basis and on an occupational basis. Surely this can be done in Australia, especially with the advent of the job bank computer system in 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA> Another recommendation of the razor gang on which I want to comment is the abolition of the professional employment offices. The professional employment offices, or PEOs as they were known, provided a very efficient and highly successful placement service for professional people. They were originally established because it was felt that the ordinary CES offices and their staff were not equipped to handle the more complex needs of unemployed professional people. As a result, staff were specifically trained to interview professional people and to provide a unique placement service for the employers of professionals at no cost to either the employer or the job seeker. The provision of this free service was in line with the recommendations of the International Labour Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> In its last year of operations, the PEO had established such a high reputation with employers that it was taking a lot of business away from the private employment agencies. It is a well-known fact that these agencies put pressure on the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Sir Phillip Lynch, to get rid of the PEO and that eventually the Minister succumbed to this pressure. There is no other reason why the razor gang would have abolished such a very efficient and successful operation. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt business in the private employment agencies has been booming since the abolition of the PEO. At the same time, unemployed professional people have been forced to go to the CES district offices for assistance. I suspect that very few of them have been placed by the CES since May last year-certainly many fewer than were placed in the previous 12 months. In fact, I asked the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), who represents the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown), a question on notice for figures on this but because compilation of CES statistics was abolished around the same time, he could not tell me how many professionals had been placed by the CES between May 1981 and May 1982. I think this is a national disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> How can an organisation such as the CES function without these sorts of figures ? How does it know how many staff it needs to allocate to interview professional people if these sorts of figures are not available? It is pretty obvious that the razor gang's decision to abolish CES statistics and the PEO was nothing more than a cheap political manoeuvre. Those decisions must be reversed if this country is to develop an effective manpower planning system. How can this Government ever hope to solve the nation's worsening unemployment situation if it is not prepared to provide the basic tools for manpower planning?</PARA>
<PARA> All that this Government has done is provide an expensive array of training schemes, although it is interesting to note that expenditure on all manpower training and support programs has fallen by 50 per cent in real terms since the Fraser Government came to power. That shows about the extent of this Government' s concern for the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the programs administered by the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs are very useful and provide the only means for many disadvantaged people to improve their job skills. Schemes such as the Community Youth Support Scheme, education programs for unemployed youth and other school to work transition programs all play a vital role and have assisted many young people throughout Australia. However, unless these people have jobs to go to, I am afraid that a lot of this money will be wasted. Between now and 1985, 650,000 jobs need to be created in Australia just to maintain the present unemployment rate, which of course is unacceptable anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the bust of the so-called resources boom and the slow-down in retail sales and in our manufacturing industries, it is hard to see exactly where these jobs will come from. Unless this Government changes its economic course and develops more effective long term manpower planning I am afraid our young people will be facing a very dim future. Even in West Germany, Chancellor Schmidt has recently announced a huge job creation program to try to stem the rising unemployment rate in that country. Perhaps Australia could develop a similar program or at least the Government could send some officials from the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs to examine the operation of the program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I wish to comment briefly on three aspects of the report of the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs. The first matter to which I shall refer is community based schemes. The Australian Democrats reiterate that we were pleased to see that the Community Youth Support Scheme had survived. We commend the Government on its wisdom in relenting in this matter and authorising the retention of the scheme. We have doubts and concerns about whether the Government yet realises the scheme's importance and the necessity not of cutting it back but of extending it. I wish I could believe that the Government understood how deeply this program is supported in the community. I think that is one of the more important aspects of the scheme. I think probably the only reason why the Government kept the scheme was that it got some inkling of that support. I hope that the Government has taken the lesson seriously to heart. I believe that CYSS is a basis which could and should be built on much more extensively. Senator Foreman touched on that matter, of course, in his comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a great need in Australia for a community-based organisation that takes into account the problems of those young people who have had no work experience, who apparently have no chance of ever getting a job because of that and whose confidence about even being able to get a work situation has disappeared. This is a semi-permanent problem. I suggest to the Government that it should look closely at some scheme which is based on the community, and which , indeed, could be based on CYSS, to try to cope with that problem and see that there is a training element and some sort of organised group activity in which these young people could work with their peers. This seems to me to be one of the most essential things that the country needs. While I am on this subject I point out that I find it very disturbing that the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) seems to be the absolute arbiter as to whether any individual CYSS program has the right to continue to exist. It seems to us that it would be far more reasonable if there were some system of appeal in the case of any centre being refused funds and so closed down. At present, even if a CYSS centre feels that it can put up an excellent case for retention it is denied the right to put that case forward. I am looking at several cases now in New South Wales which are of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the School to Work Transition Program. We were delighted to read in the report that the basis of the Department's school to work transition policy is:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . recognition that the vocational preparation received by the majority of school students can be substantially improved and that the education system needs to become better geared to the vocational needs of young people in the changing circumstances of the 1980s . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This, of course, is something which is to be applauded. The Australian Democrats wholeheartedly agree with it. It seems in that connection a pity that the Committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions was apparently unaware of this policy or did not take it into account when it abolished the Curriculum Development Centre and the Education Research and Development Committee, terminated special support for educational research and scaled down the research activities of the Department of Education. It makes one wonder what kind of governmental activity we have where pious utterances are made in one direction and then we find that when they are construed to a level of action something quite different is done. </PARA>
<PARA> I make a brief comment on a little publicised scheme-NESA, the National Employment Strategy for Aboriginals. I feel that it is something with which we could do a lot more. I am specifically interested in this section of the report, as, indeed, other senators would be, since I have had two NESA trainees employed in my office. Both were found to be keen, hard workers who went on to excellent jobs which they held after they left my office. I must say that this is very much to the credit of those people. Once they were given their heads and given confidence and work that they could do we found that they went from strength to strength. This scheme is obviously going well. I believe it should be expanded and more widely advertised and publicised among employers many of whom, we found , have heard about it only by chance. One particular concern to me is that although my first NESA trainee was allowed to travel to Canberra to see how Parliament functions and to see how my office here is set up-this is a necessary part of learning something-this travel was denied to my second NESA trainee although I felt is was a necessary part of her training. For some reason the Government has done some mad economy thing which, as is always the case with these minor economies, tends to destroy completely or to harm seriously the total value of the program. Finally, I urge the Minister to reconsider this arrangement and to restore this travel allowance to NESA trainees in parliamentary offices. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the Community Youth Support Scheme I very much endorse Senator Mason's remarks and draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that there is still no national award for project officers employed under the scheme and who, according to a previous report-I believe it was in the guidelines-must possess communication skills and the capacity to deal with a multitude of social and psychological problems. Where no State award exists-they exist only in Victoria and New South Wales- wages and conditions for project officers have been described as appalling. In many cases they are paid less than junior social work cadets while accepting heavy responsibility and heavy work loads. The figure of $9,000 per annum has been given to me as a typical wage for these people who are trained and qualified. Recent attempts by the social workers union to obtain a Federal award were initially successful but Deputy President Isaac's decision was overturned on appeal. The Commonwealth Government played a major part in that appeal, in which the final determination was that this was not an industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The level of funding for this scheme must surely allow for proper payments and other award provisions for these workers. Management committees on the whole need direction from the Government on this matter but the Government, having acknowledged the value of the scheme and having ensured its continuation, must accept the ultimate responsibility. The local committees often lack continuity and a capacity to understand their role as employers. Meanwhile, another essential service to the community is being heavily subsidised by poorly paid workers whose commitment and dedication is being exploited. </PARA>
<PARA> The technical and further education scheme in its updated form is described in a section of the annual report of the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs , starting on page 19. The introduction of a transition allowance is a very welcome innovation, providing as it does a means of filling the gap in the range of allowances available to young people. Prior to the introduction of this allowance young people were dissuaded from returning to training as those receiving unemployment benefit were required to give it up upon commencing full time school to work transition courses conducted by TAFE institutions. I suggest that it is not just young people in the age bracket of 15 years to 24 years who should be eligible for this allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past few months I have become acutely aware of a significant group of women in the community, some of whom have been out of the work force for 20 to 25 years, who have never been able to acquire very much in the way of formal education and training and who, in their 40s, having been on widows' pensions, now find that because their children have reached the age of 16 years, their entitlements are reduced to the unemployment benefit. This seems to me to be a group of women who certainly should not be thrown on the scrap heap. They should be given the opportunity to rejoin the work force, to take up their education where it left off, which in some cases was decades ago. They should be encouraged to do this by undertaking appropriate courses within the TAFE system and by the provision of a similar sort of transition allowance. That would make up to them for the loss of the extra entitlements they had been receiving as widows and it would demonstrate to them that society recognises the fact that they have done what they believed to be the right thing by staying out of the work force for all those years to bring up their children. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer also to the section dealing with the Women's Bureau. There is a reference to the equal employment opportunity guidelines which were launched on 4 February 1981 by the Honourable Andrew Peacock in his capacity at that time as Chairman of the National Labour Consultative Council. I note that the distribution of these guidelines is being monitored by the Women's Bureau. I suggest that a check be made on whether these guidelines are to apply, for example, to educational institutions, particularly universities, TAFE institutions and colleges, which employ a considerable number of people. There seems to have been very little recognition in the past of the inequities in these institutions' recruiting and employment practices which have resulted in the fact that women are very poorly represented in the better paid and more secure positions. </PARA>
<PARA> The report makes a brief reference to the Open Doors Campaign which is being conducted by the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs. This campaign aims to break down job segregation by encouraging young women to consider apprenticeship and trade training as alternatives to traditional female jobs. Currently there are about 140,000 apprentices in training in Australia but less than 2 per cent of them are women if hairdressing is excluded. Open Doors is designed to help change that situation. It consists of a package which features a booklet containing information from all States and Territories, a poster and an 18-minute videotape which features women in various apprenticeships throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The promotional material for the campaign was developed specifically for young women. I suggest that it is very important that this campaign should reach not just young women but all young people, the younger the better. The material should be distributed not only in secondary schools but also in primary schools. It should be made available for the information and edification of boys as well as girls. It seems to me to be very important for males in this community to get used to the idea that women can do anything. After all, even in the best of all possible worlds, males will still make 50 per cent of the decisions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like very briefly to make a comment on a matter raised by Senator Giles. She mentioned women who have stayed at home and devoted themselves to bringing up children and their subsequent employment difficulties, particularly those women whose children leave home or grow up prior to the women being entitled to continuous widows' pensions. I know the problem which was raised by the honourable senator and note her interest in it. I rise simply to invite her to let me have her considered view on the appropriate remedy to that problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make that suggestion in light of the fact that there is a range of possibilities. One could, for example, extend the entitlement to the Class B widow's pension, which is one suggestion which has been put forward. This would entitle all women who have ever had children to a lifetime pension if they were widowed or divorced. Alternatively, in a society in which the differential between men and women as people who enter paid employment is tending to diminish , for at least a part of the population, ought one to be more concerned with the long term employment problems of both men and women who, for a variety of reasons, might have difficulty in re-entering the work force? In other words, there are a variety of approaches. I certainly have some concern about endlessly extending the automatic category of people who are entitled to income support. I wonder whether the honourable senator has given thought to that point. She might like to raise it with me at some later time. I am sorry to have taken up the time of the Senate but it is a matter in which I am interested and on which I would welcome the honourable senator's views. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Heritage Commission was established following the recommendation of the Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate which reported to Federal Parliament in 1974. The report before us today entitled 'The National Estate in 1981' is the first report that has come before the Parliament and hence the first report that has come before the public of Australia since then. I find this a remarkable occurrence, given that the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 defines the National Estate as:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . those places, being components of the natural environment of Australia or the cultural environment of Australia, that have aesthetic, historic, scientific or social significance or other special value for future generations as well as for the present community. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to be that, given that definition, it is encumbent on the Government to engineer that reports of this kind be presented to the Parliament and to the public at somewhat less than eight-yearly intervals. I emphasise that this is no criticism of the Commission or of its Chairman, David Yencken. I believe that the financial resources available to the Commission have declined considerably in the last five or six years, that the work load is absolutely incredible and that the Commission is doing the very best it can under some extremely difficult circumstances. This means, of course, that we can seriously question the attitude of the present Government to Australia's heritage and its commitment to cultural and environmental heritage preservation and development at all. That fact is probably best indicated by a remark in the report which states that the museum commission which the inquiry recommended in 1974 has not yet been established. I would have thought that that would have been an integral part of conserving Australia's heritage. Clearly, there is much to be done. This report emphasises that in its final chapter. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Commission and its Chairman have a lot to be complimented for-the work it has done, its plans for the future and, most importantly, the results it has had so far in getting community support for, appreciation of and approval for heritage work and cultural preservation. In chapter 2 of the report , entitled 'Perceptions of the National Estate', these words appear:</PARA>
<PARA> One of the most valuable contributions made by the Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate was to give formal expression to an emerging consciousness of our natural and man-made heritage. </PARA>
<PARA>This has led indisputably to increased community support for environmental and heritage issues. An indication of that is the increasing numbers of members in voluntary conservation organisations. As I understand it, there are now something like 370,000 members of various organisations. Clearly, the public attitude is strongly supportive of what is being done by organisations such as the Commission. I had first hand experience of that last month when I took a fairly detailed tour of one of the council regions in South Australia, namely region 8, which begins around Owen and extends up as far as Clare and Burra. I discovered, for instance, that the Kapunda council has made tremendous efforts to develop one of the most extensive museums of the region that I have ever run into. Despite some mild community objections, such as bomb threats to certain councillors and attempts to ring-bark trees around the place, the Owen council nevertheless purchased the old Owen post office which is now turning into quite a profitable concern. At Burra, in the heart of South Australia's mid-north, the council is planning on spending $200,000 in the next few years to develop one side of Paxton Square which, for those people who are not South Australians and are not familiar with the area, consists of a series of miners' homes. It is a very important part of the heritage of that section of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> So community interest and action are very evident through the efforts of local governments. This, in turn, is having an additional effect on the attitudes of community groups such as Apex and of individual people in the area. I was delighted to note, while I was up there, that individual farmers are setting themselves targets for tree plantings on their properties in an attempt to replace the old Australian adage: 'If it stands still, chop it down; if it moves , shoot it'. Apexians are spending a lot of money on developing areas that are rather unattractive, such as around railway stations and so on, in those places. So clearly the actions of the Australian Heritage Commission have had quite an important part to play in what is happening with community groups in South Australia and other parts of the country. I refer again to some more points that are raised in chapter 2 which is one of the most important sections in the report. That chapter relates to the preservation of Australia's national heritage. Five arguments are outlined on page 18 of the report which are probably best summarised as arguing for the need for biological, cultural and intellectual continuity of Australia's heritage. The report refers to some comments made by Norman Myers, Senior Associate of the World Wildlife Fund, who said:</PARA>
<PARA> The welfare of humankind is served by the species that share the earth. Not only do they supply natural products such as rubber but they also provide germ plasm-living tissue that harbours hereditary codes in the form of genes. </PARA>
<PARA>He pursued that line of thought for some time. I do not have time to read all his remarks now. The report has a caption underneath a photograph of one of Australia's more magnificent rainforests which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Rainforests are among the world's richest gene banks and their economic potentiality has yet to be fully explored. Australian rainforests have been destroyed to the extent that only one-quarter of the original pre-European distribution now remains. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe it is essential-certainly the compilers of this report believe that it is essential-that State and Federal government politicians respond to the sort of evidence that is brought forward in chapter 2 of this report and act to correct the damage done in the past by ignorant members of the community and by careless members of the community, to say nothing of venal members of the community. One attempt to do this has recently been undertaken by my colleague, Senator Mason, who yesterday indicated to the Senate his intention to introduce a private member's Bill on rainforest preservation agreements. The purpose of this Bill is to encourage the States to preserve all existing rainforests in a variety of ways, into which I do not have time to go now, with financial assistance from the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Public acceptance of the need to preserve our national heritage must be matched by government action of the kind Senator Mason suggests in his Bill which the Senate will hear more about later today. In addition, reports of this nature are an essential part of the educative process of both politicians and members of the community. I reiterate what I said at the beginning of this speech; that it is essential that we get, at intervals smaller than eight years, reports on the cultural needs and the cultural heritage of Australia. I will end my remarks by quoting the final sentence of this report's summary and conclusions chapter which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Respect for an understanding of the past is a pre-requisite for a fully rounded culture of the future. </PARA>

<PARA> Address:</PARA>
<PARA> The group consists of the warehouse and offices (on Allot. 15, Sec. 5) and two old houses on Walker Street, (Allot 2, Sec. 5). Parish of Elphinstone, County of Coonabulla. </PARA>
<PARA> The Warehouse Building was erected in 1887 for the firm of Hollis Hopkins and Co. Ltd., warehousemen. The name of the architect is unknown. </PARA>
<PARA> Hollis Hopkins started in business in Townsville in 1881, purchasing the wholesale drapery departments of Aplin, Brown &amp; Co., and Burns Philp &amp; Co. Hopkins arrived in Australia from England in 1864. He lived in Sydney for 17 years before coming to Townsville. </PARA>
<PARA> He became very well known locally as one of the leaders of the Separation Movement, even settling in London for some years in order to further the cause of that movement there. The business passed to his son, Spencer Hopkins, and then to his grandson Harry Hopkins, who is also well known in the city's life, having served on the City Council and been involved in the foundation of James Cook University. </PARA>
<PARA> The present building, approx. 66 feet x 100 feet deep, consists of four floors including a basement lit by large windows recessed in the pavement. As constructed in 1887 it had two floors and basement, the top storey being added in 1890. </PARA>
<PARA> The building is a cement brick warehouse with attractive Victorian neo classical detail. The facade attempts a symmetrical composition slightly compromised by the high opening on the left side of the ground floor which serves a waggon laneway and which is furnished with iron gates with company insignia. A central entrance with triangular pediment stands slightly proud of the general facade, this emphasis being carried upwards as a central feature by means of flanking pilasters on each side of a large semi-circular headed window on each floor. The semi-circular theme is continued into the parapet in the form of a lunette containing a heraldic bas relief portraying a lamb being weighed. This central parapet section is surmounted by decorative finials and is raised above the level of a balustered parapet which extends the full width of the facade. The other windows on the second and third storeys all have decorative keystones featuring classical female heads. </PARA>
<PARA> The facade is a good example of moderately ornate provincial Victorian neo classical, visually important because of its rich play of solid and void and sunlight and shadow appropriate to Townsville's climate; and also because of its location adjoining the proposed civic square. It has architectural and historical affinity with the Commonwealth offices almost opposite in Sturt Street; and makes an important contribution to the streetscape as a part of this sequence of old buildings which also includes Buchanan's Hotel. </PARA>
<PARA> The interior of the building is believed to be largely intact and includes a foyer with fine timber panelling and counter, timber stairs and decorative structured iron columns supporting the top floor; and a lift (1889) said to be the first to be installed in a warehouse outside a capital city anywhere in Australia and the only hydraulic lift then operating in a manchester warehouse in the colony of Queensland. This lift is apparently still in working order. </PARA>
<PARA> Two Identical Cottages in Walker Street, contemporary with the Hollis Hopkins building (1890), were erected by T. Hollis Hopkins. There are small vernacular timber and tin cottages remaining from a period when this was the main residential area of Townsville. The grounds include significant large mango trees. This group is excellently preserved and important as an intact relic of the residential history of the area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. There are a number of other points to which I would like to refer briefly. I will quote from the beginning of chapter 6 on page 115 because I think it is significant. The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of the 6,700 places in the Register of the National Estate by far the largest number of individual entries are those which reflect European or European related exploration and settlement. Of these historic listings, individual buildings constitute the largest single category with some 5,000 listings. There are an estimated five million buildings in Australia, so the Register listings of individual buildings still constitute no more than 0.1 per cent of the total building. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the part that disturbs me. Apparently a listing does not necessarily preserve a building from demolition. The Hopkins building in Townsville has been bought by the State Government Insurance Office, which proposes to demolish the building and, I understand, build a 12-storey office block on the site. The appeal made by the Hollis Hopkins Concerned Citizens Committee and me is that some small amount of finance ought to be obtained-I hope from Federal sources-to preserve this edifice. If that is forthcoming perhaps there can be some spirit of co-operation on the part of the developers so that the major part of the old building can be retained. The new building could probably go to the rear of the site. In other words, it would be an incorporation. This has already happened with Buchanan's Hotel, a famous establishment on the other side of the street. The new owner proposes to incorporate the whole of the old building in a high rise building that is being constructed on the same site. I seek leave to continue my remarks on another date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-In view of the time available, I want just to congratulate the Australian Heritage Commission on its report and work and to say that I am proud to have been part of the Australian Labor Party Government that set up this institution-the Heritage Commission-and that developed the concept of the National Estate. I want to refer very briefly to two aspects of the report. The report, on page 38, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Section 30 of the Commission's Act requires Commonwealth Ministers and authorities to take no action which might adversely affect a listed place unless they are satisfied that there is no feasible and prudent alternative and that all measures that can be taken to minimise the adverse effect will be taken. </PARA>
<PARA>Later in that section, on page 40, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Whether the actions of Commonwealth Ministers at Loan Council meetings fall under the purview of section 30 has also been questioned. The legal opinions received by the Commission have not answered this question definitively. </PARA>
<PARA>In view of the fact that this is a key question which will face the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania I ask that those legal opinions be made public or be provided to the Committee. The other matter to which I wanted to refer very briefly was referred to on page 140 of the report and is in respect of the built environment and actions by agencies of the Government which affect the appearance of certain buildings which are the property of the Government. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> There are past errors which need rectification e.g. the Post Offices of Oatlands, Campbell Town, and Longford all in historic towns in Tasmania, and all mutilated by insensitive facade rebuilding some fifteen or so years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Just how much these Post Offices might contribute to the historic landscapes of their towns can be seen in nearby Ross, where a similar Post Office was only saved by spirited local resistance led by the Von Bibra family. During the 1973- 74 Committee of Inquiry investigations a promise was given that the Post Offices would be restored. The Inquiry Report documented this undertaking with a caption to a photo: 'Gracious apology for an error-Oatlands Post Office in Tasmania mistakenly robbed of its charming facade, is being restored to the original sandstone'. Today no one will acknowledge the undertaking despite strong local support for restoration; it is conveniently buried in the old Postmaster General 's Department. Whilst these Post Offices remain in their present state every visitor to Tasmania is reminded of this unrequited Commonwealth promise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-In the features section on page 9 of the Australian newspaper this morning there is an article written by John Webb headed 'Chipp, McMahon intervene over prohibited import'. The article deals with an event that occurred around about November 1972 when I received representations from the then Prime Minister, Mr William McMahon, as member for Lowe, concerning one of his constituents who was having a problem with the Bureau of Customs. I was then the Minister for Customs and Excise. The article in the Australian, as one would expect from such a reputable newspaper, is accurate and fair in its account of the way in which I, as the then Minister, treated the matter. The facts are briefly as follows: One of Mr McMahon's constituents, I believe a Lebanese gentleman, imported a still into the country that had been used to make that loathsome liquid, arak--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I used to like it, yes, but tastes change. The still's marketable value or real use or threat to the Australian liquor industry was negligible but because there was a regulation that prohibited the import of stills to produce alcohol it was a prohibited import. But this Lebanese gentleman, as I recall-it was 10 years ago and memory is dim-wanted to put it in some historical room as an ornament. To get around this dilemma, in discussions with my Department we agreed that if we made the still incapable of producing alcoholic liquor the gentleman could have it for whatever the value was. As I recall, we bashed some holes in the bottom of the still so that it could not contain any liquor, made the gentleman pay $10 and the still went through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I, as Minister, authorised that sort of procedure countless times in answer to representations from back benchers, Ministers, and representatives from the Senate. It is a Minister's function to accommodate a citizen after representations from a member of parliament to overcome what the bureaucracy does in administering the strict law. The Minister does not break the law but I think he applies a common-sense application. Another clear case is when many people bring back guns as souvenirs from overseas. They find them in some curio shop and buy them. They bring them into Australia for their artistic or historical value. Clearly, they are not brought in for the purpose of shooting anybody but technically I suppose they could be repaired to such a stage at which they could, if one achieved a miracle and found a bullet to fit them, be resurrected to shoot. In those cases quite often we would say that if the gun were rendered incapable of ever shooting another bullet we would allow the gun in, although in its natural form it was a prohibited import. That is a practice I followed when I was Minister for Customs. I hope subsequent Ministers for Customs have followed this same procedure when asked to apply common sense to the administration of their portfolios. The Australian article describes that event properly and fairly, as honourable senators would expect it to, but this fellow, John Webb-whoever he is-in the course of the article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the then Minister for Customs and Excise, Mr Don Chipp, wrote to ' my dear Prime Minister'--</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>This report is the fourth report from the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment dealing with annual reports. An examination of the annual reports of departments and statutory authorities is an important aspect of Parliament's oversight of the activities of those departments and statutory authorities. Unfortunately, it is an aspect that has not been fully exploited by Senate committees, largely due to a lack of staff resources. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of Senate committees have tabled annual reports. Most, however, have only briefly examined each annual report and the committees' reports to the Senate have concentrated on the style, format and contents of the annual reports under review. A summary of the problems raised by the reporting bodies may also be included. The three previous reports by this Committee are examples of this approach. However this method can rightly be criticised for being shallow and superficial. Such an examination is valueless and contributes nothing to the oversight by the Parliament of the operations of the Executive. The Committee believes that what is now required is a detailed appraisal of the content of annual reports. This would extend to a critical examination of the information provided, including the identification of omissions or deficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment believes it desirable to examine every annual report referred to it, the lack of resources ensures that it is not possible to do this at a level that makes the examination worthwhile. Nevertheless the Committee was keen to make an effective examination of at least some of the 45 annual reports referred to it in 1981. The Committee chose to examine in detail two annual reports; those of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation for 1979-80 and the Department of Science and the Environment, also for 1979-80. Within each report the Committee concentrated on particular areas of activity, choosing those in which it had a particular interest and with which it was most familiar. They are: from the Department of Science and the Environment annual report for 1979-80, areas which dealt with the Baseline Air Pollution Station and the Australian Balloon Launching Station; and, from the CSIRO annual report for 1979-80, areas which dealt with the effects of the recent reorganisation, particularly on the research effort, the effects of staff and financial restraints on the CSIRO's capacity to perform its statutory functions and high priority areas for expansion and new initiatives. The Committee has made recommendations on the reporting to Parliament of the activities of the Baseline Air Pollution Station, the continued operation of an Australian scientific balloon launching facility, an increase in the CSIRO operating appropriation and the prompt referral of annual reports to committees. These are very important matters and I refer honourable senators to the report for further details. </PARA>
<PARA> In this statement, I wish to highlight the Committee's conclusions regarding the conduct of this inquiry. The Commitee invited the department and authority concerned to make written submissions on the areas selected by the Committee for investigation. Representatives were then questioned at a public hearing. Subsequently, the Committee invited comment, on some aspects of the evidence, from interested persons and organisations. The approach adopted by the Committee proved deficient in two respects. First, the examination of some issues was incomplete because the Committee heard evidence only from representatives of the department or authority whose annual report was under investigation. The Committee believes that it is most important that the examination of annual reports should be at a public hearing. Evidence should also be taken from representatives of other interested parties, such as unions or staff associations, advisory councils, consumers or users of the particular services, as well as governments, community groups or businesses affected by that aspect of the operations which is under investigation. In the future the Committee intends to hear evidence from all relevant parties. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the inquiry was delayed and some of the issues were out of date or overtaken by later events. The Committee believes that it must take into account developments after the end of the reporting period. Unless this is done, distorted, or at the worst valueless, conclusions will result. Nevertheless, every effort should be made to consider matters raised in the annual report as soon as possible after its tabling, so that comments of the Committee are more relevant to the current situation. The Committee intends to reduce the time taken in its inquiries and also recommends that the annual reports be referred to committees within one week of tabling. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as future examinations of annual reports are concerned, the Committee believes it desirable that all annual reports referred to it should be examined. However the lack of Committee resources would limit such a program initially to three or four reports a year. From these the Committee will select two or three aspects of the reporting authority's operations for examination. The report of such an examination should be brief and will, if necessary, contain recommendations for future action. It is the intention of this Committee to institute an inquiry into annual reports, as soon as possible after being referred to the committee, and to conduct a short public hearing within two months of the reference. As a general principle, the Committeee would report to the Senate on the annual report within two months of the public hearing, or four months after the reference to the Committee. In this way the matters examined in the inquiry would be much more relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> In drawing attention to the delays in the referral of annual reports to this Committee which have occurred on occasions in the past, it was intended to highlight the desirability of prompt referral of annual reports rather than to reflect critically upon the President, his predecessor or any members of the Senate staff, in particular the records office. This has been brought forward in a constructively critical way in the interests of the development of the committee system and with the objective of making an examination of annual reports more effective than it has been in the past. I have written to the President on this matter and have made those views clear to him. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>Because of the Joint Committee's continuing interest in the Middle East, on 15 November 1979 Sub-committee B was given a reference to monitor the situation there and in peripheral countries. This report covers the countries of Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. This report arises from evidence that the Sub-committee has been taking since February 1980. In preparing this report the Sub-committee has had to keep abreast of developments in a region of rapidly changing political circumstances and of uncertainty. This afternoon I wish to deal briefly with some of the issues of great importance to Australia. </PARA>

</DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1934">
<TITLE>Australia's Trade Effort</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As would be expected in a report of this nature, the Sub-committee devoted considerable attention to identifying Australia's interests in the Gulf, and also how events there are likely to affect us. Australian trade with the region has increased dramatically in the last few years. Australia's exports to the Gulf rose from $87.2m in 1972-73 to $915.6m in 1980-81, an increase of 950 per cent. This compares with an increase in total Australian exports to all markets in the same period of 209 per cent. On the other hand imports from the Gulf, principally crude oil and petroleum products, stood at $1,808m in 1980-81, an increase of 1,297 per cent over 1972-73.</PARA>
<PARA> The size of increased exports might seem satisfactory, but perhaps we could be doing a lot better. Although several Trade Commission personnel have undertaken a 'three months survival course' in Arabic, the Sub-committee was told in evidence as recently as 25 March 1982 that there is only one member in the Department of Trade and Resources who can read and write Arabic adequately. Although in past years some officers had undertaken 12-month courses in Arabic before taking up appointments at one of our nine posts in the Middle East, this is no longer done due to staff resources, budgeting constraints, et cetera. This is only one area of a number where the Committee makes recommendations in respect of our trade effort.</PARA>

</DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1934">
<TITLE>The Relevance of the Arab-Israeli Dispute and the Palestinian Issue</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This report is different from the previous reports because it focuses on the Gulf, rather than on the Arab-Israeli dispute and the Palestinian question or the difficulties in Lebanon. In spite of that, the Arab-Israeli dispute and the Palestinian question are a topic which has had to be addressed in the report as it is a significant feature of the internal Gulf politics. Palestinians are dispersed throughout the Gulf and are important elements in the labour force. Their presence allows them to exert a continuing pressure on host Gulf countries in respect of the Palestine issue. Most Gulf governments publicly say that settlement of the dispute is the region's first priority.</PARA>
</PROCTEXT>
</DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1934">
<TITLE>Super-Power Involvement</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The economic interests of the industrialised Western countries in the Gulf means that the United States is keen to secure what it sees as Western vital interests in the region. The Revolution in Iran which overthrew the Shah, the Iraq-Iran war, reports of instability in the Gulf monarchies, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan have seen the United States becoming increasingly concerned about the safety of oil supplies from the region.</PARA>
<PARA> Since President Carter's January 1980 State of the Union Address to Congress, there have been many developments in United States military and strategic policy which will involve Australia. These include the establishment of a rapid deployment force, and a general increase in the ability of the United States to project power into the Gulf from the Indian Ocean. The upgrading of air and port facilities at Diego Garcia, the estabishment of transit rights at Darwin Airport for B52 bombers en route to Diego Garcia, the stationing of marines aboard ship in the Indian Ocean, and so on are all matters which affect Australia and Australia's region. The report therefore analyses the developments in United States strategic and military policy in considerable detail.</PARA>
</PROCTEXT>
</DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1934">
<TITLE>United States Policy</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Because of the importance of the strategic situation in the Gulf region, the report devotes considerable attention to developments in United States policy since January 1980. From a reading of the basic source documents and evidence presented by United States armed forces personnel to Congress it is evident that United States policy towards the Gulf is not well understood in Australia, and it is hoped that detailed information in the report will help correct this. For instance, it is clear that the upper echelons of the United States armed forces are continuing to come around to the view that getting forces to the Gulf and other areas of the Middle East in times of crisis rapidly could best be done in a westerly rather than an easterly direction from the United States. This may have important implications for Australia.</PARA>

<TITLE>Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concluded that there was little likelihood of the Indian Ocean being proclaimed as a zone of peace despite the majority wish of the 46 member states of the United Nations who are members of the discussion group on the topic. The Committee felt that given the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and its troop strength in the hinterland along the Iranian border, with land access to the Gulf and south and south-west Asia, the United States is unlikely to agree to withdraw its substantial naval presence in the Ocean.</PARA>

</DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1935">
<TITLE>Australia's Strategic Interests</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Sub-committee sought to identify how the strategic situation in the Gulf might affect Australia. It is clear, as the report states, that:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has no direct strategic interest in the Gulf. It does however have a common concern with other Western industrialised countries to secure a continued supply of oil and protect its economic viability to enable the continued export of goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA>The report also states:</PARA>
<PARA> Since United States encouragement of Australia to participate in a peacekeeping force in the Sinai, and heightened military activity in the Gulf region, the Middle East in general and the Gulf in particular, have during 1980-81 become more important elements in United States-Australian strategic relations.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not possible to list all the areas in the report on which the Committee has made recommendations and conclusions. The Committee has made a number of observations on such matters as the adequacy of our trade promotion, on other aspects of economic relations, including petro-dollar investment in Australia, on super-power involvement in the Gulf, and on Australia's policy towards the Arab-Israeli dispute and the Palestinian question. The Committee hopes that the Government will respond to them in a statement to the Parliament in the not too distant future, perhaps in the Budget sittings. The Committee hopes that the report will be a useful background for all those interested in our relations with the Middle East.</PARA>
<PARA> I should place on record on behalf of the Committee the outstanding efforts and assistance that we received from Mr Ron Wiber, the secretary; Maureen Weeks, the research officer; and Anne-Mari Poirrier, the steno-secretary. There are a number of issues that I did not raise this afternoon because of time constraints . They are issues such as the stability of the current regime that rules Saudi Arabia; the possibility of the Straits of Hormuz being blocked by the sinking of super-tankers-an issue which members of the Committee felt it was not possible to cover but which many Press and newspaper reports continually put forward as a possibility in time of war; and the Iran-Iraq war. We hope that this report, along with the issues I have just mentioned, will be brought back by the Government for a full debate in the Budget session. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

Although I have not opposed these works, I believe certain conditions need to be met. These are largely the same as those I outlined regarding the upgrading for domestic wide-bodied aircraft. I would like to reiterate these conditions. Firstly, I believe that tangible and positive steps must be taken now by the Commonwealth and State governments for the construction of a new airport, preferably in a sparsely populated outer area. Secondly, I believe the construction of an international terminal should be deferred at least pending the issue of a provisional master plan and draft environmental impact statement for public comment and the completion of a final impact statement and master plan. It is also vital that the present curfew be maintained and more rigorously enforced to ensure that nearby residents do not suffer any further discomfort.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The final point I make concerns the actions of the Tonkin Liberal Government. With an election due in South Australia later this year or early in 1983, the State Liberal Government is desperate to complete the international facilities at Adelaide Airport. That Government sees this as an easy way of winning votes and wants to use it to turn people's attention away from its own miserable performance. I repeat that these works should not go ahead until the completion of a final environmental impact statement and master plan. Furthermore, international air services should not go ahead until the facilities have been completed. It is imperative that the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) not succumb to any pressure exerted by Mr Tonkin or any of his cronies. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>In order to reduce the time stricture on the Senate and, I think, with the agreement of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), who has seen the second reading speech, I seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to bring about the preservation of all existing rainforest in Australia. To achieve this, the bill provides for the Commonwealth to give financial assistance to the States, subject to the compliance of each State with the provisions of the agreement, equal to one half of the cost of preservation incurred by the State. That is, the Commonwealth would supply a grant of one dollar for every dollar provided by each State to implement the preservation of its rainforests. </PARA>
<PARA> In return for this grant, the State would be obliged to cease the granting of all licences and permits to log rainforest; to repurchase existing licences and permits; to include rainforests in national parks; to encourage the re-equipment of timber mills to handle timbers other than rainforest timbers; to undertake re -afforestation of cleared lands to provide alternative timber supplies; and to assist in the transportation of alternative timbers to timber mills. </PARA>
<PARA> The period allowed for implementation of this agreement is two years. I feel that this is the minimum practical period for such a large undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA> I am earnestly hoping that this bill will be a matter of consensus between all political parties. Everyone agrees that our surviving rainforest, only one- quarter of that which was here at the time of European settlement, is an essential part of the National Estate. </PARA>
<PARA> Although rainforest covers less than 10 per cent of the earth's surface, it provides habitat for nearly half the world's plants and animal species. As the Australian Heritage Commission points out, rainforests are among the world's richest gene banks and their economic potentiality has yet to be fully explored. Rainforests may well be the source of new drugs, resins, fibres and foods, as they have been in the past. Rainforests are also, undoubtedly, one of the most beautiful natural environments. As an aesthetic resource, they are invaluable. </PARA>
<PARA> One of my main aims when deciding on the wording of this Bill, was to ensure that no unemployment of timber workers would result from its implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last decade, there has been a decline of 18 per cent in the number of people employed in forestry and forest-based industries-a total of over 19,600 positions. Under existing contracts almost all rainforest in New South Wales alone will have disappeared by 1992. The industry will be thrown into utter chaos, and thousands more jobs will be lost, without a reasonable scheme to change over to other timbers. This Bill would provide that scheme in time to preserve those jobs as well as the rainforest. </PARA>
<PARA> If our descendants are to be able to enjoy and utilise this most beautiful and useful environment, we must act now. Regeneration of rainforest takes thousands of years. If we log any more of our rainforest we are virtually wiping out the result of sixty million years of evolution; converting it to school desks, timber veneers and paper packaging. </PARA>
<PARA> World-wide, rainforest is currently being logged at the rate of 30 hectares per minute. In 85 years there will be no accessible rainforest left anywhere in the world except in tiny pockets of national parks which may or may not be ecologically viable as autonomic environments. </PARA>
<PARA> The preservation of rainforests is considered to be an international priority by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the Worlds Wildlife Fund (WWF). I sincerely trust that it will also be a priority for Australia and that honourable senators of all political persuasions will support this bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I commend this bill to the Senate. </PARA>

Firstly, I thank the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) for permitting me to consult with a parliamentary draftsman. I thank the First Parliamentary Counsel for his invaluable assistance. I also express my thanks to those of my colleagues who scrutinised the Bill before its presentation in this chamber. I have previously expressed my gratitude to those honourable senators who participated in the debate. I extend that gratitude to those honourable members in the House of Representatives who spoke on the Bill. In particular, I thank the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, Mr Lionel Bowen, and the honourable member for Griffith, Mr Humphreys, for their assistance. I sat in the gallery of the House of Representatives last night when the Bill was being debated. Although I did not agree with some of the comments made by the honourable member for Dawson, Mr Braithwaite, I still thank him for taking an interest in the Bill . A matter which I wish to stress is that although the Bill was a private members Bill it would not have had any chance of success if other honourable senators in this chamber, honourable members in the other place and parliamentary officers had not provided their invaluable assistance.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>HOME DEPOSITS ASSISTANCE BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> The Home Deposit Assistance Bill 1982 gives effect to the Government's promise, announced by the Treasurer on 18 March 1982, to introduce an improved deposit assistance scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides for replacement of the Home Savings Grant Scheme, which since its inception in 1964 has given valuable assistance to first home buyers. In all, approximately $450m has been made available to more than 600,000 first home buyers under the Scheme. I will be introducing concurrently separate legislation to provide for the winding up of that Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill recognises the valuable assistance the Home Savings Grant Scheme has given to people over the years in that it draws on many of the provisions of that Scheme. However, to increase the effectiveness of this form of deposit assistance, the Bill will provide for a new, means-tested Home Deposit Assistance Scheme to help low and middle income earners, married or single, when they buy or build their first home. </PARA>
<PARA> In adopting features of the old Scheme, we have recognised that some anomalies existed and the Bill now before the Senate has been designed to remove those anomalies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Home Deposit Assistance Scheme is a major element in the government's new housing package. The package also includes measures to enable banks to make an additional $400m available for housing loans, a tax rebate on home loan interest , and a Mortgage and Rent Relief Scheme. Negotiations with the States on the Mortgage and Rent Relief Scheme are underway and the Minister for Housing and Construction expects to introduce legislation for that Scheme in the Budget Sittings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before the Senate provides for the Commonwealth to pay grants to people buying or building their first home on or after 18 March 1982, who have saved towards their home in certain specified forms-basically those which form the pool of long term housing finance-and who satisfy the specified eligibility criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be no waiting period for the payment of these grants. </PARA>
<PARA> The Scheme, with its income-based means test, will direct grants to people, especially single income families with dependent children, who have the greatest difficulty in acquiring a home. </PARA>
<PARA> That maximum basic grant will be $2,500, an increase of $500 on the old scheme. Grants of $1 will be paid for each $1 of eligible savings, rather than $1 for each $3. There will no longer be any limit on the value of homes which qualify. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Home Deposit Assistance Scheme is designed to ensure that Government assistance to overcome the deposit gap is better directed to low and middle income earners and is available at the time of purchase. Mr President, this new Scheme is an honest attempt to help people into home ownership. I hope that its benefits are not whittled away by increases in housing and land costs, especially increases associated with unreasonable wage demands. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like now to summarise for honourable senators the main features of the new Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Home Deposit Assistance Scheme will operate with effect from 18 March 1982 to provide assistance to people buying or building their first home by contract made on or after that date. Owner-builders commencing to build on or after that date will also be included. </PARA>
<PARA> Eligible applicants will be able to qualify for a tax free grant of up to $3, 500, made up of a savings based grant of up to $2,500 and a Family Bonus of $500 for one dependent child and $1,000 for two or more dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA> Previously the Family Bonus has been available only in respect of dependent children in the custody, care and control of applicants at the date of the contract for the home. An anomalous position has resulted in that a family whose child is born one day before the contract date receives the Bonus yet a family whose child is born one day after does not receive this assistance. Further, the Government recognises that many people take steps to acquire a home of their home as soon as they learn that they are expecting a child. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, under the new Scheme the Family Bonus will be paid to applicants where a child is born or otherwise comes into their custody, care and control within ten months after the home contract date. Reference in the Bill to a period of eleven months reflects that under the Social Services Act family allowance may not be payable in the month of birth. As entitlement to a Family Bonus is linked in the Bill to receipt of family allowance, it is necessary to specify a period of eleven months. </PARA>
<PARA> Qualifying homes may be new or established and will not be subject to any value limit. </PARA>
<PARA> Applicants for these grants will be expected to reside in the home as their principal place of residence within a reasonable time after its acquisition. It is not intended to assist with the acquisition of a home used solely for investment purposes or as a holiday home. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I am aware that people in transient occupations, for example teachers, ministers of religion, policemen and defence personnel, do not always have the opportunity to acquire their own homes and take up residence straight away. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will enable regard to be had to circumstance such as location or nature of employment preventing immediate occupancy of the home. In this way people in transient jobs will not be disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> Applicants under the new Home Deposit Assistance Scheme may be married or single, young or old. There will be no upper age limit but eligible applicants must be at least 16 years of age, or married or engaged, at the date of entering into the home contract. Under the Scheme it replaces there was a minimum age limit of 18 years. In practice that limit has led to the exclusion of some people deserving assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> An applicant's spouse, legal or de facto, and any other person who has joined in the home acquisition, must join in the application for a grant. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme is intended to assist people buying their first home. Accordingly, where one partner has previously owned a home, but remarried and purchased again the couple will not be eligible for assistance. However there is provision for previous ownership to be disregarded in cases where the dwelling was not the person's principal place of residence. </PARA>
<PARA> The means test will apply to the combined taxable income of all applicants for the financial year preceding home purchase and will be related to the Statistician's figure for Average Weekly Earnings for that year. A full grant, subject to qualifying savings, will be payable where the weekly average of the taxable income or combined taxable income for that year does not exceed a figure which is approximately 135 per cent of A.W.E. No grant will be payable where combined taxable income exceeds a figure approximately 155 per cent of A.W.E. These limits are expressed in the legislation as annual income rounded up to the nearest $100. </PARA>
<PARA> For people buying a home during the current financial year, the combined taxable income of husband and wife or other joint applicants, for the financial year 1980-81-which is the income year against which they will generally be tested-will be assessed against limits of $18,900 and $21,700. That is to say, subject to qualifying savings, a full grant will be payable where the combined taxable income is $18,000 or less. Where it falls between $18,900 and $21,700 the amount of the grant otherwise payable will be reduced proportionately. </PARA>
<PARA> No grant will be made where the combined taxable income exceeds the upper limit . </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the income limits for subsequent financial years to be provided in the regulations. This will allow the rounding of the income limit amounts, and will also allow for appropriate adjustment to be made in the event of any change in the basis of measuring the A.W.E. Series. It is the Government' s intention to introduce an appropriate regulation each year prior to 1 July which will set the limits in respect of the income year drawing to a close. Those limits will be approximately 135 per cent and 155 per cent of Average Weekly Earnings based on information published to that date by the Statistician.</PARA>
<PARA> The amount of the Family Bonus payable will not be subject to this means test taper. If applications are entitled to only a minimum basic grant they will still be eligible for the full Family Bonus. </PARA>
<PARA> Where there has been a significant change in family circumstances since the previous financial year, the Bill provides the power to have regard to those changed circumstances for the purposes of the means test. </PARA>
<PARA> Where an applicant has withdrawn from the workforce in the period between the end of the last financial year and the date of home acquisition, and where there is no current intention or immediate prospect of rejoining the workforce, only a proportion of the taxable income will be tested. For example, if one partner stops work 6 months before home purchase, only half of that person's income for the previous financial year will be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> This arrangement would apply to cases such as women ceasing work to have children, or people leaving the workforce because of invalidity, or some other circumstance where the duration of the period out of the workforce can be established with some precision. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of other circumstances of reduced income, subsequent to the financial year being means-tested, and which are beyond the control of the applicant, a provisional grant of 80 per cent, plus 100 per cent of the Family Bonus where applicable, will be paid, based on the applicant's expected taxable income for the current year. An adjustment will be made later on the basis of the actual taxable income for the current year. </PARA>
<PARA> Only cases of genuine decline in the financial fortunes of applicants will be considered, such as unemployment, injury leading to a change in employment, impact of a natural disaster, and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> The necessary amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act to permit the Commissioner of Taxation or a person authorised by him to communicate information to the Secretary to the Department of Housing and Construction for the purposes of the administration of this legislation, are contained in the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the savings requirements, applicants must have held savings in one or more of the approved forms for at least one year immediately before the date of the home contract. </PARA>
<PARA> The grant will be paid on the basis of one dollar for every dollar held in an acceptable form. The maximum basic grant of $2,500, subject to the means test, will be paid where there have been two or more complete years of saving; a grant of up to $1,250 will be payable where there has been only one complete year of saving. I would like to stress that savings carried over from previous years will be taken into account. If an eligible person has saved say an average of $ 500 over each of the past 5 years and has total savings of $2,500 by the date of home purchase, a full grant would be payable. </PARA>
<PARA> However, only an increase of up to $1,500 in savings held in the year preceding home acquisition will count towards a grant. This is to ensure that a person will not benefit from a deposit of moneys that would not be regarded as normal savings within the intention of the Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of the Family Bonus will not be dependent on the amount of acceptable savings held. Even if only a minimum grant is payable, a full Family Bonus will be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal forms of saving acceptable under the new Scheme include deposits with savings banks, building societies and credit unions, fixed deposits with trading banks, Australian Savings Bonds purchased as Inscribed Stock or for safe custody with a bank, and payments in connection with the home acquisition, made on or before the contract date, such as for the land, for building materials or for legal fees. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of savings banks now offer facilities whereby depositors may draw cheques on their savings accounts. The Bill recognises this development and accepts such accounts as savings for the purposes of the Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Moneys held in trust on behalf of an applicant which are held or expended by the trustee in an acceptable form, and which are clearly identifiable as moneys held on behalf of the applicant, will be accepted as savings. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous scheme required all parties to an application to be Australian citizens or to have permanent resident status at the date of entering into the contract for the home. This requirement has led to anomalous situations in a number of cases. Take the example of a migrant husband who has set up a home in anticipation of his family's arrival. If his wife had not reached Australia and attained citizenship or resident status before the contract date, she would not be eligible and the family would not be entitled to a grant. This Bill provides for a grant to be payable once the applicant, or at least one of the joint applicants, becomes an Australian citizen or a permanent resident, irrespective of whether this occurs before or after the contract date. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill includes a 'sunset' clause which means that the scheme will cease after three years unless new legislation is enacted. This will allow the Government to reassess the effectiveness of the Scheme in the light of prevailing circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Printed explanatory material and application forms are being produced for early and widespread distribution. </PARA>
<PARA> Co-operation of savings institutions and industry groups which have direct contact with home seekers has been requested to ensure that there is the widest possible awareness of the benefits of the Home Deposit Assistance Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill enables the Government to continue to encourage and assist people into home ownership. It will provide a more equitable and effective distribution of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>HOMES SAVINGS GRANT ACTS AMENDMENT BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides for the termination of the Homes Savings Grant Scheme, to be replaced by the Home Deposit Assistance Scheme for which I have just introduced the enabling legislation, that is, the Home Deposit Assistance Bill 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The Homes Savings Grant Scheme was established in 1964 under a Liberal-Country Party Government, by the Homes Savings Grant Act 1964. We reintroduced it in a much widened form, to apply from 1 January 1977, by the Homes Savings Grant Act 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, since the Homes Savings Grant Scheme first came into operation more than 600,000 grants valued at some $450m have been approved for payment to people buying or building their first homes. However, following a recent review of our housing policies, the Government has decided to increase the Scheme's effectiveness with revised arrangements which are more in tune with current needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Homes Savings Grant Act 1975, introduced by the Whitlam Government, sought to phase out the Homes Savings Grant Scheme. Accordingly, eligibility under the 1964 Act ceased in respect of homes acquired after 31 December 1976. Only a handful of outstanding applications under that Act have been received during the past 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides that applications for assistance under the 1964 Act will not be accepted beyond the date the Home Deposit Assistance Bill 1982 receives Royal Assent. </PARA>
<PARA> Eligibility under the 1976 Act relates to homes acquired by contract dated 1 January 1977 or later. This Bill terminates eligibility where the contract to buy or build a home is made after the date on which the Home Deposit Assistance Bill 1982 receives Royal Assent. </PARA>
<PARA> Applications will be accepted for one month after the date eligibility is terminated. However, the Government recognises the difficulty people living in remote areas might experience in obtaining the necessary application documents. Accordingly the Bill provides that a written notification within that month of an intention to apply will be accepted provided a formal application is lodged within one further month. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Home Deposit Assistance Scheme arrangements apply from 18 March 1982. From that date, until the new Scheme receives Royal Assent, the two schemes will operate side by side. People who enter into a contract before the new scheme receives Royal Assent and who, as a result of the operation of the means test, may not be eligible under the new scheme, will have an opportunity to apply under the Homes Savings Grant Scheme. They should lodge their application as promptly as possible and certainly within one month of the date of Royal Assent to the new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will publicise the cut-off date widely and I strongly urge people who have bought their first home and who have not yet lodged an application to do so promptly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Homes Savings Grant Scheme has served Australian home buyers well. It is being repealed to make way for a replacement scheme which draws on many of the provisions of the existing Scheme but will increase the effectiveness of this form of deposit assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to provide for amendments to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977 to strengthen the Corporation's control over Australia's export meat trade. The Bill will also enable the Corporation, in certain circumstances, to adopt the role of a sole trader or to limit the number of licensees that may trade with particular overseas markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that last year penalties for the contravention of licence conditions were significantly increased. In this Bill further penalties have been included and other existing penalties raised to realistic levels. </PARA>
<PARA> In proposing these amendments to the Act, the Minister for Primary Industry has uppermost in his mind the need to maintain and uphold the reputation and integrity of our meat export industry. Recent events, especially cases of meat substitution and some incidents involving complaints about the quality of Australian meat have highlighted the need for the changes. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australia is to remain competitive on world meat and livestock markets, it is absolutely vital that our industry meet the requirements of overseas buyers. Australia's product must conform precisely to contract specifications. It must be labelled properly and be free from contamination. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill seeks to achieve these objectives by extending the powers of the AMLC so that it is properly equipped to carry out its major functions-the protection, development and promotion of our overseas meat trade. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes contained in this Bill have been recommended by the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation, which represents the producing, processing and exporting sectors of the meat and livestock industry, and have also been sought, actively, by producer organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The vast majority of Australian meat processors and exporters are beyond reproach in their business dealings. However there is a small minority which has engaged in unacceptable practices and in the process has brought the reputation of our industry into question. This legislation is designed to ensure that this minority can no longer bring the industry into disrepute. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hoped that this legislation will also serve to remind all exporters of the responsibilities they have to the industry as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Separate legislation-the Export Control Bill-is being introduced to cover matters associated with the preparation, grading and trade description of exports of food for human consumption. That legislation, and its regulations concerning the preparation of meat for export, will complement the provisions proposed in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The main instrument available to the Corporation in controlling exports is the export licence. All existing licenses will be withdrawn when the Bill is proclaimed. People, including existing licensees, seeking a licence to export meat or livestock will have to apply to the Corporation and will have to meet the new criteria set out in the Bill. The objective is to ensure that only people of integrity, competence and sound financial standing are in possession of export licences. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the meat substitution issue last year the Minister for Primary Industry received requests from the industry that people and firms preparing meat for export should be licensed by the Corporation. The industry's concern arose because of limitations in the Act which prevented the AMLC taking action against the packer in cases where the packer did not export himself but sold to a licensee who bought 'sight unseen'. Under the AMLC Act the offending party was the exporter. </PARA>
<PARA> However, an examination of their proposal has shown up some practical difficulties in implementing such an arrangement in the AMLC's legislation. An alternative approach has therefore been adopted. The Export Control Bill requires all premises in which meat is prepared for export to be registered by the Department of Primary Industry. Under that Bill regulations may be made which will require the holder of the registration to be a fit and proper person. The criteria for a fit and proper person under that Bill will be similar to that which must be met by an applicant for a licence under this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will enable the corporation to ensure that meat and livestock for export are prepared in accordance with the buyer, quality and other specifications. Under the Export Control Bill the packer of meat will be required to conform with conditions concerning the health of the product, its grading and trade descriptions. The provision contained in each Bill will complement each other and ensure that neither the packer nor the exporter will be able to escape his responsibilities in regard to the preparation of the meat or in meeting buyer specifications. </PARA>
<PARA> The linking of the two Bills will enable the Department of Primary Industry and the AMLC to co-operate to ensure adequate control of all matters from the preparation to the export of the meat. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also clarifies the powers of the AMLC to suspend or cancel a licence and strengthens the Corporation's powers to obtain the information needed to assess whether the licensee is conforming to the conditions of his licence. </PARA>

<PARA> A further major amendment proposed in this Bill is to give the ALMC power to engage in sole trading subject to the approval of the Minister. On several occasions recently, private exporters and ultimately producers have been disadvantaged in dealing with countries with single purchasing authorities. The monopoly power of these single buying organisations can be used to distort the operations of the market place and in some circumstances can have a depressing effect on prices received by exporters and producers. </PARA>
<PARA> As an example of the problems that can occur, late last year, a licensee tendered to a single import agency at 11-13 cents per kilogram below the then current equivalent U.S. price at which other licensees quoted. The licensee was awarded approximately 80 per cent of the tender, even though at the time of his offer he had no firm contracts for supply of beef from Australia meat processors . About the time the licensee sought supplies of beef, livestock prices fell. This is one example of practices which have led the Corporation and producers to request that the AMLC be empowered to sole trade or restrict the number of licensees that may quote to a market. </PARA>
<PARA> To implement the industry's request the Bill permits the AMLC to be the sole trader or restrict the number of licensees where there is a single buyer which controls all or substantially all of the imports into a country and where there is a need to ensure a fair return to producers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation's existing trading powers allow it to trade but do not permit it to exclude licensees from quoting or selling to the same market. Under these current provisions the Corporation could find itself in competition with private Australian exporters unless they voluntarily withdrew from the market or unless the foreign buyer chose to deal only with the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal for the Corporation to limit the number of licensees who may export to a particular market is simply another means of offsetting the monopoly power available to some buyers. Other Australian licensees or meat processors will be able to supply meat to the licensee or licensees trading with the market concerned. However, once the arrangement is implemented only the designated licensee or licensees will be permitted to export to the market. </PARA>
<PARA> It is emphasised that the exercise of these new trading powers by the Corporation will be limited to circumstances where it is confronted by a monopoly buyer which the Corporation judges is distorting normal market forces and the use of the power will be subject to Ministerial approval. </PARA>
<PARA> The current system of meat trading, based on free market principles and involving some 260 private operators licensed to export meat and livestock, operates reasonably well in normal trading circumstances. However, logic and common sense demand that we do not let a situation continue where the Australian industry, both producers and exporters, could sustain losses in the face of the market-distorting effects of sole buying authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes that the AMLC be given the power to engage in futures trading for livestock or meat, subject to Ministerial approval. Futures trading is a normal commercial technique which should be available to the Corporation if it decides to trade. The intention is to enable the AMLC to hedge price risks through trading on Australian or overseas futures markets. The power has been made subject to Ministerial approval in order to ensure that the approach the Corporation takes, if and when it decides to use the futures market, is consistent with its position as a statutory authority. </PARA>
<PARA> In his statement to the Parliament on 8 September 1981 on the meat substitution issue, the Minister clearly stated the Government's resolve to close loopholes which had enabled such fraudulent activities to occur and to implement a system which would ensure that the reputation of the Australian meat and livestock industry was restored to the high level it had previously enjoyed. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed in the Bill and the associated Export Control Bill are clear evidence of the Government's determination in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA>Export Control Bills</PARA>

<PARA>Export Control Bills</PARA>
<PARA>EXPORT CONTROL BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to establish a new and comprehensive legislative base for the export inspection and control responsibilities within the portfolio of the Minister for Primary Industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Under existing arrangements, export inspection powers are drawn from the Customs Act 1901 and the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905. This has created a number of administrative and legal weaknesses. </PARA>
<PARA> Although these could be overcome by amending the existing legislation, the Government has taken the view that the most appropriate long term response is to develop new and separate export inspection legislation which ensures a more efficient and flexible legal framework. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the application of export controls to goods specified in regulations; spells out inspection responsibilities and the authority of inspection staff to carry out these responsibilities; and sets penalties to apply in the case of fraud or deliberate malpractice. </PARA>
<PARA> While the inspection powers under the Bill are to be exercised by officers of the Department of Primary Industry, the Bill also provides for the Secretary of the Department to authorize carriage of such powers as are appropriate by other people. This is to cover the situation where officers of other Commonwealth and State instrumentalities, and in certain instances people under contract, carry out specific or specialised inspection functions on behalf of the Department of Primary Industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Powers provided include all those necessary to ensure compliance with the relevant conditions and restrictions. These include appropriate powers of entry and search; powers to detail vehicles, ships or aircraft for this purpose; and powers to seize products within the scope of the controls. </PARA>
<PARA> Side by side with these powers are a range of safeguards to avoid abuses by inspection staff. Entry into premises, other than registered premises, can take place only with the consent of the occupier, or in pursuance of a warrant issued by a Justice of the Peace, who must be convinced of the need for entry. A time limit is to be placed on the currency of warrants. Powers of search of vehicles, ships or aircraft are tied to a requirement that authorised officers produce their identity cards. Similarly, people are not required to assist authorised officers in their duties unless such proof of identity is produced. Provisions are also included imposing a limit on the time seized goods can be held unless proceedings are instituted and also for the release, as appropriate, of such goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Strict penalties are provided for breaches of the conditions of the Bill and associated regulations. Major penalties of $100,000 or 5 years imprisonment or both apply to the exportation of prescribed goods in contravention of specified requirements; for the use of false trade descriptions; and for unlawful interference with, or forgery of, official marks. Where appropriate, however, it will be possible to proceed against such offences by summary jurisdiction with lesser maximum penalties of $5,000 or 12 months imprisonment or both. </PARA>
<PARA> The maximum penalty of $100,000 or 5 years imprisonment or both is the same as that which was approved by Parliament in the 1981 Budget Session following the meat substitution issue. Its inclusion in this Bill will ensure that such a penalty applies to all export inspection and control activities under the Minister for Primary Industry's responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, this Bill widens the coverage of the penalty by making it an offence for false trade descriptions to be applied to documentation, and for registered establishments to have in their possession an official inspection stamp without authorisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also increases the size of the penalty for a range of other offences, such as failure to submit a notice of intention to export (up from $40 to $2,000 or 12 months imprisonment, or both), and failure to provide assistance to, or the obstruction of, inspection staff (up from $100 to $1000 or 6 months imprisonment, or both). </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1981 Budget Session a penalty of $100,000 or 5 years imprisonment or both was introduced for false and misleading statements in declarations furnished in respect of meat. This was to ensure that the maximum penalty applied to offences relating to matters such as the exporter, species, age and slaughter dates which were not covered by existing trade description provisions. These are, however, descriptive matters which are more appropriately located under the trade description requirements. The Bill broadens the definition of trade description to encompass such matters and, as mentioned previously, the application of a false trade description has been extended to documentation. Offences against these matters still, therefore, attract a penalty of $100,000 or 5 years imprisonment or both. </PARA>
<PARA> The false declarations provision in the Bill will cover minor breaches only and the penalty has been set at a level appropriate to this offence. The penalty of $2,000 or 12 months imprisonment or both is the level of penalty generally established in Commonwealth legislation for offences of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two new penalty provisions in the Bill. First a fine of up to $50,000 for breaches of licencing provisions, such as those that exist for woodchips. It will, however, be possible to proceed against such an offence by summary jurisdiction with a maximum penalty of $5,000. Second a penalty of up to $2,000 or 12 months imprisonment or both for providing any authorised officer, including officers of the Department of Primary Industry, with goods prepared or treated at a registered establishment unless the person in whose name the establishment is registered has the written approval of the Secretary of the Department of Primary Industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of authorised officers receiving produce either free or at prices below those available to the general public has been raised several times in evidence before the Royal Commission into the Meat Industry. It is a practice which the Minister for Primary Industry has decided must be stopped. </PARA>
<PARA> Concurrent with the penalties set out in Clause 24 of the Bill, which apply to those who offer cheap products, the full force of the provisions of the Public Service Act will apply to Commonwealth staff who accept such products. </PARA>
<PARA> This change in policy will be notified to all Establishments and authorised officers. The only conditions under which the Secretary of the Department of Primary Industry will approve Establishments to sell products to authorised officers is where they have a discrete and separate facility for selling to the public, where the price to those officers is the same as that available to the general public and where the transaction is backed by a receipt which describes the product, price and the purchase date. This approval will be tied to the annual re-registration process with which all establishments must comply and will be strictly enforced by the Compliance Unit now being established in the Department of Primary Industry's new Export Inspection Service. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is the first fundamental step in providing an appropriate legal basis for export inspection in the 80's and will be backed by new regulations and a system of Ministerial Orders which will allow changing requirements and conditions to be responded to quickly. These regulations and orders are now being drafted. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>EXPORT CONTROL (MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS) BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill sets out amendments to other legislation which are consequential to the passage and proclamation of the Export Control Bill 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Its main features are that it cuts the link between the Minister for Primary Industry's export inspection responsibilities and the Customs Act 1901 and the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905. It also repeals the Meat Export ( Penalties) Act 1981 and the higher penalties for all foods which were incorporated in the Customs and Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Acts following the meat substitution issue. These higher penalties are now covered by the Export Control Bill. This Bill is to come into operation on the same day as the Export Control Bill 1982. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill provides for an increase in the salary of the next Governor-General after he is sworn in July. By section 3 of the Constitution it is provided that the salary of the Governor-General shall not be altered during his continuance in office. Thus the salary fixed at the commencement of a Governor-General's appointment must remain unaltered during the period of his office. It means that the salary of the Governor-General cannot be indexed or otherwise changed during his term of office, even if his appointment is extended . It is necessary then for the salary for a new Governor-General to be set at a level which will be commensurate with his office and on a fair and reasonable basis, on the understanding that it will continue at that level during his incumbency of the position and over a period of years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Governor-General Act 1974 was introduced by the Labor Government and provided for a salary of $30,000. It was amended in 1977 to increase the salary to $37,000. It is now proposed that the Governor-General's salary be $70,000-a salary that will remain unchanged through the period of the next Governor- General's appointment. </PARA>
<PARA> The salary set for the Governor-General by the Labor Government in 1974 put the salary of the Governor-General considerably ahead of the salary of the Chief Justice of the High Court on a tax free basis. The Government is now proposing a salary of $70,000 for the new Governor-General bearing in mind the relationships and movements in the salary of the Chief Justice and CPI increases since 1974, and the need to establish a salary which must, by the terms of the Constitution, remain fixed for some years ahead. The salary of the Chief Justice is also the yardstick referred to in section 4 of the Governor-General Act 1974 for determining the pension payable to a former Governor-General or his spouse. The current gross salary for the Chief Justice is $87,000. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1974 the then Prime Minister put forward some important principles as applying to consideration by the Parliament of the Governor-General's remuneration. They were that the Governor-General's salary should be dealt with in a non-party way; that the salary should recognise the importance and place of his high office; and that the appointment of a Governor-General should not depend on personal wealth or the availability of other income. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government Parties, then in opposition, strongly supported these principles and still do. They were restated by this Government on introduction of the 1977 Bill. I would now like to commend those principles, first enunciated by Mr Whitlam, again as a basis for the current proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity to speak to the first reading of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1981-82 on a matter which has caused me grave concern since the debate in this chamber on Thursday of last week on General Business Notice of Motion No. 15 standing in my name and dealing with cheap home loans to Ministers. It is not my intention to canvass that debate, apart from posing a few questions to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner), because that debate will come on again on the first Thursday after the Senate resumes sitting. It will, I hope, have some priority on the Notice Paper. I will then have the opportunity of rebutting many of the things that the Minister said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another matter causes me grave concern. On 18 November last year I placed the following question on notice. I asked a question of the Minister representing the Minister for the Capital Territory. That Minister happens to be Senator Messner, who took part in the debate last Thursday night. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) How many people in the Australian Capital Territory are in receipt of long term Commonwealth Home Loans at interest rates fixed at 6.25 per cent per annum, or lower. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) What income brackets are these people in and what are the terms and interest rates applicable to each income bracket. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Are any of the recipients Cabinet Ministers, if so what are their names and the terms and interest rates applicable to their respective loans. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) How many persons, if any, in each of the States were able to obtain the same generous long term low-interest provisions of the Commonwealth Home Loans. </PARA>
<PARA>It is just six months, nearly to the day, since I put that question on notice. I am still waiting for an answer. Yet in the debate on 29 April in the Senate, which I have just spoken about, on my notice of motion concerning these cheap home loans, Senator Messner, in rebuttal of some of the remarks that I made, said:</PARA>
<PARA> I know that Senator McLaren mentioned one or two people who had low interest loans in the Australian Capital Territory but I note that there were many others . In fact, 5,900 people in the Australian Capital Territory--</PARA>
<PARA>My interjection was:</PARA>
<PARA> Not Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Messner went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I will come to that in a moment. In the Australian Capital Territory 5,900 people have benefited from this concession. </PARA>
<PARA>The question I pose today is: Why is it that the Minister can use those figures in a debate when I have had that question on the Notice Paper for six months now and I have not yet received an answer? I think it is a gross abuse of the forms of this House that he has not provided me with that answer, yet he must have it because he used it in that debate. I am now requesting that I be provided with the complete answer to question No. 1600 before we enter into the debate in the Committee of the Whole dealing with the appropriations for the Australian Capital Territory. If I have not got that answer I will do as I have done on previous occasions: I will persist in this chamber until I get the answer, as I had to persist in the Committee stage of the Budget Bill last year. It was a long, drawn-out procedure before the Minister-the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle)-who was in charge of the Bill saw fit to provide me with a document which, in fact, made public the fact that Mr Nixon and Mr Anthony were in receipt of those home loans. Of course, Senator Messner mentioned some others in the debate the other night. I have the relevant document. I have another document, too, which I will not use now; I will use it when that debate resumes. I am asking the Minister now that I be provided with the answer that I am seeking before we go into the Committee of the Whole to consider the appropriations for the Australian Capital Territory when we resume in the week after next. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other thing that I want to refer to. Despite the fact that the Senate, by vote, agreed to the change of sitting hours, I have been told in the corridors that some agreement was entered into that no quorums or divisions would be called on Thursdays. I have no jurisdiction over divisions but I am not bound by any agreement entered into on the calling of quorums. It is now almost 1.30 p.m.; we have been in the chamber since 10 o'clock. Some honourable senators had to attend committee meetings earlier today, as we did yesterday; some of us were here at 7.30 a.m. to attend committee hearings. We did not get away until midnight last night. If honourable senators look at the Government benches they will see that there are two honourable senators there. They are the ones who in the main supported the new sitting times; my party did, too. Some of the Ministers opposed it. I am happy to say that Senator Tate and I stuck up for good trade union principles that we do not take away hard-won gains and the lunch hours of workers. I claim that we in this place are workers. We find now that all of those people who voted for the change are away enjoying their lunches. Those of us who wanted to speak on reports or papers being tabled who had our names down to speak in the first reading debate and who have our names down to speak in the debate on another Bill do not know just when the debates will come on. So we have to sit here. Once again we have to go without our lunch . </PARA>
<PARA> Today the sitting hours of the Senate are 10 a.m. until 7 o'clock tonight. If honourable senators are interested in a Bill they cannot leave the place because they never know when it will come on. I say here and now, as I said during the debate on the recommendations of the Senate Standing Orders Committee to change the sitting hours, that I am not bound by any agreement not to call quorums. Conventions have been broken in this place quite a few times since I first came to it. I well recall the conventions, which are far more important than some agreement about the calling of quorums, which were broken in 1975. So honourable senators who are sitting in the dining room enjoying their lunch while I have to stay in this chamber in case the Roads Grants Amendment Bill comes on should not be disappointed if they have to leave their steaks half eaten and their meals are cold when they return. As I have said, I am free to call a quorum at any time I may see fit. I advise the Government and members of my own party that I will not be bound by the agreement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, I must make one point perfectly clear to you and to this chamber. You mentioned that you were advising the Government. I think that your advice should be directed to the Senate chamber. The decision relating to sitting hours was a Senate decision made as a result of a recommendation from the Senate Standing Orders Committee. I think that should be on the record so that it is clearly understood. Many responsible honourable senators on both sides of the chamber are members of the standing committee which made the recommendation to this Senate as a whole. That recommendation was agreed to by the Senate chamber. I am not passing any comment on your statements; I am just making the position clear in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>

Whilst that recommendation came from the Standing Orders Committee, as you said, Mr President, a vote was taken- a free vote I might add-of all members of the Senate and the great majority of them voted for the changed sitting hours. I am saying that those honourable senators who voted to take away a person's rights to have an hour's meal break should have no objection, if they are enjoying their meal break and some of us cannot enjoy it, to being interrupted and called back here because a quorum has been called. I take note of what you have said to me, Mr President.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity in the first reading debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1981-82 to draw to the attention of the Senate a problem which has concerned me increasingly for a number of years. I am getting increasingly bad reports about the treatment and limited service that Australian nationals receive from Australian embassies around the world. I imagine that just about everybody who has been overseas or who knows somebody overseas has some kind of anecdote to tell about the problems that they have faced in a country that they have visited or that they have heard that others have faced overseas. Clearly, not all of these situations are reprehensible or require looking into, but what is bothering me at the moment is that far too many people are saying to me in passing at social functions or when visiting me in my office that they are unhappy about the treatment that they have received at the hands of staff in Australian embassies overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The specific case that I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate today is that of a young couple whom I know personally and whose reports I would not question. I refer specifically to a series of incidents that they have reported because they went to the trouble of writing to me and I therefore do not have to rely on notes that I took in my office or simply on memory. With the indulgence of the Senate I will read the major part of the letter that was sent to me. It begins by asking me to ask the Federal Government to examine critically the attitudes and purpose of Australian embassies. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> Dear Senator Haines,</PARA>
<PARA> I request that the attitudes and purpose of Australian embassies be critically examined with the intention of at least bringing them in line with other foreign embassies overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the major complaints I received came from people who have been travelling in groups and have met up with people of other nationalities who have had similar problems and have received better service from their embassies than Australian nationals are receiving from their own Embassy. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> My experience with Australian embassies in overseas countries has been unsatisfactory to say the least. In order to indicate my point more clearly, I will recount some of the more recent encounters with Australian embassies. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the incidents was entirely the fault of the writer of this letter; the other one was not. Notwithstanding that, I feel that the assistance he received from the Embassy was somewhat lacking. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1980-81 I spent six months in Indonesia, four and a half months of which were without official sanction from the Indonesian authorities, that is to say, for 4 1/2 months, I did not have an official visa. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the man concerned went to Indonesia on a tourist visa and overstayed it . His letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Some five days before my departure from Indonesia--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, his eventual departure-</PARA>
<PARA>I decided to ''give myself up'' to the Indonesian Immigration Authorities, but before doing so I thought it wise to approach the Australian Embassy in Jalan Thamrin Jakarta, to inform them of my status and to seek advice. I was not seeking assistance in terms of finance at the expense of the Australian taxpayer , rather advice as to what, in the opinion of the Australian Embassy, I should do, and what they thought would happen to me as a result. Instead of receiving any real assistance, I had to suffer an incourteously delivered lecture indicating that I should not have done what I already had; a fact of which I was already quite aware. I asked as to what course of action might be best, and instead of receiving an answer to the question, was told that I would most certainly be sent to jail in addition to which I would have to pay a substantial fine. On enquiring whether or not the Australian Embassy could lend me the money to cover the fine I discovered that the monies which Australian Embassies are authorised to lend is $40, a sum which had not changed since I was in Spain seven years previously. </PARA>
<PARA> After leaving the Australian Embassy without any of my questions answered, I presented myself to the Indonesian Immigration Office in Jalan Cikini, Jakarta. The events which ensued indicated to me that the Australian Embassy knew nothing of the procedures adopted by the Indonesian Authorities and they could not be bothered finding out; both the former and the latter being their duty to Nationals. The Immigration Office did not fine me anything nor did they put me in jail as the Australian Embassy had said they would. This incident took place at the end of January 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> A second unscheduled encounter with the Australian Embassy took place on or about the 29th of December 1981, also in Jakarta. A friend and I had been travelling by train from Jakarta to Surakarta in Central Java when my friend had her handbag stolen. Included in the contents of her bag were both our passports, our travellers cheques and most of our cash monies. </PARA>
<PARA>I am prepared to accept at this point that that was a rather dumb thing to do. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> We reported the incident to the Indonesian police in Yogyakarta and returned to Jakarta two days later after borrowing money from a friend in Surakarta. </PARA>
<PARA>I have photocopies of the report that this couple filed with the Indonesian police in Yogyakarta. They are not of much use to the Senate since they are written entirely in Indonesian, but I do have them. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> We entered the Australian Embassy in Jalan Thamrin and were met with what seems to be the employees customary rudeness to Australians. Apart from the renewal of our passports, we were in need of other information, one piece being the address of a bank in Jakarta which had connections with the Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA>As the writer pointed out in an earlier sentence, the couple's travellers cheques had been stolen. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> We were instantly and confidently informed that there were no banks in Jakarta which had such a relationship; a piece of information which I found hard to believe; since I had in the past sent monies to Indonesia through the Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia Pty Ltd. The Embassy proved efficient only in renewing our passports. That is to say that they were only efficient in renewing our passports, not in giving the passports to us. We politely informed them that we had only limited money which we needed for food. They responded by asking whether the hotel in which we were staying in Jakarta required us to pay on a daily basis. We replied that due to my personal contact with the proprietor in the past, it was not necessary for us to pay on a daily basis. This seemed to provide them with sufficient information to determine that we were not destitute -(their word) and therefore could not receive our passports until we had paid the full thirty dollars each for them. 'Them' being passports valid only for 3 months. We told them that we needed the passports in order to collect and cash our renewed travellers cheques when they arrived. </PARA>
<PARA>a fact which ought to have been patently apparent to the Embassy people, even if the catch-22 situation was not-</PARA>
<PARA> For this, one passport was released under sufferance. As it happened, the passport which they released was not compatible with the first lot of travellers cheques to be renewed. </PARA>
<PARA>They released the woman's passport and it was the man whose travellers cheques arrived first-</PARA>
<PARA> Consequently more of our limited money was used because of the illinformed, intolerant stupidity of the Australian Embassy. </PARA>
<PARA>I accept that those intemperate words are probably more due to frustration than anything else. Nevertheless, the preceding events seem to indicate that the staff member or members to whom this couple went were slightly less than well informed. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> No thanks to the inefficiency and indifferent attitude of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, we managed to survive. The fact that we had to pay $30 for passports that required us to provide birth certificates and evidence of our identities in order to extend them for five years, is unjust. Surely the issuing office has records of the people to whom they issue passports, but then perhaps that is too intelligently simple for the bureaucrats involved in such activities to conceive of. It seems to me that Australian Embassies are not interested in Australians overseas and nor do they seem to have competent people on their staff. From my experience with this type of Public Service staff, people are employed because of their . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to note some inconsequential fury about Public Service staff which I do not intend to repeat to the Senate. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> When will Australians overseas be able to speak and feel towards their Embassies with the same degree of pride that one hears from travellers of other countries? The only factors Australian Embassies have which cause Australians to feel that the Embassy represents a piece of Australia, is the fact that they are closed on days which are public holidays in Australia, albeit that such days bear no significance to the country of placement of the Embassy. </PARA>
<PARA>I will accept, of course, the obvious rejoinder that the man concerned got himself into the first difficulty by illegally extending his stay in Indonesia and that the couple got themselves into the second predicament because they put all their belongings into one handbag. Of course, any tourist ought to know that that is not a particularly intelligent manoeuvre in a country such as Indonesia where handbag snatching seems to be a national pastime. I was later told that the couple was travelling on a train when this occurred and that they reported it to the guard on the train-not that it made any difference because the train did not stop. Somebody-I do not know whether it was the person concerned or somebody else-on the train chased the thief across the top of the train until he fell off. I know this is beginning to sound like something out of a B grade movie but I am assured it actually happened. Then, as the letter points out, they reported the theft to the Indonesian police as soon as they arrived at a station. </PARA>
<PARA> Bearing in mind that the vote for salaries and payments in the nature of salaries for overseas service personnel employed by the Department of Foreign Affairs was allocated in the vicinity of $60m of taxpayers' money in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1981-82, and a further $700,000 in additional appropriations in the Supplementary Estimates, one would be led to expect that the service provided to Australian nationals by those staff would be exemplary. The couple involved in this incident told me that some German travellers had bags which were tied to their beings removed. Somebody cut through the thongs. They received quite different attention from their Embassy than the lack of assistance that this couple received from the Australian Embassy. I understand that there are 82 staff members of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs in embassies in Indonesia. Of course, there are vast numbers-in excess of 2,000- in other countries around the world. I would have thought that among the first things that the staff would be educated in would be local laws and ground rules, the problems that are likely to face travellers in the country concerned and the red tape involved. For instance, the German Embassy provided a letter to the German nationals who had had their bag containing their passports and so on stolen so that they could go to the Indonesian authorities and not be arrested for selling their passports or encouraging people wanting to run drugs. That seems to be a fairly sensible measure to take in countries not noted for their democratic police methods. Surely, staff members of these embassies ought to be coached in the legal system operating within the country and be able to answer the questions that Australian nationals are likely to raise with them, leaving aside completely whether the Australian national was responsible for the mess he got himself into. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would have thought that staff members would be expected, indeed encouraged, to be courteous and helpful to Australian nationals who go to them with their problems, which may be petty, which may have been heard a million times before but which are of great moment to the nationals concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to utilise the time available to me this afternoon to raise a question relating to the situation within Telecom Australia. We are all very much aware that Telecom in recent years has been fighting with one hand tied behind its back. It has suffered restrictions both financially and by way of staff ceilings. Most of us are aware that within Telecom there is a quite substantial cross-subsidisation from profitable to non- profitable areas. In that arena there is a cross-subsidisation of around $300m from profitable areas to rural areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also mention at this juncture the announcement made by the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) in relation to the setting up of the Davidson Public Inquiry into Telecommunications Services in Australia. I was surprised to find that what appeared to me to be the only method of communication and the only method of announcement was by way of a Press release by the Minister last spring. On inquiry in my own State at Christmas time, I became very much aware that rural local government bodies in Victoria were completely unaware that this Inquiry had been set up. As I interpret the guidelines which the Minister set down for the Davidson Inquiry, one of its most drastic effects could be upon the telecommunications system in rural areas. I then found that the closing date for submissions, if I remember correctly, was 26 February. Many local government bodies found it extremely difficult because of the dates of their meetings to be able to get submissions to that Inquiry in time. Be that as it may, the Davidson Inquiry is now under way. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter I particularly wish to raise is the proposal within Telecom to close down rural manual exchanges. Proposals are afoot to close down some 23 rural manual exchanges in Australia including five in Victoria, namely those at Dromana, Frankston, Hamilton, Horsham and Swan Hill, leaving only two manual exchanges in the metropolitan area and one provincial manual exchange, at Bendigo. Any of us who live in country areas have become extremely aware of the effect that Access 80 had on the time it takes to dial a trunk number, that is, any number outside the local areas, on subscriber trunk dialling. </PARA>
<PARA> Between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. in particular one can quite easily dial for an hour and get the busy signal. So one has to sit and wait. I have had a lot of complaints made to me about this problem from elderly people who try to ring their sons and daughters and from sons and daughters who try to ring their parents over distances of 200 or 300 miles. They find that they cannot get through during this period, the fault being that there are insufficient lines to cope with the innovation of Access 80. However, by and large, I think people accept it. They say that if the matter is not urgent they will try to ring again the next night and hope that they will get through. Behind that there is also a realisation that while there is a manual exchange in the area they can dial that exchange and know full well that the operators, mainly ladies, on the switch will move both hell and high water in order to get them through. I have had the experience in an emergency of having a call from my home town of Warrnambool to Bendigo rerouted via Darwin and Alice Springs. I got through-that is the important thing-and in a very short space of time. Up until about five or six years ago, in my area anyhow, those switch girls had lines available to them only which could be utilised in an emergency. Five years ago those lines were taken out of the system. Now the switch girls have to vie with everybody else on the normal trunk route system except in the case of dire emergencies, when they may, by using codes known only to themselves, be able to break into another exchange and thus to reroute a call via that exchange and get a person through. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the sort of thing that is happening. I know for a fact that it is happening in my area; I suggest it is happening also in other areas. The phone number of the office of the State Electricity Commission of Victoria in the city of Warrnambool is 62 1177. That number is operated manually from 8 a.m. until 4.50 in the afternoon. After that one gets a recorded message advising one to ring such and such a number in Geelong. That means that after 4.50 in the afternoon, in the event of a blackout, a pole fire or whatever, one must try to ring Geelong and vie with the rest of the traffic on the trunk lines. Perhaps one would have to queue up for up to an hour to get through. If the emergency reached a certain peak, staff would be put on to the local switchboard and that number would be operated manually. But regardless of how the situation develops in that case, the original caller or complainant must ring Geelong, which is a distance of 120 miles away and vie with the rest of the traffic on the line in the hope of getting through with his message. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, one can always get on to the manual operators in a dire emergency and get them to utilise the methods that they have by way of codes or whatever to break through the system. These manual exchanges are now to be closed. As I said earlier, in Victoria only two manual exchanges in the metropolitan area and one provincial exchange, that at Bendigo, will continue to operate. In the case of an emergency, such as a death in the family, the telephone lines might be clagged up particularly in those hours that I mention, between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m., and the only way through the system would be to vie with the rest of the trade on the trunk line system between any area of Victoria and the metropolitan area or any area of Victoria and the manual exchange in Bendigo. That will become almost an impossibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Another consideration is the employment that the manual exchanges have provided over generations, for young and mature-aged females, in particular. I know that Telecom will say: 'Yes, we will provide a job for you somewhere else'. Somewhere else may be two hours drive or two days drive away. Many of these people have financial obligations in the towns in which they live and there is no way that they could pick up their roots and travel with the job. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important assets of the people who operate the manual exchanges is their specific and local knowledge. In many cases they were born and bred in the area where they work. They know where Brown's Hill, Smith's Knoll, William's Corner and other local places are. In the event of being contacted about a disaster such as a car accident, a fire or a flood they are able to contact all the emergency services with specific knowledge of just where that accident or crisis is. If we do away with these people, no one will really know where the closest doctor is, the name of the doctor who is open at that moment, the names of the personnel at the fire station or whatever. Whilst the emergency service system in rural areas may not break down, it will become an extremely tardy arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom figures show that an average of 6.7 per cent of trunk telephone calls failed to get through because of the overload on Telecom switching equipment in 1981. Congestion on the system, about which I have spoken, results when the demand for calls exceeds the ability of the equipment to carry them. For example , when the cheaper STD rates apply after 6 p.m., more people try to make trunk calls, but the number of lines is the same. When all the lines are busy and there are still people trying to dial STD numbers they get a busy signal. According to Telecom, in some areas, including Orange, Griffith and Tamworth in New South Wales, over 12 per cent of STD calls were ineffective. In the Orange dialling area, a staggering 59.7 per cent of STD calls failed to get through after 9 p.m. because of overloading of the switching network. That is a fairly disastrous situation for the residents in that dialling area, particularly in an emergency. I know that it costs money to keep people in rural areas. But really, if Telecom is to play the role which the Australian Labor Party wants it to play and not be hidebound by the restrictions placed on it, I believe that it should be providing a service across Australia and should not be forced into the financial stringencies that it has been forced into and the curtailment of services everywhere in order to try to balance its books. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to take a great deal of time in the debate on this Bill but I think it is important that I raise a couple of matters in relation to the lack of planning, particularly in Western Australia. We have lately found that, with fairly rapid development, it is becoming quite impossible for people in certain areas to plan what their immediate future holds for them and, particularly, for their children. On Monday of this week, prior to leaving for Canberra, I had the opportunity to go to the Orange Grove Primary School to present a flag. I was rather disturbed at what I saw.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the first place, it took me much longer to find the school than I anticipated it would. Whilst the school is clearly marked on a map-it is a very new map compiled by the Main Roads Department-a number of roads have been closed and these were not indicated. This has been occasioned by the construction of a freeway which, in fact, goes through the grounds of the school. To be exact the freeway uses half of the school oval. The effect this has had on the school is rather traumatic, particularly for the teachers and children who are involved, not only because of the noise that now emanates from the freeway. Prior to the construction of that roadway there were 130 students at this small primary school. I do not think it was ever envisaged by the Education Department that it would be anything more than a small primary school. In the telephone book the Department lists the school as being on a road that has not existed for some years. If one looks at the back of the road map one will find that it is still shown as being on Bickley Road but, of course, it is not on Bickley Road at all. It is at the end of a very small laneway. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in an ideal setting for a small primary school and, as I have said, it was never envisaged by the Department that it would be anything more than a small primary school. Prior to the construction of the freeway the school accommodated 130 children and it had seven classrooms and a principal. When the freeway was constructed, taking up half the oval, the school complained, saying that it needed some playing areas. It was decided then that the oval would be reconstructed above the school but still in the grounds. The school now has a magnificent, fully reticulated, full-sized oval. The problem is that the population at the school has decreased to 33 children, 10 of whom will be leaving at the end of this year. It is now a two-teacher school. One teacher is the principal, who is employed on a full time basis, plus one other and there is a teacher who comes in on a part time basis. The spread of the two classes is grades 1 to 4 and grades 5 to 7, which means that none of the children who attend get the proper attention that they should from the teacher, and the teacher is, of course, distracted by the variety of classes she or he has to teach. </PARA>
<PARA> The main problem appears to be that the major part of the population of the school came from across the freeway. Of course, parents are a little apprehensive about letting their children go across the freeway. The Main Roads Department was approached with a view to putting in a walkover. The Department advised the school that it should have the population before the walkover was constructed. The school, of course, cannot provide the population until the overpass has been constructed. So there has been a total lack of planning right the way through. </PARA>
<PARA> For instance, the Main Roads Department did not know that it would take up a portion of the oval. One presumes that it did not know in the initial stages. But, having determined that that was where the road had to go, one would have anticipated that someone would have said: 'We have to provide access for the children who would normally be accommodated at this school'. That did not eventuate and, as I have said, the school is now down to a total of 33 students. They have a magnificently constructed, fully reticulated oval and they do not even have enough boy students to have a full sized Australian Rules football team. The only school with which they can play any sport on a competitive basis is many miles away because, apparently, under the education system they have to compete with schools of a similar size. So the whole thing is rather ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA> With the closure of the roads it has become necessary for some of those students who are still attending the Orange Grove Primary School to now travel 5 1/2 kilometres by car. I find this a little hard to believe, but I have spoken to the mother of one of the children who attended the school until the freeway went through. She assures me that because they are a one-car family and because her husband needs the car for work she has had to change the school that her child attends. This is just because she cannot get the child from point A to point B. I think that is rather a tragic situation. I envisage that, because there is only a possible intake of one child next year and because 10 children will be leaving the school, the Education Department in Western Australia may well see fit actually to close the school. I think that would be a tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is rather nice, I suppose, to have the amount of room that is available at the moment. Having seven classrooms with only two of them being fully utilised means that the children have an indoor gymnasium where they can have physical education instruction. They have a room which has been set aside for arts so that each one has his or her particular place in the room and does not have to take away the art materials all the time. The Parents and Citizens Association decided that it would like to accept responsibility for some portion of the school but, of course, the Association has diminished as well, as only 33 children are attending the school. This means that the P and C would be responsible for a certain section but that it would never own it as it is a school building. So the P and C took down a partition between two of the rooms intending that it would become a fairly large area which could be used for entertainment. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, one of the local young ladies who was getting married approached the P and C about hiring this area at the school grounds because the surroundings are so very pleasant. She approached those people in relation to holding her wedding reception there. While plans were under way they were advised that whilst the P and C actually administers that section of the school, because it is on school grounds and, therefore, is under the control of the Education Department, that area nevertheless was not allowed to be used for social functions where liquor would be available. I thought that that was rather a tragedy because it means that the school virtually has no income, if it is reliant on the parents of the 33 students attending the school, some of whom come from the same family. I have to question whether there is enough consultation in the planning for this type of operation. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads me straight on to the next subject which I want to raise. I am sure that we have all had the opportunity over the last few days to meet with the telephonists from Telecom Australia. Once again I am led to believe that there has been a lack of consultation. I am extremely disturbed about a situation that has been outlined in relation to my State of Western Australia. It would appear that, on paper, the service will improve and I would be very grateful for that, particularly because of those people who are rather isolated. In areas where there might be 50 miles or 60 miles between farmhouses it is necessary to have some means of communication. However, the outline that has been provided to me would indicate that everything is going to be centralised to the point where everybody would be competing for the use of the same lines. </PARA>
<PARA> If, for instance, I was in Broome and I wished to contact someone in the south- west at, say, Albany or Bunbury, my call would be directed through the central exchange in Perth which would take up that one line. It would then be transmitted further through to Bunbury, thence taking up another line. The Bunbury member would be contacted. The call would then go back to the Perth central exchange and come back to me in Derby or wherever I happened to be, thus creating congestion on those lines. I would be very interested if someone from Telecom or the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume), who represents the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair), could tell me that my assessment of the figures that have been put before me is incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA> My second concern in relation to the same matter is the employment of people in small towns. I cite a country town such as Northam which has some 7,000 inhabitants and which possibly employs eight to ten telephonists; I do not know the full strength. If we look at the wage component circulated throughout the town with the provision of goods and services, we have to accept that in a town of that size it would be of considerable benefit to have those people employed. I have not had from Telecom in relation to the question I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications the other day any satisfactory comment or response that would lead me to believe that those people will be either engaged in employment of an advisory nature, such as on the 0175 service, or even available, for instance, to manage the 000 emergency service. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to point three of this subject that I wish to debate; that is, the provision of the emergency service. I think we are all fairly well aware of how the service operates at the moment, but we have to express some concern if the information we are given is correct; that once computerisation of the country exchanges goes forward the 000 emergency calls will compete for the same lines used by people who wish to make a telephone call to another point. I would be very grateful if the Minister could provide me with a response that I could pass back to the phonogram operators' association. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that the concern is not only in relation to emergencies but also the role of a telephonist in a country centre. His or her role in an emergency is very important. I cite the instance of the Meckering earthquake in Western Australia a few years ago. Telephone calls were interrupted because of the earthquake. Calls were very speedily rerouted through other areas-through the south-west and thence into the city. The phonogram operators who were on duty at that time apparently decided that they would use an outward line through the south-west and an inward line through those areas just north of Meckering so that there was no jamming of the lines because of over use. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like someone to explain to me what will happen in the event that this system becomes fully computerised. I have expressed concern here on a number of occasions for those people who live in the isolated areas of the Pilbara and the Kimberleys for instance as to whether their needs will be serviced in a much more efficient way with the development of a computerised system, whether it will be an integrated system, how long it will take before it is fully operational and what the effect will be if there is a major disaster across the Nullarbor plains. On a number of occasions the lines of communication have been interfered with and completely disrupted between the west and east coasts of this nation because of the distance involved. One has to take all these matters into account. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to be assured, before I would allow this system to be introduced-I am sure the Minister would want to be assured-that an alternative system would be available in the event of any interference in one of those major areas. I raised this question the other day, and my colleague Senator Gietzelt raised the matter following my question. The Minister advised us that he would provide us with an answer. I hope that, because Telecom will be at the stage of implementation of the computerised system in the very near future, the responses to those questions will soon be provided by the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to utilise the first reading debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) to raise a matter which was canvassed me a week ago. I had hoped to have an opportunity to raise this matter during Question Time, but on Tuesday I interviewed a constituent who was here with a deputation regarding the problems facing country telephonists and the general services provided in country areas by Telecom Australia. That matter received priority. As I said, I had hoped to have an opportunity to ask this question today, but because of the unsatisfactory way in which the order of questions is determined in this place I was not able to do that. I now refer to the question I had hoped to ask of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer in a substantive sense to the role of a Mr Sankey who, the Senate might recall, was involved in an infamous court case which suggested impropriety in respect of the Prime Minister of Australia during the 1972-75 period and a number of Ministers in that Government, particularly Dr Cairns, Mr Rex Connor and former Senator Murphy. It might be useful to remind the Senate that in that court case the Government played a role that finally resulted in judgment being entered against Mr Sankey to the extent of some $75,000 in costs. The questions that need to be asked are these: Has the Government been able to collect those costs awarded against Mr Sankey? Who was behind Mr Sankey's efforts in those proceedings which were designed to affect considerably the character and standing of eminent citizens of the Australian community and prominent members of my party? The senior counsel in that case was none other than David Rofe, Q.C . Of course, a substantial portion of the costs would have been required to pay that gentleman. One would concede that Mr Rope was heavily involved financially in the prosecution of that case which, allegedly, was a citizen's initiative concerning alleged happenings during the 1972-75 period. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise this matter because of the rather remarkable role that the same Mr David Rofe is playing on behalf of this Government in what is commonly described as the Greek conspiracy case. As the evidence presented to a Senate Estimates committee indicates, the same David Rofe has been paid approximately $500,000 in respect of the Greek conspiracy case. One is entitled to question, therefore, whether there has been some arrangement in respect of the Sankey affair and the costs awarded therein, and the role that the Government and/or Mr Rofe played in respect of the Greek conspiracy case. I remind the Senate that the Greek conspiracy case has now assumed proportions unknown anywhere else in the Western world so far as judicial proceedings are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will recall that a number of us, particularly Senator Grimes, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in this place, have from time to time raised the question of the charges laid against members of the Greek community. One can describe that case only as a legal fiasco and a great embarrassment to the Fraser Government. At about 5.30 a.m. on Saturday 31 March 1978 Detective Inspector Don Thomas of the Australian Federal Police, together with a number of other members of the force, visited a considerable number of homes in the Marrickville areas of Sydney. Some 178 people out of the 183 arrested on that morning were charged with conspiring to defraud the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> This reminds us of the way in which Liberal and conservative governments operate. Honourable senators and those of us who were here during the Vietnam war days will recall the way in which the Attorney-General's Department operated particularly with the young lads who lived in the city areas. Raids were carried out at 4 o'clock and 5 o'clock on Saturday and Sunday mornings. That sort of behaviour was defended by the late Senator Greenwood with a great deal of relish and enthusiasm. I find it particularly repugnant and unacceptable in a democratic society. Honourable senators may recall in the debates that subsequently took place that people who had migrated to this country and settled down in an ordinary Australian environment were panic stricken by the attempts of the police, of the establishment, on those occasions. A great deal of panic, distress, anger and embarrassment was caused to the families of those persons who were arrested. The most incredible thing about that particular raid is that Detective Inspector Thomas, with great flourish and fanfare in the Sunday newspapers, talked about it being virtually the greatest case in Australian legal history. The subsequent four years have shown that the actual case has gone on for 368 days and is costing this Government $20,000 a day. A total of 250 witnesses have been called, there have been 12,000 court exhibits and 30,500 pages of transcript have been compiled, which is about 6 million words. Lo and behold, that only represents the prosecution case. </PARA>
<PARA> We can see the melodrama which accompanied the activities of the Federal Police on that case. Only a handful of people have now been charged. The Government has , on the basis of the evidence, withdrawn the overwhelming majority of the charges against the members of the Greek community. Fewer than 20 are waiting for their cases to be heard. I remind the Senate that it is costing us $20,000 a day to defend almost an indefensible position. Of the persons who were arrested, some 736 had their pensions cut on the spot in a very arbitrary, unsatisfactory and heartless fashion. The Government ought to be ashamed of the way in which that incident was organised. One cannot help but see some relationship between the original Sankey case and the role of certain legal persons in the Greek conspiracy case. It can be said that the Government has been advised by Mr David Rofe on these matters. I am not in a position to say whether that advice has been wholly or partly accepted. It is an unsatisfactory state of affairs to have a person who is involved in a clear case of conspiracy against the leaders of the Government in the 1972-75 period also involved in this sort of case and briefed by the Australian Government. The case is still proceeding at the costs I have suggested of approximately $20,000 a day. I wonder how much money the case is costing the Australian taxpayers? It has been suggested that the total cost will exceed $7m. If one were to relate that to the amount of pension that would be paid to those 178 charged persons, I think we would find that we would come out on the right side of the ledger if we had not even commenced the operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, this Government has a lot to account for in the Greek conspiracy case. Mr Sankey is a very unusual person. In dealing with matters affecting my own party in the State of New South Wales he is now appearing for a group of persons who were involved in wholesale corruption of a party branch. That flows from the bashing of Mr Baldwin, M.L.C. some 20 months ago. The same Mr Sankey has turned up in defence of these persons who have been charged by the New South Wales police in a similar case of conspiracy. In my view Mr Sankey's record leaves much to be desired. I know it will be argued and defended that a person is entitled to defend anyone who briefs him. It is somewhat strange that this person was able to launch a citizen's prosecution in an attempt to embarrass and maybe even impeach four leading members of the Labor Administration in 1972-75, and then have costs of $75,000 awarded against him with no explanation as to where that sort of money came from. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent program on Nationwide featured a psychiatrist who was asked her opinion in respect of the sufferings of these members of our Greek community and how they had been affected by the heavy-handed attitude of this Government and the melodramatic way in which the Australian Federal Police had operated. One is entitled to draw the conclusions that in both cases-I believe there is a relationship-the role of David Rofe is also open to a great deal of examination.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>I present Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1981-82 which, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1981-82 which I shall introduce shortly, comprises the Additional Estimates for 1981-82. In these Bills, Parliament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made under Appropriation Acts (Nos 1 and 2) 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the principal reasons for Additional Estimates is that, although the original Budget figuring contained allowances for prospective wage and salary rate increases in the Public Service (including Defence Forces), under long- standing arrangements, that amount was not then appropriated. Those allowances, as well as amounts for wage and salary increases in excess of the allowances, now need to be appropriated. As well, funding is required for new government initiatives undertaken and cost and price increases arising since the Budget was prepared. </PARA>
<PARA> The additional appropriations total $811.8m: of this, $740.4m is sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and $71.4m in Appropriation Bill (No. 4). </PARA>
<PARA> The additional appropriations sought in the Bills are offset in part by savings in appropriations made by Appropriation Acts (Nos 1 and 2) 1981-82, resulting partly from the Government's determined efforts to achieve savings in expenditure wherever possible. These savings, amounting to $361.3m, are detailed under the relevant appropriation headings in the document, 'Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations', which has been distributed to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the additional appropriations now sought, on current information, total outlays in 1981-82, including provisions in annual appropriations and those outlays financed from special appropriations, would be about one and a half per cent above the budget Estimates. While this increase over the Budget estimates is higher than that experienced last year, the Government considers the increase is unavoidable in view of the need to maintain essential services and programs. The Government was faced this year with substantial wage and salary increases and other strong pressures which indicated a significant overrun on outlays. In keeping with its expenditure restraint policies, it has conducted a rigorous review of spending in order to reduce net additional requirements by offsetting unavoidable increases with reductions elsewhere wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I now outline some of the main areas where the Government has found it necessary to seek additional appropriations in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1981- 82. </PARA>
<PARA> Included in the amount Parliament is now being asked to appropriate is an estimated $409.1m to meet increases in award rates and other wage and salary costs since the Budget, consisting of $177.2m (civil) and $231.9m (Defence Forces). These amounts do not include the wage and salary component of additional funds being provided to statutory authorities funded under one line appropriations. This compares with an allowance of $160m included in the overall Budget figuring. </PARA>
<PARA> An amount of $14.1m is included under the Department of Communications to enable the Australian Broadcasting Commission to maintain its services without major cutbacks in 1981-82, in the face of salary increases. </PARA>
<PARA> Under Department of Defence, provision of $35.1m is made for initial payments on a mine counter-measure vessel, the aircraft carrier 'Invincible' and modernisation of guided missile destroyers, after taking into account slippage against other projects. </PARA>
<PARA> An additional amount of $4.9m under Department of Education covers expenses for the Australian National University. </PARA>
<PARA> A provision of $10.1m is sought under the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs for existing community-based youth support scheme projects following the Government's decision to continue the scheme under revised guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> An amount of $9.0m is sought under Department of Foreign Affairs for the provision of additional food aid for Afghan refugees in Pakistan and to meet food shortages in Bangladesh and Madagascar. </PARA>
<PARA> Included under Department of Health is an amount of $6.6m for the continuing essential operations of the Capital Territory Health Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> On significant amounts for which provision is sought in the Bill include:</PARA>
<PARA> $63.0m under the Department of Housing and Construction to discharge existing commitments under the Home Savings Grants Scheme;</PARA>
<PARA> $4.7m under the Department of Science and Technology for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, mainly for wage and salary cost increases;</PARA>
<PARA> $11.0m for the Department of Trade and Resources to meet calls of contributions to buffer stocks established under the International Tin Agreement and the International Natural Rubber Agreement;</PARA>
<PARA> $22.8m under the Department of Transport to meet the anticipated operating losses of the Australian National Railways Commission; this comprises $13.9m to meet the projected increase in the Commission's 1981-82 operating loss and, following legal advice, the re-appropriation of an amount of $8.9m which was originally appropriated in the Appropriation Act (No. 1) 1981-82; and</PARA>
<PARA> $6.8m for the Department of Veterans' Affairs to allow for increased fees and higher than anticipated demand for the services of specialists, medical officers , physiotherapists and other allied health professions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to conclude the debate on the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill, which has been dealt with over the last two or three days in this chamber. It has been a very wide ranging and interesting debate on several aspects of the income tax law, but in particular the focus has been on six subjects which, of course, are elements of this Bill. The first one I mention is zone allowances. This provision results from the recent inquiry into zone allowances in Australia and the Government's having taken the decision to increase them. Senator Kilgariff and Senator Crichton-Browne in particular spoke on these subjects, emphasising the very great need and indeed the contribution of people who live in the outback areas of Australia and the support that the Government should endeavour to thrust their way to ensure that they have lives at least somewhat comparable to the lives of those living in more comfortable circumstances. During the debate several points were made. I do not intend to canvass those, but they are on the record and they certainly emphasise the Government's concern for these people and their problems which, of course, the Government continually takes into account when considering policies, be they of a tax nature or of another kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Watson, in debating the issue of the incorporation of medical practices , raised the famous Peate's case, which involved medical practices of some 15 years ago. The fact is that that case focused on the issue of the incorporation of medical practices for the purposes of tax avoidance. Those kinds of principles are now being enshrined in the operation of medical practices as they have been condoned by the medical registration boards and other legal authorities within the States. Of course, they are at variance with the circumstances of the cases in the time before Peate's case, and consequently a different set of circumstances applies these days. The Government has moved to recognise that and, indeed, has provided for such practices to receive taxation treatment similar to that provided for persons who practice alone. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button mentioned several matters ranging widely over various elements of the report of the Asprey Taxation Review Committee including areas that the Government considers from time to time in assessing its taxation policy. Those matters, of course, receive consideration from time to time. The theme, I think, that he was stressing was that simplicity is required in the tax law. I think the Government agrees with that. The difficulties, of course, are that these days taxation avoidance schemes and other means of defeating and circumventing the law have become so sophisticated and involved that the law required to regulate them has become correspondingly complex. Consequently, the Income Tax Assessment Act has grown enormously in recent years. It is an unfortunate fact of life that that will probably continue while we have the degree of taxation avoidance that is attempted in this community. </PARA>
<PARA> On the general issue of tax avoidance, there is no doubt that the actions taken by the Government in recent years to legislate against particular schemes that have been sold within the community have, on the whole, been very successful. It is interesting to note that many professional advisers are recognising that there has been a change of attitude in the community to blatant paper-type artificial tax avoidance devices. The incidence of such devices is correspondingly reducing in the community. It is certainly a welcome trend. I hope that it is confirmed by later evidence on these matter. Clearly it is a result of the Government's determination to defeat, when it possibly can, artifical tax schemes of the sort that we have seen peddled around this community over the last three or four years. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the partiuclar points which are the subject of the Opposition's amendment to the second reading motion and of the already foreshadowed amendments to the Bill to be moved at the Committee stage. It is clear that there is a fundamental difference in attitude and philosophy, when dealing with the issue of tax avoidance, between the Government and the Opposition. That has been discussed on many occasions, but it is not fair-as Senator Walsh asserted during his speech-to claim that the Government is soft on tax avoidance and takes no action at all. In fact, it has been demonstrated, as I have just pointed out, that there has been considerable progress against schemes of the blatant sort. One has only to check with the tax community, particularly the professional people involved in this area, to understand that they realise that a great deal has occurred over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's proposal is to legislate retrospectively in respect of each individual scheme as soon as the scheme becomes known; that is, to go back to the first point at which such a scheme becomes identifiable. That is a solution which the Government has not accepted because clearly it offends those general principles of the law relating to retrospectivity and, indeed, is not consistent with the general principles which have been enunciated many times in this place and throughout the history of parliaments of British colour. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Chipp" NAMEID="3V4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator Chipp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect, I think the Labor Party wants to go further than that. It wants to go back to the date from which the scheme operated.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. I am sorry that I did not articulate that clearly enough, because that is what I had in mind. It is a very significant amendment which has been moved. The Government's approach to this question is to legislate automatically upon becoming aware that a scheme is in action. Legislation, of course, may not be prepared and ready to go into the Parliament right at that moment, but the Government, by Press statements, publicity in various ways and statements in the Parliament, will put on notice those people who are involved in those schemes that they can be legislated against. Indeed, people who continue to adopt those practices will find themselves in a difficult situation when appropriate legislation is finally introduced into the Parliament. That is the Government's approach. It is a fair approach. It employs the principle, if you like, of caveat emptor-people do things at their own risk once they have been put on notice by the Government. Those are the fundamental differences between the Opposition and the Government on the matter. Clearly, the Opposition 's first five amendments to the second reading motion will not be accepted by the Government when they are put to a vote. That is our general attitude also to the amendments to clauses concerning retrospectivity which I understand the Opposition will be moving during the Committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to one or two matters that were raised during the debate. First of all I acknowledge the very significant speech made by Senator Hill in respect of depreciation on industrial machinery and equipment. His general proposition was that these rates of depreciation which are allowable for taxation purposes are too low by today's standards and that they do not properly take account of obsolescence and the degree of change which is occurring in the industrial sphere these days. Naturally enough, this has been an area of great concern to the Government in discussions with industry leaders over the last five years or so. Recognition of this point is made in the fact that this Bill incorporates special rates of depreciation for the iron and steel industry. In that context there is an argument for support for industry emanating from the kind of support which Senator Hill has in mind. I believe that the best approach to those problems is a general review of government policies in respect of industries. That of course is a matter for advice from the Industries Assistance Commission to the Government. It is a matter which is constantly before the Government and constantly under review. Nevertheless, I acknowledge that there are significant difficulties in particular industries in this regard. The Government will be monitoring those issues from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans spoke at length on the matter of retrospectivity in general but he focused on section 26AAA and its application to certain transactions conducted by the Bell group of companies last year. The amendment which is to be moved by the Opposition in the Committee stage seeks to include those transactions in the general provisions contemplated by this Bill. The Government will not be accepting that amendment because of the general argument which I outlined earlier. The Commissioner of Taxation, in normal circumstances, in addition to taking action under section 26AAA in this kind of situation, would consider the possible application of section 25 and section 26A of the Income Tax Assessment Act in any case where property is acquired and disposed of by a taxpayer within 12 months. However, the secrecy provisions of that Act preclude the Commissioner from disclosing the outcome of such consideration in individual cases. That is a matter which will need to be left to the Commissioner. The Government will not be supporting that amendment. We hope that we will have sufficient support to reject it. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the general provision on profit shifting, as it has become known in this place, about which there has been a great deal of debate over the last few days. First of all, a great deal of concern was evinced by Senator Tate when he made several references to the revised Division 13. As he rightly pointed out , transfer pricing practices are merely one means of international profit shifting but the phrase has become a convenient shorthand reference to describe a broader problem. As the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) pointed out in her second reading speech, the growth of international investment , the relative ease with which money, goods or technology cross international boundaries, improved communications and the development of the network of tax havens have all served to facilitate profit shifting arrangements by transnational enterprises both Australian and foreign based. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walsh" NAMEID="TJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All the more reason why you should impose meaningful penalties.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that in a moment. The Minister for Finance also made it clear that revised Division 13 will deal comprehensively with all aspects of the shifting of profits out of Australia, whether by transfer pricing or by any other means. The new Division will also complement similar provisions for substituting arm's length prices already embodied in Australia's double taxation agreements. The new legislation will, in short, ensure Australia's ability to combat profit shifting arrangements wherever and whenever they occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the point just raised by Senator Walsh-that is, the rate of penalty applicable when the Commissioner seeks to apply penalties. The Opposition, by way of amendments moved at the second reading stage and, indeed, foreshadowed for the Committee stage, proposes to increase the penalty in cases to which the revised Division is to apply from the proposed 10 per cent to a tax increase by virtue of the application of the Division of an amount equal to double the amount of the tax increase-that is, a 200 per cent penalty. Such a penalty would not, in the Government's view, be appropriate in the cases to which Division 13 will apply. The Government therefore will oppose these amendments. The income tax law presently provides for the imposition of a 200 per cent penalty only where a taxpayer engages in arrangements of a blatant, artificial or contrived kind to which Part IVA applies or in cases where a taxpayer deliberately omits income from his return or claims deductions or rebates for expenditure in excess of the amount actually incurred. The profit shifting arrangements to which the revised Division 13 will apply are not blatant, artificial or contrived like those to which Part IVA applies. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans acknowledged, when supporting the discretions proposed in Division 13, and again when putting the Opposition's case for retrospectivity of tax avoidance measures, that a distinction can be drawn between the blatant, artificial or contrived scheme and what he describes as the 'twilight zone' tax avoidance where arrangements may have a redeeming commercial justification. The Government was mindful of that distinction in submitting to the Parliament the penalty provision that is now proposed in this Bill. Another very important consideration was that, in contrast to the proposal that the penalties in Division 13 cases should be higher, there has been criticism that provision is made for penalties in those cases since they could apply even where a taxpayer, who is a party to a transaction, has no tax avoiding intent; for example, in a case where the application of the Division achieves no more than a reallocation of profits and revenue from another country to Australia. In the Government's view the penalty in that sort of case is more akin to a late payment penalty, which under section 207 of the Income Tax Assessment Act is also imposed at the rate of 10 per cent per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> Against that background the Government considered that the level of penalty proposed for Division 13 purposes was appropriate to and consistent with the general penalty levels in the Act. I hasten to add that the Government is not unmindful of the concern that has been expressed by the Opposition, the Australian Democrats and others about the proposed Division 13 penalty and about the level of penalties generally imposed under the Act. In that regard I inform honourable senators that the Government has already put in hand a review of the levels of all of the penalties provided for in the Act. The review is being conducted as a matter of urgency with a view to the introduction of necessary amending legislation in the Budget sittings. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Chipp" NAMEID="3V4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. That review will encompass the penalty now proposed for Division 13 purposes. In that regard I assure honourable senators opposite that the concern and views which they have expressed on this penalty issue in the course of the debate will be fully considered in that general penalties review. For these reasons, but particularly because the Division 13 penalty now proposed will again be subject to parliamentary scrutiny in the near future, the Government opposes any move to increase the level of penalty at this stage. I think what I have said touches most of the contentious issues that have been raised during the debate. There may be other points which need amplification. No doubt they will emerge during the Committee stage of this debate. I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (5) Page 8, clause 4, sub-clause (3), line 19, leave out '10 September 1981', insert '1 July 1979'. </PARA>
<PARA>I explain for the record that I have moved amendments 1 to 5 in one motion because the purpose of each of those amendments is identical. It is to give clause 4 of the Bill effect as from 1 July 1979 instead of 10 September 1981, the date set out in the Bill in its current form. Clause 4, as printed, closes from 10 September last year a loophole under which tax on short term profits from the purchase and sale of shares may be avoided if the company which nominally purchased the shares is sold rather than the shares being sold directly. It was detected following some transactions of that type undertaken by the Bell group and the Bond Corporation in Perth on the shares of Ansett Transport Industries, Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort and White Industries. The Government's proposal will substantially-I repeat, substantially-preclude the use of such contrived arrangements to avoid tax on short term gains from share sales. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's amendments, if accepted, will ensure that the Bell group and the Bond Corporation pay the tax which they ought to have paid on those transactions. Of course, that will apply to any other companies which may have made similar arrangements in the period between 1 July 1979 and 10 September 1981. The amendments are explicitly designed to make those two groups, and any others in the same situation, pay the tax they ought to have paid, and they will be a warning to others. If this chamber shows that it has the courage required to let tax avoiders know that their anti-social activities will no longer be profitable no matter when they indulge in them, their anti-social activities will cease. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition regards this group of amendments as something of a test case. There is, in my view, a case for extending the application of amendments of this type to those tax avoidance schemes covered by clauses 12 and 18 of the Bill, but we decided to move the amendments to clause 4 because clause 4 is relevant to three very well-known and highly profitable cases of tax avoidance through the use of intermediary companies to mask the profits on short term sales of shares. I gather from the actions of the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine in voting to remove the retrospectivity clause from the Opposition's second reading amendment that they will not be voting for the amendments which I have now moved to clause 4. It does not particularly surprise me that that is the case; both the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine have an established record of voting in this chamber for tax dodgers. I will refer to that shortly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept your ruling, Mr Chairman. I will detail the facts of the case which prompted the remarks. Honourable senators and the public can make their own judgments about the record of the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine. With respect to retrospectivity, only two days ago Senator Siddons stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats are absolutely opposed to retrospectivity in any shape or form, irrespective of whether it relates to our tax laws or the laws of the land generally. I am anxious to make our position abundantly clear as it seems to have caused some confusion in the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA>Later that day, with respect to the alleged confusion within the Labor Party- there is confusion for very good reasons because there is so much confusion within the Australian Democrats-Senator Evans quoted from a notice of motion that Senator Chipp had given. There must be, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a systematic attack on tax avoidance schemes including retrospective application of new legislative measures . . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was replying to an interjection, anyway. The motion continued:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . following specific identification and warning of the types of schemes to be affected by the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the entire quotation that Senator Evans made. Senator Chipp did not object then so I trust that he will not object now. The point I wanted to make-I did not leave out the last half for any malign reason-is that if the qualifications are held to be important, all that the Democrats are saying is that what the Government has already been doing for about two years ought to be done, in which case one wonders why Senator Chipp would bother to put forward the motion. By way of interjection when Senator Evans said that he did not read that quotation as going any further than what the Government is already doing, Senator Chipp said:</PARA>
<PARA> At this stage, but I may be persuaded to your point of view in the next Parliament if these provisions do not work. </PARA>
<PARA>On the one hand Senator Siddons said that under no circumstances whatever will the Democrats consider retrospective legislation. Not two hours later Senator Chipp said that he may be persuaded to Senator Evans's point of view-that is, for retrospectivity-in the next Parliament if these provisions do not work. If there is confusion in the Labor Party about precisely where the Democrats stand on this issue, I suggest that the origin of the confusion is within the Democrats own ranks rather than in any chronic inability of the Labor Party to understand simple English. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us be perfectly clear. By not voting for these amendments, the Democrats and Senator Harradine are ensuring that the Bond Corporation and the Bell group will avoid paying $27m in tax that they ought to have paid. Other companies, as yet unknown, may also be given a tax remission. Let us also be perfectly clear that as a result of the votes about to be recorded by those six honourable senators the Government must either increase the taxation paid by everybody else to the extent of at least $27m or reduce benefits which would otherwise have been payable, including family allowances, a matter in which some of the people concerned purport to take a special interest. The Government will have $27m less to spend on worthy schemes such as increased family allowances. Let it be perfectly clear that that is what these people are voting for. They are voting to allow the Bond Corporation and the Bell group to retain $27m which ought to have been paid in tax, thereby ensuring that some or all other taxpayers will pay $27m more, or the Government will have $27m less to spend on worthy programs such as family allowances. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I am not surprised that the Democrats have adopted this position. On 18 November the same honourable senators, aided and abetted by Government senators, voted to preserve a taxation rort associated with some equalisation deposits under which it is possible to borrow $15,000 by way of tax not paid for a period of two years and lend $10,000 for a period of one year, in addition to which a $4,609 cash bonus is picked up, half of which is not taxable because it is tax permanently evaded. Their excuse for doing that was that the National Farmers Federation had said that IEDs were not used to destabilise income in that way. If that is so, every one of the 12,000 farmers who use income equalisation deposits is paying more in income tax than he would have paid if he had not used the income equalisation deposits. The Democrats were told about that before they voted. They were told that the scheme could be manipulated in a way that enabled the taxpayer to borrow $15,000 for two years and lend $10,000 for one year. I seek leave to move amendments (6) to (8) together. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now we know what Senator Walsh is talking about. He is categorising the Australian Democrats and me as being tax dodgers for one reason alone-that is, because we refused to support his motion for disallowance in respect of income equalisation deposits. In so refusing, the Democrats and I supported the shadow Minister for Primary Industry, Mr John Kerin. If Senator Walsh calls us friends of tax dodgers, he calls one of his own front bench colleagues, Mr John Kerin, the friend of a tax dodger. I will read from the media release of the shadow Minister for Primary Industry, Mr John Kerin, on 22 October 1981 dealing with income equalisation deposits. He stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The decision by the Government to raise the interest rate on Income Equalisation Deposits from 7 per cent to 9 1/2 per cent was predictable given the rise in market interest rates and will be welcomed by primary producers and their organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>Ironically, damning with faint praise, he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> My colleague, Senator Walsh, has pointed to a situation where the effective interest rate is 23.75 per cent. To calculate the effective rate of return is complex as it depends on the size of the deposit, the marginal tax rate and average income. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not read all the media release. I will table the document shortly. He then stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The manipulations required to gain a tax benefit by destabilising taxable income are possible, but are more hypothetical than real as it would be necessary to make I.E.D.'s when income is low and withdraw them when taxable income is high. </PARA>
<PARA>So, in effect, I pay regard to what Mr Kerin said then rather than to what Senator Walsh has said. Senator Walsh accused us of having a track record of being friends of tax dodgers. Yet the only thing that has emerged has been the IED issue. If he accuses us he has to accuse the Labor Party and its spokesman, the shadow Minister for Primary Industry, John Kerin. I am sure that many members of the Labor Party are embarrassed by the type of activity that Senator Walsh gets up to. I deliberately voted for Senator Siddons's amendment to Senator Walsh's amendment and deliberately voted against Senator Walsh's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh knows as well as I do that if any amendment is made to this piece of legislation now, because the House of Representatives plans to rise tonight, this legislation will not go through the Parliament this session. Senator Walsh is a friend of the tax dodgers under those circumstances. There is no guarantee that the amendments that he seeks to have adopted will be adopted by the House of Representatives. There is no guarantee whatsoever that consideration in that chamber will not be delayed until late August, at the earliest. He is trying to throw this Bill to the wolves. Many people are making substantial contributions to the Help Poland Live Appeal. Under this legislation they will be entitled to a taxation reduction in the financial year 1981-82 for that contribution. If we accept Senator Walsh's proposal that will go out the window as well. I have a list of the proposals contained in this legislation, but I do not have time to deal with them all. But every honourable senator knows that if we accept what Senator Walsh has put forward all of these other desirable measures will be delayed and might even be put on the long finger. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I commend the Government for its attempts to overcome the manipulations of the tax dodgers. It has, at least, addressed itself to this problem. I know that it has had problems within its ranks, but I have been advised by Senator Siddons who is leading for the Australian Democrats on this matter, that he has the assurance-indeed, Senator Messner, the Minister sitting at the table, has given the assurance-that the Government will have a good look at this matter of penalties. I am prepared to vote in accordance with those undertakings and to vote also to ensure that we have this legislation in place, without the delays which would result from the type of activities that Senator Walsh is engaging in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to the speech made by Mr Willis, who led for the Opposition in the House of Representatives, and to the excellent speech made in this chamber by Senator Evans about retrospectivity. This is an issue that deeply concerns me. I am talking about real retrospectivity; I am talking about dating legislation back to a date before a government gives a warning. The Australian Democrats are opposed to that in principle, as are all Government members and, I think, all, or most, members of the Australian Labor Party. I think every politician finds it repugnant for politicians to make illegal today something that was legal yesterday and then to make guilty of an offence people who acted within the confines of the law yesterday or last year. I think that concept is offensive to everybody in a democracy. I think that with the possible exception of one honourable senator who is a member of the Labor Party, that view would be held by members of the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I go on record as saying that in long conversations that I have had with my friends and colleagues, Senator Evans, Senator Button and other members of the Labor Party-and, indeed, members of the Government-I have been persuaded that, even though we might catch up with these tax dodgers by implementing this procedure, the tax dodgers are too smart for us because they are always ahead of us. I hope that I am not doing the Treasurer, Mr Howard, an injustice-I have a personal admiration for him-but I am inclined to the view that he personally favours real retrospectivity in this area. I do not want my friends in the Liberal Party of Australia to disclose whether that is so, but I suspect that he has mooted that idea. It is well known that he is not unsympathetic to the concept-only in this area of tax dodging. I believe that the Department of the Treasury is following the lines promoted by Senator Button, Senator Evans and Mr Willis that there has to be a new look at this issue because too many people are getting away with too much money. </PARA>
<PARA> When we consider the history of tax avoidance it seems that no matter how clever the Treasury, the Australian Taxation Office or parliamentary counsel are , we will never find an effective way of stopping tax avoidance on the present massive scale unless we embrace a new concept. We will not achieve that new concept if people in this place accuse other people of protecting tax dodgers. I would have thought that a sensible way of doing this was to try to reach some middle ground so that the rights of the individual can be protected and, at the same time, revenue can be secured. That can be done only by a consensus being reached by all the parties represented in this place. That is why yesterday, in an interjection when my friend Senator Evans was speaking, I said that maybe in the next Parliament we will have to move to another concept in this area. We will be able to do that only when we can enter into discussions and debate with a spirit of consensus and not personal abuse and cheap, petty, pathetic point scoring. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I agree entirely that Senator Siddons made a clear statement about his view and, in the name of the Australian Democrats, about the Democrats' view on retrospectivity beyond the point where warning has been publicly given that legislative action will be taken. It might have remained clear if it had stopped there, but Senator Chipp, by way of interjection on Senator Evans on Tuesday, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . but I may be persuaded to your point of view in the next Parliament if these provisions do not work. </PARA>
<PARA>That is very different because Senator Evans's point of view was that it ought to go back further than that, as these amendments seek to do, to the period when avoidance measures of the type being legislated against were first used. Senator Chipp said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I may be persuaded to your point of view in the next Parliament if these provisions do not work. </PARA>

There is no reason why it cannot sit the week after next, the week after that or the week after that. If these amendments are carried and the legislation fails because the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) does not want to have the House of Representatives sitting, that is the responsibility of the Government and the Liberal Party of Australia and not of the Opposition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not. I am coming back to it; just be patient. The National Farmers Federation claimed that income equalisation deposits were not being used to destabilise income, the pre-requisite to achieving that objective. If that is true every farmer who uses IEDs pays more tax than he would otherwise pay. The NFF has yet to address itself to that problem. Senator Harradine and the Democrats were also told that that was so. They may have been misled by the misinformation that came from Senator Guilfoyle, which was that farmers need to retain these provisions even though there may be some anomalies because it is necessary to stabilise taxable income in order to avoid taxation penalties which would otherwise be imposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that ever since the amendments of 1978 any farmer who takes a measure to stabilise taxable income will pay more tax than would otherwise have been paid. In other words, the truth was in reverse to what Senator Guilfoyle claimed it was. The Democrats and Senator Harradine were told that as well. Having been told all those things, they voted to maintain the rort. If they swallowed either of the pieces of misinformation from Senator Guilfoyle or the National Farmers Federation they were ignorant and negligent to a degree which must cast doubts upon their fitness to hold public office. If they were not culpably ignorant and negligent they consciously supported, by their votes in the Senate, the continuation of a tax dodge. </PARA>
<PARA> Everything I have said is applicable to Senator Harradine. He was getting impatient a while ago and I am about to deal with him. He tried to excuse his vote in favour of the preservation of that tax dodge by quoting selectively from a Press release issued by John Kerin. Senator Harradine has done that again today. John Kerin said, among other things, that it would be welcomed by farmers organisations. That is not in dispute. It was welcomed. They were lobbying for it. He added a few other things. Senator Harradine presented an interpretation of that but I am not interested in going into the details of the interpretation he put on it. </PARA>
<PARA> I just want to put this question: Does Senator Harradine not have free will? Does Senator Harradine do whatever John Kerin tells him to do? Does he not have a mind of his own? Does he not have a conscience of his own? Does he just blindly follow his interpretation of what John Kerin is alleged to have said? If John Kerin told him to resign from the National Civic Council, would he do that? He was told all those things. He was told the precise way in which the rort could be operated. He was told that what the National Farmers Federation said, if true, meant that the National Farmers Federation was supporting a policy which ensured that all its members who used the income equalisation deposit provisions paid more tax. He was told that what Senator Guilfoyle had said was the reverse of what was true, and Senator Guilfoyle has since admitted that, regardless of whether Senator Chipp chooses to believe it. </PARA>
<PARA> In one respect Senator Harradine is more reprehensible than the Democrats because he purports to wear on his sleeve a bleeding heart for the plight of the low income people, particularly the one low income family with dependent children. Resources of government are not unlimited. One of the effects of voting in the way in which Senator Harradine and the Democrats voted on 18 November and the way in which they are about to vote again now is to reduce the amount of money available to governments to pay higher family allowances or do any of the other worthy things which the Democrats and Senator Harradine normally claim governments should do. By rejecting these amendments, the Government is ensuring that $27m, which ought to have been paid in tax by the Bond Corporation and the Bell group, remains with the people who own those companies instead of being paid into Consolidated Revenue, as it ought to have been, so that it could be used to increase family allowances or for some other worthy purpose. Let there be no mistake about the effect of the Government's actions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks will be brief because the outbursts of Senator Walsh do not deserve any comment by any honourable senator; they speak for themselves. I put to the Senate, and I particularly put to the Australian Labor Party, this question: Is it desirable that a senator in my situation, or indeed other senators, when considering propositions put forward in this place should have regard to the spokesman for the Labor Party in respect of those issues? If their reply is yes, that is precisely what I did in regard to the income equalisation deposits. I believe that I took my decision on that issue very seriously.

<PARA> The decision by the Government to raise the interest rate on Income Equalisation Deposits from 7 per cent to 9 1/2 per cent was predictable given the rise in market interest rates and will be welcomed by primary producers and their organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my view that there should be an automatic mechanism which raises and lowers IED interest rates at a level below market fluctuations. It is not satisfactory for farm organisations to have to be continually lobbying for changes in rates in keeping with the market. </PARA>
<PARA> The IED scheme is a policy designed to equalise farm incomes and for it to work there has to be an attraction to invest. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it should be realised that the interaction between the IED scheme and tax averaging needs to be re-examined as there are anomalies that need attention . </PARA>
<PARA> Many hypothetical cases can be put forward and it is hard to differentiate between the motives for using IED's for taxation reasons or investment reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Walsh has pointed to a situation where the effective interest rate is 23.75 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> To calculate the effective rate of return is complex as it depends on the size of the deposit, the marginal tax rate and average income. </PARA>
<PARA> If one takes the specific case of an average income of $28,000 with a deposit of $4,000 the effective rate of interest at an IED rate of 7 per cent can be calculated to be 15 per cent (if used to destabilise income) or -11 per cent if used to stabilise income. </PARA>
<PARA> The manipulations required to gain a tax benefit by destabilising taxable income are possible, but are more hypothetical than real as it would be necessary to make IED's when income is low and withdraw them when taxable income is high. </PARA>
<PARA> It is most unlikely that many farmers are using IED's to destabilise their incomes because there is-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) a need for an adequate cash flow to operate a business. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) extreme difficulty in predicting future income streams. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) lack of knowledge of how to do it without destabilising farm activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Pitt Street farmers would have more opportunity to abuse the system than genuine farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Rural Adjustment Unit recently examined taxation and the farm sector making comments on the complexity and anomalies in the system. It would be appropriate for the IAC to re-examine the question of taxation in the rural sector to see whether schemes such as cumulative block averaging would be more equitable. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my view that most farmers have stayed with the averaging system over the past years (where their incomes have been rising) in an attempt to stabilise rather than equalise their incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is another examination of the IED scheme the question of extending it to other members of the community whose incomes fluctuate should also be examined. </PARA>

The Government has made it perfectly clear that the measures contained in this legislation will have effect virtually from the time of the statement made by the Treasurer (Mr Howard), or near that time, as I understand it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I will not speak at length on these amendments. They are designed to increase the penalties which would be imposed on people or firms who attempted to use transfer pricing or income shifting-I think this is the term that has been used- across international borders. The Government seeks to impose a penalty for one class of transfer pricing and consequential tax avoidance of 10 per cent of the tax avoided. In such cases and in the other two cases we propose to increase that to an amount equal to double the tax avoided. Such penalties are compatible with those which already apply under section 226 of the Income Tax Assessment Act for other classes of tax evasion. Senator Messner said that that of course applies in conditions where the evasion is quite blatant and deliberate through misstatement, supplying false information or failing to supply information at all. The penalty provisions of section 260 are applied in circumstances where that sort of description does not strictly apply either. I will not deal at great length with that. The point I make is that in putting the case for some penalty being imposed on firms and individuals who avoid tax by transferring income overseas, the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) said :</PARA>
<PARA> Without that,--</PARA>
<PARA>that is the penalty-</PARA>
<PARA>taxpayers who engage in profit shifting to reduce their Australian tax liabilities would have the 'odds to nothing'- . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is, of course, true. If they get away with it they avoid paying the tax; if they get caught they have to pay the tax. So obviously anyone who wanted to maximise his after tax income would have a go at it if he thought there was the slightest chance of getting away with it. The Government has imposed a penalty of 10 per cent. Instead of having odds to nothing, if the Government's original proposition stands, the odds will still be 10 to 1 on. In other words, if there is a better that one in 10 chance of getting away with the profit shifting operation the taxpayer who attempts it will, in the long term, be in front. We argue that that just is not good enough. The deterrent has to be much more severe than a 10 per cent penalty if one gets caught. If one does not get caught one evades the tax altogether. If one does get caught one has to pay the tax and a miserly 10 per cent. We do not believe that that is a sufficient deterrent. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Messner has stated that the Government will review all the penalties in the Income Tax Assessment Act. Apparently the Australian Democrats are willing to accept that. It is fair to say that from a government with a record such as this Government has-this applies to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in particular-an assurance as vague as an undertaking to conduct a review of the penalties ought not to be taken too seriously. It is quite possible to review all the penalties and to decide they should all be left as they are. We do not believe that an assurance as vague as that from any government ought to be taken . Such a vague assurance from this Government certainly should not be taken. Therefore, we have moved in amendments Nos 6, 7 and 8 that the penalties should be increased to the point where they will be a significant deterrent to this practice which is, in the national sense, even worse than evasion of income tax by individuals within Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has given us an assurance that it has made a decision to review the levels of penalties provided in the Income Tax Assessment Act. It has also given us an assurance that it will bring in a Bill in the Budget session to give effect to that review. We take this as the Government's assurance that it has yielded to the criticism expressed by this chamber that the penalties of 10 per cent are too low and that it will look to see to what degree the penalties should be increased. As far as we are concerned , that is a reasonable assurance by the Government. We think that it is reasonable for the Government to have time to review carefully the whole Act and to come up with its considered position on it. We expect that to be forthcoming in the Budget session. We are now prepared to vote against the amendments proposed by the Australian Labor Party in order to give the Government time to review the position properly. We are not in the business of frustrating governments. If they give us an assurance that they will take note of the expression of opinion in this chamber we are quite happy to let them study the position and come back with their second considered views.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to say that the Australian Democrats are concerned about profit shifting from Australia to any other country. By that I mean that, in addition to being concerned about shifting profits out of Australia into a tax haven such as Hong Kong by transfer pricing or by other devices, we are also concerned about, say, a United States subsidiary in Australia shifting profits from its Australian subsidiary back into the United States. So, our concern is not only with blatant tax dodgers where tax havens are being used, but also with the general principle of profit shifting from Australia to any other country. We believe that transactions betwen subsidiaries of multinational companies should be at arm's length and that that is the criterion the Government should adopt in assessing whether transactions between subsidiary companies are in the interests of the Australian people. The Government, I am sure, is aware of this. I take the comments of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) to mean that these aspects will be taken into consideration in the Government's review. For these reasons, while we are still as concerned as ever that the penalty of 10 per cent is far too low to act as a sufficient deterrent in the vitally important area of profit shifting-an area that has cost Australian governments hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars-we believe it reasonable that the Government has time to come up with its considered opinion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to be offensive to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) and I am sure he will take the comments in the spirit in which they are given. But I thought Senator Siddons stated our position with exquisite clarity. I think the Minister has grasped the point but I am just rising to emphasise it. The Australian Democrats are not concerned just about avoidance of tax by transfer of profits to tax havens such as Hong Kong but also about the notorious practice , which amongst other things was disclosed in the Fitzgerald report and many other reports, of a multinational with a subsidiary in Australia exporting goods to a third party. It invoices those goods not to a third party but to its parent company overseas at cost. So the Australian subsidiary in its profit and loss acount shows sales of goods X, cost of producing those goods X, profits nil, and tax nil. That exercise has been going on in this country for many years. I believe, after talking to retired taxation commissioners, that it is probably the most difficult aspect of transfer pricing or profit shifting to catch. That is the situation to which Senator Siddons was referring on behalf of the Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LH4">Senator JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Provided we have the numbers. The Committee of which I am a member finds that it gets a fairly sound consensus of opinion. Discussions that take place are very fruitful, both for the Government and the Opposition, and the report that is presented is particularly fruitful for the people of Australia. If honourable senators take the time to read the report of the Committee they will agree with my comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I wish to make relates to the Commomwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the reduction, by the Federal Government, of moneys paid to that organisation. That is causing a number of problems both internally within the organisation and externally in the Australian community. One of the real problems is to be found in the fact that the CSIRO has said that it must set priorities in relation to the research being undertaken. It appears to have transferred a number of members of its staff from an area of non-importance, as the CSIRO terms it, to an area of some priority. </PARA>
<PARA> The real problem is what is happening to the research being undertaken in Australia. It is fairly obvious that by cutting back funding and setting priorities those areas of research that are probably not important at this moment but which will be important in the long term to the people of Australia will have to be cut back. Research programs in Australia will be put back something like 10 years. It has to be remembered that when the CSIRO puts together a research team it takes something like 10 years for that team to develop the necessary expertise. It takes something like 10 years for the research to be fruitful and to show some results for the amount of money expended by the Government. The cutback on funding to research groups and the cutback of staff is causing a situation in which research in Australia generally will be placed at least 10 years behind what it should be. With the increased costs that are shown fairly glaringly by the amount of money being spent to purchase in particular scientific and research material it will be put back even further than 10 years. I think my estimate of 10 years is a conservative one. This Government really needs to have a look at the research being undertaken in Australia; it needs to look at the allocation of money to the CSIRO and it needs to look at increasing the amount of money paid to the CSIRO in its Budget allocation to allow it to undertake the sort of research it was talking about prior to the cuts, prior to the decision of the razor gang to reduce moneys paid to that scientific group. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I endorse all of the remarks that have just been made by Senator Jones, particularly with regard to the staff and the work that they have done not only in producing this report but also all the reports that we are helped with on the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate will know that over the last few years I have been quite worried about the amount of expenditure that is being made on research in this country. A little earlier today I pointed out that I thought that there should be more co -operation between universities and private industry and those bodies that get research grants from the Government. That is something that I think the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation could well join in. I believe that governments should encourage universities to do more research in combination with the CSIRO and the general public. It is very important in Australia that we recognise that when there are times of cutbacks, we cannot always cut back everything by the same percentage. I have always been against across the board cuts, whether they be in tariffs, in staff numbers or in expenditure by departments. There are always certain organisations-the CSIRO is certainly one of these-that deserve additional money so that they can continue their research. In the information that was given to us on the Committee the CSIRO pointed out that the costs of doing research increase more rapidly than does the consumer price index; in other words, the CSIRO contends that it should be getting at least 2 to 3 per cent more than the CPI increase just to keep up the research that it has running. </PARA>
<PARA> Not giving enough money to the CSIRO stops forever many new graduates getting a job in the Organisation. There is a tendency for, say, engineering graduates if they do not get a job in the engineering field in the first couple of years that they are out of the university to stay with the other jobs that they do get. It is the same with a scientist who would otherwise be employed by the CSIRO. If the CSIRO cannot accommodate a certain number of new graduates every year then those graduates are lost forever, I believe, to this country. Research that we might have otherwise had is lost forever. I reinforce and repeat one of the Committee's conclusions and recommendations with regard to the CSIRO. Paragraph 3.19 on page 19 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is dissatisfied with the level of resources supplied to the CSIRO . The Committee RECOMMENDS that the CSIRO operating appropriation should initially be increased at the rate of the increase of the Consumer Price Index. The Government should then investigate the claims of the CSIRO that the costs of conducting scientific research increase at a rate two to three per cent greater than the increase in the CPI. If, in a wider study for years beyond 1978-79, the CSIRO claims are substantiated, the Committee RECOMMENDS that the CSIRO operating appropriation should be increased by at least that rate. </PARA>
<PARA>The same thing, I believe, applies to the science and engineering sections of universities. I know that it is the policy of the Government to give a certain grant to a university or college of advanced education, then let it divide that money up within the university or college of advanced education. The institutions do that themselves. I think this is something that perhaps the Government should look at to see whether we should be insisting that research in this country is supported in the way that the Government wants. Research is not a party political matter at all. It is of interest to this entire country. Without enough research I believe that Australia could very easily become an economic backwater with other countries in our near north, in South East Asia, outstripping us in standards of living in the very near future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address myself to item 190 , the Report of the National Health and Medical Research Council on the Health Hazards of Asbestos. When this report was presented in the chamber Senator Georges expressed very strongly his concern at the fact that the report had not been circulated. He also drew to the attention of the Senate the fact that he considered this report to be a very serious one indeed. Both Senator Georges and I have lost our colleague, Jim Roulston, who died from asbestos poisoning. When I addressed the Senate on the matter I pointed out that not only had Jim Roulston died from the effects of asbestos but also a former colleague of mine- this is recorded in Hansard-Gordon Grenville, was suffering very much from the effects of asbestosis. Since then Gordon Grenville has died. Many more people in his age group are suffering from the effects of asbestosis. Therefore we consider this report to be a very important one. On 18 March the then Minister for Health said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two advanced copies of the Report have been placed in the Parliamentary Library . Arrangements are under way for the printing of the report-therefore copies are not immediately available to the public. However, for sale copies will be obtainable from the Australian Government Publishing Service when these are printed. </PARA>
<PARA>That was six weeks ago. No honourable senator has been issued with a copy of that report since then. I managed to get hold of the report in the Parliamentary Library and went through it. I have some criticisms of the report. As a matter of fact the whole question of health, safety and welfare rather aggravates me. It only substantiates what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) said in an address he gave in Melbourne on Saturday, 7 December. A paragraph from that address reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister and his colleagues are quick enough to collect and disseminate statistics dealing with industrial disputes. In fact, I'd like to set the record straight in this regard. In 1980, 3.3 million working days were lost because of industrial action and wages lost amounted to $152m. Industrial accidents, by contrast, resulted in more than five million working days being lost and $230m in wages. It seems extraordinary to me that so much effort is put into measuring the duration of strikes and so little into the effects of work related accidents and illnesses, which are by far the greater problem. </PARA>
<PARA>I think this manifests itself in the lackadaisical manner in which this report has been handled. Recommendation 1 in the Report states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . exposure to asbestos should, in all phases of the asbestos industry, be reduced to the lowest practicable level by the most efficient technology currently available and enforced. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no mention of how this recommendation should be enforced. I suggest that strict legislative controls should be introduced, with prosecutions and heavy fines for breaches. The Federal Government should accept this responsibility. It is quick enough to pick up the statistics in regard to industrial disputes but it is not prepared to consider the time lost and the effects on the nation of industrial accidents and sickness. In Recommendation 1, various asbestos fibres are distinguished as being more hazardous than others when breathed into the lungs over varying periods of time. I see no point in making this distinction when the Asbestos ad hoc Sub-committee admits in its report that it is internationally recognised that all asbestos is hazardous. Therefore the only safe exposure is no exposure at all. </PARA>
<PARA> In Recommendation 2 the sub-committee recommends that appropriate legislation be introduced to ensure maximum protection of workers and the general public exposed to existing materials containing crocidolite. My question to the sub- committee is: Why should we not have appropriate legislation relating to all types of asbestos, since it is recognised that all types of asbestos are dangerous?</PARA>
<PARA> In recommendation 5 the sub-committee notes that available evidence indicates no significant risk to public health from the contamination of the ambient air, food or drink by asbestos. I find this difficult to believe. In fact, this was exactly the propaganda put out about occupational exposure. We should look at the horrific situation at present, with asbestosis, mesothelioma and the like. There is a terrible rate of chronic illness and death in people who have worked with asbestos. In recommendation 8 the sub-committee noted the marked influence of smoking on the incidence of lung cancer in asbestos workers and recommended that preference be given to non-smokers for employment requiring exposure to asbestos. If the problem is as serious as that, I suggest that only non-smokers be employed and that compulsory licences should be issued to employers who are slack in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> In recommendation 9 the sub-committee noted the need for research into mesothelioma in Australia and supported the maintenance of a surveillance program. It recommended the program to the Government and the asbestos industry for long term support. Why did it not also recommend it to the unions? Did the Committee not consider them capable of being involved in such a program? It completely neglected the unions' role. I suggest that they are capable and morally obliged to be involved. My own union has been very much involved in health and safety issues. After all, it is the workers in that union who are being exposed to asbestos. I will give an example of the work that my union has done in this field. The Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union has issued an elaborate book on health and safety. It has gone to a lot of trouble to draw it to the attention of its workers. We always hear the AMWSU condemned in this place. No one seems to have a good word for it, especially those honourable senators on the opposite side of the chamber. It is an excellent book that has been issued to the shop stewards and many other people drawing the attention of workers to the health hazards in industry. It would be impossible to have the book incorporated in Hansard, but I seek leave to have the accompanying letter to the brothers and sisters of the union incorporated in Hansard, to point out how responsible the AMWSU is, especially in that field. </PARA>

<PARA>January, 1982 Dear Brothers and Sisters,</PARA>
<PARA> The AMWSU has played a leading role in the assault on poor and inadequate safety conditions for workers. At its 1978 National Conference, the Union identified major health and safety areas for immediate research and action, and backed up its concern by appointing two full-time Health and Safety Officers. </PARA>
<PARA> Stationed in Melbourne and Sydney, these Officers have worked tirelessly over the last two years to alert workers to the hazards in their working environment. Health and Safety Schools have been well attended by members, and every Basic Shop Stewards' School has included Occupational Health and Safety as a major topic. </PARA>
<PARA> Through their work, this manual has been produced. It is designed to increase awareness of the health risks members are facing every day, or could face in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Used as a reference text, it can assist members to identify dangers in the workplace and to take appropriate action. The comprehensive Table of Dangerous Substances will give members instant access to the damaging effects of most chemicals encountered at work, and the maximum concentration levels set by industry: A convincing argument to use against exposure or over-exposure to certain chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> The manual extensively covers the most prevalent industrial disease suffered by metalworkers, industrial deafness. In conjunction with this Manual, the Union has produced a video on the problems and possible solutions to this increasing problem. Your Organiser or State Education Officer can arrange a showing at your workplace by appointment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Union will continue to make occupational health and safety a priority, and hopes this manual will assist our members to assist us in our efforts to secure for all workers a safer and healthier working environment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Further to the sub-committee's recommendations about bringing to the attention of Commonwealth and State authorities the disparity of provision for compensation among the States, I suggest they should also have drawn to their attention the difficulty of the individual worker who has the onus of proof forced upon him. That has been the case with very many of the workers involved in the asbestos industry. Establishing proof is a difficult and expensive job. When I listened to the garbage that was debated in this place, seeking to allow freeloaders to gain the benefits won by the unions, I wondered whether such people ever consider the amount of money that is involved in research or the amount of fighting that has to be done on behalf of people who have been affected by asbestosis. Perhaps some day they will be affected. They will sing a different song when it happens to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The crux of the report is that there is no identifiable threshold below which there is no evidence of risk. This is recognised in the report under the section headed 'The Health Hazards of Asbestos'. The sub-committee supported the view that there should be a continuing requirement to reduce the exposure to all forms of asbestos to the minimum that is reasonably practical but there was a let-out for the employers. There was nothing at all about an obligation upon them to undertake some responsibility. In this section the sub-committee also mentioned one known Australian manufacturer using amosite-brown asbestos-for the production of asbestos cement, building materials and water pipes. The manufacturer said that if a lower standard of asbestos hygiene standards were introduced the industry would be forced to consider seriously the exclusion of the use of amosite in building materials. The sub-committee was reluctant, because of the unnamed manufacturer's problem, to recommend any reductions in the hygiene standards for amosite greater than that for white asbestos. I suggest that this example is exactly why the Government should introduce strict legislative controls and reinforce existing controls. </PARA>
<PARA> The sub-committee also agreed that there is a continuing need for the employer to provide facilities and control measures to ensure that asbestos dust is not transported by the worker to his home. I suggest that prosecutions and heavy fines should be enforced for breaches of such standards. This report has been of great interest to me. I certainly hope that the Government will soon have enough copies for members of the Parliament to have one each and that it will also make it available to the public. I believe it should make it available to the unions which are involved in this industry. I issue a warning to the Government: Where milling and manufacture of asbestos is regulated, as in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, manufacturers simply close factories and transfer their enterprises to India, Mexico, Venezuela, and other Third World countries where there are no legislative controls or unions to protect the workers in those countries. From the way in which we go about introducing legislation today -continually mucking around with conciliation and arbitration-it is no wonder that health hazards continue amongst the workers. Unions are necessary to fight on behalf of the workers because it seems that the Government is not much interested in the health, safety and welfare of workers. We should be passing some proper laws. I refer to a report by the Senior Commissioner of the Western Australian Industrial Commission. He talked about bad laws and good laws and said that there seems to be no regulation of laws regarding, health, safety and welfare. His report concerned a matter which we dealt with recently but it is still relevant. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Legislative provisions which are the subject of frequent abuse and which experience has shown are not or cannot sensibly be enforced by the State tend to bring into disrepute the whole of the law in which those provisions are found, the courts which administer that law and, in the final analysis, the system of law in general, and should, for those reasons, be removed from the statutes in which they appear. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement applies to the legislation that we debated yesterday. We had the sense to set up a committee to look at it. I heard Senator Chaney talk about those who work under the legislation, those who are subject to it and those who administer it. The unions have reached the stage at which they could not care less what legislation is passed. If I were back in the workshops I would agree with them. I would fight against social injustice irrespective of the law. If the Government cannot introduce good legislation to protect the health of the workers, why should I bother about legislation that restricts and pushes the unions back into the barricades?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on the report of the Asbestos ad hoc Sub-committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council. We have heard so much in this place and in many other places about what smoking does to the community. I have no complaint whatsoever about the medical profession and its campaign against smoking. But I query why it has not pointed out to the general population the dangers of asbestos. In 1918 in America the Canadian insurance companies refused to insure any worker in the asbestos industries. By 1930 the scientific tests on the dangers of asbestos had been carried out. The dangers were known to the medical profession in 1930. They were documented by Professor Epstein. I ask the question: Why has the medical profession been so pure in raising the dangers of contracting cancer from tobacco when it knew, in 1930, that all people working in the asbestos industry would most certainly have their lives shortened because they would develop asbestosis?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that not only should there be an investigation into what is causing the increase in lung cancer but also there are probably many other pollutants in industry about which the medical profession has knowledge that are a grave danger to people's health in the work place and in the community. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O97">Senator ELSTOB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have always admired Senator Peter Baume when he has spoken about the tobacco industry. He wholeheartedly believes what he says. But I ask why the medical profession has not come out publicly, as it has about the dangers of tobacco, and alerted the people to the dangers of other pollutants in industry. The medical profession knew of the dangers in 1930 after medical tests had been carried out, but it did not really alert the community to the dangers. Only in the last few years have people become aware that they were causing themselves grave danger. Had the people been alerted some years ago they could at least have taken some precautions to overcome those dangers. I say again as I have said before that governments have to pick up the costs. The cost to the community must be considered; it is one of the important factors. These costs eventually become part of the social welfare bill. We have to consider not only the financial costs but also the destruction of family life and therefore the destruction of the whole of society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that we should be told about the dangers of other pollutants. Senator Baume is aware that for some time I have wanted the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare to consider the dangers of what is happening in the work place and in the community. I believe that the dangers that exist are overwhelming. It is not that we should brush these dangers off. I do not believe that the majority of industries are deliberately harming people. I do not believe that sufficient information is available. I remember that when wheat was being gassed on the waterfront to kill the weevils many people became ill. They were told that there was nothing in the gas to harm them. A poisonous gas was being used and, as a result, in the next six months in Melbourne four men died. That shows that if we had been fully aware of the problems precautions could have been taken. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that asbestos is a great material. It is indestructible. It can be left in the weather and will not deteriorate. Because it does not rot or decay it is of grave danger to man. It is still being used. Every time we apply the car brakes or put our foot on the clutch, microscopic asbestos fibres are put into the atmosphere. Many people are unaware of that. Every person in the community, some more than others, is affected by asbestosis. I think that is wrong. We have developed other materials over the years, but people are still using asbestos. I have seen handy people, instead of cutting asbestos sheets with a special knife devised for that purpose, use a saw unaware that asbestos fibres were entering their lungs, their wife's lungs and their children's lungs. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that if grave dangers exist from smoking then the medical profession should explain the other hazards to the community. I think Senate committees should take a serious look at these problems because the costs will be astronomical. People will pay for this negligence three times over. They will pay for it through not only the suffering and misery caused by these pollutants but also higher taxes so that governments can maintain families and hospitals. People pay many times over. I think the majority of these problems can be overcome if people are made aware of them. In the toolmaking trade, which is Senator McIntosh's industry, a lot of machine cut oil is used. Cancer of the scrotum resulted because that oil was not kept away from the toolmaker by an apron. Thousands of people have probably contracted this type of cancer unnecessarily. People working with lead today are most certainly affected. I could mention many other pollutants. I believe that it is time that people were fully informed of the grave dangers that exist. I support Senator McIntosh in his plea to the Government to consider this matter. I believe that any action will benefit the whole of the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not hesitate in using what time I have in supporting this document. I am giving a commercial. The officers and various groups associated with the Heritage Commission are to be commended on this report. One or two comments made in the report need to be referred to briefly. On page 194 in the chapter 'Summary and conclusion' of the document entitled 'The National Estate in 1981' the following reference appears:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commission has had very little money available to engage directly in research-despite comments from Parliamentary committees on the value of such research. It has, however, been able to use its influence to generate a comprehensive series of research projects through the National Estate grants program. </PARA>
<PARA>(Quorum formed). I will take just one or two minutes to re-emphasise the need to make research moneys available to the Heritage Commission so that it can further enhance its work and do that research which is necessary throughout Australia to protect our environment and, of course, in that way our heritage. It seems to me unreasonable that the Senate should be reminded of the lack of research moneys for the Commission. The Commission has done very well, as it says, by taking advantage of the grants that have been made to the National Estate program. Nevertheless, if the unique quality of our environment is to be protected and maintained moneys have to be made available to the Heritage Commission to carry out its work in the area of research. A whole series of instances within this chapter entitled 'Summary and conclusion' indicate much that is to the credit of the Commission. The chapter states:</PARA>
<PARA> It has prepared a comprehensive Register of the National Estate in a remarkably short time. </PARA>
<PARA>The report makes many references to the gaps in the register. It also states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . these comments should not in any way be interpreted as a diminution of its status. The places currently included in the Register include the most significant natural, Aboriginal, and historic places known in Australia. The current Register will remain the core of all future listings. Other countries have taken decades to assemble a first overall list of the calibre of the current Register of the National Estate . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is self-praise. I am prepared to add to that praise because the register has been very effective and most enlightening for me and for many Australians who were not aware of the depth of achievement within Australia. The document does on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . all recognise that the full development of the National Register lists will take decades to complete. The task facing the Commission was greater than that faced by any other country, since to the Commission's knowledge there is no single national register in any country which combines such a wide range of places, both natural and cultural. The effort required to assemble the Register in the face of a great deal of hostility and misunderstanding also deserves comment. </PARA>
<PARA>It says 'in the face of a great deal of hostility and misunderstanding'. In no place is that more apparent than in Queensland. The National Party Government in Queensland-that is what it is because the Liberal Party is merely a shadow support of the National Party and when it comes to the test has very little impact on the decisions of the day-under the rather odd leadership of Bjelke- Petersen has caused, to my knowledge, a great deal of hostility and misunderstanding in relation to the efforts of the Heritage Commission. One could refer to the classic case-if one could use that term to describe that act of vandalism-of when the Bellevue Hotel was destroyed in the middle of the night on the instruction of the Premier of Queensland. That hotel, which was of particular character and beauty in its heyday, was progressively destroyed by the Government of the day to justify its eventual demolition. That was a very effective part of our heritage which needed to be preserved, but in Queensland that was not to be the case. For that reason I can understand the phrase contained within the 'Summary and conclusion' chapter which says that a great deal of hostility-that was the case in Queensland-and misunderstanding exists in relation to the work of the Heritage Commission. I would say that this document, 'The National Estate in 1981', will at least reduce or remove the misunderstanding. Whether it will remove the hostility in some places remains to be seen. The document goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The technical development of the Register system was a huge task in itself. A major effort related to the Register has been the preparation of the material required for The Heritage of Australia, the Commission's publication on the Register. The Commission recognised that it could not on its own underwrite the cost of this publication, estimated at over $500,000. Following an initial approach to the Australian Government Publishing Service, the Commission set out its requirements and invited proposals from major private publishers in Australia. The proposal made by Macmillan Company of Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>This is relevant because I am leading to the point that the Heritage Commission was unable to obtain the funds necessary for it to carry out its work. The Commission had to resort to the private sector in order to get the Register established. I think it is a serious commentary on the Government of the day that a very important commission should have to depend upon private benefactors to carry out what one must consider to be a very important task, the establishment of the Register. The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA> The proposal made by Macmillan Company of Australia closely matched the Commission's objective. The Commission has not only devoted a vast amount of staff time over the last two years to the technical preparation of the book, it also took an active part in the search for commercial backers. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission had to hawk itself across Australia in order to obtain the sum of $500,000, an amount which this Government wastes in a day by failing, in a variety of ways, to see that money is either properly expended, or, to quote Senator Walsh, that money is properly collected. If the Government acted as it should, the Heritage Commission would be able more quickly to receive the funds directly from the Parliament and would not have to search out commercial backers . The report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . thanks to the generosity of H. C. Sleigh Ltd and CRA Ltd, The Heritage of Australia has been published at a reasonable price, given its size and quality ( 1,200 pages and 8,500 photographs including many in colour). </PARA>
<PARA>The presentation of those photographs is excellent. The Heritage Commission, in a short time and against great difficulties, has achieved an enormous amount. It must be satisfying to Australians in general to have documents which effectively describe the character of the Australian scene, the Australian society and its development. Much that is displayed in this report, 'The National Estate in 1981 ', we take as commonplace. I noticed a plate depicting Ravenshoe in Queensland. I suppose I have passed that place on a number of occasions but I had never been attracted to its uniqueness or its character until I saw it displayed in this book. </PARA>

<PARA> The next report to which I refer is the fourth annual report of the Australian Heritage Commission. I may have made a rather unkind comment about the lateness of a previous report. I do not know whether I ever apologised for that remark, but now, when I see the quality of the work before us, I apologise for any remark I may have made previously which offended the executive of the Heritage Commission. Under the heading 'The present condition of the National Estate' the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> During the year the Commonwealth Government announced its decision to nominate Kakadu National Park for inclusion in the World Heritage List. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a very important decision supported by a remarkable film recently shown at Parliament House entitled The Images of Man. If I may give out commercials, let me give one out for that film. The film really penetrates ignorance on the part of many Australians. I am prepared to admit it certainly penetrated my ignorance of what has existed for many thousands of years in Australia. It showed arts which could be described only as superb. Too many of us look at Aboriginal art as gimmickry objects which we buy in curio and tourist shops. But there was a sophistication about the art shown in that film which was quite moving. It highlighted the need for the acceleration of protection. It pointed very strongly to the need to accelerate funding of the Heritage Commission and to have certain areas included in the National Estate. It is hoped that by including them in the National Estate they will be protected and suitably brought to the notice of a wide range of people. The Commission commends the Government-I suppose I also indirectly commend the Government-for the decision to nominate the Kakadu National Park for inclusion as part of the World Heritage List. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission would also like to see the Great Barrier Reef Region and the balance of the area now listed on the Register of the National Estate as the Kakadu Region nominated to the World Heritage List as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>I take this opportunity to support that. In fact, I find very little in the whole of this report which I cannot support. Practically every paragraph mentions initiatives taken or decisions made by the Heritage Commission which are worthy of support. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> In an interesting initiative, Australia's four learned academies (Science, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Technological Sciences) have formed a Joint Committee on the Protection of Prehistoric Places, to 'foster studies on the prehistory of man in Australia, to encourage the protection and preservation of archaeological sites, and to advise on action that should be taken on this and related matters'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is hoped that this encouraging collaboration will assist the cause of public education . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I most certainly think it will do so, and will add more strength to these organisations. I have spent some time on this matter; nevertheless I think the matter is important. The report goes on to refer to the great public concern voiced during the year about the Great Barrier Reef. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The declaration of the first stage of the Marine Park was announced in October 1979. Since then there has been an active public campaign for immediate extension of the Park. During the year the Government determined a ten year moratorium on oil drilling and the Prime Minister in June 1980 announced that he hoped that the Great Barrier Reef would soon be nominated for World Heritage Listing. </PARA>
<PARA>That is all very fine and all very supportable. What is happening in Queensland has again come up against the barrier of what can only be described as a government of vandals. The Queensland Government has no concern about protecting the environment and no deep concern about the protecting of the Great Barrier Reef. It is astonishing that there should be so little feeling for the protection of an area which has been described many times, by both individuals and organisations, as one of great significance ecologically. It is an ecosystem of great delicate beauty and an ecosystem of sensitive balance. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been pointed out by many honourable senators and Senate committees that to protect the area one must protect the whole area. The sooner we establish that fact the better. In order to protect the whole of the ecosystem, the whole of the Barrier Reef must be declared a national park. There is a great danger-I think the heritage Commission appreciates this-that the Great Barrier Reef may be fragmented. In that fragmentation the whole of the Reef may be lost. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The reef remains the focus of great interest and concern to people in all parts of Australia as well as to scientists and others overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Second World Wilderness Congress was held in Cairns in June. The Congress placed considerable emphasis on conservation issues related to North Queensland and to other major wilderness areas in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Great Barrier Reef headed the list. The report also mentions Cape York and South West Tasmania. I do not know whether I should concentrate on South West Tasmania because I may commence some sort of tribal fight in this place. I know that the Tasmanians are emotionally disturbed by attempts to destroy the wilderness areas in South West Tasmania. I will leave that to the Tasmanians. I will concentrate on my own area, the Great Barrier Reef. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The Congress passed a series of resolutions related to these areas, including resolutions calling for the protection of Aboriginal rights in conservation areas. </PARA>
<PARA>The report mentions, point after point, the areas of concern. The Commission says that a further issue of concern, which has attracted considerable public attention in Queensland, is the mining in the Mount Etna area. The report states :</PARA>
<PARA> this remarkable mountain contains numerous caves and clefts, one of which harbours a rare bat colony. The mountain is both aesthetically beautiful and scientifically important. Mining for cement production could alter both these values. </PARA>
<PARA>(Quorum formed). Before the quorum was called, I was speaking to the fourth annual report of the Australian Heritage Commission. Amongst other matters I was referring to the Great Barrier Reef and the mining for limestone at Mount Etna. I was making the point that the Heritage Commission during the year has been responsible for considerable efforts in the protection of our environment and of our heritage. My time has almost expired. I would have liked to have gone on with further matters. </PARA>

That philosophy is fairly popular in this community. I can well understand the honourable senator making that point clear. He seems to be backed by the law which says that it is a crime to destroy the environment and to destroy whales but it is not a crime to kill the unborn. That is the underlying philosophy of the honourable senator's thesis today. It seems to me that that thesis is backed up by the law. So he has something going for him, even if I do not approve of it . I believe that most of us in this Senate and in the community like and want clean air, clean water and pleasant surroundings. These are very useful and necessary parts of modern life and are certainly preferred to the opposite. But I believe we can achieve all of these things without the excessive efforts of the Heritage Commission, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service and various other bodies that are mentioned in the science and environment papers. I believe we can achieve all of these things without them. It seems to me that all these bodies soak up huge amounts of public money for very little real benefit to the people of this country. I do not know how taxpayers on this side of the continent feel about it, but taxpayers on the side of the continent from which I come have just about had a gutful.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I came into the chamber after having got in the Library an excellent new book called The Management of Sustainable Growth which I propose to recommend to Senator Martyr so that he can educate himself in modern ways of looking at things and possible solutions to some of the problems which he raised in the rather choleric outburst which I heard when I came in here and which I could not allow to pass without some kind of comment. Senator Martyr does not like environmentalists. He has made that point of view quite clear. He calls them 'trendies' and 'greenies' and all sorts of things like that . I will not be tempted to refer to him in similar but negative terms but will merely reason with him, as I have always found that in this place it is possible to reason with Senator Martyr. I will attempt to do so again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggest to Senator Martyr that the real problem in this area is not that all sorts of people in all parts of Australia are interesting themselves in various causes and that he sometimes finds this exasperating, that business finds it exasperating and that many people who are not interested in those causes find it exasperating. That, I think, is not the real key to this problem. Surely the real key to this problem is that we have allowed society to go on to the extent where there is no basic consensus in the community as to what should be allowed and what should not be allowed, especially where public lands are concerned. I think this is really the basic problem. It is a planning problem, if I can mention to a good Liberal that almost unmentionable word 'planning' again. This seems to me the real point at issue. If we were now, in a substantial way, to look at land use, the use of all kinds of assets-natural and commercial-in the country, the use of rain forests, coastal land and agricultural land and try to work out between us what was acceptable and what was not acceptable to the community at large, what was in the best interests of the community at large and what was not, I suggest that we would have overcome this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the answer to it. I say this because I think it is abundantly clear that we will go on having more and more environmental groups, community groups and citizen groups protesting about more and more things and because, as the world gets more and more crowded and as assets and natural resources are generally run down, the pressures on those things become greater. The situation which Senator Martyr abhors will not get any better. It will not be remedied by the Government saying: 'Let us tear up all this paper. Let us get rid of all these people who persistently raise these matters'. The Government simply will not be able to do that. I think the answer lies in seeking the reason for all these things. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with Senator Martyr that it is thoroughly messy and untidy for the community to organise itself regularly every year into perhaps hundreds of small interest groups to take up a particular issue. These groups work hard at the issue and engage constantly in controversy about it and battle with other interest groups for months and sometimes years on end at great cost to themselves and the community. All of this could be sorted out by a reasonable and rational look at what should be done in that general area. I think our society should be capable of that. It should not be a task which is beyond it. Often in this world it is more a matter of identifying problems than solving them. Once the problem is identified we often find that it is solved. The difficulty lies in trying to identify it. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the environmental movement is concerned with what is happening on public land. It is all very well for people who want to exploit rain forests in public lands-which, I think Senator Martyr would agree, are the property of the people-to say: 'We should be allowed to do this without being fettered. Environmentalists who come along to try to stop us are nuisances'. I cannot accept that or see it as a reasonable point of view. I do not think it is reasonable for people to come and say that merely because they can provide or maintain employment. I could provide immediately employment for a large number of people by taking over large sections of the botanical gardens in Melbourne, Sydney or anywhere else, ploughing them up and planting them out to potatoes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is Senator Martyr seriously suggesting that that would be an acceptable area of entrepreneurship? If that is what he is suggesting I would be disappointed in him. I am saying that that is analogous. I think we get a reductio ad absurdum by bringing the debate to that level. I am sure Senator Martyr would not go on record as saying that it would be a good idea that he and I should form a company and make money by employing people to plough up all of the Melbourne Botanical Gardens and plant potatoes or any other thing. We would probably do a lot better by planting it out to marihuana or to heroin. In that way we would make a lot more money and we would certainly employ people. But those are not socially acceptable objectives. It is a socially accepted objective that the Melbourne Botanical Gardens and the Sydney Botanical Gardens should be kept in their present state. Honourable senators might ask why. This is at the core of our argument. These gardens are things of recreational, aesthetic and great value. So those huge areas in those cities which are probably worth billions of dollars just in land value alone are kept as they are because of public consensus. It is not good enough for the Government to say that that is acceptable and then not to accept the principle that other public lands, simply because they are more remote, simply because they have had some sort of history of exploitation, will be treated any differently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Exploitation of beachfronts, forests or any public land must become a matter of community debate. That community debate is always valid. We are supposed to be guardians of a proper democracy and of public feeling. I suppose we would be failing in our duty if we did not support that to the hilt. I have some criticism of the Government because of its undoubtedly ambivalent view towards the environmental movements. I have said before in this place and I will say again that these are not people trying to preserve something for their own benefit; they get nothing out of it. There is nothing in it for them except hard work and the spending of their own money. They are looking quite honestly and quite definitely towards the future. They say that something like a rain forest has the same aesthetic and recreational value-perhaps an even greater value-as the Melbourne Botanical Gardens and it should be preserved in the same way. I seek Senator Martyr's assistance and co-operation in furthering this great cause as I see his point of view as being substantially one with which a large number of people sympathise. </PARA>

Surely public revenue is devoted to the upkeep of those gardens. Would the honourable senator say that only those people who think the gardens are of value should be levied to pay for their upkeep? Of course not. If the honourable senator were charged with that responsibility naturally he would say that it is a matter for the public purse to look after. This applies to historical matters as well as environmental matters. If people do not preserve rainforests or stop them from being cut down or destroyed completely, in a period of 10 years no rainforests will be left. It is not good enough to have mere regrowth of a rainforest. That is not an adequate replacement for the real thing? Surely those environmentalists have a right to say these things? Surely they have a right to write reports and to demand things? Just as surely they have a right to all the support from the community that they can be given including support from the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak also to the annual report of the Official Establishments Trust. I say at the outset that it would be impossible for a person interested in these many reports, ridiculed as they are by Senator Martyr, to discuss them all. There are 18 reports before the Senate. If any honourable senator wanted to devote his half hour speaking time to even six of those reports he would have five minutes to speak on each. How can anyone link one report with another? It is just an impossibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I made such remarks when the new Standing Orders were agreed to in this place. Eventually we will prove that it will not work. Under the old system on a Thursday night honourable senators had two hours within which to get together their thoughts on the matters on which they wished to speak. But today we sit in this chamber from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. without a break. If an honourable senator has an interest in a certain item which is to be debated he or she cannot leave the place until it has gone through. If one leaves the Senate chamber and tries to do some work one might miss one's opportunity to speak. One cannot devote all of one's time to sitting in the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA> My colleague, Senator Georges, was certainly caught short, as he has been on other occasions in the Senate. He devoted the whole of his half an hour to speaking to the report of the Australian Heritage Commission. He has previously shown a great interest in the Great Barrier Reef. I suppose that he has spoken more in this place on the Great Barrier Reef than has any other honourable senator. But because of this stupid Standing Order he is prevented from discussing these papers. After this matter has been concluded this evening it disappears completely from the Notice Paper and will not come back again. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not my intention to speak to any of these reports. I just wanted to reply to Senator Martyr's statement that hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money are wasted on environmental reports. He ought to get himself out into the country areas of Western Australia. He should have a look at the rape of that country and at the amount of land which has been cleared. He ought to come to my State. I will take him into the Murray mallee scrub and see how hungry farmers in years gone by have cleared every tree from the land. Under normal rainfall the ground starts to blow and covers fences, houses, roads and railway lines. Then there is the enormous cost to the taxpayer in trying to clear those roads and railways so that people have access from one town to another. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that, when Senator Martyr spoke tonight, he gave due thought to what he was saying otherwise he would not have said what he did. He said that he was speaking on his own behalf. I am pleased that he was. If he were speaking on behalf of the Government I am sure that he would get the Government into serious problems. These reports are not rubbish. They are Government reports; many are prepared by the Government departments that instituted these inquiries. Some have been prepared by Senate committees with which we will deal a little later. Of course, Senator Martyr serves on some of those Senate committees. I hope that when those reports are dealt with he will not say that they are rubbish. If he does he should not be a member on those committees. I rebut everything that he said about the reports being rubbish. Once they are tabled in the Parliament I receive many requests from interested parties and persons who want copies of the reports so that they can read their content. Over the years some of these reports have had a very great effect on and have been of great benefit to the citizens of Australia. We are now waking up to the fact that we have to have environmental protection. We have to have it because the people, such as Senator Martyr and many of the members of his party, are interested only in raping the country to get a dollar out of it. Never mind what is left behind; leave a great hole in the ground! Just leave it there for our children and our children's children. What will they say about the honourable senator in the years to come? Some of the honourable senator's children and grandchildren, when they read the honourable senator's remarks which were made in the Senate today, will think back and say: 'Well, what sort of a grandfather did I have? Look at the conditions that I live under now. He said that it was only rubbish, that it was a waste of public money'. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a few remarks on the next group of reports. I think I have said enough on this group. I hope, as I said before, that the Senate Standing Committee on Standing Orders will have another look at the bind that we have got ourselves into with these changed hours and changed methods of dealing not only with legislation but also with reports such as those that we are dealing with tonight and will come down on the side of common sense. Let us get back to the system that we used to have in this Parliament when, on the day that these reports were presented any honourable senator who was interested could speak on them if he wanted to. Now honourable senators cannot do this. There is a time limit of 90 minutes for debate. The reports are then shoved off. Some of the reports that are listed now were tabled in the Parliament in 1978. We are now debating them here in May 1982. They are all lumped together. Of course, we are told that we have to speak on all of these reports, more or less in the one breath. It is impossible to do that. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Jones-I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. I know that there is before us a motion in relation to grouping the Orders of the Day. But I think it is worthwhile to point out that on the Notice Paper we have Order of the Day No. 8, Trade and Commerce Group of Papers-that is correct-and Order of the Day No. 9, Science and Environment Group of Papers. At the bottom of that there are Orders of the Day Nos 148 and 190. There was no motion to include those Orders of the Day, although the Chair allowed Senator McIntosh to debate an Order of the Day and refused permission for Senator Georges to debate an Order of the Day. I notice that in Order of the Day No. 10, Primary Industry Group of Papers, there is one paper on the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation and we then have Orders of the Day Nos 11, 12,, 13, 14, 15, 16, 29, 38, 39 and so on. We now have a motion to group them together. It seems to me that the Chair's refusal to allow Senator Georges to debate the matter was incorrect because of the way in which this list is set out.</PARA>

<PARA> Senator Georges-I wish to speak to the point of order. What emerges out of this , of course, is that we have almost 30 papers before us-I am just guessing now; I just took the first group encountered and assumed that we had about 30 papers before us. The time given to an honourable senator to speak is just one half hour. For the sake of my argument, if I wanted to speak on every one of those matters I would have one minute to speak on each. Surely that was not the intention when we agreed on a procedure, for debating papers.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Grimes-No. You would not have wanted to speak to that many.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Georges-Previously I wanted to speak to three reports. As it turned out it took me 30 minutes to speak on the first one, so I had no time left for the other two. In this case I notice that Senator McLaren indicated his intention to speak to every one of these. Senator McLaren is to continue his remarks on practically every one of those reports-at least 20 of them. He has a right to speak on every one of them. The Senate, by this motion, will rob him of that right. There is something wrong with the system that has emerged in this place. I raise that objection now because I think that we will have to take another look at the relevant sessional order.</PARA>

This is one method which the Standing Orders Committee has come up with.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the motion, not to the papers. The motion now before the Chair is that we deal cognately with all the papers that are listed. If the motion is carried I will have 30 minutes in which to speak to 20 of those papers. As I pointed out in relation to the previous list, it is physically impossible to do that. Some of the papers that have been dragged up for debate tonight- those at the top of the list, starting with Order of the Day No. 10-are nearly two years old. Yet the last couple of papers on the list came in only last week. I ask the Minister when he speaks to the motion to state how I can possibly tie in a debate on the dried fruits industry with the poultry industry, the dairying industry, the meat research industry, the pig industry, the chicken industry, the Forestry Council, the Meat and Livestock Corporation, the Wool Corporation, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, the Wheat Board, the Honey Board, the Egg Board, the fishing industry , the Rural Research and Extension Council-of course, that organisation no longer exists; it has gone out of existence because of a determination of the razor gang-and the Industries Assistance Commission report on fruit and fruit products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How in the world can any person, however capable he may be, speak to all of those papers in one speech? It is just physically impossible to do so. That is why I objected when you, Mr Acting Deputy President, stopped Senator Georges from speaking in the debate on the previous group of papers. It was not possible for him to make a comprehensive contribution to the debate which bore any sense at all while trying to deal with all the papers together. If he had not entered the debate the papers would have disappeared from the Notice Paper. </PARA>
<PARA> I am opposed to the motion which the Minister has moved. I know that it will cause some havoc but I will be speaking again at 6.15 because again we are to depart from the Standing Orders of the Senate and I think, by agreement, even from the present sessional orders. They are again to be thrown out the window as I said they would last week. Because some member of the Government wants to have some legislation passed, arrangements can be made and the sessional orders do not mean a thing to the Senate. In years gone by I have always supported my former Senate colleague, Jim Cavanagh, in opposing any removal of the rights of honourable senators to speak on General Business. I am now informed that there is a move afoot to take away 45 minutes of the time set down for General Business to allow the Senate to deal with Government Business. I have warned over the years that these things would happen when we started tinkering with the Standing Orders. Honourable senators' rights are taken away from them. It is physically impossible for me to speak to all of the reports listed under my name on the Notice Paper-20 in all. I cannot do it. I am opposed to the motion moved by the Minister. </PARA>

It was not a Government decision that he should move that motion. As I said to Senator Georges, we have always had difficulty with honourable senators wishing to speak to papers. The method we are presently following has been agreed to by the Standing Orders Committee. It was debated in this chamber and agreed to by the Senate.

It is not the fault of the Minister. The Whips, of course, met earlier today. We knew that under the sessional order the trade and commerce papers would be treated as one group and that the science and environment papers would be dealt with in another group. The Minister has moved that the primary industry papers be dealt with in a group. I agree with what Senator McLaren has said. It is virtually impossible for anybody to deal with more than one or two reports in the time that is available.

There are matters relating to the egg industry which could be brought together, but how do we combine the very important report of the Industries Assistance Commission on the Bovine Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign with other items? That is a very important subject which needs a full debate. At least honourable senators need the facilities to enter in depth into a debate on that matter because the beef industry has problems. There are problems in the Northern Territory which, if not solved, may seriously affect our meat export industry. We cannot just brush this matter aside in a short debate in which some 25 other items are dealt with. I suggest that we could debate item No. 11, which relates to the poultry industry, together with the paper relating to pigs. Can we include pigs with poultry?</PARA></TALK.START>

Items relating to fisheries could all be brought together. The reports of the Apple and Pear Corporation and the Dried Fruits Corporation could be grouped together. But to bundle all those items into a single list and to give honourable senators half an hour in which to cover the whole ambit, I think is ridiculous. It is an absurdity which has emerged because those who are organising the program intend to brush aside as many of these reports as possible and to take them off the Notice Paper as quickly as possible. Senator Martyr agrees with that, of course. I have a feeling that he does not want anything serious to be debated in this place. His levity in referring to my comments on the environment seems to indicate that he thinks that anything that is important to the environment, or anything that is important to debate in this place, should be quickly brushed to one side and that he should concentrate on his own particular problem and concern. I just point out that if we cannot quickly change the sessional order that now is part of our proceedings, at least the lists should not be as lengthy as those before us tonight.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The procedure that we are discussing has been in operation for quite a long time. It was brought in to enable honourable senators to debate the various subjects that are listed under General Business Orders of the Day. Before any arrangement was made, when a report was tabled in the Senate, debate on the report was adjourned and the matter was listed on the Notice Paper. The Notice Paper got longer and longer. The matter never came up for people to be able to have a say on it. There was no debate because it was never brought forward. Some time last year, in an effort to give honourable senators an opportunity of debating these matters-many had expressed their disappointment that they were not able to speak on the reports when they were actually tabled-a system was devised so that on each Thursday, under General Business, a group of reports could be brought forward under particular headings. Honourable senators then would have a chance to debate them . This system, by and large, has worked very well. There have been very few upsets. It was not introduced as a result of the new hours or the new Standing Orders that have been brought in during the last week or two. The practice has been with us for a long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The arrangement was not made by the Government, a Minister, or the Whips. It was an arrangement that met general agreement in the party rooms. It came to a Whips' meeting and the Whips carried out the instructions given in the party rooms. That is how this procedure was brought in. Today, we debated trade and commerce matters under General Business Order of the Day No. 8 and we have science and environment matters under General Business Order of the Day No. 9. This was arranged by a prior motion. It was thought then that there would be very little debate on the papers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was an indication that people did not want to speak. The Whips went around but people took very little interest in these matters. Senator Georges must admit that that is fairly accurate because now we have nearly finished discussing the science and environment group. In order to give honourable senators the opportunity to continue to debate these various papers, General Business Order of the Day No. 9, the primary industry group of papers, was added to enable honourable senators to have until 7 o'clock. Of course, all we are doing now is discussing this arrangement and we are losing time. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) moved a motion in order to group the primary industry matters in a manner similar to General Business Orders of the Day Nos 8 and 9.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggest to honourable senators that after tonight they should sit down and review the situation. I am sure we will do so. I suggest that everyone look at the system to see how it has been working. Honourable senators will see that over the months it has given them the advantage of being able to bring papers forward and discuss them. If any honourable senator finds a better system than this, then by all means he should bring it in. But if we start bringing in little groups of papers here and there the system will not work because honourable senators will have insufficient time to debate them. </PARA>

But I again make the plea that the Whips, as has been suggested, confer with their various party members to see that many of these reports are voluntarily taken off the Notice Paper before we again get into such a bind as we are in now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to talk about the Apple and Pear Corporation Report 1980. Yet on the list of papers to be tabled today-we did not discuss it because of the time limit imposed upon us-was the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation Report for 1981 which we now have in our offices. That was brought into the Parliament today. It was probably tabled in the other place yesterday. The Senate now is faced with the position where we have to debate the Corporation's report for last year. It is 12 months old. Surely there can be some consultation so that we can be told about the reports that are coming in before the list of papers is compiled each second Thursday-we only debate them once a fortnight when the Parliament is sitting-with the aim of striking from the Notice Paper some of the papers which are out of date. Some are listed in the group now before the Senate . The General Business Orders of the Day to No. 85 are all 1979-80 reports. The 1980-81 group is still to come. As I pointed out, if I had had the opportunity I would have spoken today when the 1981 report was presented. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at both of the reports jointly, I would like to make a suggestion to the powers that be in the Apple and Pear Corporation. The reports list, under the heading 'Composition of the Corporation', the respective names of the members of the Corporation. I suggest that the States which members represent should be listed beside their names. That is what I shall confine my remarks to, in the main, in speaking on the reports. </PARA>
<PARA> In debating the apple and pear legislation in this chamber in times gone by, I pleaded with the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) that recognition be given to my State of South Australia and to the State of Queensland and that they should have representatives on the Corporation. I am very pleased that that was agreed to at last. The Minister issued a Press release on 14 April 1982 which is headed: 'Appointment of Two Additional Members to the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation'. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Peter Nixon, today announced the appointment of Mr Douglas Bishop of South Australia and Mr Stanly Halloran of Queensland as members of the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation to represent the interests of apple and pear growers. The appointments increase the number of members on the Corporation representing the growers from four to six, in line with changes to the legislation last year. Both Mr Bishop and Mr Halloran have wide experience in the apple and pear industry. Mr Bishop is a past President of the Australian Apple and Pear Growers' Association while Mr Halloran has been a member of the Excutive Committee of the Queensland Committee of Direction of Fruit Marketing since 1973. Mr Nixon said the new appointment would ensure that the membership of the Corporation was sufficiently broad to allow adequate consideration of all individual State industry concerns and problems. They would also improve industry-wide understanding and support of Corporation initiatives, especially in regard to domestic market promotion. The new appointments are until 31 August 1983 when all other member's appointments terminate. </PARA>
<PARA>I place on record my appreciation to the Minister for having appointed representatives from South Australia and Queensland to the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation. That can only be for the better. Before this, the growers from both of those States were denied a voice on the Corporation which, in the main, is concerned with the marketing of the product that they produce. They now have that voice and can take part in the deliberations of the Corporation. I hope that that will bring about a better understanding of the growers' needs and will be of great benefit to the apple and pear industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said in his statement that having two other people on the Board would improve industry-wide understanding and the support of Corporation initiatives, especially in regard to domestic market promotion. There is a great potential in Australia for the promotion and sale of apple cider. At one time in South Australia non-alcoholic apple cider could be bought in steel 10-gallon kegs. It is no longer available. We are very concerned about the carnage on the roads and people drinking alcohol at various functions. At one time we were able to get a keg of apple cider for people to drink at functions. It was a very good product, but it is not now produced; we cannot get it in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the plea to the Corporation that in its promotion campaign it should see whether it can attract the interest of some manufacturers in again producing non -alcoholic cider in kegs. I know we can get plenty of it in bottles. I recall that Gil Duthie, the member for Wilmot in the other place for a record number of years, was also secretary of the Labor Party parliamentary resources committee for a number of years. For years before I came here-and since I have been a senator-that committee held dinner meetings on a Tuesday night. It was left to Gil Duthie to arrange the meal and the drinks. All we would get on the table to drink was apple cider. It came from the Huon Valley in Tasmania. It became known as Duthie vodka. </PARA>

I make the plea to the Apple and Pear Corporation that it take some steps to see that non-alcoholic apple cider is sold in bulk again. I have asked for it to be provided in the parliamentary dining room. Sometimes I can get it and sometimes I cannot. I think we should make efforts to see that it is always available because it is a delightful drink. If the industry suggests that it is not profitable to make apple cider available in kegs some approach ought to be made to the Government for some financial assistance to see that it is placed on the market. I know that in South Australia one can get still apple juice. Other forms are available in flagons. But those products do not have the fizziness of the apple cider that we used to get in the kegs. Also, it is not as palatable to many people, although I drink it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to make reference to another matter. In looking at that report I find that South Australia, the State which I represent, has the lowest production of apples of any State or Territory except the Australian Capital Territory. Of course, those of us who know the apples which are produced in the Australian Capital Territory know that they are of very high quality. Mr Hawkman, who is very well known to me, produces very high quality apples near the Canberra Airport. He grows them with organic fertiliser. I recommend those apples to anybody who may care to partake of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Natural fertilisers. If Senator Georges talks to me after I will tell him all about it. It might be a bit different from that which he was using here this afternoon. I noticed also in that report that Tasmania, in the 10 years to which this report refers, has always been the highest producer of apples. In contrast, my State has always produced the lowest number. But we do produce a very good apple. We make the apple cider about which I was speaking. Senator Tate said 'Hear, hear!' when I mentioned the Tasmanian apples. They are good apples too. Of course Tasmanian producers are finding it very hard to market the apples that they produce. If the Corporation were to take some notice of the plea that I have made here today, to look at the by-products of apples such as apple juice and apple cider, we might not have the problems that we have at present in getting rid of that great apple surplus which exists. I noticed in the report that in 1973 Tasmania had a record crop of 7,024,000 boxes of apples. That figure has been reduced considerably; the estimate for this year 1982 is down to four million boxes. So the figure has reduced by three million boxes in a short span of about eight years. I do not know whether the apple producers in Tasmania are going out of business or the trees are not producing as much as they did; they are getting older.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One other matter on the list to be discussed this evening is the 1979-80 annual report of the Australian Wool Corporation. We know from the announcement with which we have been acquainted that the razor gang decided in its wisdom-it has not proved very great wisdom now that we have looked at it-that the Australian Wool Testing Authority would be sold. Legislation has been introduced in the other place regarding this matter. It has not come into the Senate yet so I am quite in order in talking about it. The Government was not able to sell the Wool Testing Authority. It was to be sold to try to assist the Government with its deficit. The Government was trying to sell the other authorities through which it put its axe for the same purpose. I spoke on the Australian Wool Testing Authority when legislation on the matter was being considered by the Senate. I spoke on behalf of many woolgrowers who had approached me. I expressed their grave concern about what the Government was doing to the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious with the Australian Wool Testing Authority, as with many other authorities, that the Government recommended abolishing that the government had not done its homework. It had not consulted anybody about taking over these instrumentalities. The proof of the pudding is now in the eating with the Australian Wool Testing Authority. The Government could not sell it. Now it has to turn it into a tax-free organisation. I believe that there have been great ructions among some of the people on the Government back benches about what the government is now doing. Of course, what the Government did was second best. I will have more to say about that when the legislation comes into the Parliament. I do not think I need to take the time of the Senate in talking about it tonight except to conclude by saying that the conclusive proof of the Government's lack of wisdom is now becoming obvious in pieces of legislation and in select committees that have been set up to consider some of these things which the razor gang recommended in haste. The Government will now repent its decisions at leisure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating these education Bills together and the Opposition will oppose them. These three Bills have a common purpose, that of reintroducing tertiary fees for second and higher degree students throughout Australia. As honourable senators will be aware, this is not the Government's first attempt to reintroduce tertiary fees. In numerous debates in the Senate and in other places the Australian Labor Party has put forward reasons for its steadfast opposition to this measure. However, despite the defeat of this measure in the Senate some time ago, the Government has seen fit to bring the legislation into the Senate again. So I will take this opportunity to reiterate the reasons for the Labor Party's opposition to the reintroduction of tertiary fees. I do so knowing that the defeat of this legislation this evening or when the Senate resumes will provide the Government with a Bill which will be one of the grounds for a double dissolution. All I can say about that is that the Labor Party is ready to face the Liberal Party of Australia at a Federal election at any time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We oppose the reintroduction of fees because of our belief that access to education at all levels should be a right of all Australians. The proposed reintroduction of fees, especially if it is extended by the Government to a wide range of students, will reduce access to education. There is no way that that will not happen. That is fundamentally the reason why we oppose these measures. The introduction of fees will mean, eventually, that once again, as in the pre- Whitlam era, education will become a privilege restricted to those who can afford to pay for it. We regard that as a fundamentally undemocratic development . </PARA>
<PARA> Many people will be disadvantaged by the imposition of higher and second degree fees but I would like to draw the Senate's attention to the disadvantage that this measure will cause for Australian women seeking higher education. Women's incomes are, on the average, much lower than their male counterparts' and women are, therefore, less able to pay fees. Women who normally interrupt their careers to have and raise a family are, for that reason, more likely to require retraining in an appropriate area and, therefore, more likely than their male peers to need a second or higher degree. The majority of those people who will be unable to pay for second and higher degrees, if this legislation were to be successful, would be women. Monash University research shows that 57.6 per cent of women students currently studying would defer or not enrol if fees were reintroduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Hand in hand with the Government's proposal to reintroduce fees is the proposal to introduce a student loans scheme. The Government claims that this is the way in which it will continue to provide access to higher education. But the Labor Party is highly sceptical of this claim and, in fact, we reject a loans scheme for the same reason as we reject the imposition of fees. A loans scheme will again restrict access to higher education, or to whichever level of education the loans are to be made available, to those who can pay or to those whose families can support them. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly; as my colleague Senator Tate interjects, it has been tried in the United States of America and it has not worked. If one looks at the pattern of access to education in the United States one can see a decrease in access to higher education in the lower socio-economic groups and an increasing monopoly of access to higher education amongst the wealthy classes. That is the experience we should have learnt from. That is one of the main arguments-learnt from experience-against the proposals the Government is now attempting to foist upon us. It is clear that a loans scheme will restrict educational opportunity to those able to pay off loans. Of course, it will further undermine the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme which has already been substantially eroded through government neglect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that Government senators will say that once a person has his first degree he should be in a position to pay for a second degree. They will ask why the taxpayer should subsidise people in order for them to do higher degrees and so on. I want to make it clear at this stage that if we in this country are interested-certainly the Labor Party is interested-in increasing the skills and expertise available to the community and available for the improvement of the economy, we should encourage, not discourage, able students to pursue higher degrees and second degrees in order to increase their qualifications. If we create a situation in which one's access to higher education depends on one's ability to pay we will be ruling out people of merit. It has always been the case that when fees are required there are people with merit who are unable to secure scholarships. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no use the Government pretending that existing post-graduate scholarships accommodate all the people who have ability but who are in financial need. It is now a very sparse scheme. Certainly I do not believe any academic in the country would claim that all able, talented and higher degree students can be accommodated under the existing post-graduate scholarship award scheme. Indeed, that scheme has had its value seriously eroded in recent years and the opportunity for higher degree students to supplement or earn their income by tutoring has declined alarmingly. It used to be the case some years ago that higher education students and, indeed, undergraduate students could work as tutors in their own institutions and supplement their income. That situation- again as a result of Fraser Government education strategies-no longer prevails. </PARA>
<PARA> We have people sitting in tutors' jobs because staff ceilings and cutbacks in universities have meant that the tenure jobs are totally tied up with people who got tenure maybe 10 years ago, who have many years of their working lives to go and who certainly will not resign from their tenure jobs because there are no jobs elsewhere. There are highly qualified people with Ph.Ds, with many years tertiary teaching experience and with many publications to their credit occupying the tutoring jobs because no other academic position is available to them. In a situation like that the post-graduate student has virtually no chance of getting some part time tutoring to supplement his or her income. So I hope we will not have Government speakers suggesting that it is the case that higher degree students can supplement their income through teaching; nor, as I have said, can all of them be accommodated by the post-graduate scholarship schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point to be made about loans is that people enter into loans only if they know they will be in a position to pay them off. People from middle class backgrounds who have affluent families and who expect to inherit some wealth and property of course are in a position to take out a loan while they are doing a law or medical degree. Of course, while they are doing a higher degree in one of those areas they are increasing their ability to earn their own income. But what is the situation for students from a poor background, of whom there is an increasing number today? How can they take out a loan not knowing what their responsibilities to their own families will be, knowing that there is no financial back up from their own families and, of course, in many cases, not being assured of highly remunerative employment? It is all very well for Government senators to talk about-as they may well do in the course of this debate-the incomes of doctors or lawyers. The Opposition is certainly concerned about the high level of incomes in those areas. I remind honourable senators that not everybody who takes a higher degree will go into one of those highly remunerative areas. </PARA>
<PARA> We want and expect people to work in the community for voluntary agencies or for organisations such as the Aboriginal Legal Service or the Aboriginal Medical Service which pay very low salaries indeed. There are still people in our community who take higher degrees and then want to work for charitable and voluntary organisations. Those people are needed. If we insist on a loans scheme we will be depriving a whole lot of community activities of the skills and experience of people who have higher qualifications. Because those people have the burden of a loan they will say: 'I would like to go and work for the Aboriginal Legal Service for 10 years but I cannot because I have to pay back my loan, so I will go and work in a suburban solicitor's office'. That is the sort of concern we have about the overall effects of insisting on a loans scheme as a means of financing higher education. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there is still the threat of unemployment. I am very well aware of the fact that graduates, and certainly graduates with higher degrees, have a much lower rate of unemployment than the rest of the community; nonetheless there is still a measure of unemployment even amongst people with doctorates and masters degrees and so on. Again, if one comes from a low income family, a poor family, one simply cannot take the risk of taking out a loan, secure in the knowledge that one will get a job and pay it back, because one could become one of those unemployed doctors of philosophy that we have heard about quite frequently. Mr Paul Carrick, President of the Australian Union of Students, in a recent Press release stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Student loan schemes are notoriously inequitable and have been a disaster in many overseas countries. The scheme proposed by the Federal Government is worse and effectively means banks would be able to dictate to students what courses they take. </PARA>
<PARA> Students could face a debt of up to $10,000 upon graduation with uncertain employment prospects. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, a loans scheme would restrict the educational opportunities of women in particular. Many financial institutions still regard women as a greater credit risk than men. Women suffer higher unemployment rates than men and, when in employment, on average they receive lower salaries. All these factors would work against female students obtaining, let alone repaying, loans. A survey carried out by the Monash Association of Students indicated recently that up to 48.5 per cent of current female students do not think they would be able to repay a student loan. Quite obviously, the introduction of both fees and student loans would be a serious restriction on women's access to education. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate should also consider the Government's motives in this limited-to use the Government's term-reintroduction of fees. The amount of money saved in the education budget would be extremely small. Therefore this Government measure is not a budgetary measure at all; it is not an economy measure or a measure designed to reduce public expenditure because it will not do any of those things to any significant degree. it is clear that this limited reintroduction of fees makes sense only as the first step in a general reintroduction of tertiary tuition fees which would again mean that higher education, even at undergraduate level, would be available only to the rich. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been further erosion of access to education by the Government's quite unreasonable policy of imposing fees rather selectively on overseas students. Again, that is not a serious revenue-raising measure but a measure which simply excludes people from access to tertiary education, people for whom access to tertiary education is probably what they most need from a developed country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation we are debating would allow the Government to set up a fee collecting mechanism so that the level of fees imposed on students could be fairly easily increased at a later date. The Australian Labor Party believes that the reimposition of tuition fees for second and higher degrees would unfairly penalise post-graduate students and, as I suggested before, would handicap important research work carried out in tertiary institutions. Post- graduate students make a major contribution to Australia's research effort. Indeed that is the case not only because of the calibre of the work carried out by post-graduate students in our research institutions but also because of the Government's meanness in funding other forms of research and development in this country. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, for example, is desperately underfunded. That lack of funding has been adverted to in a number of debates in the Senate in the last couple of days. This country is desperate for some good research and development. We need to find new productive industries and new technologies to make those industries efficient. There are a number of areas, particularly those in which the CSIRO has been involved, in which we have a great deal of expertise. We have some good experience in the field of agricultural science. Medical science is another area in which we have a great deal of talent and experience. But the Government simply will not fund research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> The private sector expects research and development to be carried out by public institutions so that it can come along and skim some profitable technology or expertise. The private sector in this country has been scandalously unprepared to assist in the research and development effort in a way that would benefit the entire economy. The burden has fallen on post-graduate students, and post- graduate research programs carried out within tertiary institutions in this country have been a major contributor to successful research and development- what little the Government has permitted-in recent years. If the Government, through the reintroduction of fees, prevents graduates taking up post-graduate studies, much of this important research work will simply not be done. The supply of trained researchers for education, industry and government will dwindle and Australia's development effort will suffer. It is certainly nonsensical of the Government to promote research on the one hand, through the establishment of Commonwealth research centres of excellence, yet handicap research on the other hand by penalising post-graduate students. The majority of post-graduate students are already struggling to maintain themselves on the inadequate financial assistance currently provided by the Government. How are they expected to manage with the added burden of fees?</PARA>
<PARA> Finally-this is a very serious consideration-the reintroduction of fees of any kind for higher education represents a breach of faith by the Government. In a pre-election undertaking the Government assured the people of this country that it had no intention of reintroducing tertiary tuition fees. Its actions in bringing forward this legislation are a violation of that pre-election undertaking. I urge the Senate to remain firm in its opposition to these three Bills so as to preserve educational opportunity in this country and to keep the Government to its word. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; We are discussing in a cognate debate tonight three Bills dealing with the fundamental issue of the imposition of fees on second and higher degrees. Senator Teague, during a debate on education yesterday, alluded to the fact that this issue of education has been discussed in the Senate regularly. Not only has education been discussed on many occasions , but also the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill and cognate Bills have been discussed ad nauseam. The obvious reason that the time of the Senate has been taken up again tonight is simply the device of constitutional propriety; to make sure that there is at least, in the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), a trigger for a double dissolution. The fact that the trigger already exists raises the point that the Government, presumably, is looking to use these Bills to call a double dissolution. If that be the case, the Australian Democrats will be very happy to have the opportunity to fight an election on such an issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason for our opposition resides not so much in the notion of education or institutional organisation as in our concern for the economic ramifications of such a move. I shall refer the Senate yet again to the chain of argument that we believe has not been refuted by the Government or even addressed by the Government. It is beyond doubt that we are moving in a world of rapid change. We need to seek as rapidly as possible long term plans for our economic future. It is also beyond doubt that a very large proportion of the industries which Australia can expect to develop in the coming decades, and upon which it will ultimately come to rely for a major proportion of its gross national product, will be industries of a technological kind, a communications kind, or the emerging industries of bio-technology. It is also beyond doubt that those industries around the world are based upon a highly educated community. Those communities which have spent and continue to spend high amounts of their budgetary allocations on education have also been those countries which have developed, are developing and are in the lead in relation to that range of industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I pointed out in my previous speech that our economy relies most heavily on a single item; that is, the service sector. It does not rely on manufacturing, primary industry, or mining as the largest single item. The largest single contribution to the gross national product is service industries. That is indicative of the type of economy that we have and the type of economy that we share with countries such as Sweden, West Germany, Japan, the United States of America and Canada. That is characteristic of those types of economies. It is also characteristic of those types of economies that they not only have that particular expenditure on primary and secondary education but also spend heavily on tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA> We must look at what Australia will provide for its tertiary education sector. In some of the countries that I have mentioned, the expenditure comes not only from government but also from industry and from private endowments. The United States of America is the prime example of continuing and large support from the private sector for tertiary institutions. Recent developments in funding for universities is quite intriguing. In the United States of America one of the growing areas for funds is the area of industries based on communications. I predict that in the next 10 to 15 years that will be easily overtaken by the industries of biotechnology. Rather than take a superficial view, which happened in the last debate, by saying: 'Look, the United States of America Government does not spend all that money, industry spends some money', I believe one is obliged to delve further into why that is occurring and what are the ramifications of that occurrence. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at what is occurring, one will notice that there is a very close relationship between the development of those industries and higher education. It has been pointed out on innumerable occasions that there is even a physical proximity; for example, the Silicon Valley in the United States is in close proximity to three of the largest university campuses in the United States. That particular development is something that the United States, in its own historical development, has been able to foster and expand. It is not something that has occurred in this country. It is all very well to wave one's arms around and say: 'Look, the industry ought to be picking this up', or 'If government cuts back industry we will make up for the lack of funding from government'. It is only possible to do that if we have firm assurances from industry that it will provide those funds that the government does not provide. In other words, if the Government speakers wish to use that argument again in this debate, I ask them to table firm assurances from industry that it will pick that funding up. If not, it is an arm waving exercise, a flag waving exercise, and it will be to the detriment of this country. We cannot gamble our tertiary education on the possibility that somebody will pick up the funds the Government does not spend. It is not a gamble in the United States of America, it is an historical occurrence. That is the way in which it occurs in the United States and has occurred since the development of universities in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to look at what happens in the United States with the industries I have mentioned. Many of the tertiary institutions in the United States have developed close links with various industries-links which share staff, and knowledge which has been gained in research by both sides. Indeed, industry pays for many of the faculty positions in universities in the United States not because it wants control over their output but because they know that the long term benefits to it will easily outweigh the minute cost of a faculty member at a particular university. Many of our universities in Australia have attempted that in the past. In almost every case, unfortunately, it has been a failure. Currently in Australia a number of such experiments are under way. Some of these I believe have good prospects of continuing. </PARA>
<PARA> I will point to a rather ludicrous situation that has arisen. At the University of Queensland it had been the intention of the computer science department to attempt to develop over three to five years a consultancy operation. This consultancy operation would require input from government to get going. After all, the major funders of universities in this country are governments. The small amount of funds which would have been necessary to generate that computer consulting facility would have had a twofold effect on industry not only in Queensland but also in other parts of the country. It would have developed at the university increasing skills which could be passed on to students and it would have enabled the skills of faculty members to be made available to industry in general. </PARA>
<PARA> It had been confidently predicted on the basis of the detailed work that had been done on the submission that in a space of three to five years that facility within the university would have become self-financing. In other words, it would have been a good exercise in co-operation between a government funded institution and private enterprise. These are the types of things which have occurred so successfully in the United States. What happened? A free enterprise government, such as the one we have in place in this country, vetoed the small amount of funds which would have been necessary to generate, in one of our major universities, a facility which would have become self-financing. That is how far this Government has any intention of fostering co-operation between those two arms. So why throw out the United States as an example? At the very time the universities in this country attempt to do that, this Government pulls away. That type of argument must be backed up, not by fine words in this chamber or any other place, but by detailed finances and moneys going to the universities to enable them to provide those types of facilities. I believe it is the last time that this Government ought to talk about free enterprise fostering in any shape or form. Time and again it finds itself incapable of following its own basic philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to another suggestion which has arisen in this debate, and which has about it the same tinge of absurdity; that is, that students ought to be, in some way, morally uplifted by paying for part of their education, that somehow or other we will have a spin-off of better people. Senator Teague looks rather puzzled. I point to some of the interjections he made in the last debate in relation to the moral uplifting tones of paying for fees. This rather odd notion is a very interesting proposition. Unfortunately I will not be able to develop it at this point. I hope I will be able to develop it at a future date in more detail. I will be able then to point out to Senator Teague the absurdities of that argument. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Today I received a number of complaints about Ansett Airlines of Australia's air services from Cairns to Weipa and return. My information is that Ansett is cancelling services at short notice and not providing sufficient services to carry freight. When I attempted to determine from Ansett today what its flights were between Cairns and Weipa and return, I understood how Weipa residents had become confused about the flights available to that centre. The actual timetable bears little relationship, if any , to the published timetable. I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Transport to ask the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) to examine the availability of flights from Cairns to Weipa, what cancellations have occurred in the last month and whether Ansett is fulfilling its obligations to this part of north Queensland. I realise, of course, that the Minister cannot provide this type of information tonight but I would appreciate early advice from him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I actually wish to raise two matters tonight. The second matter is one that I alluded to last week. In the adjournment debate on Thursday of last week I raised a matter relating to an incident in a South Australian school. I outlined on that occasion how a Press report suggested that a secondary school student suffered burns when a teacher allegedly poured methylated spirits on one of the student's hands and set it alight. I said last Thursday that many people would take a grave view of the incident but I withheld any further comment until the South Australian Education Department made any findings available in relation to investigation of this incident. Last Thursday I did not seek a response from the Minister; neither do I do so tonight. Even though I did not seek a response from the Minister, Senator Messner replied that he would see if any further information was available. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I was appalled to read that this violent episode has been given a classical bureaucratic whitewash. I would like to read an article that appeared in today's Courier-Mail. It is headed: 'Teacher is fined and transferred'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> ADELAIDE.-A teacher who set alight a boy's hand at an Adelaide high school would be fined and transferred to another school, the South Australian Education Minister, Mr Allison said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> Shaun Riley, 12, said last month his hand was burnt when the teacher used methylated spirits to set it alight because he had not done his homework. </PARA>
<PARA> The teacher, who has not been named, declined to be interviewed but Education Department officials said the action was intended more as a practical joke than as a punishment. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Allison said he was satisfied the matter had been dealt with in an appropriate way and he considered it closed. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Adelaide Advertiser today there is an article which is almost word for word with the article which was in the Courier-Mail. I happened to see an Australian Associated Press article which was shorter than those two articles; but it contained some additional information, so I will read what the AAP article mentioned. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> An Adelaide teacher had been fined a week's wages and transferred over an incident in which a pupil had his hand burned, State Education Minister Harold Allison said today. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Allison said no police charges would be laid over the incident, in which the teacher poured methylated spirits over the hand of a 12-year-old pupil and lit it. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to go over some of the points mentioned in the article in the Courier-Mail. That article was almost word for word with the article in the Adelaide Advertiser. It said that the teacher would be fined. That is an indication that someone in authority regarded the matter quite seriously. The AAP article mentioned that he would be fined a week's wages. This teacher apparently will be transferred. I ask: Why will he be transferred? Why was he not suspended from duty on a permanent basis? Why were his services not terminated? If he is not suitable to teach at one school because he pours methylated spirits over the hand of a student and lights it, why send him to another school? Is it that there is no methylated spirits in the stores of the school to which he is to be transferred? It seems to me that if he is not a suitable teacher at one school he should not be transferred to another school to perhaps act in a similar way. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also stated in the article in the Courier-Mail that Education Department officials said that the action was intended more as a practical joke than as punishment. A practical joke? Is this what students will be subjected to when they go to South Australian government schools? Are they to have a practical joke perpetrated on them? Are their hands to be burnt with methylated spirits? If it was a practical joke, it is an absolute disgrace. But even if it was a punishment, it is an absolute disgrace. I wonder whether it was a punishment. If it was not a punishment why should the Education Department official mention that it was more a practical joke than a punishment?</PARA>
<PARA> I must admit that I have some harsh words to say about Mr Allison. I do not know the man personally. I have made some inquiries about him today but I cannot mention the comments because what certain people said to me about Mr Allison is just hearsay. Taking just this incident by itself, and noting that Mr Allison said that the matter had been dealt with in an appropriate way and he considered it closed, in my opinion the matter has not been dealt with appropriately. There should be a full disclosure of the investigation that was made by the South Australian Education Department. It should be made public so that people know whether this sort of action will continue and whether this teacher, who has apparently been transferred to another school, will act in a similar way again. If Mr Allison can do no better than to say that it has been dealt with in an appropriate way and that he considers the matter closed he should resign his portfolio. I do not say that lightly because a student has had his hand burnt when methylated spirits was poured over it and it was set alight. How many parents will now trust the administration of Mr Allison when students are treated like this, either for punishment or as a practical joke? I call upon the Premier of South Australia to demand that Mr Allison make a full disclosure of all the facts of this case. If Mr Allison will not offer his resignation, he should have his commission terminated by the Premier of South Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will endeavour not to try your endurance, Mr President, more than is absolutely necessary to put on the record a matter which is, I believe, of some seriousness and demands a reply from the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). Having registered a strong protest last week about the Attorney's rather shameless rule-worship in insisting on a criminal record check when the Commonwealth employee in question had good grounds in principle for refusing such a check, I now raise a matter of a rather different kind, though still concerned with security. This concerns not the strict adherence to rules but, on the contrary, an apparent irregularity. I refer to the appointment of a Mr John Gerrard to fill, initially on a temporary basis, the position of Director, Security, of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. The Attorney is, I am informed, already aware of this case through correspondence he has received from the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association. It is, nonetheless, I think, important to sketch out the facts very briefly in order that it may be understood why I publicly now raise the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am informed that the need to fill the position of Director, Security, on a temporary basis from 1 January 1982 arose because the permanent appointee, Mr Alan George, was absent from that date on a long term sick leave pending retirement. On 29 August 1981, some four months prior, Mr Gerrard was transferred to a temporary position of Security Officer (Clerk Class 8) under the supervision of the Director, Security. A number of aspects of the promotion- transfer of Mr Gerrard through various positions in the period 29 August 1981 to 1 January 1982 appear to be highly irregular given that it is standard practice at the Australian Atomic Energy Commission to advertise all temporary and permanent vacancies and to interview applicants prior to filling a position. Firstly there was no advertising prior to the filling of Mr Gerrard's transfer from clerk class 7 to security officer clerk class 8 in August 1981. Secondly, in a subsequent filling of the Director, Security position, again by Mr Gerrard, on 1 January 1982 the vacancy was not advertised. Thirdly, senior management of the AAEC have actively discouraged appeals by staff against the transfers, and ultimately promotion, of Mr Gerrard stating: 'No one else could possibly win'. These are quite unusual steps and have given rise to serious speculation that Mr Gerrard's nomination for the position was done by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and that this occurred well in advance of the vacancy formally occurring on 1 January 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General will recall that the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association made this allegation to him directly. The allegation is not based on idle speculation but on information which I understand was provided to ACOA by one of its members. As I said, the allegation is given credence by the irregular procedures undoubtedly associated with the filling of the position. I am not of course in a position to confirm or deny that allegation. However, I believe it is a serious allegation and I raise the matter here to give the Attorney-General an opportunity to answer it in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> It is beyond doubt the statutory function and the duty of the Commission itself to choose the best qualified person for the position subject I readily acknowledge, to whatever security check is appropriate having regard to the obvious sensitivity of the position. I am not denying that ASIO will have had and should have had an input at that level of checking but it is quite another thing altogether for ASIO to be allowed to interfere, as it has been suggested, to the extent of actually determining the ultimate nomination to this position in breach or ordinary, proper procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> The question has also been raised as to whether the United States Central Intelligence Agency-the CIA-has been at all involved in this appointment; an involvement which the Government may of course seek to justify because of international arrangements involving the AAEC. I simply endorse in that respect the sentiments of the ACOA that it would seem quite objectionable if an Australian appointment were indeed made in any way subject to foreign approval or scrutiny. The ACOA believes-I support it in its belief-that the problems highlighted by events in the AAEC to which I have referred are not isolated. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of this incident, and I understand some previous incidents, it has called for proper arrangements to be implemented immediately taking into account the explicit statutory provisions of the Atomic Energy Act and the current ASIO legislation and that those procedures should include in this case: Firstly, the advertising of the vacancy again within the Commission; secondly, if deemed necessary, the advertising of the position outside the Commission; and, thirdly, the vetting of the preferred candidates, but in doing so taking fully into account and consideration the checks and safeguards that are laid down in the Australian Security Intelligence Agency Act 1979. The proposals that are here being suggested amount to no more than the regularisation of this apointment in accordance with established law and procedure. I ask the Attorney to indicate his response. The functions of ASIO in relation to security assessments are fully set out in Part IV of the ASIO Act 1979, in particular in section 37 (i), which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The functions of the Organization referred to in paragraph 17 (1) (c) include the furnishing to Commonwealth agencies of security assessments relevant to their functions and responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA>That function is clearly described in the Act. It is a limited one. I believe that here, as in all other matters involving this Organisation, we must be constantly and continually vigilant to ensure that ASIO does not exceed its functions in this or in any other respect. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by simply saying that the issue of security assessments and the procedure that ought to be followed in relation to them was dealt with quite extensively by Mr Justice Hope in his second report on intelligence and security tabled in 1977. I commend the various relevant passages in that report to the Attorney, both in respect of this case that I have now mentioned and in respect of the case that I referred to last week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer firstly to Senator Colston's remarks concerning air transport problems between Cairns and Weipa. As properly acknowledged, I do not have any immediate information. I will convey his concern to the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) and obtain a reply for him. With regard to the matter at the Adelaide high school, Senator Colston must clearly recognise this as being in the State area of concern and administration. It is not a matter which the Federal Government can approach in any meaningful way. When Senator Colston first raised this matter some 10 days ago I made inquiries of the Education Department in Adelaide to see whether I could obtain any further information for him. I have not been able to obtain any further details concerning the way in which the State Education Department formed its judgment in regard to this matter. Now that the matter has been concluded I will personally speak to Mr Allison to obtain some explanation of the conclusions reached in this matter. I will speak to Senator Colston, perhaps privately, about that matter on a later occasion. Generally speaking, this is not a matter in which the Federal Government would involve itself.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australian policy has been consistently directed towards realising the goal of world wide disarmament. The Government devotes considerable resources to arms control activities thus reflecting the importance we attach to disarmament. The Government's budget allocations for the Department of Foreign Affairs include provision for Australia's active participation in the relevant international disarmament forums, notably the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva, the United Nations Disarmament Commission and the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly itself, particularly the First Committee in which disarmament matters are considered.</PARA>
<PARA> The contribution which a government makes to the goal of disarmament depends on the quality and content of its policies on disarmament and related issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) obliges each non-nuclear weapon State party to the Treaty not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices and not to seek or receive any assistance in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. The Treaty also imposes the obligation on each non-nuclear weapon State Party to the Treaty to accept International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA) safeguards for the exclusive purpose of verification of the fulfilment of its obligations assumed under the Treaty with a view to preventing diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.</PARA>
<PARA> Article X of the NPT provides that any State Party has the right to withdraw from the Treaty if it decides that extraordinary events related to the subject matter of the Treaty have jeopardised its supreme interests. Such a Party would have to give three months notice to all other States Parties and the United Nations Security Council which notice must include a statement of the extraordinary events it regards as having jeopardised its supreme interests.</PARA>
<PARA> The NPT is the principal international instrument aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. It is a persuasive symbol of a broad-based international consensus and an important deterrent to proliferation. The strength of this consensus is demonstrated by the fact that 113 States have already adhered to the NPT. Abrogation of the Treaty by any State Party would have serious political and economic consequences. Such a State would forfeit its access to supplies of nuclear material and expertise. No State Party has ever withdrawn from the Treaty.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. However, in June 1981 the Board of Governors of the IAEA approved a nuclear safeguards agreement between the IAEA and Vietnam covering the Dalat reactor in connection with the supply of nuclear fuel for it from the USSR. This suggests that Vietnam proposes to recommence operation of the reactor.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Teheran reactor was shut down following the outbreak of hostilities with Iraq in 1980. As far as can be ascertained, it has not been reactivated.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Why is every effort not being made to ensure that the shelter is able to continue its important work, as Nambour has a special need for short-term and emergency accommodation, and the assistance given at this shelter to people and families in crisis, helping them to rehabilitate themselves, saves the community purse far greater expenditure on welfare services.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) The Nambour Lions Family Emergency Accommodation Centre was funded from 25 July 1979 to 31 March 1982 under the pilot Family Support Services Scheme component of the Children's Services Program. Funding from this source ceased because the project was ineligible for funding under the guidelines for the extended Family Support Services Scheme, which commenced operating on 1 January 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> I have approved projects for inclusion in the Scheme on the basis of recommendations by the State Minister for Welfare Services, acting on the advice of the Commonwealth/State Management Committee. On the advice of the Queensland Minister, I agreed that the funding of the Nambour Lions Family Emergency Accommodation Centre would continue until 31 March 1982. The project is predominantly operated as a women's refuge and is therefore specifically excluded from funding under the Family Support Services Scheme guidelines. The centre is more appropriate for support under the Queensland Government's program of assistance to women's refuges, and I have raised the question of assistance under that program with the Queensland Minister.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 March 1982 (Hansard, page 1089) Senator Gietzelt asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services. The Minister will be aware that the Australian Electoral Office is required by the Commonwealth Electoral Act to carry out periodic reviews of the electors enrolled in Federal electorates for the purpose of maintaining an up to date electoral roll. I ask the Minister: Is it a fact that, as a result of restrictions placed upon staff and funds, the Chief Australian Electoral Officer is unable to carry out the regular habitation review procedures in most States of the Commonwealth? Does that mean that the electoral rolls will not be brought up to date?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the limits to which available funds could be spread over the various operations in which the Australian Electoral Office is engaged, habitation review activities were reduced in this current financial year. As the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs suggested in his reply to the honourable senator on 24 March 1982, this curtailment however did not flow from staff restrictions.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 places on officers of the Australian Electoral Office the responsibility for the maintenance of the electoral rolls. The Australian Electoral Office does all that it can, within the limits of resources, to help all eligible electors become and remain correctly enrolled and, as the honourable senator is aware, habitation reviews assist the Electoral Office in obtaining elector information for the preparation, maintenance and revision of the rolls. Nevertheless, it must not be lost sight of that with a system of compulsory enrolment such as we have in Australia, the responsibility for being correctly enrolled rests in the end on each individual elector.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following information in relation to that question:</PARA>
<PARA> The direction to Australian Electoral Office staff in relation to public discussion about electoral matters is that any discussion should not be party politically oriented, should not express views in relation to government policy in respect of electoral matters, and should not seek to have the official position of the officer cited as an authority for statements on matters not related to his own duties. Within these limits and in the interests of electoral information and education, Electoral Office staff are certainly not discouraged from assisting inquirers about general electoral procedures.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Coleman has informed me that in accordance with these principles and particularly in the run-up to the 1980 elections he answered many questions relating to electoral procedures and talked to groups of people, usually on an ad hoc basis, from various political parties, including the National Party, the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party. Mr Coleman informs me that the honourable member for Brisbane, Mr Manfred Cross and Senator Gerry Jones will no doubt be pleased to confirm this in respect of the Australian Labor Party since both of them were at discussions in Mr Coleman's office prior to the election.</PARA>
<PARA> As for the particular meeting to which Senator Gietzelt refers Mr Coleman informs me that it was not a secret meeting of the National Party Executive. The meeting which was arranged by the Queensland Branch of the National Party consisted of a group of 100 or more persons to whom Mr Coleman was asked at very short notice to give an address with questions and answers outlining the electoral procedures relating to the Senate.</PARA>
