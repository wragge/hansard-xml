<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 84 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that the most fundamental Human Rights, as per UN Charter and are guaranteed by the Constitution, have been cruely disregarded in Yugoslavia and that the Serbian Orthodox Church is one of the most tragic and up to now, silent victims.</PARA>
<PARA> The Clergy from the Tamnava Deanery in Yugoslavia, cry out 'OUR CHURCH DOES NOT LIVE ANY MORE,-IT MERELY EXISTS'. Our children know nothing of Christ, because we are not allowed to teach them. Any attempt in this direction ends in interrogation and persecution of both the children and clergy.</PARA>
<PARA> In an Open Letter directed to the Yugoslav Presidium and the President of Serbia, the Serbian Orthodox Clergy from all over Yugoslavia, appeal for an investigation into planned and meditated, 20-year genocide of everything Serbian in the Kusovo region.</PARA>
<PARA> Some 100,000 Serbians have had to flee from their homes. Old monasteries, churches, and graves have been desecrated, destroyed or burned down. People have been harrassed, attacked and some have been killed. Criminal offences have been committed against Orthodox students and monastics.</PARA>
<PARA> The petitioners therefore respectfully ask that the Commonwealth Government through their Minister for Foreign Affairs makes a strong protest and representation to the Yugoslav Government asking for protection against persecution of Serbian population of Kosovo region and guarantees of basic human rights, and in particular freedom and practicising of Orthodox religion in Yugoslavia.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament House assembled. The humble petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully showeth.</PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the Child Care Act 1972 demonstrated the Government's acceptance of the need for, in the words of Mr Lynch when introducing the Bill, ''. . . the development of child day care facilities of good quality throughout the Commonwealth''. To achieve this objective it must be realised that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) To provide, or encourage the provision of anything less than the highest quality care is a failure to recognise the potential value of day care to many children in our society.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The provision of child care is highly labour intensive.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Top quality child day care requires that supervisory staff be professionally oriented and qualified.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) The work of providing child care is physically and mentally demanding.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government enact a policy which will ensure that all existing and proposed subsidised child day-care centres receive a level of funding to meet the cost of:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) 90 per cent of all staff salaries including ancillary staff such as clerical and cooks.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That Australia Council funding for the Popular Theatre Troupe of Queensland has been entirely cut for 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> The Popular Theatre Troupe of Queensland has made an important contribution to the cultural and artistic life of the Australian community for the past eight years taking innovative and original theatre to sections of the community who would not normally attend live theatre performances.</PARA>
<PARA> The Popular Theatre Troupe of Queensland is the only theatre company in Australia which consistently presents theatre of social comment and tours nationally every year.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the continuing high level of tax avoidance and evasion is cause for grave concern for honest Australian taxpayers, and demands stringent and immediate action by the Commonwealth, noting in particular:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The latest estimate by the Australian Taxpayers' Association is that $7, 000m a year is being lost in taxation revenue;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) This figure can only continue to rise because of the timid approach by the Government in closing off tax loopholes; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No effective inroads can be made until a comprehensive policy is adopted of levying tax from the date on which a scheme of tax avoidance is first used.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask Senator Chaney, Minister for Social Security and Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, whether the number of people on unemployment benefit in Australia is now 466,000 as at last month? Is that figure some 70,000 above the monthly average forecast in the Budget which was brought down in August? Is it also 6,000 above the recently revised estimates provided by the Treasurer to the House of Representatives? If the Budget figures in relation to unemployment levels were not deliberately falsified as part of the Government's plan for an early election, how can the Minister justify such enormous discrepancies in the estimates which have been made?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The most recent figure I have available is for October when 465, 959 were in receipt of the unemployment benefit. I think that is approximately the figure which the Leader of the Opposition mentioned in his question. The current estimate accepted by the Government is under consideration. A revised figure was announced by the Treasurer some time ago. The most recent information I have is that the Treasurer again has updated revisions before him and is giving them some consideration. It is quite clear that there has been a significantly worse result than was anticipated at the time of the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I reject again the suggestion that there was a falsification of figures at the time of the Budget. As a Minister who was involved in the Government's decision as to the acceptance of a figure on which to base Budget figuring, I can only say that we took the advice which was available to us. I do not know of any observer who was predicting the sort of rapid deterioration which has occurred since August. Senator Button may have had some private advice on the subject, but certainly the advice which was available to me and the Government at that time was not that there would be anything like the increase which has occurred. The point needs to be made, I think, for the sake of people who are subject to unemployment benefit, that the payment of unemployment benefit is not affected by the Budget figuring. Unemployment benefit is, of course, automatically paid to those who are entitled to it. I will respond to the rest of the question when I have had a chance to consult the Treasurer who is, as I said before, considering the latest information available to the Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that, recognising that Tasmania had major disabilities compared with mainland States, the Federal Government adopted a particular policy concerning its approach to Tasmania and, based on that, set up the Callaghan Inquiry into the Structure of Industry and the Employment Situation. The report of that inquiry recommended in November 1977 a program of special assistance. The special assistance projects under this program amount to some $10m, and they have been approved. Under present policy guidelines Commonwealth special assistance is to complement Tasmanian initiatives in industrial development and is conditional upon an element of Tasmanian self-help in the proposals. The proposals are considered by a Commonwealth-State officials committee, chaired by the Secretary to the Department of National Development and Energy, which last met on 10 March of this year. At that meeting two proposals which are now under study were noted. One concerns an essential oils industry for Tasmania and the other concerns a maritime heritage centre in Launceston. The Prime Minister and the Premier agreed in 1981 to a review of the existing arrangements and progress with the special assistance scheme. A draft report on the results of this review is at present under consideration. I have a list of the various matters that have been undertaken.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Acting Attorney-General. It refers to the appointment of Mr J.

What protection from defamation action does Mr von Doussa, his inquiry and, ultimately, his report have? Will the Acting Attorney-General table the letter written to Mr von Doussa setting out his terms of appointment? Will he give an undertaking to table the report as soon as it is completed?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The arrangement with respect to Mr von Doussa-I have not been directly involved in setting it up, so I speak from my general knowledge of the subject-is, as I understand it, a consensual one. There has been an agreement between the Government and Mr Horgan that, in order to put these matters to rest , there should be an investigation of his affairs by an independent counsel. Mr von Doussa has agreed to do that. It is something which is being done with the active co-operation of Mr Horgan. I understand that that co-operation includes making available whatever is requested and giving Mr von Doussa access to Mr Horgan's advisers. As I understand it, there is no formal power to subpoena. There has not been an appointment of any sort which would give rise to any form of statutory or common law powers to subpoena documents. Rather, there is a consensual arrangement whereby an independent counsel of high reputation will examine the matter and report to the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as protection from defamation action is concerned, I am relieved that I am not permitted under the Standing Orders to give legal opinions because, representing the Acting Attorney-General, I would be doubtful about advising Mr von Doussa on the law of defamation. But again I should have thought that that would not give rise to difficulties in this case. At the request of two interested parties-namely, the Commonwealth and Mr Horgan-Mr von Doussa is conducting an examination in accordance with certain terms of reference which have been given to him. I should not have thought that any problem would arise with respect to defamation.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as the third and fourth parts of the question are concerned-the question of the tabling of a letter and of any results of Mr von Doussa's examination-I will refer them to the Acting Attorney-General for reply. I have not seen any letter of appointment and I am not aware of whether or not one exists. It probably does exist. I will examine that matter and ask the Acting Attorney- General to give me a reply to the third and fourth parts of the question.</PARA>

In the event of Mr von Doussa producing findings which are adverse to Mr Horgan, will Mr von Doussa have the same protection against possible action for defamation that Mr Costigan had when his report was presented to the Government and that Messrs McCabe and Lafranchi had when their report was presented to the Victorian Government?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said before, I do not propose to breach the Standing Orders by endeavouring to give a legal opinion which might be a suspect opinion anyway. There is clearly no privilege, in a statutory sense, in a matter such as this. There may well be questions of qualified privilege which might arise where there is a matter of common interest and where a person is acting at the request of parties but that is a matter of law on which I do not think that I could give the Senate a definite opinion even if the Standing Orders permitted it. If Mr von Doussa has problems with respect to defamation and so on I have little doubt that he will raise those matters with the Acting Attorney-General or the Attorney-General if he is back in place at that time. I proffer the view that I do not believe difficulties will arise in this area. If they do no doubt they will be matters which the counsel concerned will raise with the Attorney-General for the Government's consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the attention of the Minister for Education been drawn to the lack of employment opportunities in Australia for graduates who have majored in oriental languages, even if those graduates have had additional language experience overseas? Is it true that Federal Government departments such as the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Joint Intelligence Organisation and the Office of National Assessments regard such language skills as supplementary to other qualifications and therefore unnecessary? Does not the private sector prefer as interpreters foreign-born nationals who have English as their second language so that employment opportunities for Australian graduates majoring in oriental languages for practical purposes are restricted to teaching other students, thus perpetuating this employment disaster? Will the Government consider a survey to compare job opportunities with the number of students currently taking majors in oriental languages so that young Australians who put many years into studying these languages will not be misled?

I thank Senator Lewis for making several examples known to me. I cannot comment on whether departmental priorities or practices in departments nominated by the honourable senator are as set out by him but I have no reason to doubt that they are. Issues which relate to the employment of graduates who have Asian languages have been taken under study and were among matters raised in a report in 1980-the Fitzgerald report 'Asia in Australian Education', a report to the Asian Studies Association of Australia. That report is still under study and is still being considered. It was a report to a particular association and the Government will be hearing from and working with that Association on how we should respond to those recommendations.

Not only is it a matter of concern and interest to him, but also it is already acknowledged as being of concern and importance to the Senate. The Senate Standing Committee will be taking that matter under study. I think it is reasonable to expect that the Senate Standing Committee will include among its concerns the question of employment prospects for graduates with Asian language skills.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce been drawn to Press reports that the European Economic Community has agreed to reduce steel imports by 3 per cent? What effect will this decision have on Australian steel exports to the EEC countries, which in 1980-81 totalled more than $40m? Is it correct that the EEC was able to reduce imports under the terms of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade because the domestic consumption of steel had fallen? Since the Australian domestic consumption of steel has fallen dramatically over the last year why has the Government declined to reduce imports of steel as the Australian market has shrunk instead of simply freezing them, thus effectively increasing the share of steel imports?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the report referred to by the honourable senator in his question. In a sense it is a reminder of the very great danger which we face around the world with country after country or region after region closing down its trade and further restricting world trade in a way which will damage the long term interests of this country. I think that the most partisan person in the Senate would probably agree that if world trade was in a healthier situation we would not be facing many of the economic difficulties that are causing us so much concern today. The point raised by the honourable senator underlines the difficulties which governments face in this time and the danger that a series of measures will be adopted, whether by countries or trading blocs , which will further reduce world trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was that sort of consideration which was in our mind when we faced the very difficult question of what response should be made domestically to the obvious difficulties of our own steel industry. We opted to freeze the level of imports rather than to reduce them because we are, currently in GATT discussions of course, trying to ensure that world trade is not further impeded in the way that I indicated earlier in this answer. In making decisions of this sort one is caught with a difficult balance. We, as a trading country, have more of an interest than almost any other country in maintaining the free flow of goods around the world. If Australia, in any sense, sets the lead in closing down trade I believe we will suffer very severely for it. I think the reasoning behind our original decision is clear. The Industries Assistance Commission is further considering this matter. As I said earlier, I understand that the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd will be making a further submission to the IAC and no doubt these matters will again come before the Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I am not aware of what cost would be involved in full tax deductibility for housing interest. It will probably be recalled that earlier in the year-I think March or April-a housing assistance scheme was introduced and then later, in the Budget in August, an alternative scheme was introduced that could be used for partial deductibility of interest. I think the total cost of what now is on the books is about $400m odd in a year, so I imagine if we were to embrace full tax deductibility for housing interest it would be at considerable cost. I do not doubt that stimulus to the housing industry and ancillary industries for that matter is desirable and that can be achieved in a number of ways. In the introduction of the housing interest deductibility that is now in place consideration was given to assisting those who are in most need, those who may be paying the high rates of interest or those who, in the early years of the purchase of their first home, have considerable expenses. I will draw Senator Bjelke-Petersen's question to the attention of the Treasurer but, as I said, with the Budget just barely passed, there is no proposal at this stage to allow full tax deductibility.</PARA></TALK.START>

For example, I understand that a prominent couple in Queensland have advertised a His and Her hat that has been worn-a Joh and Flo hat.

Some of them are relatively ineffective. It is important for those who are going to use some kind of agent to try to stop undue exposure to know which are the effective agents. I will ask the Minister whom I represent whether there is a list extant which can be made available to my colleague. I will pass on the quite excellent and positive comments which have been made by Senator Townley for the Minister's consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the unusual step of under Standing Order 98 addressing my question to Senator Mason who is in charge of the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill which is listed on the Notice Paper. I refer to statements made by Tasmanian Australian Democrat, Norm Sanders, which made great play of Senator Mason's world heritage legislation and in which he stated that Tasmania is a banana republic and a third rate State which is incapable of managing its own affairs. Is not Senator Mason's world heritage legislation predicated on similar assumptions? Will Senator Mason dissociate himself and his colleagues from Dr Sanders's statement?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YJ7">Senator MASON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I by no means dissociate myself from the tremendous efforts of my colleague Dr Norman Sanders in Tasmania on behalf of the welfare of Tasmania and its protection against the current but temporary ascendancy of barbarians there. I have seen some comments by Mr Gray in this morning's Mercury. If I were Dr Sanders, having read those comments I would see my lawyer. Dr Sanders is a totally dedicated conservationist and a patriotic Tasmanian whose views on the Gordon-below-Franklin dam are, I am quite sure, shared now by the majority of Tasmanians. I think that is something that Mr Gray has to learn. I agree with Dr Sanders to the extent that if Mr Gray goes on being Premier of Tasmania for too long, in spite of the resilience, beauty and natural advantages of that island he will make Tasmania a banana republic. His attitude to this dam and his complete irresponsibility towards its economics and towards conserving the thing which has been given into his trust-that is, Tasmania, with its beauty and heritage-show him to be a man of very small achievements. I hope that he either leaves the scene quickly or demonstrates that he has rather better aims than have been apparent to date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr Sanders is as angry as I am at the pattern of destruction that is already being carried out in Tasmania by the Hydro-Electric Commission on Mr Gray's specific orders. Mr Gray is not prepared to wait and see what the rest of the people of Australia want; he just wants to get in there and destroy things as fast as he possibly can. He is destroying the area in a careless way because there is evidence already-gathered, I might say, by Dr Norman Sanders, the only person to do so-that an oil slick 5 kilometres long has occurred on the Gordon River. That has happened because of the carelessness of the Hydro-Electric Commission in the use of a pile driver alongside the river. It used that pile driver in such a way as to allow more than 2,000 litres of oil to leak into one of Australia's most beautiful rivers. It seems to me that those honourable senators who are from Tasmania ought to look again at the dismal efforts and paltry performance of this man who has made these comments about Dr Sanders. As for Dr Sanders, I am in no doubt whatsoever that he has the interests of Tasmania at heart. He may be from another country-he comes originally from the United States of America-but he has been around the world enough to know when he has something good. He wants to continue living in Tasmania-he has told me that many times-because he sees it as a place of great beauty and he wants to see that beauty preserved in the interests of his own children and the children of other Tasmanians.</PARA>
<PARA> As for my Bill, it has been brought forward merely to construe into law the obligations which the Tasmanian Government and the Federal Government have already incurred under the terms of the world heritage movement. The Bill does no more than that. What are we going to do? We have a world heritage movement. Mr Gray says: 'This is great; let us have it, as long as it applies only to other people'. Would it be perfectly okay, for instance, if Mr Bjelke-Petersen suddenly found out-I know he would not do this-that a very valuable product was to be found in ground-up coral and said he would systematically mine the coral in the Great Barrier Reef? Similarly, perhaps Ayers Rock could be ground up for gravel! Of course, Mr Gray would object to those things. The basic point is that the South West Tasmanian region is part of Australia. Mr Gray is not the Premier of some republic off to the south of Australia. He is an Australian, like all of us, and he has an obligation to this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for National Development and Energy to an article in today's Sydney Daily Telegraph which is headlined: 'Work stops on $ 40m Split Rock Dam'. The article claims that a New South Wales funding crisis has stopped the development of the $40m dam in the north of the State. The article reports that the delay is due to the Federal Government's refusal to put up its half of the development money in a lump sum. It states that if the Federal Government would come across with the money the State could go ahead with the project. Further, it states that the Federal Government has allocated $ 2.5m to the project in the past two years of which the State has received only $ 250,000. This is a circumstance of great importance, not only for water availability but also for employment in the area. Will the Minister comment on these significant allegations?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I saw the article in this morning's Press. Indeed, the claims by the State people are quite fallacious. The fact is that money is passed to the States for water resources under the Commonwealth Government's National Water Resources Program. Under that program the arrangements are that there will be a dollar for dollar grant-that is, a dollar from the Commonwealth matched by a dollar from the States-that the States will put forward a priority list and the amounts of money available will be reviewed by the Commonwealth in terms of that priority list. The fundamental situation is that it has been agreed by all States and by the Commonwealth since the formation of this program that this should be a year by year decision. It has never been envisaged that there would be any commitment by either the Commonwealth or an individual State for the total cost of any water resource program at the start of any year. Because it is a matching grants program it is reviewed year by year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1980-81 the Commonwealth provided, on the basis of priorities recommended by the New South Wales Government, half a million dollars for work on the Split Rock Dam. This amount was matched by the State Government and spent. There is no question of any long term commitments at all. In 1981-82, under exactly the same program, the Commonwealth Government provided a further $1.5m to New South Wales towards the approved work on the Split Rock Dam. In fact, the New South Wales Government drew only $250,000 for work on the dam. I repeat that we allocated $1 .5m which could have been taken up and spent. This year the Commonwealth Government has offered $1m to the New South Wales Government. However, the New South Wales Government has decided to introduce, unilaterally, its own decision making on this. It has said that the State has decided not to proceed with the construction of the Split Rock Dam until there is a long term commitment from the Commonwealth Government to meet half the full cost of the dam under the National Water Resources Program.</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that that program is accepted by all the States and in the year by year grants does not make full term commitments to meet half the full cost of any program. Each year submissions are made by the States. They are reviewed and according to priorities there is a matching program. The fact is that the New South Wales Government has had offered to it a considerable amount of money, $1. 5m, of which it has spent a handful, and another $1m which it has not taken up. It has not taken it up because it has decided unilaterally on a principle which is not part of this program at all. The State Government knows very well that the Australian Water Resources Council, of which all the States are members, has looked at this question for the future of long term commitments for particular projects and has asked the survey group that is doing the perspective of water to the year 2000 to look at methods by which long term commitments can be made.</PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly governments, both State and Federal, cannot commit themselves indefinitely to full term programs. I repeat: What has been said is not accurate at all. There is no mote in the Federal Government's eye. The Federal Government has conformed precisely with the terms of the National Water Resources Program. Each year it has offered a significant amount of money. Each year that money could have been put to work. The fact that the money is not being put to work means that a number of Australians who could be employed are not working. It means that the Split Rock Dam is not being built at this moment although it could be built.</PARA>

There has been a recent retrenchment of 128 workers and there is a likelihood that more workers will face the loss of their jobs before Christmas.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a tragic fact for Australia that the Australian steel industry is suffering a major decline. That is happening for a number of reasons. One reason is the world-wide recession and a very great fall-off in the demand for steel. In the free world alone there is a surplus capacity of about 150 million tonnes a year or more. There is an enormous surplus capacity around the world. The second factor is that a number of countries are, in fact, very competitively exporting. It is suggested that some, for example Korea, may be subsidising their steel and their steel prices in order to win foreign exchange. Countries such as South Korea, facing an enormous problem in funding their foreign exchange because of their imports of oil, are very heavily in debt in that regard. The result is that the world at large has not only a glut of steel but also very keenly priced steel. Australia cannot, of course, compete in world markets on that basis. There has been a Temporary Assistance Authority inquiry and the Government has taken certain steps. The matter is being referred to the Industries Assistance Commission for an overall look.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To respond specifically to Senator Jones, the Commonwealth Government is in continuous discussion with the steel industry in an effort to see how there can be a major reconstruction of the steel industry and a bringing about of better efficiency in Australian steel making capacity. That will require a considerable injection of capital. Senator Jones and others will recall that in the last Budget the Government included a provision whereby a company with groups of companies can produce an amalgamated balance sheet. That ought to provide BHP with the capacity to inject some of its oil profit into the steel industry. A considerable number of steps are under consideration at this moment. But the road back for the steel industry will not be an instant one. It will be long term, requiring major reconstruction and, of course, a reduction of the cost factor in Australia-particularly opposition to soaring wages-so that we can keep costs down and be competitive.</PARA>

In those days, in contrast to today, that policy was part of a work sharing program.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; We have had a number of discussions drawing comparisons between 1929 and 1982. If Senator Gietzelt wishes to justify his parliamentary party's attitude to a wage freeze or pause by drawing comparisons that are out of date, let that rest on its own. A meeting of Commonwealth Government Ministers and State Premiers will be held in the next week or so. At that time the Commonwealth Government's proposals will be put forward. The State governments undoubtedly will bring forward their own proposals. We hope that out of that there will be recognition that the wage claims that are being made and have been made have been affecting very adversely employment prospects and opportunities. That may not be accepted by the Australian Parliamentary Labor Party in the Federal sphere, but I think we should await the outcome of the Premiers Conference to see whether different attitudes are held by people who belong to the same party as those who sit opposite. The wage pause, I believe, is one step that may be taken to try to improve the employment prospects of all those who are seeking employment. For the proposal to be dealt with in the way that I understand it was dealt with yesterday by the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party seems to me to be very short-sighted and not to have the support that seems to be developing for it in the Australian community at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources. Inasmuch as Australia's annual inflation level is calculated for the September quarter to be 12.3 per cent and wages increased last year by 15.2 per cent or, for adult males, by 16.9 per cent, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development inflation average figure last year was 7.8 per cent or, for our major trading partners, 6.5 per cent, is it not natural that Australia's steel is likely to be the second most expensive in the world?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The adverse factors set in at about the time the Whitlam Government was having an impact on inflation. Today Australian steel ranks very much as one of the high price steels in the world. This is due to a number of factors, some of which I set out in a previous answer. A number of countries have established brand new steel works, particularly countries like Korea which do not have the built-in obsolescence of the older steel works. The fact is that today Australia is facing higher costs than those of our trading partners. In some cases Australia's rate of inflation is double that of its trading partners. I think Senator Crichton-Browne's figures are correct in contrasting us with the OECD. There is no way in which Australia can trade outwards in steel or any other product until we can get our cost factor down to that which is comparable with those with whom we trade. That is a fundamental matter. It is one of the reasons that at this moment the Commonwealth Government is seeking a wages freeze in Australia in order to bring down the rate of inflation and, therefore, to bring down costs. While inflation remains high interest rates will remain higher. Therefore, capital costs and the refurbishment of industry will become dearer. I support the general thrust of Senator Crichton-Browne's question; it is a fact, and one has to bear down on costs in order to resolve it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that my colleague Senator Chaney will take no offence at the answer I am about to give, but it seems to me that almost every Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has his resignation called for from time to time during the time he holds the portfolio. About a month after leaving the portfolio he is generally regarded as having been the best ever Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I understand it is true that Mr Blitner, who is the Chairman of the Northern Land Council, has criticised my colleague Mr Wilson in the last few days. I read the criticism and had a feeling of deja vu in the sense that when I held that portfolio the criticisms came fast and furious. It is important to examine any criticism to see whether any elements of it are valid and need response. Sometimes, however, they represent an unreasonable response to the necessity which a Minister has from time to time to say no to some requests. I do not know of the circumstances behind this call. However, I can say to honourable senators that it is an event to which Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs are likely to find themselves exposed from time to time as they come into conflict with one group or another. I found it very important to work well with Mr Blitner and the Northern Land Council and I know that my colleague Mr Wilson has great respect for them. I know that he wants to work with them in the most positive way possible and that he values the consultations he has with them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Thursday, during debate on the first reading of the Dried Fruits Export Charges Amendment Bill, Senator Foreman referred to a question which I answered on 9 November and suggested that that answer contained incorrect information. The particular answer to which the honourable senator referred stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In other words, the imported summer stocks with which Kelvinator will be competing for this summer's trade are already imported.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe this answer, which is a selective extract of my complete reply, is correct. When read in the context of my complete reply it is quite clearly a fair generalisation of the reality of the market circumstances for room air conditioners. Sales of room air conditioners occur throughout the year but the majority of sales are made during the spring and summer period. I also said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's action was taken consistent with the recommendation of the Temporary Assistance Authority, which took the view that the procedure recommended by the company would not be effective as a means of providing additional protection because a large number of imports were already in the country.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Foreman's assertion that tariff quotas would have been a more appropriate means of assisting Kelvinator does not logically address the market and import situation revealed by the Temporary Assistance Authority in its report on the matter. In particular the Authority said:</PARA>
<PARA> Data available to the Authority indicate that imports for 1982-83 may increase to 215,000 units, some 12,000 units higher than in 1981-82. Imports cleared by the end of October 1982 are expected to amount to about 160,000 units.</PARA>
<PARA>It further said:</PARA>
<PARA> Tariff quotas could not be used to protect Kelvinator's production in the 1982 -83 season, unless the 1982-83 market proves to be close to the top of the forecast range of 189,000 to 250,000 units. There can, of course, be no guarantee that this will occur.</PARA>
<PARA>Kelvinator's own estimate of the 1982-83 market is for the lower 189,000 units. So it follows that the priority for 1982-83 must surely be to assist Kelvinator to compete with the imports which are already in the country. This is what the Government has done.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition raises this matter because it is desperately concerned at the absence of a properly informed debate about education not only in this Parliament but also in society generally today. Clearly the circumstances cry out for such a debate. One has only to look at the labour market, at unemployment figures, at the economy and at the outcomes of various educational institutions at the moment and over the last few years to realise that we ought to be engaged in a properly informed debate about education. The Australian Labor Party is determined to have such a proper debate . We want to debate the educational objectives of our school system and our post -secondary systems. We know that there is a crisis in education in that the education systems are not able to meet either the individual needs of all students or the collective needs of our society and our economy. This view is not only the view of the Australian Labor Party but also the view that has been endorsed and documented in all the major reports on education that have appeared in the last seven years-that is, the seven years of the Fraser Government. Most recently and most pertinently, we have the report of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission, 'Learning and Earning'. Honourable senators will be familiar with this report and its findings. This report is a damning indictment of Fraser education policies. Along with the reports that succeeded it, it demonstrates that students are dropping out of the education system at an alarming rate because the education system does not meet their needs. But where do they go when they drop out? They go not to jobs, apprenticeships or job training but to unemployment and despair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Labor Party wants to know why this is happening. We want to know what changes are needed in the education system to make them adapt to contemporary needs. The Labor Party wants to know this; teachers want to know it; students want to know it; parents want to know it; and educationists want to know it. But the Fraser Government is not interested in these matters. The Fraser Government is not interested in education or in students. The only interest that the Fraser Government has in this vital area is in discriminatory funding. The Fraser Government's whole educational strategy has been to save money at the expense of public education and to promote its own political fortunes by increasing funding to certain non-government schools whose needs are minimal in comparison with the rest of the non-government and the government sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party very much regrets that, instead of a debate about education and contemporary needs, to date we have had a debate about the relative merits of demands of certain private schools for virtually unlimited funding. I must state that these demands are just that-demands. They are not needs as defined by any proper education body; they are simply the wishes, the demands of the beneficiaries of certain schools. We very much regret that the Minister for Education, Senator Peter Baume, has fed this unhealthy debate, has lent his ministerial weight to the unrestrained, selfish demands by the advocates of certain education choices. We very much regret that the Government has no education policy, only a funding policy, and that that funding policy is clearly an inequitable one. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, funding is relevant to what education can provide; of course it is the case that the Federal Government's reduction of real funding for the government school sector has meant that the educational objectives of the government school sector have been harder and harder to attain; of course the Government's financial undermining of our tertiary institutions has meant that the ability of those institutions to change and to adapt to contemporary needs has been hamstrung. We need to look only at what is happening to research and development in our university sector to see the effects of inadequate funding on the economy as a whole. We do not deny that we need to talk about education funding. We do not deny that funds are necessary for a sound, modern, adaptable education system. But what we are totally opposed to is the Government's use of education funding for its own short term political and electoral ends. </PARA>
<PARA> An analysis of what the Government has done in terms of education funding clearly shows that it has operated in a preferential way and not in a manner based on the education policies designed to meet the needs of all students. In anticipation of the kinds of rhetoric that the Minister is no doubt going to engage in in a few minutes, let me say this at the outset of this analysis: The Australian Labor Party does not quarrel with the proposition that parents have the right of choice with regard to their children's education, that choice of course being exercised within the normal regulations and criteria that operate in a democratic society. The political right to choose a certain kind of education is similar, however, to the political right to buy a certain sort of car or live in a particular sort of suburb. That political right of choice does not bring with it an automatic right to have that choice subsidised by public funds to an unlimited extent. We must make the distinction between a political right of choice and a legitimate demand for public funding. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the view of the Labor Party that in the current economic recession when money is tight not all choices can be subsidised infinitely. Our view is that public money must be spent in the most equitable manner possible. Public money must go to raise the standards in government and non-government schools which do not have at present the resources to give the kind of education that students need to meet contemporary needs, as we state in the wording of the matter of public importance. We cannot countenance the use of public money for schools which are operating well above the level attained by government schools or the majority of non-government schools, the parish schools. It is simply a matter of equity. The schools which have the resources to offer effective education-we admire them, we respect them and we acknowledge the work they are doing-ought not to claim more at this stage and leave the majority of our children deprived. That simple proposition is the basis for the Labor Party's needs policy in education funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister will produce a lot of figures in an attempt to show that the Federal Government is spending more money on public education than on private education. Of course, that is simply not the case. The percentage of Federal Government contributions to the total recurrent costs of government schools, for example, has dropped from 10 per cent to 7 per cent. In money terms that is $ 111m. That means that $111m less is available in the government school sectors as a result of Fraser Government policies. How can government schools improve, adapt and respond to contemporary needs while they are being financially undermined in this way? The Government likes to boast-I am sure Senator Baume will repeat this boast in a few minutes-that its expenditure per pupil has gone up, but I must point out that this new ratio of funding to individual pupil does not in fact represent a success for the Government; it is a sign of failure. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me explain. The expenditure per pupil has gone up because the total number of pupils has declined. That is the heart of the matter as far as today's education debate is concerned. Schools are not retaining students. The rate of retention has slipped markedly since the early 1970s. I must point out that although the rate of female retention to the end of high school has increased, the rate at which that increase has taken place has dropped and the number of girls proceeding from school to post-secondary training has also decreased. These figures are available in the recently published report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts on this matter. Schools are not retaining students; the rate of retention is declining. </PARA>
<PARA> The proportion of students proceeding from school to university, of course, is also declining. This is a tragic irony at a time of record high youth unemployment and when people without skills and education on the labour market are finding it hardest of all to crack that labour market. Schools, and to an increasing extent post-school systems, cannot retain students. Why is this happening? This is the question with which we in the Labor Party are concerned. Clearly, schools and tertiary institutions are not offering what students need or what they think they need in contemporary circumstances. Clearly, schools need to change in line with the structural changes that have occurred in the economy, in line with the technological revolution which has had a devastating effect on conventional employment and in line with fundamental social changes which include, for example, a permanent-I stress 'permanent'-high rate of participation in the work force by women of all ages.</PARA>
<PARA> Schools must change, yet the level of funding for those schools-that is, the government schools and the majority of non-government schools-has been such that innovation and adaptation simply have not been possible. Increases in Commonwealth general recurrent grants to schools since 1976 have been directed to non-government schools, and the largest increases have gone to the wealthiest non-government schools. Government schools have suffered a decline in real funding in the same period. At this point I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which demonstrates this trend. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President. The figures are drawn from Schools Commission reports. The percentage increases in Commonwealth general recurrent grants indicate the Fraser Government's priorities. There has been a 259 per cent increase in funding for the most wealthy private schools and a 12 per cent decrease in funding for government schools, which schools, of course, are attended by 78 per cent of all Australian school children. It is regrettable that the Minister for Education has attempted deliberately and mischievously to characterise the Labor Party's stance as an attack on non-government schools. The Labor Party's policy is clearly one of restoring fairness to schools funding . Our policy would clearly benefit not only the 78 per cent of all Australian children attending government schools but also a sizable proportion of the remaining 22 per cent in non-government schools. I do not think Senator Peter Baume is fooling many people. Lest Senator Sir John Carrick be tempted to repeat his remarks of yesterday about the flinching attitude of the Labor Party towards editorials in the Australian Financial Review, I shall quote from the editorial of the Australian Financial Review of 10 November, with which, of course, the Labor Party finds itself in total agreement. The Australian Financial Review stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Education Minister, Senator Baume, warned Catholic parents in Sydney last week that the Labor Party's 'needs' policy for school funding was 'a denial of the well established right' of Australian parents to choose private schools for their children and receive basic grants from the Commonwealth and State Governments. </PARA>
<PARA> In attempting to score political points Senator Baume forgot to mention that this open-handed policy, claimed as a prime example of the Liberal Party's ' freedom of choice' philosophy, was of increasing concern to both the Treasury and the Government's education advisers. Federal education outlays in 1981 were $882.6m, rising to $1,066.7m in 1982 and to an expected $1,241m in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just the march of inflation pushing up education costs to the Federal Government. A significant factor is the ease with which new schools can be registered and . . . the fact that a large number of private schools have managed to have themselves classified or reclassified as Category Three schools that attract the maximum funding. In both 1982 and 1983 the Federal Government will provide greater funds to the private rather than the public sector, a new phenomenon. </PARA>
<PARA>A great deal of money has been spent but the money has not been spent equitably and it has not been allocated in such a way as to enable the schools system and the post-school education systems to provide education that students want and need. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party is determined to put the education debate back on the rails, that is, to have the debate about education. Let me remind the Senate of the reasons for and the history of massive Federal Government involvement in schools. Honourable senators will recall that until the election of the Labor Government in 1972 Federal Government involvement in schools had been minimal. The incoming Labor Government set up the Interim Committee for the Australian Schools Commission under the chairmanship of Professor Peter Karmel to establish a program and objectives for Federal Government upgrading of schools education in Australia. I remind the Senate of the terms of reference of that inquiry. I take the Senate's time to do this because it seems to me that the whole debate about funding has gone right away from the initial objective of having a Federal schools program. It has deteriorated into this clamouring about freedom of choice, unlimited funds and so forth which was not, of course, why we started a schools commission and why we started Federal Government funding. The terms of reference for the Karmel Committee included the following:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) examine the position of both government and non-government primary and secondary schools in all States and in the A.C.T. And the N.T.;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) make recommendations to the Minister for Education and Science as to the immediate financial needs of schools, priorities within those needs, and appropriate measures to assist in meeting those needs . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In carrying out its task the Committee was instructed to work towards establishing acceptable standards for those schools-government and non- government alike-which fall short of those standards. From the outset the initiative of the Federal Government was to establish standards and then to find ways of assisting schools that fell below those standards to raise those standards. The Karmel Committee report-I recommend it to honourable senators who may be out of touch with this debate-had a very interesting discussion on this question of needs which was then our policy and still is. On page 51 of the Karmel Committee report-I hope that the Minister is paying attention-it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> All needs are relative. The allocation of public funds to primary and secondary schools cannot be defended merely on the basis of subjective assessments by interested parties of what resources they would like to have, without regard to fiscal implications or to differences in existing standards among schools. The needs of particular schools cannot be considered in isolation. A school which already has modern equipment, pleasant buildings and a favourable pupil-teacher ratio may wish to have its services enhanced by, say, the installation of closed circuit television. While this may indeed be an improvement, it must take low priority in relation to the claims of a school whose buildings are decrepit and whose pupils are being taught by ill-prepared teachers without the assistance of ancillary personnel or essential equipment. The economic problem of unlimited ends competing for scarce resources is ever present. </PARA>
<PARA>If it was present in 1972, when that definition of needs was written, it is even more present now after we have been in an economic recession for seven years. In this summary of, I believe, a very progressive and excellent report, the Karmel Committee said that it acknowledged that there were serious deficiencies in Australia's schools. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA> These deficiencies lie in three broad areas. First, most schools lack sufficient resources, both human and material, to provide educational experiences appropriate to the young in a modern democratic industrial society. Secondly, among schools there are gross inequalities, not only in the provision of resources but also in the opportunities that they offer to boys and girls from varied backgrounds. In particular there are many inner-city schools which draw their pupils from populations that suffer grave socio-economic disadvantage , and there are handicapped children for whom quite inadequate opportunities for schooling exist. Thirdly the quality of education leaves much to be desired. Many teachers have been inadequately trained and the provision for their professional development is frequently meagre. Curricula and teaching methods tend to be unresponsive to differences between pupils and to address themselves to the development of a range of attributes which is narrow in relation to the possibilities of life in a complex technological society. In some schools and school systems the authoritarian and hierarchical atmosphere inhibits the human relationships that should prepare young people for their place in the adult world. </PARA>
<PARA>I can see that my time is expiring. Before it does, I wish to say that the deficiencies established in the Karmel Committee's report have been overcome to some extent. The Australian Labor Party is happy to recognise that that is the case. However, such deficiencies have not been overcome totally. The inequalities that existed then still exist. Those inequalities will not be overcome while the Government refuses to address itself to the question of developing education policies to overcome them. Those problems and inequalities will not be overcome and schools will not be able to adapt to contemporary needs , to retain their students, until the Government drops its inequitable and very partisan approach to schools funding and goes back to the Karmel Committee's original report and establishes a program that will truly achieve equal opportunity for all children in schools and in post-secondary education in terms of contemporary needs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The subject finally determined for today's debate concerns education policies. Anyone listening to the broadcast of the proceedings will be disappointed that so narrow a compass was taken on by Senator Ryan's choosing to re-awaken a very narrow area of debate and disagreement and tending to concentrate on talking only about money and school funding and forgetting a whole lot of other areas of education. I know that Senator Macklin, who is to speak in the debate, has an interest in a whole lot of other areas of education, including research. We, for our part, want to cover a much wider compass. I observe that the honourable senator who led in the debate is now leaving the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators have heard the Opposition expounding the national policy which it announced a week or so ago and which it is trying to sell. The policy is divisive, destructive and unfair. We will make that known to the Australian people at every chance we get. One of my colleagues will discuss later the Australian Labor Party's policy and what it may mean. We will ask whether it will add anything to what the Government is already doing to meet and satisfy contemporary needs. I, for my part, want to demonstrate quite clearly that this Government is pursuing and has pursued over a number of years education policies which are relevant, which are appropriate and which meet the needs of Australian people. Of course we are not dealing with a perfect product. I heard Senator Ryan's remarks about the report which was released recently on the study about learning and earning. One might almost have thought that in expressing her concern she was paraphrasing the Press release which I had put out. She was almost re-expressing that Press release and taking it as her own.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course we share concerns about education. We should share concerns. I draw the Senate's attention to a Press release by Senator Macklin some months ago which I want to praise. He spoke about the need for talking together and trying to come to some degree of understanding between us on what is possible in the way of achieving consensus in education. In my approach today I will try to identify some of the national education needs and goals. I will try to demonstrate that not only our expenditure but also our policies are directed towards meeting those needs, towards trying to satisfy them. My colleague Senator Teague, in his contribution later, will discuss some of the specifics of the programs which we fund and which are designed to meet contemporary problems. This is done, of course, so that students at tertiary and secondary levels can cope with the challenges which are all too evident in today's society. As I mentioned, we will be discussing the ALP's rather pathetic policy. That will be done by my colleague Senator Martyr. </PARA>
<PARA> What are our national needs? It is quite clear that Australia requires a society with the skills which are necessary to meet what lies ahead, and this skill need is changing, and changing continuously. In addition all Australians need to have the opportunity to develop through education their individual and personal potential both for their own benefit and for the benefit of the wider community. We need a system where quality and excellence are valued. We need an educational system which will help us, as a nation, to comprehend what the challenges are and which will help us to produce a society with enough flexibility to respond to those challenges. In a particular area of education the question of what we do for youth in transition is one of the answers to what is needed but, of course, it is not the only answer for which we are searching. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government acknowledges the national needs of this country. We have endorsed a policy which sets out to provide and to fund an educational system to respond to these needs. We do it through schools and through the post-secondary area. In co-operation with the States our policies ensure that there is freedom of choice in the schools area. Our policies increase access to good quality educational opportunity for many children and they have promoted the attainment of acceptable resource standards in government and non-government schools. To achieve these goals we, as a government, are providing in 1983 about $1.25 billion as our share of a national educational cake. This will be an increase in real terms of about 20 per cent since 1976. I will come back in a moment to discuss how that is divided. </PARA>
<PARA> Since we have taken government there has been a major increase in our commitment in terms of real money which, after allowing for inflation, goes into supporting schools. We supplement State inputs. We acknowledge that in the schools area the States have primary constitutional responsibility but, of course, much of the money they put into education through their schools comes in the end from Commonwealth grants. The operation of government schools has been such that they have increased their per student expenditure in real terms by about 50 per cent between 1974 and 1981. There has been a real advance in terms of the resources applied in government schools across Australia. We have played our part in this. Our total recurrent funding for government schools has increased in real dollars. If the dollars we applied in 1976 and the dollars we are applying now are looked at and we discount for some appropriate deflator, it will be seen that we are putting more into supporting the running of government schools in Australia-the recurrent funding-than was put in in the last Labor Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last Labor Budget $328m-I have adjusted the figures to get them into constant terms-was put into the running of government schools by the Commonwealth. In 1981 we exceeded that figure and put in $330m. In 1982 the figure was $334m and in 1983 it was $339m. Senator Ryan can use any percentage she likes. In the end it is whether more or less money is provided which is important, once inflation has been allowed for. We have increased our support to the government sector for running the schools. We ask that that be acknowledged, not that the figures be twisted. Our commitment is strong and continuing for government schools. </PARA>
<PARA> We have increased our support for non-government schools by quite considerable amounts. The honourable senator spent some time concentrating on this. She referred to Labor's policy. It is like an earthquake. There is more moving earth with Labor's policies-about 5.5 on the Richter scale. It is hard to know where one is at any moment. Is it the ALP policy as set out at the biennial conference in July? Is it the Labor policy that is set out in the latest Press release from Western Australia as all the weaseling goes on to try to satisfy this or that interest group that the policy as set out at the Labor conference does not apply to it? Is it the policy that was identified in the National Times using a list that came from ALP sources, now disowned? Is it the policy favouring the limit set out in front of me at a conference recently at which the Labor spokesman talked about schools with fees in excess of $2,500? Is it the policy behind the later announcement when the Labor Party talked about schools with fees in excess of $3,000? Is it the policy behind the recent announcement of the Labor spokesman when he was speaking in Western Australia that no school in Western Australia will be involved?</PARA>
<PARA> What is the ALP policy? One thing we know about it is that it is designed to knock off funding for some non-government schools in Australia. That is quite clear; that is explicit. It is designed to take away the funding which goes to support some Australian children today. If one believes the document that came out of the ALP conference-I ask why one would not-that involves up to 96,000 Australian children. That is as I read the document and understand it. I think my understanding is correct. It demonstrates the power of the left wing and of unions such as the Australian Teachers Federation over the policy making of the Australian Labor Party. But the ALP is now discovering that when it tries to articulate into policy what it passed at the conference it will not work. It is unwilling to come up with a list of exactly who are the kids whose funding it would knock off. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party's policy is based upon several misapprehensions. First of all, schools in Australia have both assets which they have gathered and incomes which they need to run themselves. The two are quite separate. It is quite possible for a school to be rich in assets and poor in income. I ask honourable senators: If a school's assets are built up over 100 years does it follow that it is a rich school in income terms? Of course it does not follow. Yet the ALP, as much as anyone, has tried to promote the myth that any non-government school-this applies only to non-government schools-which has assets is by definition a rich school. That is a logical absurdity. There are rich and poor schools in terms of assets in both sectors-government and non-government. The Commonwealth contributes in a very major way to the provision of assets. We have traditionally provided up to 30 per cent of what the States use in building their government schools. This year, in my State, because the State Labor Government is withdrawing much of its support for the building of government schools, the Commonwealth's contribution, unacknowledged by the State, will rise to closer to 40 per cent or more of the entire amount spent. </PARA>
<PARA> But the debate is not about assets. It is about the income that the schools have available. It is about salaries, because the cost of running schools is the cost of salaries. Here the subservience of the ALP to teacher unions has been most obvious. The unions are creating myths. The fact is that the Commonwealth Schools Commission assesses schools in terms of the amount that they have coming in. It puts those schools into one of three groups, group one being the better off schools and group three being the poorer schools. If the Schools Commission assessed government schools in Australia-the state schools-every government school in Australia would be in group one, the best off group. Most government schools in Australia in terms of resources and income with which to pay teachers to run them are group one schools. Although one would not think so to listen to the nonsense that is talked by our opponents, most government schools, in terms of income with which to run them, are group one schools. They have enough coming in from the State to pay the teachers' salaries. It is the Catholic schools that are poor. Even the non-Catholic independent schools, in terms of income, are poorer schools. Our policies attempt to overcome that relative inequality. The Commonwealth Government tries to support non-government schools on the basis of need. To try to argue that a group one non-government school is rich compared with its government school counterpart down the road is untrue, a lot of nonsense and the basis for a misplaced policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ryan in her speech mentioned the problem of retention of students. Having paraphrased the first part of my Press release she then went on to say how sad it was that schools cannot retain students. She did not give the whole story. Not all schools cannot retain students. There is a problem. It is the government schools that cannot retain children. It is true that there is a falling number of children coming through the schools in the smaller school population. But the independent schools in Australia retain children. The completion rate to year 12 is 85 per cent. The poor Catholic schools which are poorer in every way than their government school equivalents retain children. Their retention rate to year 12 is 45 per cent. It is the government schools system that is failing to retain children. Its retention rate is 30 per cent. Might I say that the excellent Australian Capital Territory education system which I administer has a retention rate to year 12 of 65 per cent. It is the schools operated by State governments that are losing students to the non- government sector and failing to retain students through to year 12. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps we need to explore and understand why that is so. If I had been less coy when answering Senator Chipp's question last week I might have suggested that there is something in the approach of some teachers in those schools which is causing parents to want to withdraw their children and take them to another system in which they know there will be a teacher every day, in which they know that industrial matters will not interfere with their kid's education and in which they believe the education is, in some way, better. That is a matter of school system funding to which my colleagues will come back and develop further.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth also is a major contributor to other areas of education. It is the sole funding agency for the university and college sector in Australia. It has provided enormous extra input into the technical and further education sector. In fact, in 1983 it will put more than $2,000m into the post-secondary sectors of education, that is the 19 universities, the 44 or 45 colleges after amalgamation and, of course, the TAFE sector. We are providing support, through our funding, for 166,000 university students and 168,000 students in colleges. We are providing our portion of support for 2.3 million children in the government school system, for two-thirds of a million children in the non- government system and for about 700,000 people in TAFE. That measurement is slightly difficult because there may be some double counting. That is where our support goes. </PARA>
<PARA> We show the way in other areas in the Australian Capital Territory system. We pioneered a partnership between schools and the community. The Australian Capital Territory school system has a school-based curriculum. There is parent participation in school matters through their involvement in school boards. The Australian Capital Territory has been a pioneer in a system of upper secondary education in secondary colleges. This system has proved to be extremely effective in the education of youth. The Commonwealth, through its own system of education, is helping to show the way. In co-operation with other arms of the portfolio, the Australian Capital Territory system is collaborating in the development of educational initiatives that will ensure that all youths in the Australian Capital Territory have access to satisfying educational experiences either within their schools, within the work place, or through community services. This is to be called Program Youth. Australian Capital Territory schools are also pioneering bilingual education. In 1983, eight of our primary schools will be given supplementary funding to trial bilingual programs. We have announced recently that we will promote and support the French-Australian School -a bilingual school-in the Australian Capital Territory. At Narrabundah College in the Australian Capital Territory we have introduced and are supporting an international baccalaureate program. On a national basis, we have funded a transition program which is represented in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> In the education area we support school funding, college funding, university funding and technical and further education funding, which has gone up significantly during our period of government. We support students through the provision of student benefits. In this Senate we will be debating and implementing a Bill to provide the option of student loans. We are involved in supporting many programs-programs through the Aboriginal Secondary Education Grants scheme and the Aboriginal Study Grants scheme, programs for isolated children, programs to support more post-graduate students with higher stipends and less onerous conditions, programs to get more students to stay at school by offering a much increased secondary allowance scheme for years 11 and 12, and programs for greater Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowances. We are taking every step we can to enhance and increase educational opportunity in Australia. It distresses us when the debate, advanced by our opponents, concentrates on matters at the margin and tries to say to the Australian people that what the education debate should be about is whether a small group of non- government schools should be punished and to try to call that a national policy.</PARA>
<PARA> We accept the debate on this matter of public importance. There is no truth in the statement that there has been a failure by this Government to pursue educational policies; our policies have met contemporary needs. I end by observing that my opponents actually put in two notices today as to what their matter of public importance would be. When they realised that the first one was totally unsustainable and unarguable, the second one emerged. We have demolished it, I think, quite comprehensively. </PARA>

<PARA> The failure of the Government to pursue education policies which meet contemporary needs. </PARA>
<PARA>Listening to the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume), I was reminded of Walter Bagehot's description of a statistician who uses figures as a drunk uses a lamp post-for support rather than illumination. I was very sad that the Minister's speech was so much devoted to stunt rhetoric about what this Government has done without any critical examination of the situation of education in Australia and how it has developed in the last few years. I found that the most enlightening part of Senator Baume's speech was the news that Senator Martyr will be brought into battle at the end of the debate to demolish the education policies of the Australian Labor Party. That will give us an opportunity to have the 1950s revisited. I doubt that he would have much understanding of contemporary education issues. Twice in his speech Senator Baume referred to the answers for which the Government is searching. He then devoted most of his remarks to issues of funding, for which he chastised Senator Ryan for referring to at all. The other sad thing about his speech is that it had all those characteristics of the Fraser Government's style about it. As a new Minister, he has learnt quickly to emphasise the most divisive issues rather than those of fundamental importance to an education system and further to find scapegoats for failures of government policy in various sectors of the education system. </PARA>
<PARA> I will examine very briefly how it has come about that we get this sort of performance from a Minister in the Fraser Government in 1982-a Minister of a government which has been in power for seven years. The Government's record in education has been as bad as it has been everywhere else. I remind the Senate that the Fraser Government came into power at a time when the basic advisory structure for education, which the Government still retains, of education commissions had been established by a Labor government. It came into power at a time when there were higher participation rates in secondary, university and college education than there are now-that is, a greater proportion of young people were attending those institutions. It came into power at a time when there was a community consensus about the operation of the Commonwealth Schools Commission and about increased equity and opportunity throughout the school system which was operating as a result of decisions and recommendations of the Schools Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1976 the Fraser Government, for ideological reasons, decided to turn the process around. If we look at the rhetoric of 1976 and 1977-very ideologically based rhetoric-we find many references to the relationship between education and employment, the need to train people in specific skills. The current ideology of business was that the education system in Australia had failed. The Government picked it up. There was a lot of talk about the education system being a scapegoat for the failure of entrepreneurial skills in Australia and the declining success of Australian business. All of that ideological turnaround ignored what senators on this side of the Senate were saying even then. It ignored enormous technological changes and developments which at that time were, and still are, taking place in Australia. This meant that we had to consider an enormously different range of options for Australian children than this Government was prepared to consider. The emphasis was on the relationship between education and the job market. This was reflected in the terms of reference of the Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education, Training and Employment established in 1976 or 1977. The inquiry report was talked about for two years by spokesman for this Government-by Senator Baume's predecessors-as the document which would provide a blueprint for Australian education until the year 2000. The terms of reference of the Williams Committee of Inquiry contain the specific request for that Committee to give all its emphasis to the relationship between specific education and specific employment. This was flying in the face of the realities of a changing society. </PARA>
<PARA> If we talk about those questions to business people today-this may be news for Senator Baume; perhaps he does not have the time-we see that their attitudes have changed entirely. The attitudes of this Government have not changed. The attitudes of business people now, who are very much concerned about growing unemployment, particularly amongst young people, is that there should be much greater Commonwealth expenditure on education. They were saying exactly the opposite in 1976 and 1977. Seven years later one can say that no Government in Australian history has presided over a greater decline in employment and education options for young Australians than the Fraser Government. The only education option which this Government offers as being different from that offered by anyone else and which other speakers in addition to the Minister will no doubt offer, is the option which it has always been very concerned about; that is, the option for some children from wealthy backgrounds to exercise their traditional privilege of attending wealthy schools at public expense. That is the option which the Fraser Government offers young Australian children. It is the only one which identifies it from everybody else in the context of this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem is that the Government is locked into a very narrow view. Senator Martyr will obviously pick up a bit of paper and make some divisive debating points. But that is not really what the issue is about. That is the only additional option which this Government offers, because for six years now it has been locked into a narrow view of the function and role of education. There is no greater confirmation of the statement that I have just made than can be seen in the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission publication 'Learning and Earning: A study of education and employment opportunities for young people' to which Senator Baume referred. I refer the Senate to the table on page 4 which shows participation rates of 17 to 21-year- old Australians by type of enrolment, sex and sector for 1975 and 1980 and the decline in participation rates, particularly amongst young males. I refer to the statement made in analysing that table on page 8, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The largest declines in higher education have been 17-19-year-old males in universities and 17-19-year-old females in advanced education. The participation rate for 17-19-year-old males in universities has now fallen to the level of the mid 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA>I stress that it has now fallen to the level of the mid-1960s. So has the debate of the Minister for Education in this Government. His debate and arguments have fallen to the level of the mid-1960s, out of which a Labor Government in 1972 and 1975 took tremendous steps towards rescuing this country. Under the section headed 'Implications for Policy', the Tertiary Education Commission first makes this point:</PARA>
<PARA> Education has values over and above its immediate employment and economic advantages. It is, for individuals and societies, an investment in the quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to talk about tertiary education in that context. That is precisely what the coalition was not saying as a government in 1976 to 1978. It rejected those arguments completely. In 1982 the rejection of those arguments is coming back to haunt it. The report also states:</PARA>
<PARA> Few unemployed and other disadvantaged young people are in their present circumstances by choice; at least in part they are there because of the decisions of other young people to whom a wider range of options is available.</PARA>
<PARA>What the report is talking about there is inequalities of opportunity in education. When honourable senators on the other side of the chamber say they are in favour of inequalities of opportunity in education they reflect the view which is expressed in this report about what is happening and what has happened in terms of funding for schools and access to post-secondary education. Let us look at the Government's record in relation to those matters. One of the reasons advanced in this report for declining access to post-secondary education is not only doubts about the function of post-secondary education in contemporary years but also the availability of student assistance schemes which encourage, in this report's view, education participation and a real decline in the value of student assistance schemes. The report goes on to make other recommendations about why people are turning away from post-secondary education. Senator Baume made no reference in his speech to the constant complaints about the declining level of research in Australian universities. All these matters are an indictment of a government of seven years which, blinded by ideology in 1976, 1977 and 1978, went off on the wrong tangent in relation to the development of the education system in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer very briefly to Australian Labor Party policy because I want Senator Martyr to have something to chew on and not to give us the benefit of views which he has obtained elsewhere about what the ALP policy is in relation to these matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is my version. I would be delighted if Senator Martyr would deal with its intellectual implications. That would be, indeed, an essay in novelty in this Senate. The first thing I want to say is that the policy of the Labor Party expresses very great concern about the participation levels in post-secondary education in Australia and in later secondary education. That is something we have known in Australia has been bad by world standards for years. But the problem now is that under this Government the situation is getting worse . If Senator Martyr can produce any magical figures, like Hotspur from the vasty deep, which prove that wrong I will be delighted to hear them. The ALP has a commitment to increasing participation rates in secondary and post-secondary education. The reason for that is simple. If this country is in the depths of recession or depression-whichever you like to call it-there is one thing that can be said about the relevance of the Australian system. It is simply this: When and if this country comes out of that period of recession and depression, the best thing the education system can contribute-and that is what the Tertiary Education Commission report says, by implication-is a highly skilled and qualified population, one capable of making adjustments, capable of making a variety of choices about participation in the community, and capable of making civilised and competent judgments about values. That is the importance, in a nutshell in terms of the time we have in the Senate, of the essential position which the ALP policy adopts on that important issue.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the schools issue has been raised by Senator Peter Baume, let me first of all point out one extraordinary confusion in the speech which he made on 3 November to the Federation of Catholic Parents and Friends. He devoted a lot of time to saying that ALP policy threatens non-government schools. A few paragraphs later he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . the average resource levels of government schools have reached the stage where they could be classified under the Commonwealth's subsidy scheme as ' wealthy', not needy. </PARA>
<PARA>It is an argument he raised again today. If he reads the ALP policy, which is one of comparability between like schools and says that government schools can be classified as wealthy, then there is no threat, in the ALP policy, to non- government schools. The ALP policy is concerned about one issue in relation to schools and that is equality of opportunity. We cannot have equality of opportunity in a society in which we assert rights as distinct from opportunities for those who are already in a privileged position. That is the basis upon which an ALP government would be pledged to provide many more resources for the vast majority of Catholic schools. The reason is quite simple. If we are talking about equality of opportunity we have to do something different from the record which is revealed in documents which I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard. These documents show the Commonwealth contribution at various dates to primary government and non-government schools and secondary government and non-government schools. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -This debate on this matter of public importance is a weak faint attempt by the Opposition to raise some criticism of the Commonwealth Government's sound education record. The debate has fallen flatter than any matter of public importance this year. The Opposition is already beaten on the question of education policy. The only distinctive thing it has to offer is a divisive sectarian desertion of resourceful non-government schools. For the rest, it is following the Government's lead. The speeches made by Opposition members today amount to empty rhetoric. Why does not the Opposition recognise that the greater part of its recently announced education policy is a follow the leader policy, stepping out in clear directions already determined by the Liberal-National Party Government? Let me make it clear: What we should be talking about is the overwhelming commitment by the Commonwealth Government to education in Australia, a total Commonwealth commitment to education to the tune of $3.8 billion; that is, almost $4 billion a year. In money terms, it is almost exactly double what was spent by the Labor Government in 1975-76, which was only $1.894 billion. What we are talking about is a Commonwealth commitment to education of 8.1 per cent of this year's Budget, a Commonwealth commitment to education that is second only to social security and defence in terms of Budget outlays, a Commonwealth commitment that, as a nation, when the combined resources of Commonwealth and State are considered, totals over $7 billion in terms of public expenditure. The Opposition did not refer to that perspective but rather made snide, rhetorical remarks around the edges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a nation we spend more than $20m a day, every day of the year, on the education of our children. The education of all Australians is at stake. It is not a time to revive old bitternesses. It is not a time for opportunism or for half-considered promises; it is a time for sound policies. This divisiveness was never helpful. What we need now is communication between the parties, between the Government, the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. What we need now and what we are offered by the Government are sound, well-considered policies. We need forward thinking; we need sensitivity to the needs of our century rather than a return to the unproductive, factional and sectional debate of the past. My colleague Senator Martyr will be acknowledging that there are many areas of agreement between our policies and the 'me too' policies of the Opposition as they have followed the Government's lead. These are the areas we should be concentrating on. These are the issues we should be addressing and in my remarks I will refer directly to specific education programs and education issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The contemporary needs of Australians are wide ranging and varied. That is a truism but it is directly to be borne in mind in all of these matters. Our education system aims to ensure that we have the flexibility to adapt to the needs and to address the problems that challenge us. Education is one response to the many needs of youth. Education must endeavour to meet the demands from schools that are relevant in an increasingly technological age, but education must, with even more priority, address itself to the mastery by school children of basic skills. </PARA>
<PARA> In the schools area, Commonwealth programs, which will amount to $1.24 billion in 1983, have two broad aims. Firstly, the provision of resources to achieve acceptable resource standards in all schools-in government schools and non- government schools-and to translate these into improved educational outcomes. Combined Commonwealth and State effort has improved recurrent resource standards in government schools by about 50 per cent in real terms since 1974. Standards in non-government schools have also increased in real terms, but only by almost 35 per cent since 1974. That is why the Government will not let down non- government schools, as the Opposition has suggested and put out in its policy. The Commonwealth policy is to provide a basic grant for all students attending government and non-government schools, with supplementary grants to students attending those schools that are assessed as being in greater resource need, and 80 per cent of non-government schools are seen to be 30 per cent below the average level in government schools. Why should a Liberal Government that believes in equality of opportunity deny resources to the non-government schools that are so far behind in resource allocation? We will not let down non- government schools and I believe that the introduction of this divisive policy by the Opposition is not helping in any respect. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to one statistic in particular with regard to pupil-teacher ratios . In 1973 the overall ratio was 21.8 students per teacher for all systems, for all schools. But eight years later, by 1980, the ratio had fallen to 16.9 pupils per teacher. Throughout this period the pupil-teacher ratio for both government primary and secondary schools has remained consistently and substantially more favourable than for non-government schools. The first goal of our schools policy is to ensure that there in an acceptable resource standard and allocation among schools in Australia. The second broad goal is the provision of support for groups with special educational needs. I quote from page 1 of the most recent Commonwealth Schools Commission report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission wishes to record its satisfaction that, in a difficult budgetary climate, the Government has accepted most of its recommendations on the funding of Commonwealth programs for schools in 1983. Especially important are the decisions to increase general recurrent funds for government schools and low- resource non-government schools, to provide additional resources for severely handicapped children and newly arrived migrant children and to give handicapped children of pre-school age access to the special education programs. </PARA>
<PARA>Apart from the migrant and multicultural education programs, the Commonwealth Government provides funds for the disadvantaged schools programs, which will receive $35m in 1983. The special education programs will receive $33m in 1983, which represents a real increase of 66 per cent since 1973. We have sought the integration of handicapped children into regular schools for their social and educational advantage. We have provided special programs for children for whom it is wise to remain in institutions. An amount of $3.6m will be allocated for that in 1983, which represents a real increase. The country areas program will receive $10m in 1983. This program was introduced by this Government in 1977 to provide support for students in isolated areas. </PARA>
<PARA> In the brief time that is available to me I will not have the opportunity to go over statements that I have made previously in the Senate with regard to the primary importance in schools of basic skills, of ensuring that what have been simply and, I think, erroneously called the three Rs-literacy, numeracy and the basic skills of comprehension, communication and analysis-are available to all children and that there is ability through the programs for mastery. This in turn requires us as a government to be committed to ensuring that teachers in training colleges are trained and not just academically educated. We have to ensure that teachers have the ability to train children in basic skills. We still need to press on with the restructuring of secondary education to ensure that the 25 per cent who comprise the most disadvantaged and underachieving students in Australia are not shunted into an academic stream that is geared to the Higher School Certificate or matriculation, but rather are given real self- confidence and motivation according to their vocational choice and vocational outcomes. We need to co-ordinate and enhance the language resource of Australia. That matter is the subject of a direct inquiry of a Senate standing committee to which the Government will be, I know, very responsive. We should not lose sight of important contemporary needs, such as mathematics training for girls. It is still a national scandal that the girls of Australia do not participate equally in mathematics training in education. Specific initiatives in curriculum are being supported by the Commonwealth to overcome that problem, but they are designed largely to turn around social and peer group attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to isolated children, the Commonwealth Government received this year a report which it commissioned about evaluating and upgrading these schemes of assistance to children in the outback areas of Australia. The Government's response in the Budget directly followed advice that was given in the Tannock- Tomlinson report. With regard to Aboriginal studies curriculum, there has been an historic and tragic inability to offer Aboriginal languages and developed curriculum in Aboriginal studies in our schools. This has been addressed by the Commonwealth Government. The Commonwealth Aboriginal Studies Working Group report of March this year to the Australian Education Council was developed in its earlier stages by Commonwealth instrumentalities and representatives, not least the National Aboriginal Education Committee. The Commonwealth Government now seeks to address itself to the practical implementation of the pilot schemes that have been so carefully and well outlined in that report. I could refer to computer assisted learning and the advantages that that may have in terms of the contemporary needs of Australian school students. Let us not fall into the trap though of earlier years of thinking that the availability of television to students will solve everything. Some new technology for students will not solve everything. The best thing is still to have a well-motivated, warm-hearted, knowledgeable trained teacher encouraging students, but technology can be of some assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has directly faced these issues. Where it has direct responsibility, such as in the Australian Capital Territory, it has responded with initiatives-for example, the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts regarding preparation for the work force. In Canberra the secondary college system has proved a real success in that direction. The Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) has already referred to Program Youth, which is seeking to make sure that the educational initiatives for young people are in line with the recommendations of that report. The bilingual programs in Australian Capital Territory schools are still pacesetters. Today, with some other senators, I visited the North Ainslie school, which has a Greek bilingual program. This program has been of very real significance and success. Programs of this type need further encouragement not only in Canberra but also in the States. The recent Australian Labor Party policy speech addressed these points in a faint following of the Government's declared directions. There is a me tooism about the ALP's policy, which is to say that the perception of these issues by the Government is the one that the ALP would want to have too and it would like to commit itself to seeing these policies coming forward. The only distinctive part of the ALP's policy is the sectional and divisive stand against resourceful non-government schools. We stand against that. We will fight that. We believe that there ought to be an ability for family choice. We will not see a cutting back in the resources that are going fairly and equitably, according to the level of resource, to non-government schools. </PARA>
<PARA> If there had been time I would have spoken about transitional education and all the many initiatives that have been taken in regard to higher education. I have not had time to touch upon areas such as the centres of excellence program, the response to management education in Australia, the response to the Galbally report, and its implementation, and so on. This Government's achievements in education have been the pacesetter not only for debate in this Parliament but also for the States. I believe the Opposition's faint raising of this debate has fallen completely flat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Senate is debating a matter of public importance on the failure of the Government to pursue education policies which meet contemporary needs. The debate has limited itself by and large to the issue of schools, so I will pursue that line and leave aside the other issues which, naturally enough, fall under the rubric that we are discussing. The unfortunate thing about the debate is that we have spent a lot of time here today discussing what is spent rather than how it is spent. Surely the issue is that massive education budgets can very well be misspent as spent well. It is the issue of how money is spent in education which presumably should exercise our minds, particularly if we are trying to meet contemporary needs. I have said on a number of occassions that I do not believe that this Government has a national education policy. I do not believe we have really sought in the 80-odd years of federation to disentangle the correct approach in terms of the responsibilities of the States within the federation and the responsibility of the Commonwealth within the federation. That is not necessarily a criticism of where we are, but that is undoubtedly the situation we are in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In order to meet contemporary needs we have to disentangle very rapidly the responsibilities at the various levels and see who is responsible and who ought to be pursuing particular policies to meet those needs. Undoubtedly education requires, at the national level, a national perspective. We need to be able to integrate our education into our other policies, particularly into our economic policy but also into our social, cultural and other developmental policies. To have education policy by itself, sitting aside from all other policies, is to have an education policy that is of very little use. It must be linked with other policies, it must run parallel with them and, indeed, I believe that it must infuse them in order to to give direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, more than ever, we will fail unless we grasp that problem. We will fail because the contemporary needs of education are, in a peculiar way, our future needs. Education is one of the professions which seeks to look always to the future, and it must seek to look towards the future of this country if we are to have a successful education policy. When we implement an education policy we are saying to four or five year olds, or their parents, that when children go into our educational institutions we are seeking to assist them over the next 12 to 20-odd years and to form them in such a way that they will be productive and useful members of the community and will work towards their own betterment and the betterment of all others in society. But that means that we are saying to a person who goes into a pre-school today that he will be doing that after the year 2000. That is the point that we have to come to grips with and that, in a peculiar way, is the contemporary need because we know in this country that by the end of this decade over a third of our population will be in jobs they are not currently in. If that does not give us reason to pause then surely nothing else will. </PARA>
<PARA> We are meeting unprecedented rates of change and yet we tend, as we have done again today, to talk about more of the same. More of the same at this time will not assist us one iota. It would have done in the 1950s and it would have done in some way in the 1960s. It lost credibility rapidly in the 1970s and in the 1980s it is very much a recipe for disaster. Before the year 2000-that is, before those children now going into pre-school have finished their education- over four million young Australians will have gone on to the job market. Four million more young Australians will have been looking for work, looking to be productive. That is the type of thing we are talking about. We are not talking about a dollar here or a dollar there; we are talking about the very lifeblood, the very basis of our community and our society. </PARA>
<PARA> In our debates on education we have tended to talk about how much money should go to this school and how much should go to that school. Today the Government has been critical of the Australian Labor Party in terms of the points that the Labor Party has made about its policy on aid to non-government schools. I have said before, and I say again, that that argument was started by the Government. Unfortunately the Labor Party may have fallen into it, but certainly it was started by the Government. Australians have had this debate up to their necks, and we do not need it again. This country does not need to have yet another divisive, drag-out brawl about money going to government or non-government schools. Once and for all we have to accept that we have parallel systems within this country and we have to accept the doubtless economic imperative that before the end of this century almost every school in this country will be funded 100 per cent from government funds. That is an undoubted economic imperative when one looks at the costs. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to try to develop policies which will accommodate that fact within a democratic structure. We ought to stop talking about the whole issue of funds in relation to government and non-government schools and, rather, talk about how we can move both systems ahead so that both are better. I wish now to point to failings in both systems. Within the government structure, the failure is not, as the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) seemed to suggest, within the teachers. The failure within the government system is that it does not offer as wide a choice as is possible within the structure. The failure within the non -government system is that it offers a range of choice only to a small group of people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats stand very firmly for the notion that we should offer to all parents a choice in education. What we mean by that is not only a religious choice but also an educational choice. In other words, if a parent wishes to choose a particular school because it has a multicultural flavour, because it teaches languages in great depth and with great expertise, because it deals with computer education in a realistic and far-reaching way, because it takes maths seriously or because it knows that we are in a scientific age, that parent ought to have that choice. That, we believe, is to offer a real choice to the parents of Australia which will have effect into the next century. It is not to say to them that when we talk about choice we are talking about whether or not their children will receive a secular education or a religious-based education. That is a very small area of choice and to my way of thinking it is something from which we should have passed on. It is no longer a debate about whether we will have that particular range of choice in the community; the community has accepted that we will. What the community is not being offered is a range of choice in those other educational matters. That is where we must now put all of our energy and all of our innovative imagination and expertise, and we must do it together. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has had a number of policies such as the attempted abolition of the Curriculum Development Centre or its consignment to some type of legislative limbo. We have had a serious diminution in the usefulness of the Schools Commission and we have had in the past-thank goodness it has now passed and I do not expect the present Minister to indulge in it-an attempt to shift responsibility for unemployment on to the schools. The States have been bludgeoned into reallocating funds from areas of high need into transition programs. All of those things have confused in many ways the responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the responsibilities of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at that issue in terms of where the responsibilities lie, undoubtedly they lie with the Commonwealth to explain or to articulate a program of funding in relation to what it sees as the imperatives of the next 20 years. The Commonwealth Government has that Commonwealth responsibility. It is a unique responsibility. It must spell out where it sees those extra four million young Australians being employed and what skills it believes they ought to have to be able to gain useful employment. In many ways that employment will be in jobs which certainly do not exist today. They are jobs which we, as a nation, must create. They will not just happen; we will have to develop them. The Government should seek as far as it is able to look ahead into those areas, to spell out for both government and non-government schools its visions and priorities and then make allowances for them. I hope at some stage within the next couple of weeks to speak in detail on the problem in Australia concerning mathematics. I say in passing that that is probably one area where Australia is failing badly. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the type of schooling system we want I think the Commonwealth Government has an obligation to say to the State government: 'You ought to be looking at bringing the community more into your schools and offering wider choices and greater diversity'. It ought to be saying to the non-government schools: 'Since you are moving to a position where you will be totally funded from public funds it is no longer possible for you to have exclusive control over who goes into your schools or who are jettisoned from your schools and how they are jettisoned from your schools'. In other words, the Commonwealth Government has to bite the bullet and say: 'If your schools are dependent on public funds they must meet public criteria. They must offer a service which is available to everybody within the community'. Many parents with children in Catholic schools may find that very difficult to accept. I say to them that they should look at what has occurred in countries overseas. For example, in some countries, such as Great Britain, Catholic schools are funded 100 per cent by the State. When Britain moved to that position the actual composition of Catholic schools did not change very much. By and large Protestants were not willing to send or interested in sending their children to Catholic schools unless they were seeking, as they are now, a particular type of education offered by them. If parents wish to do that it is a parental right. But as we move on into this century I do not see how schools that are supported from the public purse can keep those types of privileged entrances and exits. </PARA>
<PARA> I have discussed this matter with a wide range of people involved in those schools. I think they see the equity and the justice of those ideas. They do not in any way seek to take from parents their choice, the right to have public funds for their schools or the range of schools which is offered. They are seeking to broaden that range of choice to include all parents within this community who seek not only a religious education for their children but also a particular type of education. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Government also has a responsibility to say to private schools: ' There are other areas at which you ought to look'. Unfortunately, I think the debate to date has not done anything other than re-arrange deck chairs on the Titanic when we ought to be attempting to establish life boats to the future for this country. Surely that is what we are about. We must assist each other in the development of that precious resource-those children who are put into our care. They are put into the care of a variety of people in this country. Our concerns are identical. We want children to flourish and develop their best talents so that together everybody in this country will be able to provide for people in the future a better country than we have at present. That really is the aim of any education system. It cannot be achieved by ripping ourselves apart yet again in this country on the divisive issue of where the dollar goes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say at the outset that I am attracted to some of Senator Macklin's ideas. But the actual terms of the matter of public importance brought forward by the Opposition make it very much like some of the debates that we have had in previous weeks. There is obviously no genuine desire on the part of members of the Opposition to come to grips with any fundamental education difficulties that we may have in this country. The whole objective of the debate today is to score political points. An even more serious charge I make is that the debate today also creates division once again on what we used to call state aid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that members of the Opposition have suggested that only they understand contemporary education needs and how those needs may be truly satisfied. That is laughable. By what particular miracle did the Opposition, thrashed at three previous elections because it could not or would not come to terms with this problem or relate to the average Australian, suddenly acquire an expertise which has eluded it for years? The truth is that it has not acquired any such expertise. In fact, Senator Ryan showed the enormous gaps which still exist in the Australian Labor Party's education knowledge and its bias towards one system only; that is, the government system. For example, Senator Ryan suggested that there was a crisis in funding and curricula of such proportions that the whole system was about to fall apart. We know that this is absolute nonsense. In real terms the Government's expenditure is equal to the essential demand. Figures are available in the Basic Paper No. 15 put out by the Parliamentary Library to which I will refer later. Curricula construction and implementation is fundamentally the work of state governments. They are now facing up to the enormous problems that exist today and the realities of education and training in difficult circumstances. They have not always done that. These stringent circumstances are forcing them to face up to the realities . </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ryan also raised the matter of funding to non-government schools. We did not start this although there have been suggestions that we did. Senator Ryan has bolted away from the Labor Party's so-called commitment to the private sector. What a charming excuse she gave! She said: We cannot do everything for everybody so those in the private system will have to wait because they have no automatic right to parity of funding. It is quite clear to me and to other honourable senators who were listening to her speech that, in short, she meant firstly: 'You have the right to choose'. Of course that is a very fine statement . We acknowledge that and thank her for it. But she then said: 'You have no right to an equal share of the funding'. This is another charming interpretation of Labor Party policy. I hope that all those honourable senators who have a particular interest in funding for non-government schools were listening to what she said because I think this is the version of the policy which has almost complete uniformity amongst members of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole essence of Senator Ryan's remarks was that the education system was about to fall apart. We know and we have said before that that is completely untrue. Senator Ryan ought to have thought for a moment about what this Government is working towards and what she and others should be trying to achieve. In summary, we seek improved educational standards, a greater participation of parents and everybody concerned and improved and wide-ranging support for parents to keep their children at school and encourage them to go on to tertiary level. Without doubt this Government's support for both non- government and government schools is strong and continuing. I personally hope that it is moving towards parity. </PARA>
<PARA> I said earlier that I would offer a table as proof of the Government's commitment to education. I have not circulated this table because I believe that it is in the hands of the Opposition.

Of course this trend will continue to be consistent in the future and it will answer the real needs of education. A government of our persuasion has been in office between 1949 and 1972 and 1975 and 1982. It is our kind of government which broke the log-jam of injustice to private schools. It seems to me that the only real problem of injustice that still remains in the education system is that parity of funding between government and private schools has not yet been achieved. I hope that in my lifetime I will see this achieved. I know that the only possibility of seeing the parity of funding between government and private systems is by the retention of this government. Any other kind of government-the Government that we saw here between 1972 and 1975-will be no guarantee to me or to anybody else who supports the private system. People have the right to choose the kind of education they want and to get a fair share of the funds they put in . There will be no guarantee for me or for any of those people if there is a Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the difficulties about the policies of the Australian Labor Party is that there are obviously several policies. Today we have had the Ryan policy and the Button policy. A day or two ago we had the Dawkins policy. We have had the Hayden policy and the Federal Conference policy. All those policies are marginally different. It seems to me that the margin of difference is in the audiences that various spokespeople for the Labor party are addressing. I have at least two interpretations of the five policies that I have heard about. The two worst versions are mutually exclusive. Labor senators hope, when they address audiences consisting mainly of people who support the organisation known as DOGS, the Council for the Defence of Government Schools, that what they say is private and does not get into the Press. There is always trouble when there are quotations by Labor speakers who go to meetings such as this. It seems to me that honourable senators have assured DOGS supporters that the government schools will be favoured and that Labor's long policy term is to encourage only one form of education; that is the government form of education. </PARA>
<PARA> With audiences of private schools honourable senators seldom speak about parity and they say something quite different to what they say to the DOGS audiences. They suggest-there are some who are naive enough to believe it-that Labor is totally dedicated to preserving and protecting the private education system. As I say, this is for general private school audiences only. When they go round to speak to people who come from poorer parish schools, the line is varied just a little. This is to indicate that Labor will look after them and will cut down or cut out the funding to larger and relatively more prosperous private schools. Plainly the two major lines of Labor's policy are mutually exclusive and plainly divisive in their intent. The essence of Labor's line to the smaller and larger private schools is also deliberately divisive in trying to set one against the other. I want members of the Opposition to know that we are awake to their divisive tactics. We will be expressing everything we know about these divisive tactics in education debates from now on. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to tell the Senate about a document entitled 'The Discrimination Gap in Public Expenditure on Government and Non-Government Schooling 1980-81'. The source of the figures is the Commonwealth Department of Education in March 1982. Of the total Australian schooling budget for 1980-81, 88 per cent is spent on government school children and 12 per cent is spent on non-government school children. Honourable senators will know that 76.9 per cent of Australian school children are in government schools and that 23.1 per cent are non-government school children. A total of 94.8 per cent of State government expenditure goes to government schools and only 5.2 per cent goes to non-government schools. The relationship is much closer with the Commonwealth. Senator Peter Baume has been trying to demonstrate this today. It seems to have fallen on deaf ears in the Labor Party. A total of 52.6 per cent of Commonwealth Government expenditure is spent on government schools and 43.8 per cent of Commonwealth Government expenditure is spent on non-government schools. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite plain that there is a long way to go before there is reasonable parity. This problem which has bedevilled us in the Senate and members in the House of Representatives for so long has been in existence too long. We have to get to parity as quickly as we can. I will be content if parity is achieved in my lifetime. I know that if there is a Labor government I may not live long enough to see this parity come into being. This does not just occur to me, or to people who may have a definite ideological bent for private schools. It has also occurred to the editors of the Canberra Times. The editorial of Friday 19 November stated:</PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of the aggregate figures--</PARA>
<PARA>These are the figures I have quoted-</PARA>
<PARA> Anyway, it is apparent that parents of children in non-government schools are subsidising parents with children in government schools. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very strong and truthful statement for the editors of the Canberra Times to make. Finally, the Government's record on education is very sound. The Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) has clearly indicated the high points of what the Government is doing in education. He has been well backed up by Senator Teague. We, on the Government side, have no case to answer. For Senator Button to come in here and suggest that it would be my job to demolish the Labor Party's case in this debate is one of the silliest assertions I have heard him make in a number of silly assertions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to vote against the second reading of the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill and associated legislation. I will support the foreshadowed amendments in the Committee stage, if the second reading is carried, of which contingent notice of motion has been given. I have four reasons why I am opposed to the passage of the Bill at the second reading. The first is that I believe it is wrong philisophically because it indulges in retrospectivity. I do not intend to attempt to give the Senate a lecture on retrospectivity-that matter has been canvassed here for a number of days-but I think one ought to be grateful that at last the Government has recognised that the legislation is in fact retrospective. For a long time we had the quaint idea promoted by the Government that what was involved was merely a recoupment; it was not retrospective. The Government dressed it up with all sorts of semantics. I do not think that did the Government's credibility much good at all. I think it was forced into the position illustrated by these words which George Orwell wrote back in 1946:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Political languge-and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists-is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind. </PARA>
<PARA>I am afraid that is what the Government's propaganda about this measure was for a very long time. The only other comment I wish to make about retrospectivity is that there have been some allegations from my political opponents that somehow or other Perth is the tax evasion capital of Australia and that it is full of somewhat dubious Liberal lawyers who were doing odd things within their professions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Name one.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DV4">Senator WITHERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, nobody has yet named one, but it is rather interesting that my colleague Senator Crichton-Browne mentioned the other night that the infamous Mr Bercove was one of the Labor lawyers for liberty, or something like that. He is perhaps the most notorious of all the lawyers caught so far. I shall read from a Queen's Counsel's opinion which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to the stated justification for the proposed legislation: the Government has 'decided on this course of action because of the essentially fraudulent nature of much of the conduct involved'. The first point to be made is that nothing in the press release indicates that a distinction will be drawn between vendor shareholders who acted fraudulently, or were aware of the fraudulent intention of others, and those who did not. Of course the legislation will say nothing of the sort. A characteristic of the members of the class in question will be their lack of knowledge of that which entrepreneurs or purchasers would do. It adds nothing to the rational discussion of matters such as this to use emotive phraseology such as 'essentially fraudulent', however attractive that may be as political rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it may be granted that some involved in such transactions acted in a truly fraudulent manner. Their sins are to be visited upon the vendor shareholders, who were legally entitled to act as they did when the actions were performed, and who are to be deprived of the benefits of limited liability and made liable for the taxation liability which was not at inception or subsequently theirs. All who care about the rule of law should feel outraged by such a proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>That opinion is dated 19 August 1982 in Perth and is given by one Ian D. Temby Q .C. who, some six or nine months ago, was the endorsed candidate of the Australian Labor Party in the by-election in the electorate of Nedlands, caused by the retirement of Sir Charles Court. I think that ought to be put on the record as the opinion of someone who might be said to be one of my political opponents. </PARA>
<PARA> I move now to my second reason for opposing this legislation: I think it is politically stupid. It is quite wrong because all it has done initially is to encourage Mr Wran in his essay on retrospective stamp duties which blew up in his face and which he had to give away in the end. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DV4">Senator WITHERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. He went back to 1920, he said inadvertently; once something hit the fan he could not duck away from it fast enough. I have no doubt that the initial intention was to go back to 1920. It has also encouraged the Australian Labor Party. Senator Evans was recently reported in the Press-I trust, accurately-on how the Labor Party, if it got to office, would conduct its war retrospectivity against tax evasion and avoidance. I am quite certain that the ALP would not have adopted retrospectivity with such fervour if members on this side of the Parliament had not made retrospectivity respectable. That is why I refer to the political stupidity of this legislation. I can never see any point in a political party making the bad policies of its opponents respectable. That is all we are doing by this legislation. In logic, if the Government believes in retrospectivity in respect of the present Bills, why should it not then recoup all that tax from dry Slutzkin schemes, from Curran schemes, from family trusts and from family partnerships? There is no reason why it should not because so far nobody has said that everybody in the present scheme had been fraudulent. The vendor-shareholders were not fraudulent; they were merely tax avoiders at that stage. But why, in logic, should we catch those engaged in a wet Slutzkin and not a dry Slutzkin? Once we go down this slipperty track of wet Slutzkins we end up in all sorts of other things. The Government's argument about fairness and equity lends weight to the Labor Party's point of view that we should legislate retrospectivity to catch all tax avoidance schemes which have been around, say, post the mid-1960s.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The third reason I am opposed to the legislation is because I believe it to be unnecessary. No evidence has ever been produced that the present legislation is ineffective to catch the fraudulent evaders-those who ought to be caught under the Crimes Act, the Companies Act or the presently existing taxation Acts. I put it quite strongly to the Senate that the only reason this legislation is necessary is to cover up bureaucratic bungling, incompetence and lethargy, because the schemes should have been stopped back in 1975. If anybody in this country should be given a medal it is Mr Todman who discovered these schemes in 1972, according to the Costigan report. He did a vast amount of work on these matters until the time of the Brinsden opinion in mid-1975. It is rather interesting that Mr Todman seems to have disappeared. I imagine he has now retired. He ought to be publicly thanked for first exposing and getting on to these matters. The 1975 law was adequate, according to Brinsden, Lockhart and others. Everybody knows about those opinions. </PARA>
<PARA> Who was to blame? I initially thought the Commisisoner of Taxation ought to get a cuff under the ear because he had not been sufficiently diligent, but having looked at the telephone book of documents which was tabled, it is quite obvious that he nagged year in and year out like an aching tooth. I almost said 'mother- in-law' but that would not be appropriate with the present Acting Deputy President in the chair. The Commissioner nagged away trying to get some action but nothing happened. Admittedly, perhaps he should have nagged the Attorney- General's Department harder and harder. I suspect that what happened was that he was so used to rotten service from the Attorney-General's Department that he thought the rotten service he was getting was normal service. One can get so used to bad service that one thinks it is normal and it does not worry one. He thought that the inaction was par for the course for that Department. I think the real blame belongs to both Harders and Neaves. These two cannot escape responsibility. In a private practice they would not only have been sued for negligence but also reported to their professional organisations and, most likely, struck off the register. There is no way any private legal firm could leave a client's business file in a bottom drawer for seven years and escape either a negligence action or being struck off by the professional group or the Full Bench of a Supreme Court. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened here? A couple of minnows in Perth are chased. Poor Bercove, as if it was all his fault. Fancy the head of one of the major legal firms in Australia-be it Malleson's, Blake's or Allen's-saying: 'It was not my fault. I gave it to the articled clerk and he forgot about it'. Imagine getting away with that! Anybody who knows anything about anything knows that one just cannot blame the office boy for one's own dereliction of duty. Harders and Neaves had the job and they got the money. They pleaded before the Remuneration Tribunal that they ought to get more money because of the responsibility that they carry. Permanent heads argue for a bigger responsibility allowance. When something goes wrong it is said: 'Yes, but that is somebody else's fault; it is the bloke out in the branch office'. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that both Harders and Neaves ought to be sacked. If they are not sacked at least they ought to be immortalised somehow or other in limericks or clerihews. I have had a go but the result is not terribly good. There are many more erudite people in this place who have a far better sense of rhythm than I have and I would be grateful if they would polish it up. I would start off with something like this:</PARA>
<PARA> A negligent lawyer named Harders,</PARA>
<PARA> Had a head as empty as Mother Hubbard's larders. </PARA>
<PARA> Because he was so lax</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner received no tax,</PARA>
<PARA> And the companies went to the bottom of the harbours. </PARA>
<PARA>Of Mr Neaves, one could say:</PARA>
<PARA> A foolish lawyer names Neaves,</PARA>
<PARA> Was so negligent he encouraged tax thieves. </PARA>
<PARA> Because he was so lax,</PARA>
<PARA> The Act on income tax</PARA>
<PARA> Now has another 80 leaves. </PARA>
<PARA>These fellows should not be allowed to go scot-free. I am not prepared to support legislation made retrospective 10 years to catch taxpayers-I have been quite open in public on this-when public servants go scot-free. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear a lot these days, quite properly, about law reform. One of the things which law reform commissions have been bending their minds to in recent years is how to smarten up the private legal sector. A number of suggestions have been made. It is said that lawyers should not try each other in club; they should not do it in secret. There should be consumers' representatives to see that the general public is being given a fair go. By and large the legal profession agrees with all these very necessary reforms. What is good enough for the private sector ought to be good enough for the public sector. Who can take some action against two negligent lawyers running a big legal practice who have cost their client-the Commissioner of Taxation-$450m, $500m? I do not know what the figure is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps $600m. It would be the biggest negligence action in this country. If I were the Commissioner of Taxation I would be taking acting against them if I could. The fourth reason I oppose this legislation is that it is all about what one might call the game law mentality. Madam Acting Deputy President, you would know that the game laws of the United Kingdom perhaps had their origin with those well known Norman kings. If one took one of their deer in one of their forests one lost one's hand or one's eye. As the centuries rolled by the game laws got tougher and tougher. I suppose one could say thank goodness for that, otherwise many of the people transported to Australia for poaching would not have been sent here. But in the late eighteenth century the situation became so extreme that there were some 200 or 300 offences for which a person could be hanged or transported for life. This legislation is following a similar course. We are trying to get more gamekeepers and to make the poaching laws harsher; we are taking no action to do away with what causes people to poach. Most people who take any interest in the criminal law or criminology would agree with Mr Clifford, the Director of the Australian Institute of Criminology. He was reported recently, when talking about some necessary reforms in the criminal law and our attitude on law breaking, as saying that the answer is not harsher penalties and more police. He was not talking about tax. That is what these Bills are all about. They are all part of the game law syndrome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We in this place take a rather superior attitude, do we not, about Pakistan, Iran and the savage punishments that they mete out for what we would regard as quite minor offences. But I say that we are going down the same track. One of the interesting things about this debate is that in spite of all the hyperbole we have heard about fairness, equity and getting back allegedly stolen money-all the pure wind people are attempting to roll into solidity-what comes through more than anything is a feeling of vengeance. That is what honourable senators want. They want revenge on the people who they think stole their tax revenue. Honourable senators want the same sort of vengeance wreaked on those people as they want wreaked on a criminal or anybody else who offends them. That is what I call the game law mentality. </PARA>
<PARA> What is going to happen? I can predict it. We are going to have a bigger tax Act; we are going to have more and more laws, more and more tax officials, more and more people prosecuted, more and more people bankrupted and more evasion and more avoidance. It is absolutely predictable. I could understand the Tories getting together on the game law attitude. The English gentry were fully in favour of enforcing the game laws. I suppose there are some landed proprietors in Australia who believe that they are the direct descendants of them. I can understand the socialists believing in game laws concerning tax because they are a party of materialism. Of course they are materialists. We keep saying, do we not, that they are socialists, materialists, not people of the spirit. Why people who really regard themselves as liberals could get picked up with the game law attitude totally escapes me. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tories, the anarchists, the socialists, the revolting peasants-call them what one likes-have all joined forces to enforce a new set of game laws and they are going to be very proud of it. That is why I will not support this legislation. Nobody is terribly interested about individual rights, human rights and the rule of law. Nobody wants to talk about that. This legislation represents a triumph of materialism over liberalism. Money is the most important thing that we can think of. That is what we want-money. It does not matter by what means we get it or how we use it. As long as we get that $400m, $500m, $ 600m, or $700m it does not matter what happens; we want the money. I would not have thought that that is the way we should do it. Because I believe this legislation represents a triumph of materialism over real liberalism there must be a division at the second reading stage of the debate. I think that the socialists, the Tories and the materialists all ought to sit together, be seen to be sitting together and be counted so that they can all be exposed for what they are. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said the penalties will get harsher, retrospectivity will grow and the rule of law will continue to be trampled on. The cash economy is alive and well. It is thriving and it will get bigger and the end result, of course, is that we will get worse laws and end up with probably less revenue from a distorted section of the taxpayers. A few harmless lunatics-as they may be considered-talk about flat rate tax. That may not necessarily be the answer but at least they are talking about some sort of tax reform. There are those who disappear into the distance and talk about a different mix between direct and indirect tax but they are still not really getting to the fundamental problems of taxation in this country. The real problem of taxation in this country, of course, is that all governments which wish to buy votes at election times and raise expectations which they will never realise keep using a revenue gathering Act for expenditure purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> I reckon that I could write a tax Act in about 10 pages and get rid of most of the avoiders; I would not get rid of the evaders. We will always have the crooks in this business. We will always have people who will understate their incomes. We will not do away with evasion even if we start cutting their hands off. People have suffered all sorts of physical and financial hurt in their attempts to cheat the tax gatherer. They will keep on doing it. But we would get rid of most of the tax avoidance in Australia if Parliament-it is our fault the present situation exists-did not keep legislating to invent new schemes whereby tax avoiders could make a welter out of what were thought to be good political ideas . I mention but the film industry and art collections tax schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> For some 40 years now-most likely for some 50 years-the whole of the Income Tax Assessment Act has been becoming more and more distorted as governments give more and more concessions by way of amendments to the tax Act. If political parties would bend their minds to having very simple revenue raising legislation , if they would hand out all the goodies they wished to hand out by using the expenditure side of the Budget, through the Appropriation Bills-be they general or special-that would provide some idea of what they were spending and some idea of who was collecting it. Then most of the tax avoidance in this country would go. Who is not in tax avoidance? On the front page of the Australian this morning a gentleman from the Australian Conservation Foundation was reported as seeing nothing wrong at all in getting donations, laundering them through his own organisation as tax free money, taking 2 per cent off the top, then passing the money on to somebody else. Everybody talks about lack of morality in this country, yet everybody is in it. Tax concessions generally are opposed by the revenue gatherers. Quite clearly, the Commissioner of Taxation knows that whenever politicians get those crazy notions about giving a special benefit to a particular class of person it will be exploited and will become a rort. The politician brushes that fact aside because there will most likely be a vote in what he is doing to the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Until we get back to using the Income Tax Assessment Act to raise revenue and the Appropriation Bills to expend money we will stay in this tax mess. It is no use adopting the game law attitude. That will change nothing. It will make things worse. We will end up with a more divided society. We will not shift the burden of taxation by making the Act more and more complicated. With a complicated Act we will not stop either tax evasion or tax avoidance. We will have harsher penalties, more injustices and more discretions placed on the Commissioner of Taxation. I guarantee the bigger the Act grows, the harsher the penalties, the more the cash economy will thrive. </PARA>
<PARA> We have just seen the first signs of barter in this country. Honourable senators who have not seen such signs will know of others who have. Such trade will grow. I am really opposed to the legislation because of the game law mentality. This sort of thing will do nothing for taxation reform. It will satisfy the desire for vengeance of those who want to wreak their wrath on these so-called wicked, evil people. It may satisfy those who wish to gobble up this $ 400m, $500m or $600m. For those four reasons I intend to vote against the second reading of the Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make a few remarks in relation to the taxation Bills, not to go over ground that has been already canvassed by a large number of honourable senators who have spoken during the debate, but to canvass what I believe to be a couple of relevant points relating to the retrospective legislation proposed by the Government. Senator Withers, who has just spoken, tried to make out that the Australian Labor Party was proposing this legislation. In actual fact this retrospective legislation has been brought into this place by the Government. It has been brought into this place by the Government only because of the Government's lack of action. We heard Senator Withers talk about officers within various departments, saying that they should be struck off the legal register because of their non-action. He said that if there was a clerk working for those gentlemen who did not carry out the duty they were supposed to, one could not blame the clerk; one had to look at the people who were in charge of the action being taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I go a bit further and say that the reason the Government has brought in the retrospective legislation and seeks to make changes to the Income Tax Assessment Act is the lack of action not just by the Government but, more specifically, by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). If we talk about fairness in relation to laying blame at people's feet, about people in charge in departments placing files at the bottom of a drawer and not doing anything about them for a number of years, about not being able to blame the clerk, I think it is very reasonable for us to say that the Treasurer should accept some blame for the problems that have occurred within the taxation system within Australia. We should also blame the Attorney-General for not taking action when those rorts were taking place, when the people of Australia were being robbed of tax that should have been paid, when the rorts were being worked . This is the time when the Treasurer and the Attorney-General were not taking positive action to upset the tax avoiders and the tax evaders in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not any action of the Government that made it introduce retrospective legislation or take some action in relation to the Income Tax Assessment Act; it was the McCabe-Lafranchi report and the report of the Costigan Royal Commission of Inquiry on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. It was those reports that drew the attention of the public to tax avoidance and tax evasion and led them to ask that some action be taken in relation to it. The Government, in supporting the report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, grabbed the thin edge of the wedge. It did not really believe that the Royal Commission's findings would go as far as they did and indicate the amount of tax evasion and avoidance that had been taking place in this country, the amount of tax evasion and avoidance that the Attorney-General and Treasurer had not taken any note of at the time it was taking place. It was only the outcry from the electorate, from the pay-as-you-earn taxpayers of Australia who were continuing to pay the correct amount of tax, that made this Government take some action. It was also in an attempt to draw away some of the blame from the Treasurer and the Attorney -General that this Government decided to take some action in relation to tax avoidance in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that one should look at the amount of revenue that is being lost to the Australian people and the Australian Government and the extra burden that is being placed on the pay-as-you-earn taxpayer because no action has been taken by this Government when tax evasion and avoidance has been taking place and bottom- of-the-harbour schemes have been under way in this country. That scheme has spread at an amazing rate. The McCabe-Lafranchi report gave details of some 900 companies which were investigated, out of 3,000 companies which it was alleged were involved in all States. The Australian Taxation Office now admits that around 6,000 companies may have been involved. The New South Wales Government reportedly has a list of around 4,000 companies involved in that State. It is impossible to tell where the scheme stops. </PARA>
<PARA> It was because of that scheme, the problems that existed with taxation and the amount of revenue lost to the Department of the Treasury, that this Government decided to take some action and to bring in retrospective legislation in relation to bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. I believe that was a correct action. It has been quite surprising to me that a number of honourable senators on the Government side have opposed retrospective legislation and have stood in this place and used a number of quotations from learned members of the law community to back up their arguments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. They have used those to back up their arguments about why they oppose the introduction of retrospective legislation in this country of ours. It also seems that most of those honourable senators who were opposed to the Government's bringing in retrospective legislation, or trying to gather the money owed to it by the tax evaders and avoiders, have all said that they are not supporting the tax evader or the tax avoider. After saying that those honourable senators went on to say that they opposed the Government, they opposed the introduction of this legislation to try to bring about the gathering of the tax that was owed by people who had avoided it over a period. So on the one hand those honourable senators were saying that they are opposed to retrospective legislation but on the other hand they were saying that they are not going to support the tax avoider or tax evader although they are opposing the legislation proposed by this Government to take some action in gathering the tax owed in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose we could go a little further and look at the pay-as-you-earn taxpayers. I find it fairly difficult to read today because of the break in my glasses. A public opinion poll on bottom-of-the-harbour schemes shows very clearly what the ordinary person in Australia thinks about the Government's action. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Two out of three Australians favor the new law to collect taxes from shareholders of companies which went to the 'bottom of the harbour.'</PARA>
<PARA> Almost as many people would also favor a retrospective law to help collect other unpaid taxes, according to the Morgan Gallup Poll. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Australia-wide survey in October, 1844 men and women aged 14 and over were asked if they had read or heard of companies not paying taxes because their profits disappeared-a procedure known as 'sending them to the bottom of the harbor.'</PARA>
<PARA> Of the people surveyed, 76 percent said they had heard of 'sending profits to the bottom of the harbour.' All then were asked whether they had read or heard of the retrospective law to help the Federal Government collect taxes from the shareholders of the companies whose profits disappeared. Seventy-four percent said they had heard of the new law. </PARA>
<PARA> All people were then asked: 'Are you for or against that new retrospective law to help collect unpaid taxes from the shareholders of companies which ''went to the bottom of the harbour''?'</PARA>
<PARA> The following table shows that large majorities of both Liberal-National Party and Australian Labor Party electors favor the law:</PARA>
<PARA>I could go on and mention the percentages. The percentage of all people for the new law was 65 per cent. The percentage of Liberal-National Party for the new law was 67 per cent; the Australian Democrats, 54 per cent; the Australian Labor Party, 68 per cent, and others were 62 per cent. A whole series of figures is available in that opinion poll. I do not believe there is any need to read all of them because I think the poll shows very clearly the number of people in favour of this Government taking that action. Apart from a number of small amendments the Australian Labor Party will support the action proposed by the Government to see once and for all that the right amount of tax is returned to the Taxation Office so that pay-as-you-earn taxpayers are not required to continue to carry the burden placed on them by the non-payment of tax by tax avoiders and evaders in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise as an unashamed supporter of the Government's proposals that are before us and I trust that the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill 1982 and the other legislation before us will be endorsed by the Senate today without any amendment. I believe that we have before us legislation which demonstrates the Government's intention to collect moneys which should have been paid and made available by the taxpayers of Australia for necessary government purposes over the years, moneys which were denied by fraud and evasion and from which certain people have obtained benefits . Those people who have obtained benefits will be required to repay them so that the ordinary pay-as-you-earn taxpayer in this community shall not suffer. All the nonsense that has been talked in this place and elsewhere about retrospectivity overlooks the fact that, if anybody suffers because of the failure to go ahead with legislation of this sort, retrospectively the people to suffer will be the present day PAYE taxpayers who will pay more tax and not receive concessions because the bright boys have got away with the frauds which they perpetrated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to say various things about the general nature of this legislation. It is designed generally to catch bottom-of-the-harbour schemes; frauds which have been perpetrated. What is a bottom-of-the-harbour scheme? Put very simply, a company with current year profits is stripped of all its assets so it is left with no money. The company's ordinary tax liability-that is, company tax or the undistributed profit tax-is not paid. The company is sold to a promoter who pays an inflated price for it because he knows the tax liability will not be paid. The promoter in turn sells the company to people with fictitious names and bogus addresses. In other words the company was transferred to people who had no money and who could not be traced. The Commissioner of Taxation is then owed money from each such company under the existing taxation law, but the company has no funds to pay him. The company has vanished without paying its tax liability and it has no assets from which to satisfy the debt. </PARA>
<PARA> Bottom-of-the-harbour schemes are not clever devices for avoiding taxation; they are fraudulent exercises in tax evasion by which taxation, lawfully payable by a company on current year earnings, remains payable but unable to be collected. I believe that when one realises those plain facts one is amazed at the extent to which there has been opposition to this legislation. Some of the opposition is genuine and sincere, but I am afraid that some of my colleagues on this side of the chamber have been induced-they are mostly laymen-sometimes by clever lawyers, into believing that there is some enormous overriding principle that no legislation should be made retrospective. I will come to that question in a moment. We know that something like $580m was evaded by means of these schemes and the Government has said that that must be paid. When the Government shows its firmness and determines these things then I think we must recognise that its attitude is popular. I think reference has already been made to the most recent Morgan gallup poll about this matter. In that poll people were asked :</PARA>
<PARA> 'Are you for or against that new retrospective law to . . . collect unpaid taxes from the shareholders of companies which 'went to the bottom of the harbour'?'</PARA>
<PARA>What was the reply? Sixty-five per cent of all people-the result is very similar with respect to party allegiances-were for the new law. Sixteen per cent voted against the new law and nineteen per cent were undecided. The same people were then asked:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Apart from this particular case, are you for or against retrospective laws to help collect unpaid taxes?'</PARA>
<PARA>Those for retrospectivity, 60 per cent; those against, 22 per cent; and undecided, 18 per cent. So there is a very heavy public demand for the Government to take this action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not supporting it because of a gallup poll. There is a fair amount of popularity in my party for this legislation. I believe it is right and just. The fact that the public understands the need for it is an important consideration. It is important to realise also that, although the Government has made some concessions, the Bill has not been watered down. Despite the criticisms which have been made of it, the Taxpayers' Association Journal had this to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill hasn't been watered-down. The changes merely recognise that in many cases it would be impossible for the vendor shareholders to sell enough assets quickly enough to avoid crippling interest hitting them harder. </PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that before us we have a reasonably undiluted attempt by the Government to enforce these obligations. Much of the criticism that has come from colleagues on this side of the chamber has been on the basis that the Government was slow to appreciate the problem-the Government did not take action . Of course the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, and other reports, have indicated most incredible delays, misjudgments and bureacratic bunglings on the part of persons who ought to have known better. Nonetheless, that was no excuse for the Government, when it realised the position, not to proceed then with expedition and not to proceed as hard as it could. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand and respect the attitude of my colleague Senator Hill who takes a reasoned view of this matter and concludes, quite contrary to my view, that existing laws might be sufficient. I do not believe the existing laws would be sufficient to recover the moneys which otherwise would be lost, but at least he bases his argument on reason and not on the argument of others who unfortunately have been persuaded that the only principle of taxation is non-retrospectivity and not fairness and equity between one taxpayer and another. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of retrospectivity which has dominated this debate is one which I think should be faced. It is one by which non-lawyers are mesmerised. They think that, because something was legal when it was done, the legality of it must not be changed and the rights must not be altered. There have been all kinds of absurd propositions as to why we should not do this sort of thing. We in this Parliament approve retrospective legislation in the form of Bills time after time. The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances approves retrospective provisions about twice a week. They are beneficial provisions. They are provisions which point out that the Government may be slow in awarding people payments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course it is. We do it so many times. Senator Hamer and I well recall a debate at a meeting of the Liberal Party State Council in Melbourne last weekend when the Council threw out a proposal for some general bars against retrospectivity. There we heard the Honourable Alan Hunt, for many years the leader of the Upper House in Victoria and a conscientious Liberal at that, saying that he had supported more than 150 pieces of retrospective legislation with a clear conscience. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If anyone tells me it is not Liberal, or contrary to principle, I say we don't belong to the same party. It's nonsense to create an overall principle where none exists. </PARA>
<PARA>That was very well said by Alan Hunt and it is very true. Of course, as I have said, it takes one principle and there is an existing principle. The law generally tries to interpret against retrospectivity. It prefers, where there is doubt, to rule against a retrospective operation. We in this Parliament prefer to deal with something retrospectively only in the case of need. But where crooked people have got away with money for years and where we can deal with them only by using this sort of method, it must be used. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me remind people that in this case we are not using retrospectivity to create criminal offences. That is a slide which has been adopted by many of the people who argue in this area. They point to Article 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence, under national or international law, at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time when the criminal offence was committed. If, subsequent to the commission of the offence, provision is made by law for the imposition of a lighter penalty, the offender shall benefit thereby. </PARA>
<PARA>That is quite true, but we all agree that the Article relates to criminal penalties. Nobody doubts that it is undesirable to do that. But in the case of the recoupment of tax which ought to have been paid by individuals but which, because of a sleight of hand or illegalities, was not paid, a completely different situation prevails. It is an interesting fact that the power of parliaments to legislate retrospectively has been cited very often by judges. Reference probably has been made already in this debate to Lord Greene, who in dealing with this matter said, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA> It would not shock us in the least to find that the legislature has determined to put an end to the struggle by imposing the severest of penalties. It scarcely lies in the mouth of the taxpayer who plays with fire to complain of burnt fingers. </PARA>
<PARA>That is how he responded to people who were objecting to retrospective legislation. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the section has to some extent a retroactive effect again appears to us of no importance when it is realised that the legislation is a move in a long and fiercely contested battle with individuals who well understand the rigour of the contest. </PARA>
<PARA>Likewise, Viscount Simon, who was Lord Chancellor, in dealing with similar legislation, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Judicial dicta may be cited which point out that, however elaborate and artificial such methods may be, those who adopted them are ''entitled'' to do so . There is, of course, no doubt that they are within their legal rights, but that is no reason why their efforts, or those of the professional gentlemen who assist them in the matter, should be regarded as a commendable exercise of ingenuity or as a discharge of the duties of good citizenship. On the contrary, one result of such methods, if they succeed, is, of course, to increase pro tanto the load of tax on the shoulders of the great body of good citizens who do not desire, or do not know how, to adopt these manoeuvres. </PARA>
<PARA>That, I suggest, is the major principle. It is the principle of fairness which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) have amply demonstrated in this legislation. We do not want to see the burden imposed in this way on other citizens. We used retrospective legislation against the Curran scheme in 1978. We have used retrospective legislation on many occasions when it has been necessary. We know that here we are dealing with people who broke the existing law and who acted with greed. People who would be prepared to buy a watch outside a shop window knowing quite well that it was worth a lot more than they were paying for it run the risk of having to disgorge later on, and when they disgorge we should not be trying to protect them or defend them. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the main arguments against retrospectivity has always been that we must have certainty in the law. There is a feeling, a grasp, on the part of non- lawyers that certainty is a necessity, but much of the law has been built largely on retrospectivity. In the early days the common law recognised people's rights to land and to other things and if a person's possession was in his name he could do what he liked with it. Then along came the courts and subsequently the Parliament creating the law of equity which was superimposed on the common law and which changed the rights of people at common law. It said: 'You must recognise trusts, you must recognise beneficial interests by other persons in your land'. So people had their rights changed retrospectively. The whole greatness of the equity system created in Britain both by the courts and by the Parliament lies in the fact that it was created retrospectively. This was pointed out very well in a letter which Mr James Guest, an eminent lawyer in Victoria, wrote on this subject a short time ago. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> All people whose land, money or other assets are held in trust for their benefit from the long tradition in English law which has allowed the most solidly entrenched rules of the common law to be disregarded in favor of the requirements of ''good conscience and equity''. To own something at common law was not (and is not enough) if the equity jurisdiction of the King's court found that the way in which the common law owner acquired it made it unconscionable for him to hold it for his own benefit. Such was the origin of the trust; like the early remedies for fraud it was created retrospectively. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is important for those who sob now against retrospectivity to bear this in mind. I can well imagine the reaction of my colleagues' equivalents in 1833 when the British House of Commons abolished slavery throughout the British Empire. They must have been very concerned about the retrospective destruction of rights which they had enjoyed for generations. They must have thought that they were entitled, because of the certainty of the law, to go on enjoying and flogging their slaves for the next 100 years, but that right was suddenly gone. I am afraid that I have heard in the arguments of some of my colleagues today the reflection of those slavers of 1833. Who will pay if we do not have retrospectivity? It is very clear that the victims will be the pay-as-you-earn taxpayers. Those people these days are paying something like ten per cent more of the whole taxation of this country than ten years ago. In 1972 they were paying, as a percentage of income tax, 55.23 per cent. They are now paying 66.39 per cent. I think that is wrong. I have many other objections to the tax law. I draw attention to the great increase in PAYE taxpayer's obligations and to the lesser increase in company tax. It is a lesser increase because people using the cash economy put money in their own pockets. I think these matters must be taken into account.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I turn now to another question. Of course it has been said that this legislation seeks to recover moneys obtained by evasion. It does not, of course, deal with avoidance. There is considerable confusion about this subject. I, for one, have not a great deal of strong faith in the variation and difference between evasion and avoidance. In many respects, of course, I think that the elaborate schemes of tax avoidance which have been adopted in this country for some years and which have lost the government millions of dollars are worse than the petty evasions by people taking money out of their tills and not accounting for it when paying tax. I draw some comfort from the fact that, in 1980, the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act outlawed both evasion and avoidance in relation to the Slutzkin schemes. I am glad to see that, in future, no distinction will be made in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can understand the Government not proceeding, in this legislation, to try to recover moneys that have been obtained by way of tax avoidance. It is certainly easier, in principle, to justify the attack on evasion. Certainly, it is necessary, I think, to recognise that the High Court of Australia, in its jurisdiction for a number of years, allowed various schemes as legal which were deplorable and quite contrary to the public interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were avoidance schemes because the High Court said they were legal. Everyone else would regard them as immoral and shocking, but they were allowed to exist so people proceeded with them. A number of those were later outlawed; they were illegal as from 1980. But I believe there is justification, therefore, in the Government restricting the legislation to evasions. There is some difference of view about this. The Australian Labor Party attitude to this Bill is considered in an interesting article by Terry McCrann in the Age of 3 November headed: 'Labor clarifies position on tax retrospectivity'. Senator Gareth Evans explained, in a general way and quite well, the Opposition's attitude towards this type of legislation. He started well, but when it came to saying how much further the Labor Party would have gone I think he immediately got into rather heavy water. The article stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . he then proceeded to confuse the issue by saying that observers should not necessarily assume Labor would embark on a rash of retrospective legislation to recoup all the tax lost by all the artificial avoidance schemes. Yet Labor had not ruled out specific action against trust-stripping for one; each case would be considered on its 'merits'. </PARA>
<PARA>The writer then says:</PARA>
<PARA> Score one against Senator Evans. The electorate is entitled to a much clearer expression of just exactly how extensive Labor's retrospective action will be.</PARA>
<PARA>I will not go into the detailed argument in this but it does create a problem once one proceeds to on-their-merits arguments about which schemes will be attacked and which will not. Clearly in the case of evasion which the Government has chosen to legislate against there is a clear and good case. Blatant, contrived and artificial avoidance schemes have been put to rest for the future. But I believe that the Government should certainly try, to the greatest possible extent, to enforce legislation to collect moneys which can be recovered from people who were the beneficiaries of schemes in the past. The Government is in an unassailable position in this area. Even though there have been delays there will be no excuses for not collecting these taxes. Of course, if the Government did not proceed with that collection it would be subject to condemnation by the public which obviously appreciates the position very clearly. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to the amendments. This series of legislation has been considered in depth by the Government parties. I wish only that some other parts of the legislative program received the close investigation that has been given to this legislation; I would also like to see the same courtesy and attention given to people who have objections to legislation. Not always does that happen. I have studied the amendments as best I can. I am not, and never have been, any expert in tax avoidance, tax evasion or tax period in my 25 years as a lawyer. But the alterations appear to be minor. They have shown a state of care on the part of the Government in relation to people's rights and opportunities to protest to the courts. The legislation has been amended to include promoters. I think it is highly desirable that collections be made from them. Provision has been made for joint holders and people who may be jointly responsible for tax avoidance. I think that is eminently sensible. The important thing is that the Government has not conceded one inch anything to do with an 'innocence clause' because that would be a sell-out of this legislation. It would be better that no legislation came before us. How are we to stand by and prove what is in a crooked evader's mind? We will have to prove also what is in the mind of a person who gained benefit by tax evasion ten years ago. It would be the easiest thing in the world for a tax evader to say: 'I was advised by my lawyer that it was a good investment. I did not know that there was anything wrong. I am innocent'. He will then hope to escape. </PARA>

<PARA> The attitude of the Federal Government appears to be that the vendor shareholders must have known what was going on, and accordingly were parties to the fraud or at least knowing recipients of the proceeds from fraudulent conduct . </PARA>
<PARA>It does not follow from any of those things that they must have known. They knew that they were gaining a benefit. They knew that they were getting something worth much more than they were entitled to get. If they knew what they were doing in their businesses-the dictum of caveat emptor-they ought to have known about their dealings in the community. It is not a matter of their necessarily knowing of the fraud. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Alternatively they say that the vendor shareholders are in just the same position as innocent purchasers of stolen property. </PARA>
<PARA>I think I agree with that generally. Those who innocently buy watches and so forth may find they have the same problem. The article further stated:</PARA>
<PARA>But the analogy is false: It has always been good law that such purchasers cannot obtain good title but never that vendor shareholders were liable for the company's tax. </PARA>
<PARA>That is just a little legal fiddle. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It now seems inevitable that the legislation will be introduced. If this occurs then while the Law Council maintains its opposition to the legislation a minimum requirement must be to protect those persons who did not know that the taxation liability of the company would remain. There are many vendor shareholders who believed in one way or another that the entrepreneur would arrange for the liability to be expunged by lawful means. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps they did believe that. Perhaps they hoped that they would get away with it, but they will not get away with it because the taxpayers of Australia will not allow it. The article concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>There is every justification for providing that lack of knowledge in the taxpayer be a defence to the right to recover. This is not criminal legislation and there is no reason why the onus should not be cast upon the taxpayer to establish lack of knowledge. The Law Council will be doing everything in its power to bring this situation about. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that it fails entirely in its aim. I think this is an example of where, unfortunately, the logic of the Law Council has entirely failed. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition to the legislation has come from odd sources. It has come also from Western Australia. I read with pleasure the other day what my friend, the honourable and very honest Senator Andrew Thomas from Western Australia, had to say about the extent to which the opposition to this legislation, which has been promoted so much in that State, had permeated the Liberal Party. I notice that he withdrew the specific allegations and there is a somewhat garbled account as to when or where certain moneys were collected. Nonetheless, it is very clear that in Western Australia there has been much too much desire to improve the positions of and help the people who have made money quickly. It is time the Western Australian Liberals and other Liberals in this country who hold the same view got down to putting the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party back into the hands of the people who support the pay-as-you-earn taxpayer, the ordinary decent citizen of Australia. I believe this legislation is a great fight towards improving tax reform. There are a lot of other things to be done, but I commend the Government for the courage with which it has stood by its convictions in this area. I wish it every success with this legislation and with its vigorous enforcement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have listened to the debate I have come to the conclusion that virtually all that needs to be said has been said both in the Senate and in the other place. In fact, it made me think of the story that was told to me recently by somebody who has been here quite a long time. Shortly after being elected he made what he thought was a very good speech and puffed his chest out. One of the old timers pulled him aside and said: 'Young man, that was a very good speech. I made exactly the same points 15 years ago.' Although I am not making the same points 15 years after they were made previously, there are some I want to make very briefly with regard to the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill 1982 and the other Bills in the package. Their purpose is to enable the Government to collect tax which was not recoverable from companies because of certain manoeuvers and the disposal of the records of the companies- that is, they were dumped, as it were, at the bottom-of-the-harbour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have to make my position clear because I will support the second readings of these Bills but with very grave misgivings. We have all had a considerable amount of time to give this matter a lot of thought. We have heard from others of the length of time that these avoidance schemes have been going on and of the delays both within the Crown Solicitor's Office and also within the ranks of governments over the last few years. Senator Jessop yesterday, in what I think was a very thoughtful speech, detailed those delays very well. I refer interested people to his speech. In fact, I think it would be of advantage to many people to read the speeches made both here and in the other place because the debate has been thoughtful and many points of view have been put. I remind the Senate that in June 1978 I voted against the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill. It related to the Curran schemes and, I believe, the provisions were retrospective. Likewise, aspects of these Bills are retrospective. Certainly, the implications of being able to collect tax for the previous 10 years go along way. I operate a business and have done so for many years. I have kept my records for a long time. But those people who may have quite legitimately disposed of some of their records would have a lot of trouble in objecting to some of the assessments that might be handed out by the Australian Taxation Office. Certain persons did avoid payment of tax by using very artificial schemes. Out of fairness, in this case they should be made to repay those amounts. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday, Senator Grimes reminded the Senate that if a pensioner is overpaid for one reason or another, out of his very meagre income he has to repay that amount. The same principle in reverse should apply here. Justice and equity must apply equally to all taxpayers. In this case I take the broad view, that is, that justice to most taxpayers will be done by supporting this legislation. Justice to the average taxpayer will be better served by supporting this legislation with certain modifications. I believe that if such modifications can be made the legislation should be supported. One such modification is that we must ensure that those innocent of contriving benefits from these schemes will not be labelled. The fact that recoupment will be enforced only if the assessed amount exceeds $100 is not sufficient argument to my mind. I believe that the innocent must be protected. Senator Withers put it well in a letter to me recently in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> We can't have decent, honest, respectable citizens being swept up and labelled with frauds, cheats, and intentional evaders by dragnet legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>That comment puts very well my reasons for feeling that the innocence provision should be included. We have heard how people can be innocent. Therefore, I will support the insertion of that clause. I still believe tax retrospectivity should be made illegal. Of course, that does not apply when somebody is given a benefit . If we seek to recoup that benefit, it does not matter how much later we get around to doing it, although it should be done quickly, of course. But when legislation imposes a penalty, retrospectivity is a very bad thing. The Constitution should be altered so that retrospectivity is made illegal as it is in the United States of America and France. I believe such a constitutional amendment would be understood by the people of Australia and would, I am sure, be passed. </PARA>
<PARA> Had the Government acted with sensible speed these Bills would not be necessary . The Government should realise that although I support these particular Bills I do so only after much anguish. For instance, if we establish a true precedent of retrospectivity we could open the door for retrospective income taxes and capital gains taxes. The Australian Labour Party has already said that these Bills do not go far enough. Earlier today Senator Withers said that we have made its bad policies respectable. He may not have used quite those words but that was certainly the import of what he said. </PARA>

I hope if cases such as ones that these Bills are meant to correct ever come to the notice of government or government departments, that we will not see the bureaucratic bungling that everybody knows has gone on. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) is responsible, if his Department does not act and does not inform him of what is going on. I hope in future the Government will act quickly and clearly. If it does not, I must say that it will not be able to count on my support for any retrospectivity. It is against the party platform and only in balance am I able to support these Bills. I do not believe anyone can feel safe if they are not able to plan their affairs in the certain knowledge that the rules of the game will not be altered retrospectively.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Senate is debating the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill 1982. The Opposition has moved an amendment to the motion for the second reading of that Bill. First of all I wish to state quite plainly that as I understand it I am the last of the Mohicans-the last in a long line of speakers on this Bill. I hope that I can do justice to the debate. I will do so, if that is possible, within a period of five or 10 minutes. As Senator Townley said, the debate has ranged over almost all of the principles and issues that one could imagine when addressing one's mind to a subject of this character. I say at the outset that I regard the debate as being on a very high level. I congratulate those honourable senators who have put so much time into analysing this very important subject and into giving the Senate and, I believe, the public, the benefit of that reflection in such well chosen words in most cases. This Bill would not have been necessary had the Government taken action when it was so urged as far back as 1976 and 1977. From a reading of the documentation that has been tabled in the Senate thus far, it is clear, however, that one person at least comes out without egg on his face. That person is the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I say that reluctantly, but I have had a look at the documents. I must say publicly that the Prime Minister did urge the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to take urgent action about these schemes once the matter had been drawn to his attention. The Treasurer had the responsibility of taking action. There were significant delays in the Attorney-General's Department which are still as yet unexplained. The Opposition's amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill reads as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) condemns the abject failure of the Treasurer and the Government, knowing of the existence of straw company tax evasion schemes since at least 1978, to respond quickly and effectively to the massive tax evasion occurring through the use of such schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>Up to that point the amendment is unexceptionable. But paragraphs (b), (c) and ( d) of the amendment go well beyond the reasonable confines of the debate at this time. I would have thought that many honourable senators on the Government side who are opposing these Bills would support the first part of the Opposition's amendment; that is, paragraph (a). One of the arguments that has been advanced by Government speakers in opposing this Bill is that there is already in place legislation which should have been acted upon and pursued by the Government. As such, I believe that half a loaf is better than none. The Opposition may well consider, whilst I am concluding my remarks to the Senate on this matter, dropping paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of its amendment and leaving paragraph (a) intact. That would, of course, challenge those who have spoken in similar terms to vote for that proposition. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I could amend it. I might try that, if that is an indication of the Opposition's view. The debate, as I see it thus far, has boiled down to two principles; that is, certainty before the law and fair shares . Those who advanced the principle of certainty before the law have suggested that an act which was legal some years ago should not now be clothed with illegality. Let us leave that aspect aside for one moment and address ourselves to the aspect of fair shares. I suggest that there is not one senator or, indeed , one member of parliament, and very few citizens of this country, who would defend the systematic bleeding of taxation revenue between 1972 and 1980 by the promoters of the schemes that have been described during this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly, we are all agreed on the principle of fair shares, but equally we have been confronted as a parliament and as a nation by the challenge of those promoters and those who have benefited from those schemes. The question is how to reverse that challenge and to ensure that the principle of fair shares is now accepted and implemented. How can we arrange things so that the ordinary pay-as- you-earn taxpayer does not have to continue to shoulder the burden of tax forgone by the existence of these artificial tax avoidance schemes? Herein lies a matter of real concern. The opponents of the legislation have stated clearly that the end does not justify the means. They have asserted that the Taxation ( Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill and its associated Bills are retrospective legislation and that at no stage should one clothe with illegality something that was previously legal. Let us analyse that for a moment. Can we elevate, if I may use that word, these schemes to that level? I believe we cannot. I suggest that one cannot say that those schemes were legal at the time. The best that one can say about them is that they may have had doubtful legality. The Brinsden opinion and other opinions testify to that fact. </PARA>

I agree with the principle of certainty before the law and I am concerned with any suggestion that one should vote for retrospectivity where laws are certain. But what is retrospective about this legislation that is before us? The companies that are now at the bottom of the harbour were due to be assessed for company tax at $46 in every $100. That taxation was due to the Commonwealth Treasury at that time and is still due. So in that sense there is no retrospectivity in this legislation. It was an entitlement for the companies to pay that tax at that time. They still owe it; so there is no retrospectivity there. There is no suggestion that there is any attempt now to clothe the actions of the promoters, disastrous though their consequences for the internal revenue were, with criminal illegality, so there is no retrospectivity in that aspect.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a new tax, and the new tax is applied to whom? The new tax is applied to persons who are identified as having received a taxation benefit by virtue of their entry into an artificial scheme to avoid taxation. Under those circumstances, there is an argument that even that is not a retrospective tax. It is a new tax applied to persons who have derived a benefit . Those vendor-shareholders undeniably obtained a benefit by virtue of the fact that the companies in which they were shareholders were sold for a price which was unrealistically generous given the circumstances of the companies. It was unrealistically generous by reason of the fact that the company tax of $46 in every $100 of their profits was not paid to the Commissioner of Taxation and still is not paid. Those who have picked up the tab have been by and large the pay-as-you-earn taxpayers throughout the Commonwealth. The people who have derived the benefit, that is to say, the promoters and the vendor-shareholders, have, in some cases, had the money for perhaps eight years. It is not suggested in this legislation that they now pay the equivalent of that money to the Australian Taxation Office. This legislation, were it genuinely retrospective legislation, would say, 'That was the amount you owed. Multiply that by what inflation has run at and this is the amount that you pay now'. No, the legislation is not doing that. It is simply imposing a tax to the money value on persons identified by reason of their benefiting from those schemes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I may not have convinced Senator Martyr, but I have convinced myself that this legislation does not clothe with illegality an act which was previously legal. Undoubtedly it imposes a tax on persons who previously would not have been eligible to pay it; so it is truly a new tax. I suggest that we come back to the question of fair shares. Having indicated that I agree with the principle of certainty before the law and that that principle is not in any way offended as I see it by this legislation, let us come to the question of fair shares. Should the ordinary taxpayer continue to pick up the tab, firstly, for those who have promoted the artificial tax avoidance schemes, and secondly, for those who have derived benefits therefrom? My suggestion is that they should not , and the principle of fair shares suggests that once those persons have been identified they should be asked now, by reason of this new tax, to pay at least some-not all of it but some-of their fair share in shouldering the burdens of this community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I reiterate that I would very strongly oppose retrospective legislation in this Parliament. I suggest that the high principles that have been advanced do not apply to the activities that have been engaged in by the promotors of the schemes and therefore I consider that in no way is this legislation offensive to the principles of certainty before the law and of fair shares.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second reading debate on the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill and associated Bills has been extensive, in terms both of the time it has occupied and the matters that have been raised by honourable senators. It is interesting that the legislation has had support from members of the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Australian Labor Party and from Senator Harradine. I thank all those honourable senators who have spoken for the spirit in which they have contributed to the debate. Perhaps because we have had so many speakers I should thank also those honourable senators who have not spoken. There are those like my colleague Senator Lewis, for instance, who would have spoken in support of the Bill. But the extensive list of Government speakers made Senator Lewis use his discretion not to speak on this occasion. I think as a result of what has been put by honourable senators we are better able to vote on this projected legislation tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I could not hope, in this speech at the end of the second reading debate, to respond in detail to all the comments that have been made but I trust that the Senate will accept a response which picks up the main threads of what the various speakers have put, where they were making separate points. The very big issue of principle which has been aired is whether it is appropriate that we should now be legislating to cover events which occurred during a period now past, from 1972 to 1980. The Government remains of the view that the legislation is an appropriate response to the situation and is not subject to valid objection on the score of retrospectivity. A great deal has been said about that by a number of speakers. The legislation addresses circumstances in which companies have been so stripped of funds that they are unable to pay very large amounts of tax which were and still are legally payable. An element of illegality was, on the part of at least some of those involved in the overall arrangements, present in each one of these cases. Companies were denuded of funds in a way that quite disregarded the claims of the revenue, and beyond it the general public, to the income tax which the companies had come under an obligation to pay. But in saying that I want to nail another notion that I have heard expressed, that is that the legislation somehow makes illegal what was legal at the time. It does nothing of the sort. Having given those directly concerned the opportunity to contest the claim by the Commissioner of Taxation, what the legislation does is to say that the amount of company tax that remains unpaid is to be recouped from those groups, vendors and promoters who benefited from its non-payment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was speaking on the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill. I was responding to some of the claims that were made during the second reading debate on the Bill. I continue by saying that the call for recoupment puts no additional taint or brand on those concerned. When that is recognised-as I hope it will be-it becomes clearer that the legislation is a justifiable exercise of the power that the Parliament unquestionably enjoys. In exercising our responsibility to legislate for a fair and equitable tax system we must, in the view of the Government, on this occasion act in a way that is formally retrospective but in a way that simply recoups benefits flowing from the evasion of legally payable tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of innocence of vendor- shareholders will come up again during the Committee stage of the Bill. Let me say at this point that when the legislation is not making illegal anything that was legal but is just affecting recoupment of unpaid tax any state of innocence on the part of vendors is not to the point. I say that with all due respect to those of my colleagues who think otherwise. Let me add that, while I differ from them on this matter, I do acknowledge that they conscientiously hold a different view and it is quite wrong for them to be classed, as some have done, as friends of the vendors and evaders of tax. I also suggest that it is not helpful to the resolution of the question that is now before us to seek, as some honourable senators have, to make points about prosecutions not having been launched in the past against those who were active in the promotion of pre-tax profit stripping schemes. That has already been the subject of extensive debate in the Parliament. It is just a matter of repetition to go over that ground again. What is important is the action that is being taken at present. </PARA>
<PARA> As a government we have acted to establish in office a special prosecutor to pursue matters under the criminal law. The work of the Special Prosecutor is well under way. The question of criminal actions is one for the Special Prosecutor. It was legislation of this Government, introduced in 1980-the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act-that dealt a mortal blow to pre-tax profit stripping schemes. I have heard it said again in this debate that that legislation was too long in coming. Those who say that, however, fail to take into account the necessity there was of ensuring that attainment of a desirable objective was affected with fairness to those who might have been caught up in it. In the present situation the Government is attacked by Opposition senators for having, in the course of producing legislation that meets reasonable points of criticism and attains proper standards of fairness, varied the legislation in one way or another. Sub-clause (12) of clause 3 is a particular example of that. The sub- clause does not represent the significant loophole in the legislation that those honourable senators have made it out to be. Again, I will expand on that at the Committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I use this opportunity to say something about the revenue estimates. The Australian Taxation Office has now identified some 4,900 companies that were, in the period concerned, stripped of pre-tax profits. The primary tax evaded in these cases totalled some $500m. The undistributed profits tax amounted to some $120m. The Commissioner of Taxation has estimated that about 10 per cent, or $ 60m, of this will be uncollectable. On top of that the Commissioner estimates that about $40m will be excluded from recoupment by sub-clause (12) of clause 3, so that total recovery under the legislation is now put at a figure of about $ 520m. It is also estimated that $100m of this amount will be collected in 1982- 83. Changes in the original proposal, such as the decision to give vendors a chance to contest the basic assessment of company tax, have contributed to the fall-off in current year collections. Some people see the granting to vendors of this facility of payment by instalments as another element of delay. In some situations that would be true, but in others again the facility is expected to advance the recovery process. </PARA>
<PARA> I come now to further aspects of the Opposition's proposed amendment to the second reading of the Bill, which I trust the Senate will reject. No one who has followed this matter with any care could support the notion that the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) and the Government have, as suggested, failed to respond quickly and effectively. It is all very well to suggest otherwise with the benefit of today' s knowledge and insights but the information then available, even in 1980, presented nothing like the picture available today. As has been said before, the Government has acted with resolution consistent with the need to exercise care in framing legislation such as that of 1980, which I remind the Senate was described by the Opposition as being of an unprecedented nature. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition amendment suggests that the Bill is inadequate on two counts- that it does not recoup personal income tax lost in the course of pre-tax profit strips and that it does not extend to sales tax. I suggest that the sales tax point can be dealt with quite shortly. Fundamentally, there is not, as in the case of income tax, the same clear loss of revenue. Rather, the Commissioner of Taxation believes that he has substantial prospects of upholding sales tax assessments against companies that are in a position to pay the tax. The Opposition contention about the recovery of personal income tax is useful for the gap that it exposes between the thinking of the Opposition and the Government. We say that the proper scope of legislation such as this is the recoupment of tax that has always been legally payable. The Opposition puts, but the Government does not accept, that the tax that has simply been avoided should be the subject of these retrospective tax measures. It is no indication of lack of concern to observe that this category of avoidance is no worse than others in respect of which legislation has been made purely prospective in application. I remind the Senate that it was this Government that, through new Part IVA, legislated to stop tax avoidance through dividend stripping and similar schemes. That legislation has operated since 27 May 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> This brief summary concludes my remarks at this stage. I urge the Senate to reject the Opposition's amendment to the motion for the second reading and to pass the Bill as it stands. I make similar comments in regard to Senator Harradine's amendment to the Opposition's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, as you are finally responsible for both the Hansard and the Journals of the Senate, I crave your indulgence to ask you a question. Normally in Hansard and the Journals pairs are noted after any division. One would imagine that because the Government and the Opposition voted together no pairs would be shown. If no pairs are shown it could be thought later in historical terms that senators whose names are not shown in the division list abstained from voting. I make the point on behalf of Senator Bonner and Senator Martin that if they had been here they also would have voted no. They are not here to ask for the division; they cannot ask for their names to be recorded in it. I suggest to you, Mr President, if pairs are to be shown, that Senator Bonner and Senator Martin be shown as being paired with those who voted no. I could not care less about what they do on the other side, but the problem that arises in historical terms is that people who are not shown in the division list could be thought not to have voted at all.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall not move yet the amendment to sub-clause (12) which has already been circulated. The first question I want to ask relates to sub-clause (2) of clause 3 which incidentally was not in the original legislation introduced into the House of Representatives on 23 September. I understand that the effect of that clause is to exclude from liability persons who were acting as directors in a capacity incidental to their professional capacity, presumably as accountants or lawyers. My question is, firstly, whether that is broadly correct and, secondly, I seek the Government's reason for the addition of that sub-clause to the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill as it was originally presented on 23 September.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sub- clause (2) makes it clear that a person will not be taken to be a director of a company merely because the directors act on advice given by that person in a professional or business capacity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, I did not clearly hear the first dozen or so words of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle). It is not perfectly clear to me. Only a few days ago a Queen's Counsel of my acquaintance described certain clauses of this Bill as being written in a mixture of Swahili and Afghan as if the intention were to prevent people from understanding it. I will confess that I often have difficulty understanding legislation but in this case even professionals have difficulty. It is still not clear to me. I thought my question was simple enough. Does this sub-clause exclude from liability people who exercise the powers of directors but in a capacity which is incidental-when they are acting as directors-to their professional advice or service such as an accountant or lawyer?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The sub- clauses referred to are inserted in the Bill for the reasons defined in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. If Senator Walsh looks at the memorandum he will see the definitions of the clauses that seem to worry him. Sub-clause (6) applies in relation to a purchase of shares and mirrors the application of the sub-clause in relation to a sale of shares. That is the reason it is included in the Bill. It seems to me that the inclusion of that sub-clause is perfectly reasonable. The fact that it was not in the original Act and that it may have been since introduced reflects the fact that the sub-clauses were put in as part of the promoter provisions. Sub-section (6) matches sub-section (5) and sub- section (8) matches sub-section (4). The reason they have been included is because of the promoter provisions included in the revised Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Pages 6 and 7, clause 3, sub-clause (12), leave out the sub-clause. </PARA>
<PARA>Sub-clause (12) was not contained in the legislation when it was introduced on 23 September-the first version of the Bill. As I stated last week, this is the Horgan amendment. I will leave aside the question of what it is designed to do. Its effect will be to allow Denis Horgan-the former finance committee vice- chairman of the Western Australian Liberal Party-to keep the several million dollars of tax which was not paid by companies of which he was a major shareholder. The effect will be to allow that powerful, influential Liberal to keep several million dollars which were designated by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) a couple of months ago as having been stolen. If this sub-clause remains in the Bill the situation is that if a person has a company and puts it into a tax avoidance scheme, which subsequently fails, and that person retains the company after the scheme fails that person will have to pay the tax. If he owns a company with current year profits, puts it into a tax avoidance scheme, sells it to a promoter such as Brian Maher, who then sells the company to a painter or docker or some other sham director and the scheme then fails, nobody pays the tax. If a person with a company with current year profits sells it to a dealer like Brian Maher, who then puts it through a tax avoidance scheme, sells it to a painter or docker or some sham director and the tax avoidance scheme then fails, nobody pays. That is the effect of this clause. If I heard the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) correctly when she was replying to the second reading debate, the current estimate of the cost to revenue of the insertion of this clause is $100m. </PARA>
<PARA> I say this is the Horgan amendment because the principal Horgan company, Treamog Ltd, which was covered to some extent in the McCabe-Lafranchi report, was put into such a tax avoidance scheme. The transcript of evidence given to the McCabe-Lafranchi inquiry by Lee Hurley, an associate of Maher's, on page 6949 shows quite clearly that Treamog was put into a tax avoidance scheme after it was acquired by Maher. It having been previously stated that the balance date for the company was 31 December 1976, and it had been purchased on 10 December 1976, Hurley was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> What steps were then taken by Commercial Securities Limited in relation to solving the tax problems of the company?</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate there that the tax problems referred to were a current year profit of something over $3.7m. That somehow or other had to be eliminated before the balance date of 31 December. Hurley replied:</PARA>
<PARA> A share trading partnership called Trevista Trading was formed shortly after acquisition by Commercial Securities and 36A (2) type losses were created, sufficient to wipe out any taxable income in the accounts of the company. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know, and the secrecy provisions of the Taxation Act probably preclude me from finding out or the Senate being told, whether that specific share trading avoidance arrangement was disallowed by the Commissioner of Taxation. Whether it has been disallowed at this stage or not, we do know that a number of schemes which had previously been successful, which might be loosely described as Curran-type schemes, are being contested in the courts by the Commissioner, and with some success. So whether that particular scheme has failed or not, there is a very real possibility it will fail at some time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> If clause 3 (12) had not been inserted in this Bill the current year tax liability of about $1.7m, from a current year profit, according to the figures disclosed in the McCabe-Lafranchi report, of $3.7m, would have had to be paid by the shareholders. Directly and indirectly Denis Horgan owned about 60 per cent of the shares in that company and therefore he personally will, because of the insertion of this clause, be allowed to retain in round figures one million stolen dollars, as the Prime Minister called them. There is no clearer evidence of the corruptibility of this Government than the fact that this clause has been inserted. All the strong rhetoric about cracking down on tax evaders, of making these people who have stolen money pay it back, falls to the ground because this clause has been inserted. The entire rationale for the existence of this legislation disappears because of the insertion of this and two or three other clauses. From the outset the Government has asserted that because this legislation deals only with acts which were illegal and fraudulent at the time they were committed, therefore all the transactions were void. </PARA>
<PARA> The rationale for the introduction of this legislation is that it will simplify and speed up the collection of tax which could have been collected under the old laws because the actions were fraudulent and illegal. Because of the insertion of this clause it is virtually guaranteed that most, if not all, of the companies affected by the legislation, if there is a substantial tax liability, will litigate their liability. The insertion of this clause has guaranteed that there will be very considerable litigation before the money can be recovered. The insertion of a couple of other clauses to which we will come later, such as those relating to the time within which payment is required and the reduction in the penalty for late payment, will obviously delay the collection of whatever timely amount of money is left, but this clause more than anything else undermines the Government's own rationale for the Bill because it will take most of the substantial cases into the courts. The avoidance of such litigation was said by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in his statement of 25 July to be the major reason for the introduction of this legislation. Above all, the insertion of this clause shows the corruptibility of this Government. If one is a powerful figure in the Liberal Party and is a heavy enough contributor to its funds one can have clauses written into government legislation to exclude one from liability to repay what the Prime Minister said was stolen money. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted with considerable admiration Senator Thomas's initial statement last week that the campaign undertaken by the Liberal Party of Western Australia against any sort of liability for anyone was funded by tax evaders. With something less than admiration I noted his subsequent retraction when people in the Liberal Party in Perth stood over him. I noted with some amusement the denial of Mr W. W. Mitchell, the chief organiser of the campaign against making anybody pay any money back. The West Australian of 17 November reported:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Mitchell denied that funds were provided by tax evaders. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Mitchell is quoted directly as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> I raised funds in the same way that I have raised funds for the Liberal Party and for other causes- . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that that was confirmation of Senator Thomas's original charge rather than a denial of it. I hope that there will be some attempt, especially by the non-Labor Opposition senators, to come to grips with the full implications of this clause-not only its cost to revenue but also its effect on the logic and the credibility of the Government's tax policy, as well as the injustice of allowing a particular class of influential vendor-shareholders to escape entirely from their liability because the agents with whom they dealt, in this instance at least, went through the process of a tax avoidance scheme instead of just stripping the money and passing it straight on to a painter and docker. </PARA>
<PARA> This clause does partially what some Government members want to do entirely- insert a blanket innocence clause which, of course, would make sure that nobody had to pay the money back. This clause exempts only a special class of people, one of whom is Denis Horgan, the chairman of the finance committee of the Western Australian Liberal Party, because the major company, Treamog, through which he evaded almost half of the total tax that he is shown to have evaded, was treated in this way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make some brief observations related primarily to the comments made by Senator Walsh. One almost has a sense of overwhelming, pathetic pity for the obsession that Senator Walsh has for Mr Horgan. He concluded his remarks by saying that Mr Horgan was the finance chairman of the Western Australian Liberal Party. I will not go through his statements, one by one, ticking and crossing the allegations as to their truth or otherwise because, frankly, he would get nought out of 10 for his endeavours. The facts are, of course, that Mr Horgan is not chairman. That is well known. Senator Walsh has previously acknowledged that. He has acknowledged that in his comments on a number of occasions. It is interesting to note that we do not hear an overwhelming obsession with Mr Bercove who has been documented by Mr Costigan, as Mr Horgan was not, for his activities, notwithstanding the fact that he was a member of the Mt Lawley branch of the Australian Labor Party for a number of years. He signed advertisements, along with a number of ALP lawyers, for the ALP and we hear not a squeak from Senator Walsh about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems, from Senator Walsh's statements, that everybody on this side of the chamber has this overwhelming influence. Mr Horgan, to the best of my knowledge, is not a member of a branch of the Liberal Party. I cannot confirm that but I can certainly confirm that he is not powerful, influential or able to exert influence or pressure at a branch level, let alone at a divisional level, an executive level and a State level, and certainly not at a government level. It is absolutely obscene, absurd and obnoxious to hear this diatribe of drivel that comes out of Senator Walsh's mouth every time he gets to his feet.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh then went on to make some comments about Senator Thomas's statement. He found it very, very distasteful that Senator Thomas made his first unfortunate, inaccurate and imprecise observations and then, recognising the faults and inaccuracies of his comments, withdrew them in an unqualified way. Of course, the truth strikes you in a very unpleasent fashion. </PARA>

I am quite sure, if this were true, that Senator Thomas would stand up and say so. It is quite untrue. The remark is not justified.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether Senator Evans, the so-called self-confessed champion of civil rights, can afford to interject too much during debate on this legislation, which proposes to introduce retrospectivity. Senator Evans, a person who to my knowledge has championed civil rights for all of his adult life and has stood out against infringements of civil liberties, has just lent his name and his vote to legislation which retrospectively will have an impact on people. In other words, Senator Evans-I would not have singled him out had he not chosen to interject during my remarks-has stated by his vote in this chamber today that he is prepared to declare illegal today something that was a legal one, two or ten years ago. That is a rather peculiar way of protecting civil liberties. I leave it at that and make no further comment on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This clause, as it stands, rams home the difficulties of this kind of legislation of which Senator Withers warned us today in a first class speech. This clause will be an absolute nightmare to administer. In that sense I am attracted to the Australian Labor Party's amendment to delete it. What, in effect, would acceptance of the Labor amendment do? It would make the application of this legislation harsher. Therefore, as I am opposed to the legislation because of its retrospective element, I find great difficulty in supporting an amendment that would make retrospectivity have a harsher application than it now has. I am speaking rather tentatively because the legislation, particularly this clause and the amendment, is extraordinarily complex. I hope the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) and her advisers will correct me if I am wrong in my understanding. As I understand it, it is a saving clause which was inserted, as Senator Walsh correctly stated, in the second draft of the Bill. I do not know whether it was inserted because of the activities of Mr Horgan. I can see Senator Walsh's point that a person who gained through villainy could well benefit from this clause. I do not disbelieve his figure of $100m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Walsh. But I also read into the clause a protection for those kinds of people regarding whom I will move an amendment at the end of the consideration of clause 6; namely, the innocent, particularly those who can prove hardship. As I understand this clause, it excludes from liability for the recoupment of tax those cases where a tax avoidance scheme then assumed to be legal-mainly the Curran scheme-was used prior to sending the company to the bottom of the harbour. This clause would seem reasonable at first glance but it applies also to schemes which are struck down by the court. This leaves us with a situation in which the Commissioner of Taxation cannot collect because the company has been sent to the bottom of the harbour, even if he wins a judgment in court. In effect, the clause says that people should escape liability if they thought a scheme was legal as against a situation in which the scheme was, in fact, legal. I simply state that to prove what Senator Withers said this afternoon. What sort of nightmare for the Commissioner will this be to interpret? I shall just read the mind-boggling, mind-bending paragraph (b) of clause 3 (12). It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> at the time when the relevant scheme was entered into, it would have been reasonable to expect that the relevant scheme would secure the result referred to in paragraph (a);</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that is clear to everybody who heard me read it out. One could well ask: In whose mind is it reasonable to expect this-in the mind of the person selling or the person advising? Who can we imagine can assume the legality of a scheme? I find the whole concept of the legislation repulsive. Senator Withers suggested this afternoon that when we do something crazy-as this legislation is- we have to do equally crazy things to get ourselves out of the holes we dig in the original crazy legislation. I am very sympathetic with the thrust of the amendment which the Australian Labor Party has moved. But because I am opposed to the retrospective element in the legislation and because this clause makes the retrospective bite in the legislation harsher, unless I can be enlightened by the Minister that I am wrong in what I am saying I will be obliged to vote against the Labor Party's amendment. </PARA>

In response to a specific question on that issue I said that I did not know. I still do not know. I have no idea where the money came from. It may have come from tax evaders or it may have come from supporters of the Australian Labor Party. Who is to know? I said that the Liberal Party had nothing to do with the raising of the funds nor with the management of the campaign. The mistake I made on Tuesday was to say that those members of the State Council of the Western Australian Liberal Party who took part in the debate when the State branch of the party was persuaded not to support this legislation were less than honest in not declaring an interest.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am working on it, Senator. The effect of clause 3 (12) which we are debating in the context of Senator Walsh's amendment to delete it is this: If, instead of just stripping and dumping a company after its purchase, the purchasers go through the motions first, before they dump the company, of participating in some elaborate tax avoidance scheme-usually it was a Curran scheme-even if that scheme subsequently fails so that the tax in issue remains clearly payable the vendors will not under these circumstances be held liable. That is what clause 3 (12) is all about. The requirement in the Bill is that the vendors must reasonably believe in the efficacy of the intended avoidance scheme which is to be put in operation by the post-sale purchasers but, of course, given the way in which the High Court was behaving through the 1970s under the leadership-if I can dignify it with that expression-of Sir Garfield Barwick one would have had to believe in fairies not to believe in the efficacy of elaborate , complicated, artificial, blatant and contrived tax avoidance schemes of the kind that were being put in operation by the post-sale purchases in these cases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The further requirement is that the avoidance arrangement had to be self- contained and not part of some larger, ultimate scheme of defrauding the revenue . But how on earth that criterion specified in the legislation is to be ever applied, given the kinds of claims that vendors will be making about their belief in the efficacy of these schemes and their non-relationship to other more sordid arrangements, beggars the imagination. The result of these criteria will be, as Senator Walsh so clearly pointed out, endless litigation. The lever is created, the crutch by which just about every single vendor will be able to establish with at least some prima facie claim of plausibility his coming within the scope of this legislation. The result of this clause is that even if some artificial avoidance scheme is being put in operation by a post-sale purchaser and even if that artificial avoidance scheme is being pursued with vigour by the Commissioner of Taxation, ultimately resulting in the scheme being struck down as illegal, unconscionable and intolerable, the company in question is them ultimately stripped of whatever is left in it and dumped so that no liability which might be held to exist by the courts of the board of review following the striking down of that artificial avoidance scheme is ever liable to be acted upon, in those circumstances-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In no circumstances would I ever contemplate reading a speech, however complex, Senator Withers, though I suppose it may be necessary to do so when one fills it up with clerihews and limericks. Even if those conditions are satisfied, namely, an avoidance scheme being struck down and the company ultimately being dumped so that no liability is ever able in practice to be attached to that company so stripped, in those circumstances as a result of clause 3 (12) the vendors are not able to be held liable, even those vendors who benefited in such a spectacular financial way from their own participation in these arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How much is to be lost to revenue as a result of clause 3 (12)? That must remain a matter for speculation in the absence of detailed figures being provided by the Government. But it is my understanding that of the 4,600 companies that were originally identified as participating in the bottom-of-the- harbour schemes-I notice from what the Minister said tonight that that figure has now gone up to 4,900-700 at least were involved in post-sale avoidance arrangements of a Curran or some other kind and thus come potentially within the scope of section 3 (12). The proportion of dollars lost as a result of these manoeuvres is, in fact, as I understand it, considerably higher than 700 out of 4,600 because the big companies of which Senator Walsh has instanced Treamog Ltd were almost invariably filtered or fed through this kind of mechanism after the sale before being simply crudely stripped and dumped in the time honoured bottom -of-the-harbour fashion. The result seems likely to be a very massive loss from the $600m-odd of revenue that was originally anticipated as being returned from the operation of this legislation. It is impossible to guess precisely how much will be left after the operation of clause 3(12) but it is clear that it will be very much less than $600m. </PARA>
<PARA> What justification has been advanced for clause 3 (12) in the mouth of the Government? It has been acknowledged, as the Government has to acknowledge, that the logical result of clause 3 (12) is that a company may end up with tax liability assessed by the courts or the board of review which is unable in practice to be recouped. It is further acknowledged by the Government that that will occur in the context of a chain of transactions in which the company in question is ultimately stripped and dumped in the sense of being put in the bottom of the harbour or in some other way reduced to a shadow of its former self and unable to be proceeded against in practical ways by the Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in defence of clause 3 (12), says what is involved here are avoidance arrangements, not evasion arrangements. We do not have the fradulent element involved in these transactions which is such to justify retrospective recoupment legislation. It is quite extraordinary that the Government should seize upon this particular distinction in this context, that is in the context of compamies being sold to Father Christmases who come along and offer massive financial returns, far more than could be expected if the vendors in question were to be paying the taxes normally falling due and accruing on those companies . An extraordinary assertion is being made, and is made no less extraordinary when one considers the way in which, up until just a few weeks ago, the Government was resolutely refusing to acknowledge a relevant distinction morally between tax avoidance on the one hand and tax evasion on the other. I refer, for example, to the comments of the Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, earlier this year when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . those high priced lawyers and accountants who have devised and promoted tax avoidance schemes do more damage to the basis of this society than a thousand Gallaghers in this world or a thousand Builders' Labourers Federations.</PARA>
<PARA>Then he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if we have to legislate for every wrongful act . . . then we will be so subsumed in legislation . . . every judge in the land would have to work overtime. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, what he have to do is attack tax avoidance in exactly the same way and with exactly the same dedication and vigour as we tackle tax evasion. Again, in May 1981, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no real difference between the person who finds an artificial loophole to slip out of tax and the person who falsely declares his income. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no real moral difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion. That, of course, is the nub of the issue so far as clause 3 (12) is concerned. Clause 3 (12) is being defended, as I have no doubt it stoutly will be by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle when she rises to her feet in a moment, on the basis that this involves avoidance, whereas the nub of the rest of this legislation involves evasion. There are some circumstances in which it is legitimate to draw that distinction. That is a relevant distinction when we are talking, for example, about the application of criminal penalties to tax cheating operations. It is appropriate that criminial penalties be applied in the case of tax evasion . It is not appropriate, in my view, that criminal penalties ever be applied, retrospectively or otherwise, in the context of tax avoidance, but that is not an appropriate distinction when avoidance and evasion are bound up in the very same series of transactions and that is exactly what is involved in these cases.</PARA>
<PARA> This legislation only begins to bite when the company in question is ultimately stripped of its assets in such a way as to become unable to meet the tax liability falling due as assessed by the Commissioner of Taxation. This legislation is only applicable, in other words, when there has, at the end of the chain of transactions, been some fraudulent stripping arrangement. But the fact that the avoidance arrangement occurred earlier on in the chain of those transactions does not, to my mind or to the mind of the Opposition, relevantly distinguish this sort of case from any of the others in which bottom-of-the- harbour vendors are involved. The reality is that by clause 3 (12) a gift-a very large gift indeed-is being given to government supporters. This is the pay-off for those within the Government ranks who have opposed this legislation. While keeping intact the specific appearance of toughness about this legislation, while keeping intact all the macho huff and puff and hairy chested sort of effect that this legislation is intended to have in the public mind as cracking down toughly on tax avoiders and tax evaders, this is really a craven capitulation to those who have been beating the system in a slightly more sophisticated way than their brethren. This is the pay-off to the Horgans. This is the pay-off to hundreds of other supporters of this particular Government who have been pressing the Government for action to protect them which would have embarrassed the Government to do more overtly than it has in this particular clause. Clause 3 (12) is a retreat of a very expensive kind so far as the Government is concerned, expensive in terms of revenue and expensive in terms of the principles which the Government has sacrificed in the process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many extravagant things have been said about clause 3 (12). But let me provide some information with regard to figures called for during the debate on this sub- clause. The Government is not able to accept the amendment that has been moved by the Opposition. We have heard during the debate that the sub-clause will lead to massive losses of revenue. I think I ought to put that into perspective and say that the Commissioner of Taxation has given an estimate of the amount of revenue attaching to it. He estimates that some $40m will be affected under this sub-clause. I am not suggesting that that is a trifling sum, but I think it puts the debate into some perspective. It certainly puts it back on to the basis of more accuracy than we have heard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition senators have spoken as if hundreds of companies will be affected by the sub-clause at some times and at other times they suggest that only one company will be affected by it. Hundreds of companies will not be involved. The Opposition's misunderstanding may flow from the fact that about 800 of the total 4,900 companies have lodged objections in support of tax avoidance claims rejected by the Commissioner. They have lodged objections, but they may or may not be successful in them. Again, that is the figure cited by the Commissioner. In some cases the tax avoidance schemes were entered into before the companies were sold. In other cases they were entered into after the sale of the companies . It is only in the post-sale scheme cases that clause 3 (12) may apply. I say ' may' because not every post-sale avoidance scheme will be within the scope of this sub-clause. Its scope is limited. </PARA>
<PARA> For clause 3 (12) to apply there must have been a post-sale scheme designed to avoid the company's accrued pre-sale tax liability but which, in the event, was found to be unsuccessful as an avoidance technique. In addition, the attempted avoidance scheme must have been one that, viewed objectively, it would have been reasonable to expect at the time would have succeeded in its avoidance purpose. Yet another test is that the avoidance scheme was not part of the stripping arrangement by which the company was rendered unable to pay its tax. Finally, the arrangement by which the company became unable to pay its tax must not have had a purpose of achieving that result. All of these tests must be satisfied if clause 3 (12) is to apply. We could perhaps put all that another way by saying that clause 3 (12) is there to exclude a case from the recoupment tax where a company was sold and the new owners then put it into an avoidance scheme. The scheme must have been one that reasonably would have been expected to succeed- that is, where there was an expectation that tax would not be payable by the company and accordingly the funds of the company were stripped from it, and there was no fraud in a situation of the kind that I have described. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Reasonably expected by an objective test. That is not a test based on the state of mind of the participants. It is the view of how a reasonable man or woman would see it. It is not, as has been put, something that would be what the vendors expected, but it is a reasonable test that would be made by reasonable people. The sub-clause has been described as one that would give relief to a particular individual. I suggest to the Committee that the sub-clause really gives no more than an expression of proper principle. Perhaps that is where we part company with the Opposition. We differ on the principle. Opposition senators have described the sub-clause as one to give relief to a particular individual who has been named again and again in this chamber. I would say that they are wrong in the way in which they have chosen to interpret this sub-clause, because it simply arises out of a Government view as to the correct principle that this legislation should effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know and the Government does not know whether the sub-clause will apply in the particular case or in any other specific case that we might like to mention. I do not really know how the Opposition can claim to know how it would be affected because these are matters which are between the person concerned and the Commissioner of Taxation. It has been claimed that public reports have named particular instances and have given information on which conclusions have been drawn. I say again that these are matters between the persons concerned and the Commissioner. Certainly the Government does not know who would be affected by this sub-clause, or what effect its deletion would have on particular individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh has attempted to develop an argument that sub-clause (12) reflects the principles of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act and the kind of situation that is excluded from the recoupment tax would, if it occurred now, fall outside that Act. That is an interesting point but I suggest it is somewhat academic. In a typical case, where at the time of sale a company has not been assessed for tax, the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act applies if there was a reasonable expectation that tax would be payable-I repeat, if there was a reasonable expectation that there would be a future tax liability. Entry into a tax avoidance scheme would, in theory, operate to prevent that reasonable expectation arising. Again I say that that is a theory, because the practical reality is that Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Act, along with the Government's earlier anti-tax avoidance legislation, is so wide ranging that it would be hard in the extreme to imagine that there could now be a paper scheme of avoidance that could reasonably be expected to succeed in a purpose of tax avoidance. It is for all of these reasons that I urge the Committee to reject the Opposition amendment and to pass this sub-clause. </PARA>

She said that that objective test would not be in the mind of the tax avoider but would depend on whether, in the opinion of informed people in the industry, such a scheme would have had a reasonable chance of succeeding. She has led us there towards one of the very important reasons why this clause should not be allowed to remain in the Bill. Every tax avoider or evader in this category will find it very easy to go along to his accountant, or to any accountant, lawyer or agent involved in arranging tax avoidance schemes, or to the promoters and all their employees, and to have everyone say: 'Well, of course, we expected this avoidance scheme to succeed'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Particularly as Senator Chipp expressed a desire to listen to further debate on this amendment I would like, as simply as I possibly can, to go through the effect that it would have. If sombody who owns a company with current year profits puts those profits into a tax avoidance scheme which the Commissioner of Taxation ultimately disallows that person will have to pay the tax; that is, of course, independent of clause 3 (12). But clause 3 (12) would ensure-the Minister appeared to deny this but it is in her second reading speech which she made a couple of weeks ago-that it also affected pre-sale tax avoidance schemes. If a person with a company with a current year profits puts those profits into a tax avoidance scheme and then sells the company to a tax promoter who, before the scheme was disallowed, was lucky enough to have passed the company on to a sham director and stripped all the money from the company, nobody pays the tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at those two instances. Surely any reasonable person would conclude that the company owner who tried the tax avoidance scheme which failed is less culpable than the company owner who tried the tax avoidance scheme and than sold it to a promoter, especially if the process of sale to the promoter required that all the assets of the company be turned into cash. That was the basis on which, if not all almost all, these schemes operated. A company which was actually producing something, carrying on some legitimate business, would sell off all its assets to another company still under the control of the same people , which company than carried on the business. But everything that the target company, the original company, owned was turned into cash. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of Treamog Ltd-according to the McCabe-Lafranchi report-total funds of $6.536m were involved. All the company had was money, it was not producing anything. It was not conducting any business. The business which it had once conducted had been sold off. In many cases the business was then still conducted by the same people using all the same physical assets but operating under a different name. So the company had nothing but money to sell. The vendor shareholders than sold all the money for 95 cents in the dollar, as they did in the case of Treamog, even though as in the specific case of Treamog again-the annual report of the company, which was drawn up just a month before it was sold , showed provision for taxation of $2.168m. In that case a promoter paid 95 cents for every dollar of cash that the company had even though there was a known tax liability of 33 cents in every dollar that the company had. We are asked to believe-certainly by 10 Government senators but I think the Government as a whole-that that person should be regarded as innocent. He sold nothing but money, sold every dollar for 95c but with a tax liability at that time of 33c. That is exactly what happened in the Treamog case. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the insertion of this clause the vendor-shareholders of Treamog and some hundreds of other companies-nobody can really know at this stage how many hundred that will be-who essentially went through all of those steps, turned everything that the companies owned into cash and then sold the cash for 95 per cent of its face value with a tax liability of 33c, are to be excluded from paying any of the tax providing either they, or the promoter, went through the process of a tax avoidance scheme which they have to demonstrate objectively could have been expected to succeed. I suggest that all they will have to do to demonstrate that it could have been expected to succeed is to produce half a dozen accountants, lawyers, staff of promoters and agents who will stand up in court and swear that they expected it to succeed. </PARA>

Essentially, that is what this clause does. I cannot believe that this Government would destroy the logic of its own taxation policy, wipe out all its credibility, or any shred of credibility it may have left on the question of clamping down on tax avoidance and evasion, and indeed destroy the basic rationale for the Bill itself, that rationale being that this legislation is necessary to keep all these matters out of court and to speed up collection, by then subsequently inserting a clause which guarantees that a substantial number of them at least will be litigated in court. I do not believe that even this Government, as crazy as its economic policies may have been from time to time, and still are, would have inserted a clause like that unless there was a very good reason for it. I suggest that, among other things, one reason-unless there were very good reasons for it-is that this company, Treamog Ltd, clearly comes within the scope of that sub-clause.

I have been a member of this place for a reasonable time. From memory, Sir Garfield Barwick became Chief Justice of the High Court in about 1964. One thing about High Court judgments, of course, is that they are all public-they are published. Since I came to this place in 1966, how many petitions have been presented each day by the Australian Labor Party about the wicked judgments of the High Court and how this terrible man Barwick was allowing the tax system to be ripped off? How many notices of motion have been given? How many questions have been asked? How many matters of public importance have there been? How many urgency motions have there been?

I have no doubt at all that during the period these judgments were coming down from the High Court the Commissioner of Taxation was urging a series of Treasurers-who had more Treasurers than Whitlam, I cannot imagine-to amend the legislation because of the loopholes which the High Court was finding in the existing Acts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I should make a short comment on some of the things said since I outlined the tests that have to be applied before this section may apply. I want to respond to what Senator Walsh said when he sought to draw a distinction between the case of a post-sale attempted avoidance scheme and one in which there was an attempted avoidance scheme before the vendors sold their shares. Clause 3 sub- clause (12) does not apply in the latter case. However because of sub-paragraph (c) (ii) of clause 5 sub-clause (7) that latter case will be outside the legislation if, at the time of sale, there was on an objective view a reasonable expectation that the scheme would succeed and the company had not then been assessed by the Commissioner of Taxation. The objective test is one to be determined in the first instance by the Commissioner of Taxation applying the test of reasonable means. If and when it gets to a court the promoter may put forward what his expectation was but that does not give the answer. The court must resolve the matter not on what the promoter thought but on the basis of a reasonable man's view of the scheme's likely success. I think Senator Walsh has been talking about the insertion of the clause guaranteeing that there would be a lot of litigation. I think that we ought to remind the Senate that in most cases there was no attempt at all to add a post-sale avoidance scheme. In those cases there would be nothing to litigate in reliance on this sub-clause.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief. I want to say how much I appreciate the lucid explanations given by Senators Walsh and Evans when explaining the Australian Labor Party's amendment. I congratulate both of them on their speeches. I am persuaded by them that if I voted for the thrust of this legislation I would have to support the Labor Party amendment. I know honourable senators such as Senator Missen hold very strong views on this. However, I am disappointed that Senator Missen has remained silent because I respect his views on this subject. I would have thought that if honourable senators support the retrospectivity of this legislation, as Senator Missen has done in this case, the arguments of Senator Walsh and Senator Evans are unanswerable. Because I quite clearly rejected the concept of retrospectivity in this legislation I cannot support this amendment. I am not trying to score any point off Senator Missen. I suppose I am acknowledging the force of logic of the speeches of the two Opposition speakers. However, I cannot accept or support the amendment for the reasons I have given.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak very briefly on this matter. I have listened to the debate carefully. I certainly have been concerned with this clause for some time. I know it is one to which an amendment has been moved. I hope the Government has not gone too far in making these provisions. I can see very little merit in the concession given to people in this regard. The Government makes a big thing of the difference between tax avoidance and evasion . It is a distinction which I do not personally make but, of course, there is a distinction between the two terms throughout the whole of this legislation. I remain unconvinced by the answers given by the Government on this clause concerning extensive amounts of money which will not be recovered. But I am not an expert in any way on this subject. I hope the Government is right. I am prepared to go with its judgment on this matter. I am not sufficiently convinced , certainly by the explanations that have been given.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Labor Party is indebted to Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle for explaining what until now I had thought was simply a misprint in her second reading speech. She told us that the reference to the recoupment legislation not applying where there was a pre-sale avoidance scheme which might reasonably have been expected to become successful was indeed exactly what she meant. She justified that by reference to the language of clause 5 (7) (c) (ii). Indeed, when one reads clause 5 (7) (c) (ii) it does become quite clear that what is being said there is that for the purposes of calculating the amount of the company tax liability of a company one should take into account not just the liability which is in fact owing in respect of company tax for such a company but the amount of company tax that might reasonably be expected to be owing had an avoidance scheme that was set in train but which proved unsuccessful, in fact been successful. We were told earlier that the loss to revenue by virtue of the operation of clause 3 (12) would be $40m. I ask Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle whether she will now tell us precisely the amount of revenue loss that this bit of deft legislative redefinition in fact involves and whether it is not very much more substantial than $40m.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think a lot of honourable senators on the other side will want to say a lot about some of their amendments. Although Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle has clarified the situation this makes little difference to the essential point about the effect of clause 3 (12). I take Senator Chipp's point. I agreed with him entirely when he said that anyone who supported the basic thrust of this Bill, so far as it goes, logically should support the amendment. He then said that he does not support the basic thrust of the Bill because he believes the whole Bill is unjust. But I put it to him that even for somebody who holds that view, surely it is more unjust with this clause in than it would be with this clause out, for this reason: If one tries a tax avoidance scheme to wipe out a current year profit and it fails, one has to pay the tax. Now we have the clarification. If the company is sold to someone like Brian Maher, but before selling all its assets are turned into money and then the money is sold for 95 cents in the dollar, knowing that being sold with it is a contingent tax liability of 33 cents in the dollar, and then after the event of the sale, because of sheer good luck, the dealer attempts a tax avoidance scheme, no tax has to be paid. Nobody has to pay any tax under those circumstances provided the dealer takes the extra precaution of flogging off the bankrupt company to a painter or docker or some other sham director. Surely it is even more unjust to allow people who behaved in the way that the vendor-shareholders of Treamog Ltd did, and however many thousand other companies there were in exactly the same category, to escape from tax liabilities, when somebody who in a more or less honest way attempted a tax avoidance scheme of his own-insofar as there is any honesty in this whole area-has to pay. Even for those who think the Bill as a whole is unjust, I put it to them that it is even more unjust with this clause than it would be without it.</PARA></TALK.START>

Section 209 of the Income Tax Assessment Act broadly sets in train legal action for recovery of tax liabilities. Proceedings under that clause will not be taken unless notice of assessment has been served on the person and the Commissioner of Taxation has served notice in writing that proceedings will be taken within 30 days unless the tax is paid. Suppose somebody who knew he had a significant liability under this Bill skipped the country before an assessment could be served on him and he decided that he would stay outside the country.

<PARA> ''(3A) A report of the Commissioner under section 14 of the Assessment Act may-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) draw attention to the failure of a person to pay recoupment tax or late payment tax due and payable by the person; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) disclose the identity of the person.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment relates to the subsequent publication in the annual report of the Commissioner of Taxation of the names of vendor-shareholders affected by this legislation. Neither the original clause-that is, original to the Government's Bill-nor the one that is in the Bill that is before us now, as I read it, makes it mandatory for the Commissioner to name vendor-shareholders affected by the legislation. But the provision in the Bill as it is before the Committee makes it much less likely that the vendor-shareholders would be named in the Taxation Commissioner's annual report. The original 23 September provision, which we are attempting to reinsert, states that a report of the Commissioner under section 14 of the Income Tax Assessment Act may draw attention to the failure of a person to pay recoupment tax or late payment tax due and payable by the person and disclose the identity of that person. That was what the Government originally had in the Bill and subsequently decided to replace with what is in the Bill before us. I will not read it out; it is rather lengthy. The effect is to make it much less likely that such persons will be named in the Commissioner' s report. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought that the arguments put up by Government members in the House of Representatives for resisting this amendment when we moved it there were particularly spurious, remembering that the people concerned have been proclaimed by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), amongst others, to be thieves and criminals, people who were involved in fraudulent, illegal activity. By definition, according to the Government, the people who would be likely to have their names published are those who are guilty of fraudulent and illegal activities, with the possible exception, of course, of the odd vendor- shareholder who actually did not know what was going on. However, they would be a very small minority. It seems to me that, again, the reason that the Government changed its mind and its original Bill is its anxiety to protect from exposure people who have influence, particularly in the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The only penalty that could be imposed on the great majority of people who would be affected by this clause is the penalty of exposure, nothing else. I do not believe that the Government has put up any valid reasons for changing its original intention. I think that there is at least as good a reason for naming in the report of the Commissioner of Taxation not only people who, in the great majority of cases, are engaged in what Mr Fraser says is fraudulent and illegal activity but also people who have not paid up when called upon to do so as there is for naming other tax avoiders and evaders. They have been named probably ever since the Income Tax Assessment Act has been in existence. I hope that the Senate will accept our amendment which, like the previous amendment, I stress, only seeks to restore provisions in the Government's Bill which were in the Bill which the Government itself introduced into the House of Representatives six or eight weeks ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh again makes the assertion that the deletion of a clause which was in the original Taxation ( Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill has been done for the benefit of the Liberal Party of Australia. I find that absolutely remarkable in terms of its logic but not in the least remarkable in terms of its coming from Senator Walsh. To me, this amendment epitomises all the distasteful elements of the public debate which has been carried on by the Australian Labor Party in the public arena seeking in an artificial way to promote rage, indignation and intemperate comments to the point where there is no distinction between innocence and guilt, avoidance and evasion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not ever pretend to be visited by the accidental mistakes made by any member of the Government or the Opposition. One assumes that the object of the clause proposed by Senator Walsh is to ensure the public vilification of presumably in many cases innocent people, to ensure judgment of people by the public in many cases, to put on trial publicly those people who may in a dispute ultimately be found to be thoroughly innocent and thoroughly justified in their objection to an assessment that is applied to them by the Commissioner of Taxation. It is intended, in my view, to humiliate the respectable people in the community who are simply seeking to contest an assessment which is put before them. Of course, it represents a complete change of the provisions of section 14, I think it is, of the Income Tax Assessment Act , which presently provides that those listed in the annual report primarily are those who breach the Act or are subject to evasion. Implicit in that, in many respects, is the question of guilt. It has been argued long and hard in this debate that the legislation is not about innocence or guilt. But if this amendment does not seek, more than anything else, to imply guilt to individuals, I do not know what does. It removes the original intention, wording and thrust of the provision to the point where it is now being abused and prostituted to the stage of attaching additional names for one of two purposes-to intimidate people into paying taxes which they may well be challenging themselves or to hold them up to vilification and to public ridicule. Taxation is a complex matter and invariably if people see names in the Commissioner's annual report they will judge those named guilty. It is perhaps a sad indictment upon our community but that is the situation at the present time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suspect that one of the great casualties of this debate on this issue is the standing of this Parliament which hitherto has been held to be somewhat fragile. Individual members over recent months have sought by their own prejudices, hates , obsessions and distortions of truth to reduce the standing of this Parliament. I think by this clause we are seeking to reduce the standing of the community as well as our own. The fact that we have used parliamentary privilege and we are now seeking to use an insidious system to vilify these people further does not, I believe, reflect well upon this Parliament. I suspect that many people are going to be damaged and destroyed by attacks upon them by individuals in this Parliament under the cloak of parliamentary privilege. I do not think we ought to add to the indiscriminate, imprecise, irresponsible and concocted attacks by the political parties who are putting forward this amendment. For my part, I think it is intended simply to intimidate people and to try to make presumably innocent people guilty in the eyes of the public. If that is its intention, I cannot be a party to it. </PARA>

It would specifically entitle the Commissioner of Taxation to name in his annual report a person who fails to pay recoupment tax payable by that person.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason was that simple failure to pay ought not to lead to persons being named publicly because there are possibilities of injustice in adopting such a course. Perhaps I ought to say that the general reporting responsibility of the Commissioner is to name people who have committed breaches or evasions of the tax law. A simple failure to pay has not been regarded as a breach or evasion warranting the formal naming of a person by the Commissioner. For that reason it was decided that we would not insert a provision that extended the Commissioner's reporting function in that way.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apparently Senator Crichton-Browne is unable to understand why anyone might be led to suspect that changes could be made to the Government's Bill to benefit monetarily and otherwise prominent members of the Liberal Party of Australia. I find that really quite astounding, coming from a Western Australian member of the Liberal Party, as at least five members of the finance committee of the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party have been identified in documentary evidence-records of the Corporate Affairs Office-which shows that they have sold companies to the Maher organisation. The last time I had a list there were only 15 members of the finance committee and five of them-not all simultaneously-have been identified as people who flogged companies to the Maher organ- isation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Far from saying that one is paranoid to suspect that the Liberal Party might be a little sympa- thetic to the interests of people who flogged companies to the Maher organisation, it seems to me that one would have to be pretty thick if one did not come to that conclusion, particularly as the only company of which we have details-the other companies were incorporated in Western Australia and, therefore, have not been investigated yet-of a sale to the Maher organisation by members of the finance committee of the Western Australian branch of the Liberal party is Treamog Pty Ltd. That is the only company of which we have financial details. That company had a current year profit of in excess of $3.7m. Its balance sheet, presented a month or so before it was sold, showed a provision for taxation of $2.168m, none of which has been paid. Senator Crichton-Browne must think that we are extraordinarily gullible and that the people of Australia are extraordinarily gullible, given the fact that five members of this finance committee have been identified as having sold companies to the Maher organisation, if he expects us to believe that this Government is not a little susceptible to a bit of pressure from people who have been involved in tax avoidance and evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the provision which we want to have reinserted in clause 4 of the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill. It is a provision which the Government had in the Bill when it was introduced on 23 September. It does not make it mandatory for the Commissioner of Taxation to name people who have not paid tax, but it does make it much more likely that the Commissioner would name people-vendor-share-holders-who have not paid tax. I refer to the puerile argument put up in the House of Representatives by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) when he questioned why Ralph Willis, the honourable member for Gellibrand, wanted this provision to be inserted. Mr Spender said:</PARA>
<PARA> He does it simply for the purpose, so it would seem, of bringing pressure on people to pay. People should not pay because of public pressure, because of fear of trial in Parliament . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Leaving aside the last extravagant line-it is not a question of trial in Parliament; it is a question of information being disclosed by the Taxation Commissioner-what this man is saying is that people who have had the use interest free for anything up to 10 years of money that ought to have been paid in tax and who ultimately will not have to do anything more than pay back in inflated dollars-grossly devalued dollars-money that really ought to have been paid as far back as 10 years ago should not be publicly identified. He thinks it is intolerable that people who do not pay on time after receiving an assessment should be publicly identified. All our amendment, which the Government itself had in originally, seeks to do is to make that situation more likely. The people who have had the interest free use of money for 10 years will pay it back in today's value dollars and not in the much more valuable dollars of anything up to 10 years ago. Mr Spender thinks it is intolerable that people who are not paying up under those extraordinarily generous terms-providing they have managed to evade the liability completely through clause 3 sub-clause (12) of the Bill or some other device-should have any sort of pressure brought on them by way of being named in the report of the Commissioner of Taxation. One would have to be pretty gullible to swallow that line. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has given no reasonable explanation at all for having changed its own original Bill. We seek to restore to this proposed new section the clause which was in the 23 September Bill. No reasonable explanation at all has been given for the decision to change it. I suggest to Senator Crichton-Browne that the obvious explanation is that his influential friends back in Western Australia successfully appealed to the natural sympathies of the Liberal Party for people who have been up to their necks in tax avoidance and tax evasion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh's contribution appears to confirm a comment made by Senator Withers that some people regard this legislation as revenge legislation. I do not regard it as revenge legislation but apparently Senator Walsh does. I support the legislation because, simply stated, there have been people who, after having received advice, have entered into arrangements whereby they have received a tax benefit which they otherwise would not have obtained. All that this legislation does is establish a new tax in order to recover moneys and identify people involved. The new tax is thereby levied on them. Why should those people be treated in any different way from any other taxpayer? As the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) said, they have no chance of breaking this law because the tax will be levied. They will either pay up or not pay up. It is not a question of avoidance; they cannot avoid or evade this tax. Therefore, under the normal provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act and under these circumstances the Commissioner of Taxation could not nominate in his annual report those people because, as the Minister has said, the non-payment of taxes does not create that sort of an offence. Therefore, I oppose this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am very concerned about the fact that over the past two or three months names of individuals have been bandied about under the cloak of parliamentary privilege and this Parliament itself has been held up to ridicule. I suggest to the Opposition that the stocks of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden, have fallen amongst the general public because he also engaged in name calling and was found out. I suggest that Mr Hayden's reflections on John Reid did him no good at all. I do not think it affected John Reid's credibility or standing in the community but it did affect the Leader of the Opposition's standing in the community. My own view is that we should reject this clause if we are to treat this legislation in a proper manner and thus reject the revenge aspect that has been injected into this debate. </PARA>

How does the Commissioner of Taxation collect this debt? He collects it by the normal processes of the law. He can either send a person bankrupt which happens quite often-a string of surgeons in Perth got mixed up in the Molle affair and were made bankrupt by the Commissioner of Taxation in an attempt to collect the taxes due-or other procedures are available to him. I do not know whether he can execute either on a person's goods or on his person prior to getting a judgement for the debt that is due. I imagine that the Commissioner uses the normal provisions of the law existing in this country to collect the money owing to him.

For example, they park a van outside the debtor's house and say: 'We are here to collect money from people who do not pay their bills'. There has been a lot of harassment by debt collecting agencies. Most civilised people think that such conduct ought not to be permitted. It is only 100 odd years since the Dickensian method of gaoling people for debt was formally abolished-the old debtors Acts. Do we want to go back to that?

The taxpayer gets an assessment, attaches a cheque to it and sends it off . I hope that the Commissioner of Taxation collects the money due to Consolidated Revenue by the normal methods used within the community. He ought not to be given powers beyond those of any other person to whom money is owed. I am not one of those people who believes that either the Crown, if one is a royalist, or the state, if one is a republican, should have more privileges than anyone else in the community. This is one of the things for which parliamentary democracy has been fighting certainly since about the time of the Magna Carta. These days we seem to be turning the clock back.

In fact, I think some of those bad practices of debt collection agencies have been stamped out by legislation in some of the States.

We do not believe there is anything improper about using pressure to make those people pay the money. The Government and, regrettably, Senator Harradine apparently believe it is improper to use pressure to make them pay back the money they should not have had and which they have had for anything up to 10 years interest free.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having listened to the debate, particularly the speeches of Government senators, I think the record ought to be put straight. The amendment which has been moved by Senator Walsh states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (2) Page 8, clause 4, after sub-clause (3), insert the following new sub-clause :</PARA>
<PARA> ''(3A) A report of the Commissioner under section 14 of the Assessment Act may-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) draw attention to the failure of a person to pay recoupment tax or late payment tax due and payable by the person; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) disclose the identity of the person.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The speakers opposite have tried to vilify Senator Walsh and to portray this amendment as being his. What Senator Walsh is endeavouring to do by moving this amendment is to re-insert in the Bill a clause which was in the original Bill. There is no doubt that the Bill would have gone through the Liberal Party and National Party rooms. Members of those parties would have talked about it. It came into the other place and because of pressure upon the Government, which was brought to bear by the very people Senator Walsh mentioned, the Government has decided to delete the clause. To save the Government some embarrassment Government senators tonight tried to portray to the people at large that this is an amendment of Senator Walsh or of the Opposition. It is no such thing; it was in the original Bill. If people look at the original Bill they will see this. It was put there by the Government-no doubt by the Treasurer (Mr Howard)-and agreed to by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and brought into the other place. Because of the pressures brought upon the Government by the powers that be, the very people who Senator Walsh is criticising, the clause was taken out of the Bill to appease those people who no doubt have been heavy financial contributors to the Liberal Party, particularly in Western Australia, as my colleague Senator Walsh has pointed out. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing has come out of this amendment which has been moved by Senator Walsh tonight. It reminds me of that book about Ben Chifley, The Light on the Hill, in which it was mentioned that the greatest thing that could happen to make people come out of their cocoons is when the hip-pocket nerve pinches. That is the very thing that has happened tonight. Senator Withers made one of the longest speeches in this chamber tonight on this Bill. Because the hip-pocket nerve is pinching on some of his friends Senator Withers saw fit to come out of hibernation, out of his cocoon, to make a speech. I think it is perhaps the first speech of any length that he has made since he was deposed from the leadership in this place by Mr Fraser. I give Senator Withers credit. I thought that he suffered from permanent laryngitis but we find tonight that he does not. He has come out of his cocoon in defence of the people in Western Australia whom both Senator Withers and Senator Crichton-Browne are desperately trying to defend. </PARA>
<PARA> In trying to defend those people they are trying to lay all of the blame on the shoulders of Senator Walsh who, in my view, has been honest in what he is trying to do; to re-insert in the Bill the very clause which the Government saw fit to take out. It is an embarrassment to the Government. Senator Withers said that some Government senators ought to be ashamed because they are sitting with strange bedfellows because the Opposition is voting with the Government. It is not our Bill. It is the Fraser Government's Bill. It is not the Labor Party's Bill. I find it hard to appreciate what Senator Withers is about when he tries to turn the debate around and accuses some of his own senators of being with strange bedfellows just because the Labor Opposition supports the Government's Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very interesting to sit here tonight and to see the disarray on the Government side. We have heard Senator Crichton-Browne airing a great difference of opinion with Senator Missen. I have always looked upon Senator Missen as one who considers things in a rational manner. However, because he comes up with a point of view which is different from that of Senator Crichton-Browne we see Senator Crichton-Browne shaking his finger at him and making certain accusations about him. I give great credit to Senator Missen. I am only imitating Senator Crichton-Browne, who was trying to embarrass Senator Missen here tonight. I am sure he could not do that. If any honourable senators in this chamber have been embarrassed tonight by Senator Walsh's amendment they would be Senator Crichton- Browne and, not very far behind him, Senator Withers. We only have to have listened to them tonight or to read the record of the debate tomorrow--</PARA>

We know that Senator Jessop was not in the chamber at the time, so he would not know. I invite him to read the Hansard tomorrow to see how often I mentioned that amendment and how often I addressed my remarks to it. I say again that the amendment moved by Senator Walsh in fact embraces a clause which appeared in the original Bill brought in by the Fraser-Howard Government in trying to deal with these crooked tax evaders-they are nothing else. I say again, in support of Senator Walsh, that the senators who vote against Senator Walsh's amendment tonight are in support of tax evaders in this community. It is the lower-paid income earners who will have to contribute by paying higher taxes in order that the wealthy people who support the Liberal Party can be let off the hook and so make a contribution to that party's election funds.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Finance ( Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) for information from her advisers on this matter. If any taxpayer fails to pay any tax on the date on which it is due, I take it that the Commissioner of Taxation has two courses of action open to him. One is to issue a bankruptcy notice, which is very, very public and identifies the person. I take it that the other course open to him is to sue for his money by the issue of a writ, which again makes very public the sum owing and the identity of the individual. Does the Commissioner have any other capacity to collect his money? I assume he collects it by due process of law through the bankruptcy courts or the normal courts by suing for the amount owed. If he does that, I suggest to Senator McLaren that it makes very public who the individual is and how much money is involved. I imagine the Commissioner can, and should, do that the day after the sum falls due.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this clause has had a fair bit of discussion. Senator Withers or someone else made these points before to the effect that the Commissioner of Taxation has powers to collect the money. Of course, he would sue through the courts. He would get judgment. He has garnishee powers, or he can put a person through bankruptcy proceedings. Those courses are open to the Commissioner. As I said earlier and as I think other honorable senators have mentioned, failure to pay has not been regarded as a breach or evasion warranting the naming of a person by the Commissioner. It was for that reason that the Government decided that this provision to entitle the Commissioner should not be inserted in the Bill. That was said many times before Senator McLaren and others got up to talk about it. The usual processes of the collection powers of the Commissioner of Taxation are available and it is for that reason that it seems unnecessary to extend the Commissioner's reporting function that presently exists.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (1) Page 16, clause 5, sub-clause (7), paragraph (c), sub-paragraph (ii), line 44, after ''expected'' insert ''by the person or persons who sold shares''. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Page 17, clause 5, sub-clause (7), paragraph (c), sub-paragraph (iii), line 6, after ''expected'' insert ''by the person or persons who sold shares''. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Page 17, clause 5, sub-clause (9), paragraph (c), leave out the paragraph. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of these amendments is to help the Government resolve some inconsistencies in the legislation, in the first instance by adding the words ' by the person or persons who sold shares'. That in no way alters the intention of what the Government is trying to do because as the clause is printed there is a degree of ambiguity as to from whom the liability is owing. Sub-clause (7) (c) (ii) states:</PARA>
<PARA>any amount of ordinary company tax (not including additional tax payable inder section 207 of the Assessment Act) that, immediately before the last sale time, might reasonably have been expected to become payable by the company at a later time in relation to the year of income in which the last sale time occurred or a preceding year of income . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There is an area of ambiguity there which cropped up when we dealt with the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act of 1980 as to who is the person affected. It is very clear, from what the Government has said on this, that it believes the vendors of those shares are the people who should meet the liability. By inserting those words-there is no reason why the Government would oppose this- that ambiguity would be resolved. There are good and sound reasons for that matter to be resolved at this point. </PARA>
<PARA> The third amendment, which deals with the second theme, resolves the inherent inconsistency and incompatibility between what is said in clause 5 (7) (c) (ii) and clause 5 (9) (c) because the former sub-clause provides that the taxation liability shall be in the line of what would reasonably be expected to be the taxation liability of the company, presumably when the assessment is issued, which would be at the end of the financial year. Many changes can take place through a financial year and it may well have been known to the vendors of the shares that through the rest of the financial year the taxation liability of the company would have altered from what it was at the time of sale. Again that is a reasonable proposition for the Government to accept. But when we go to clause 5 (9) (c) we find that it is worded in such a way that the taxation liability of the company is assessed prior to the sale of the shares. In other words, a vendor who sold in good faith knowing that there would be a change in tax liability will have no recourse to what sub-clause (7) (c) (ii) provides because clause 5 (9) (c) denies him that right. It is a fundamental drafting error in the Bill. Therefore, I look forward to the support of the Government for my amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will not support the amendments that have been moved by Senator MacGibbon. The amendments to which he has just referred relate to those provisions of the Bill which define the method of calculating the company's contingent tax liability at the date of sale. The contingent tax liability of the company is used in ascertaining whether the excess consideration test in sub -clauses (1) and (2) of clause 5 is met. The ascertainment of the contingent tax liability of the company is an objective one. The insertion of the words 'by the person or persons who sold shares' would result in the test becoming subjective. In other words, the actual expectation of a vendor-shareholder would be required . To the extent that it requires an ascertainment of a vendor-shareholder's state of mind it could lead to claims that there was no subjective expectation of a tax liability because the vendor-shareholders were told that their company was to be put through a magic trick to eliminate that liability. Of course, there was no magic trick; there was simply fraud.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Viewed in another way, the amendments proposed by Senator MacGibbon amount to an innocence clause. The Government does not accept the validity of arguments for an innocence clause. We will probably be saying something further on that matter shortly. The omission of paragraph (c) of clause (5) (9) would also enable claims that post-sale tax avoidance schemes were to be used to eliminate liability and would also, in effect, amount to an innocence exclusion. For those reasons, the Government is not able to accept the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard a rather interesting explanation. I presume that the person who wrote it is the person who drafted this part of the Bill. What we are doing here is imposing more draconian penalties on people after this Bill is passed and applying them for the period of 10 years before the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act than existed after that Act was passed two years ago. I should have thought that it would be very difficult for the Government to sustain that position. I would like to have a word with the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) about this business of everyone being presumed guilty. That is the presumption that she has made. She cannot seem to understand that some people would have legitimate and bona fide tax deductions for the rest of the financial year. I would like the Minister to explain why all the people involved are presumed to be guilty of fraud.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know when Senator MacGibbon prepared his amendments but I had not seen them until tonight. I have not had the opportunity to take any expert advice on them. Senator Evans is objecting. He has had a quick look at them. Certainly, nothing that Senator MacGibbon has said convinces me that the amendments should be supported. In the first two amendments he seeks to insert the words 'by the person or persons who sold shares' following the words 'might reasonably be expected'. I am only a layman in these matters but it seems to me that if words mean anything at least the possibility of litigation is opened up by the insertion of those words. The test then becomes not what might be reasonably expected by a third part standing at arm's length in the transaction but what a person who was involved in the transaction says was reasonably expected of him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the third amendment, which seeks the deletion of sub-clause 9 (c) entirely, I repeat that the Queen's Counsel to whom I was recently speaking said that this Bill seems to be written in a mixture of Swahili and Afghan and it is terribly hard to understand. But again Senator MacGibbon has not, in my view, given sufficient reason for supporting that amendment either. The Opposition will not support any of the amendments. I point out that the Bill has been around for a very long time. We all know, of course, that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) said in July that this Bill would be passed in the first two weeks of the Budget session; that is, the Bill would have been passed through both Houses before 24 August. In fact, the first version did not hit the deck until 23 September and the second version did not hit the deck until 23 October, which was five weeks ago. If Senator MacGibbon wanted more thorough consideration given to his amendments he should have circulated them before 8 o'clock tonight.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 19 May I raised a matter relating to the eavesdropping of telephone conversations between Weipa and Aurukun. I outlined that I had been advised that commercially available frequency modulation radios can monitor conversations on this radio telephone link. To date I have not been told of the outcome of any investigation into the matter. Can the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume), who is in the chamber, provide any information now and, if not, can some information be provided in the near future?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have the Hansard from 19 May. Senator Colston was kind enough to give me some warning that he would be raising this matter. There is no doubt, on reading that Hansard , that Senator Colston set out, on that occasion, a situation. I undertook to try to get some information for him. I believe that it is quite right and proper that he raises the matter again tonight. I think a period of six months has passed since he first raised it. Tonight we have been back to the Department which I represent and have gone as far as we can to try to get some information. I can give him some general information at this stage. I am advised that some radio circuits are not absolutely private; that conversations can be heard by people using the right equipment and with the willingness to eavesdrop; that in remote areas such as Weipa and Aurukun the terrain is such that Telecom Australia is not able to provide secure landline circuits. The honourable senator, knowing the terrain, would understand that. Instead, Telecom uses radio links to provide a basic low cost service. A decision is best made at the time of installation whether some form of privacy protection device should be incorporated in the service. Such a device can be installed later in some particular cases, but it is more costly if it is done afterwards than if it is done at the time of installation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly, at Weipa and Aurukun the installation is such that conversations can be overheard by some people. I am not certain that that advice is based upon what the honourable senator told me or whether it is based upon further investigations. But Telecom is examining the matter urgently and it hopes to be able to come back to me with more information which I could give to Senator Colston, I hope, tomorrow. We do not have the extra information required tonight . The practice of listening in, eavesdropping, is of course illegal. The Telecommunications (Interception) Act was passed for the very purpose of stopping this despicable practice and it provides for severe penalties for people caught contravening the Act. There is then another line of action which might be opened up from what Senator Colston has described. May I say again that on reading the Hansard of 19 May I believe the honourable senator deserves and requires an answer to his problems. We are seeking that answer urgently and I will provide it as soon as I can. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) My Department does not monitor the need for podiatry in Australia or the extent to which these needs are met.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No programs are funded by my Department to assist in meeting these needs.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. Miss S. Marr submitted an application to my Department for a health services research and development grant on 14 January 1982. The application was entitled 'The evaluation of manpower requirements and the need for podiatry services in the community' and a sum of $9,500 was sought. Owing to the freeze on Commonwealth Government expenditure, the application was not formally considered by the Health Services Research and Development Grants Task Force till 5 August 1982. The Task Force did not recommend funding on the following grounds:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) There was concern that the methodology proposed in the project would not yield results which would constitute a basis for estimating the national need for podiatry services.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The Health Commission of New South Wales is responsible for monitoring the adequacy of health services in New South Wales. A study such as that proposed by Miss Marr would not be beyond the resources of that Commission if the subject was of sufficient concern to it.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No. The National Health and Medical Research Council (N.H. and M.R.C.), through which the Federal Government provides support for medical research, does not earmark funds for research into specific diseases. The Council allocates funds to individual projects on the basis of assessed scientific merit, so that those projects which are considered to be highest in quality receive support.</PARA>
<PARA> On this basis the N.H. and M.R.C. has allocated funds for research into muscle and muscular dystrophy over the last five years as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1982-$372,351</PARA>
<PARA> 1981-$335,922</PARA>
