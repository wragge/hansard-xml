<PARA> That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death yesterday of Mr A. A. Armstrong, member for Riverina from 1965 to 1969, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>I express just a few words personally and as a member of the National Country Party and, indeed, of the Government parties referable to the shock at the sudden death of Bill Armstrong. It is a shock that brings to all of us who had the opportunity of knowing Bill Armstrong a realisation that we have lost a good friend and, indeed, a very fine Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> Bill Armstrong had a long and distinguished career in the community in which he lived. He served the community through his efforts in the world of politics as well as in many other fields. He was a very well-known and well-liked member in the Federal seat of Riverina. He served there, as I have said, from 1965 until 1969. Bill Armstrong had a distinguished career in the Army. He served in the 38th Australian Infantry Battalion in 1939 and 1940 and then in the Australian Imperial Force until the conclusion of the war. He was mentioned in despatches. He was decorated with the Military Cross. </PARA>
<PARA> Bill Armstrong was born in 1909 in Deniliquin which was his home base for the entire passage of his life. I believe that he was a person who really had no enemies in the entire world in which he moved. He was a man who made a point of understanding every other body's point of view. I think in doing that he was a great example to all of us. Not only had he a wide range of interests in the social, political and economic circumstances and development of the community but also he was a very keen sportsman. Among his close attentions in that field was his determination that the Melbourne Cup should start on time and with no undue advantage anywhere in the field. I understand that he was the starter of that famous Australian event on no fewer than 21 occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many things that I could say about Bill Armstrong and his family-his wife whom I have known very well for years, his daughter and his three sons. I do not propose to speak for the length of time that his passing really deserves but I take this opportunity of again offering not only my own very sincere consideration and condolences but also those of my party, and indeed of the Government, to his wife, his daughter and his three sons. I can only hope that the measure of their grief will be in some way relieved by the knowledge of the massive army of friends and the good will that Bill Armstrong was able to establish. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join Senator Scott in expressing my personal sympathy and that of members of my party and this Government to the widow and family of Bill Armstrong upon his death. Those of us who knew him would join with Senator Scott in commenting that he had a very warm personality and a quiet and gentle strength. In Shakespeare's words, he was a man. He served in both peace and war with great distinction. He served not only at the local shire level but also in this Parliament, in the other place. He served in World War II with particular distinction and was awarded the Military Cross for bravery. I suppose that the most important thing that one can say about a person is that we are the poorer for his passing. We had in him a warm friend, someone from whom we gained in friendship in the journey of life. In expressing our sympathy, we say to his family that he will be long remembered by us.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join others who have spoken of the sad passing of Bill Armstrong. My experience and knowledge of Bill could be summed up as follows: He was widely consulted for his expertise in pastoral interests. He was highly regarded as someone who had a very broad experience in and a vast knowledge of that important area of activity in Australia. In the Army he was decorated for his bravery. In what I think was one of the proudest of his achievements-his work as the starter, amongst other things, of the Melbourne Cup for over 20 years-he was praised for his impartiality, his accuracy and his competence. I can only subscribe to what Senator Chipp has said: As a friend, he was a very good bloke.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That your petitioners are gravely concerned at the special privileges bestowed on the Deputy Prime Minister Mr Anthony M.P. and the Minister for Primary Industry Mr Nixon M.P.:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) That in 1964 a Liberal/Country Party Government granted Mr Anthony M.P. a Commonwealth Government Home Loan Mortgage of $17,964 for a period of 45 years at a fixed interest rate of 4.75 per cent and that at 1.10.81 the amount of principal outstanding was $15,005.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 43 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Health Care Card system introduced on September 1st. for low income, unemployed, pensioners and other beneficiaries discriminates against the unemployed by its exclusion of pharmaceutical, optical and other entitlements for unemployed people. This discrimination results in greater hardship and distress to the unemployed and their dependants, and reduces their access to essential health facilities by increasing the onerous burden of health charges on this group which can least afford it.</PARA>
<PARA> This discrimination is a further example of the government's harsh and insensitive treatment toward the unemployed and their families, and creates unnecessary divisions within Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should review the Health Care Card system and extend the benefits for pharmaceutical, optical and other entitlements to the unemployed (in line with the recent recommendation of the Australian Medical Association).</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That the decision by the Federal Government to introduce fees at the Repatriation General Hospital, Greenslopes, was made without prior consultation with medical staff at that hospital and implemented at short notice.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That fee introduction will place the hospital in the untenable position of having to compete with the State's free hospital system.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth concern over Plant Variety Rights (PVR) legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> We agree that:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) PVR will aggravate the free exchange of genetic material for plant breeding .</PARA>
<PARA> (2) PVR will not enhance Australia's access to improved plant varieties developed overseas but will encourage the dumping of unsuitable varieties on the Australian market.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) PVR will restrict the public plant breeding program to basic research for exploitation by private enterprise and discourage breeding for disease and pest resistant varieties.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) PVR will lead to the domination of the seed industry by foreign interests not responsible to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The proprietary rights granted by PVR will encourage the introduction of seed distribution and marketing monopolies and lead to seed price increases.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Is it true that estimates of the Budget blowout are going as high as $1. 4 billion? Does this not support the view of commentators that the Budget strategy is falling apart and is 'in tatters'?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the latter part of the question, I have not seen the statements but, of course, I have recently reread the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report on Australia which says that compared with other countries in the Western world Australia's performance is remarkably good. The Budget has suffered some setbacks. As the result of some continued industrial strife in Bass Strait, the volume of production of crude oil there has fallen to the extent that this year the shortfall in revenue will be perhaps some $220m. Of course, that is a very large amount. It is also necessary to meet the Academic Salaries Tribunal's increases and the recommendations of Mr Justice Coldham's Committee of Reference for Defence Force Pay on Defence Force salaries. Overall the Budget deficit has increased but the Government is busy seeking to contain any increase in it and is making a number of reductions in expenditure so that the deficit will be kept to a minimum.</PARA></TALK.START>

Will the Minister advise whether that policy has been effective? If it has, what savings have been made?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As one would expect with energy matters coming within my portfolio, of course I have a brief on both the matters raised; and, as honourable senators would expect, I am keenly interested to know what savings are made and how Australian prices for oil and gasoline compare with overseas prices. Import parity pricing has been a marked success. It has been commended by the International Energy Agency as being essential. The Agency has said that any country which sets out to have a proper energy policy must have, as its basis, the pricing of its petroleum products at world scarcity prices, and that in fact is what import parity pricing means. If one were to assume that the demand for crude oil and petroleum products, say over the three fiscal years since the introduction of import parity pricing, had continued at the average rate for the past, that is the 4 per cent which Australia experienced in the 10 years to 1977-78, the saving would be of the incredible order of 75 million barrels of oil compared with the historic rate of consumption. To put it another way, if petroleum consumption growth in that 10 years-an increase of 4 per cent per annum-had been maintained, then we would have had to get 75 million barrels more out of Bass Strait. That is some six months supply. Quite clearly, there have been enormous savings. With the consent of the Senate I would be happy to incorporate in Hansard a comparative table of the prices of petroleum fuel in Australia and other countries. I seek leave to incorporate that table in Hansard .</PARA></TALK.START>

If it is not true, where are there to be cutbacks? Will these be particularly in the area of overtime? If overtime is to be cut, in what areas will this happen? How does the Minister expect that this will affect the processing of pensions, benefits and family allowances?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="229" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To take the last part of the honourable senator's question first, I do not anticipate there being any effect on the processing of pensions and benefits. That, of course, is an important and primary obligation of my Department. I would not wish to see any action taken by the Government, and the Government would not wish to see any action taken, which would interfere with meeting that primary obligation. In common with all other departments, the Department of Social Security was asked to exercise all possible restraint in its discretionary outlays and that includes overtime. There was a temporary freeze on unused funds while essential needs were assessed. I should point out that on the very weekend that that occurred, or on the weekend following that occurring, overtime was worked to meet those commitments that I mentioned earlier in my answer, namely, ensuring that pensions and benefits were paid on time. It was made clear from the outset that funds would be made available to enable pensions and benefits to be paid on time. In fact action is currently in train to secure the release of further amounts needed to maintain essential operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Department does not rely heavily on overtime for its operation although some is essential. The salary provision in the Budget was $175,100,000 and the provision for overtime was a modest $2.9m. In terms of the total operations of the Department that figure is relatively small. But it is a fact that at times overtime needs to be worked in such areas as computer operations to ensure that the very large number of payments that are made weekly by the Department can be made at the right time for pensioners and beneficiaries. I noticed one report in the Sydney Morning Herald which said:</PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, Deborah Hope reports from Canberra that the payment of pensions and other welfare benefits will be severely disrupted by the overtime freeze in the Department of Social Security-</PARA>
<PARA>It then reads:</PARA>
<PARA>according to the Administrative and Clerical Officers' Association.</PARA>

I ask the media to think of the welfare of pensioners and beneficiaries and to check such reports with me or my Department before they are published. In fact there will be some minor effect on my Department. Currently there are discussions between my Department and the Department of Finance about areas where there might be possible savings between now and the end of the year. There is the possibility of some small administrative savings. There is the possibility of some minor slippage in subsidy payments where that will not break obligations or inconvenience the operation of organisations that are expecting those payments. The overall effect on a total Budget in excess of $10 billion will be minuscule.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Veterans' Affairs aware that currently the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment is dealing with a reference referred to it by the Senate concerning pesticides and herbicides and their effect on human health? The Senate has requested the Committee to deal with Vietnam veterans and the problems associated with agent orange and other herbicides. I ask: Firstly, in view of Press reports describing the recent Repatriation Review Tribunal decision in favour of Mrs Lorraine Simpson as an historic ruling that would open up the flood gates of claims from veterans, can the Minister advise the Senate of the implications of this decision for the manner in which the Repatriation Commission will examine such claims? Secondly, should claims for disabilities attributed to exposure to chemicals be now accepted, what will be the implication, if any, for the epidemiological studies on Vietnam veterans by the Commonwealth Institute of Health? Thirdly, the decision of the Repatriation Review Tribunal on the Simpson case notes on several occasions the absence of representatives of the Repatriation Commission during the hearing. Can the Minister explain the absence of the Commission?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can confirm the facts. A decision was handed down last Thursday by the Repatriation Review Tribunal in the case of Mrs Simpson who claimed that her husband's death caused by a malignant lymphoma was the result of his war service. It is important to note that the Tribunal did not make a finding that there was a definite proven link between any exposure of Mr Simpson during service in Vietnam to agent orange or any other toxic chemical. Mr Simpson's death, due to lymphoma, was caused in circumstances which I will describe in a moment. I wanted to make that point clear because there is some doubt in the minds of people who may be concerned about their own state of health because of the kind of media reporting that occurred over this decision. In fact, it could give an impression that new evidence was brought forward in the Tribunal to indicate some kind of link between chemicals and the kind of health problems that were suffered by Mr Simpson.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I stress that in this case the Repatriation Review Tribunal applied the onus of proof provisions contained in the Repatriation Act which require a determining authority to grant a claim unless satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there are insufficient grounds for so doing. Of course, this is a matter which has in recent times been subject to contest in the High Court of Australia and which is now well settled in the law.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jessop raises the point of whether this is an historic ruling. One has to acknowledge that this has not yet been established for the purposes of either legal inquiry or scientific inquiry. Consequently, claims which may be put forward by individual Vietnam veterans will proceed in the normal way through the repatriation appeals system. Should these claims that have been put forward be further accepted, that will be a matter for future concern of the Repatriation Commission and other bodies. As to the effect upon the epidemiology study of the Commonwealth Institute of Health, quite clearly the Government's intention, as I have recently announced, is to pursue the scientific questions involved in this matter with utmost speed. Consequently, as I announced a week or two ago, we have undertaken certain new measures to ensure that we get early answers to that question.</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the latter part of Senator Jessop's question regarding the absence of Repatriation Commission officials during the Repatriation Review Tribunal hearing, I point out that this is of course a matter of decision of the Repatriation Commission. It is an independent statutory authority. It has been designed by this Parliament to be outside political or other interference. Beyond that, I understand that the reasons in this case were simple. On the file which was presented to the Repatriation Review Tribunal during its hearing were three clearly very substantial, important and, might I say, well qualified reports from experts in the treatment of cancer, and in particular lymphoma, who stated that in their opinions there was no connection between toxic chemical exposure and malignant lymphoma. Therefore, no particular reason was seen to appear at the Tribunal.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the first question, the answer is unequivocally yes, we can give that assurance. No decision was made by the Government to relinquish control in the Loan Council. As to the second question, the Government felt that a Loan Council that had been functioning since 1927 needed to have some review. There were a considerable number of borrowing changes in the public and private sectors over that period. A number of commercial ventures now entered into by State and local government bodies had not been entered into before. Whilst the Government asserts its primary national responsibility for the economy and, therefore, for money supply as an instrument of the economy, it could foresee that there might be some changes in the procedures and the practices that could be beneficial to both. But the Commonwealth Government, in whatever should be pursued, will keep the primary responsibility before it; that is, it accepts that it has this national responsibility for the economy and, therefore, for the overall money supply. It will have that in its mind. Nevertheless, it believes that, as I said, because of particular borrowing changes that have happened in the past few years it is well worth having a second look at the general procedures.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Alligator Rivers claim is not yet determined. The Finniss River claim is awaiting determination. I tabled in an interim typewritten form last June the Aboriginal Land Commissioner's report on the Finniss River claim and later this week during the tabling of papers will bring down the final printed form with the maps and the other documents which are required. Some appeals have been made to the High Court of Australia on certain matters which go to these claims. There is a question as to the weight which the Commissioner should give to questions of detriment being argued before the High Court. There is also a question as to the status of grazing licences and whether they represent alienation of land. I will not be in a position to make a determination on the Finniss River claim, a complete determination on the Alligator Rivers claim or a final determination on Borroloola until these matters have been determined. As soon as the High Court has made its judgment on these matters I will be in a position to go back and to make the judgment to which the honourable senator refers.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister representing the Minister for Health may seek to add to my answer. It so happens that I am responsible for radioactive materials. I am advised that this situation refers to radioactive monazite residues from sand mining at Capel which is 170 kilometres south of Perth. The situation there, I am advised, is similar to that encountered recently in Byron Bay, New South Wales. A radiation level of 0.1 millirems an hour is recognised by the International Commission for Radiation Protection-that is, the ICRP-as the threshold level for public health investigation. The radiation levels at Byron Bay range from 0.1 to 0.6 millirems an hour; that is, 100 to 600 microrems . The New South Wales Minister for Health has explained that 1,200 hours' exposure would give the equivalent in radiation of two chest x-rays.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me make it perfectly clear, as I have said in the Senate before, that I do not seek to minimise the effect of any radioactivity. If I give the Senate the comparative figures I do so to enable some understanding of the nature of the problems. It is not to say that because one would need to have 1,200 hours' exposure something ought not to be done. I want to make that abundantly clear. The advice I have is that at the Byron Bay level one would need 1,200 hours exposure to get the equivalent radiation of two chest x-rays. Again, chest x- rays are elective. Exposure to radioactivity from these materials could be compulsory. I make the point that there is a duty to keep down the amount of non -elective radioactivity. If the figures cited for Capel are correct the radiation hazard will be of a similar order to Byron Bay. We understand that the Western Australian State X-ray Laboratory surveyed the area in 1981 and has reported to the Western Australian Minister for Health. If there is any further information that either Senator Baume or I could add for the honourable senator we would be keen to obtain it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has been informed by me that the Atomic Energy Act is under total review and that discussions are in continuous process with the States to define a new Commonwealth Act for the future and State and Commonwealth roles. The sovereignty situation is quite clear with regard to these kinds of matters. In everyday life the States are handling industrial and medical isotopes in very large quantities. At those levels the States are responsible. For example, nobody doubts that it was the responsibility of the State to act to remove the contaminated soil at Hunters Hill. I think that nevertheless puts in perspective the fact that the Commonwealth accepts that it has a responsibility in Australia for significant radioactivity. It has a responsibility particularly for movement of radioactive material between the States and overseas. I imagine that in these cases in question the States would assert their responsibilities. Since they are day by day handling these kinds of matters and these kinds of mining procedures-sand mining is a mining procedure- it would be a State responsibility. I emphasise that in the discussions preceding the formulation of the Atomic Energy Act there will be an attempt to define clearly the responsibilities of the States and the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>

Were the exploration and mining tenements pursuant to the Diamond (Ashton Joint Venture) Agreement Act 1981 granted under the Western Australian Mining Act by the Western Australian Government, which has exclusive authority over the land? Is the agreement under the Diamond (Ashton Joint Venture) Agreement Act 1981 between the Western Australian Government and the Ashton Joint Venture partners the only government agreement required to be entered into directly for the mining, marketing and processing of the diamonds? Is it a fact that the Western Australian Government, under the agreement, is entitled to have independent assessors value the diamonds? Is it a fact that any agreements or arrangements which the Ashton Joint Venture partners enter into for the processing and marketing of the diamonds are subject to the approval of the Western Australian Government?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are six aspects of the honourable senator's question. I will just sketch the picture as I see it at the moment. The conclusion of the Ashton Joint Venture marketing study, which has been a wide- ranging and complicated task, is to be welcomed by everyone as a further step towards large scale production of diamonds in Australia. I give honourable senators some idea of the magnitude of the venture so that the question can be appreciated: The Ashton Joint Venture has already spent $60m on exploration and evaluation of the deposits and initial capital outlay on the mine and plant is estimated at something like $300m, a figure which will increase with later expansion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are several points to be noted about the proposal to sell diamonds. At this stage it is a recommendation to the AJV partners; no conclusion has been reached. Secondly, AJV would have the right to retain gem diamonds for cutting and polishing in Australia, which AJV intends to undertake at the earliest opportunity. Thirdly, AJV would market 25 per cent of other production in its own right. The sorting of all production, which is skilled and labour intensive, is to be done in Australia. Against that background my understanding is that the answer to the first part of the honourable senator's question is that this was a granting of a mining permit by the Western Australian Government, and the subsequent questions all concern relationships between the State Government and the mining partners. Of course, the Commonwealth Government has export control powers as latent powers which could be used if that were felt necessary, but those powers are used only on rare occasions. It has to be understood that in the first place the partners are people highly experienced in commercial industrial matters who understand the true value of resources and how to get the true value for a resource of Australia. So one can understand that they would not willingly underprice or undersell a resource.</PARA>
<PARA> That is the background. The agreement is not at this moment fully concluded. It is a complex matter because many of the diamonds are of industrial quality rather than of gem standard. There is a depressed price for diamonds in the world today and, therefore, it is a complex matter to arrive at a commercial deal. If there are futher aspects that my colleague in another place would like to add to the answer I will direct the honourable senator's attention to them.</PARA>

The percentage of total tax that is broken up among the States is 20.72 per cent now, instead of 38.7 per cent of personal income tax as was the case in the past. It follows therefore that if, as will happen if the sales tax measures are blocked this year, there is a loss to revenue of $132m there will be a loss of $27.4m to the States. Indeed, with a $330m loss of revenue in a whole year there will be a loss to the States of $68.4m. These are large figures in terms of State revenue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I invite Senator Button to produce the record. The fact is that this Government indicated that, whilst the Australian people were relatively highly taxed by world standards in personal income tax, they were taxed relatively lightly, by world attitudes, in indirect tax. It was considered desirable to spread the burden in that way. The Government hoped that it might be able to bring about personal income tax cuts. But two or three things have happened. Firstly, the denial by the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats of $330m in a full year will, of course, make it so much harder. I repeat the figures supplied by the Department of the Treasury: The prospective loss of sales tax revenue for the full year next year will be $330m; for this year it will be $132m. Therefore, in fact, the action of the Labor Party and the Democrats will reduce the ability of the Government to reduce income tax. Equally, the industrial strife that occurs, for example in Bass Strait, reduces income and so reduces the capacity of the Government to reduce income tax. The Government wants to introduce cuts in personal income tax, but the Government sees as its overriding responsibility the reduction of the deficit so as to bear down on inflation and interest rates. It would be one thing to give back nominal income tax cuts but the creation of a bigger deficit would add to inflation and therefore take away the real purchasing power of money. The Government regards the control of monetary policy as a primary responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Knowing, as we do, how deeply respectful this Government always is of the views of Sir Billy Snedden, I ask: Does the Government accept the view of Sir Billy reported in this morning's Press that the Executive, especially in the person of the Governor-General, has too much power relative to the legislature, that another 1975-type constitutional crisis is inevitable sooner or later and that when it does come Australia is destined to become a United States-type republic? I further ask him whether or not the Government accepts this particular scenario, what is it doing to advance the cause of constitutional reform by less spectacular means? In particular, what is the future of the proposal for a further session of the Australian Constitutional Convention this year, as endorsed of course by the Senate last Thursday night, in light of the failure of last Friday's Premiers Conference to reach that item on its agenda?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have very little knowledge of Sir Billy Snedden's views, although I did gain some cursory knowledge of them from reading the Press this morning. On such a serious matter I would really like to have the opportunity of studying his views, although, as I said, I think he was making forecasts of what might happen rather than expressing any belief of his that that is what ought to happen. However, without studying his views, I am not able to make even that judgment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Evans has introduced into the Senate a Bill to make major constitutional changes. The Government has not yet considered what position it will take in relation to that legislation, although I am hopeful that it will be able to deal with that matter shortly. If Senator Evans wishes, as no doubt he does, to bring the matter on for debate in the Senate, I do not wish to say anything further in relation to the matter; it will be very seriously debated in this chamber in the near future. As we know, the Constitutional Convention was placed on the agenda for the Premiers Conference last Friday but that item was not reached. In those circumstances, I am giving consideration to what the next step should be in ascertaining the views of the States. The Premiers of course will be meeting again. I have not yet decided whether to wait until then or whether to try to activate some attention to the subject by the Premiers before they meet again.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for National Development and Energy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fall in the real price of oil over the past year or so has resulted in a fall in the real price of oil and oil products to the Australian motorist because the price of oil has gone up by less than the rate of inflation. The situation is that, as the result of a number of initiatives- first of all, a decision by the International Energy Agency members to reduce their purchases of oil considerably; secondly, very big conservation measures, particularly in countries such as America and Japan; and thirdly, Saudi-Arabia's increase of output-a temporary glut of oil, oil products and, indeed, products such as liquefied petroleum gas has been brought about. I say 'temporary' because nothing alters the fact that oil is a finite resource and is being used at a rate that, in the course of the decades ahead, will virtually exhaust it. It is a temporary glut added to by recessive characteristics in countries throughout the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another significant situation which is occurring is that Iran and Iraq, which have been at war, face serious balance of exchange problems. Iran in particular is producing oil on to world markets at a discounted price below the price of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. This may sound good news to those who, in the short term, want cheaper oil but there is some considerable danger to the stability of quite a number of countries if there should be economic or political instability within OPEC. I cannot tell, therefore, whether the Saudi-Arabian market price will remain where it is at the moment, at $34, or whether it will move.</PARA>
<PARA> When I was in Saudi-Arabia one month or six weeks ago Sheik Yamani foreshadowed that he thought the price would hold, that there would be no upward movement of the oil price in OPEC this year, and that he felt that next year there would be an upward movement in the price of OPEC oil but not as great as the rate of inflation. He considered the possibility of some reduction in the volume of Saudi-Arabian output in order to stabilise the situation. At this moment it is a very delicate situation, contributed to by Iran's discounting. There are quite a number of oil producing countries whose output at this moment is at the minimum which, in their judgment, is required for the maintenance of their economies and their general living standards. So we could get some destabilisation.</PARA>
<PARA> If the price of oil stays as it is or falls slightly this year then, of course, there will be a fall in price in real terms. The price in Australia is geared to the Saudi-Arabian market price and, therefore, would move with it. It is significant now to look at what has happened and to reflect upon what members of the Australian Labor Party used as claims in scare tactics some 14 months ago, before the last elections. They tried to frighten the people but the very reverse of what they claimed would happen has happened. No one can say what might happen in the long term because a judgment has to be made as to the stability or otherwise of the Middle East. But we will be fixing our price according to the Saudi-Arabian light crude market price.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government, in its determination of interest rates , is very sensitive and susceptible to the advice of the Reserve Bank Board and the Department of the Treasury. My instinct is that in general terms that advice has been observed over the period. It may be that there has been some variation of a minor scale but, to my memory, the Government has departed little, if at all, from the advice that it has had. The decision-making of the Government on interest rates, therefore, has been done without regard to election campaigns because the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Department of the Treasury are not so influenced. On the other hand, the completely irresponsible prediction of the Premier of New South Wales that interest rates would rise to 18 per cent was made with full regard to elections. I was delighted to see it condemned by virtually every responsible economist and senior businessman in Australia. So the Government is acting responsibly. If electioneering comments are made, they are made by the Australian Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>

I ask whether one of the occasions on which the advice was not observed is the one referred to on page 8 of the Reserve Bank's latest annual report in which it states that there were protracted differences of opinion between the Bank and the Government regarding interest rate policy between September and December of 1980-in other words, the period to which I referred- and that those differences of opinion were not finally resolved until December 1980.</PARA></TALK.START>

Prior to these reports, assurances had been received from the United States that no part of the Sinai peacekeeping force, including the United States component, would have any association with the rapid deployment force. The Government, nevertheless, sought further clarification from Washington. In response to this request, the United States Government has provided specific details of the legislation passed by the United States Congress setting out the conditions for the United States participation in the MFO. This legislation takes the form of a United States Senate-House joint resolution. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>

Article VI of the Annex 1 to the Treaty of Peace specified those functions to be supervision of the implementation of Annex 1 of the Treaty and employment of best efforts to prevent violation of its terms. Specified arrangements set forth in that Annex are: operation of check points, reconnaissance patrols, and observation posts along the international boundary between Egypt and Israel, and at various points in the Sinai; periodic verification of the implementation of the provisions of the Annex; additional verification activities at the request of either Egypt or Israel; and arrangements insuring the freedom of navigation through the Strait of Tiran.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday, 16 February, Senator McLaren raised a question concerning the Bills Digest Information Service provided by the Legislative Research Service of the Department of the Parliamentary Library. I undertook to discuss the point with senior officers of the Library. I have done this and have had lengthy discussions with the Acting Parliamentary Librarian, the head of the Legislative Research Service and two other senior officers of the Legislative Research Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the aim of the Library to have a digest prepared for all Bills, and every effort is made to do this. On those occasions when a digest is not prepared it is as a result of the pressure of urgent work for honourable senators and members. This pressure is a result of a continuing rise in the number of requests year after year being handled by a staff whose number is static over the same period. In addition, the Legislative Research Service prepares general background work in the form of basic papers and current issue briefs, writes papers for delegations of parliamentarians proceeding overseas and prepares material for the Estimates Committee of the House of Representatives. When a digest is not prepared, therefore, it is as a result of the exigencies of the time and has no other origin. In 1981 some digests were not prepared, most of them being in respect of government measures.</PARA>
<PARA> The submission to which Senator McLaren referred is an internal document. I assure the honourable senator that Mr Speaker and I will do our best to have the staff ceiling of the Parliamentary Library raised for the year 1982-83. The problem is one which attracted considerable discussion in Senate Estimates Committee A on 15 September last when the estimates of the Parliamentary Library were under examination.</PARA>

The Committee was greatly assisted in its consideration of the Bills by Professor Dennis Pearce, Professor of Law at the Australian National University, whom the Committee appointed, with your approval, Mr President, as its counsel, from 1 December 1981 to 30 June 1982.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this first report to the Senate, the Committee has given a brief outline of its method of operation so far. Given the experimental nature of the Committee, however, the procedures described are not intended to be definitive, and the Committee would welcome any suggestions from senators before it is required to report to the Senate, before 30 June 1982, on its work and the need, if any, for a separately constituted committee. </PARA>
<PARA> For the information of honourable senators, I also table a document entitled ' Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest', which includes the Committee's preliminary views on proposed laws on which the Committee has not yet reported to the Senate . As the Digest indicates, the Committee invites any senator who wishes to do so to draw matters to the attention of the Committee under its terms of reference. Copies of the Digest are being delivered to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> The report draws the attention of the Senate to some 29 clauses of 9 Bills presently before the Senate and it does so in accordance with our terms of reference. This is quite apart from clauses of other Bills which we have preliminarily examined and which will be reported on when those Bills come before this House after passage in the House of Representatives. The significance of this reporting process should not be exaggerated. The present report contains nothing of a sensational or dramatic nature but does reveal a number of provisions that ought to be scrutinised carefully by the Senate in the light of our terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA> Where there are doubts about the clause's intention or its drafting or where it may be a matter of policy on the part of the Government, but this is not revealed in the second reading speech and other documents, nonetheless we feel it is desirable to draw the problems to senators' attention so that they may appreciate and resolve the issue, where necessary. If, on investigation, the clause appears to come within our terms of reference, we will normally report it to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend in two respects the International Organizations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963, to enable Australia to meet certain treaty obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> The first amendment (dealt with in Clauses 2 to 5 of the Bill) is achieved by making individual amendments to a number of Sections of the Act. The need for this amendment has arisen from the terms of an agreement which is to be concluded between Australia and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources which we expect will set up its headquarters in Hobart, in early 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, which was concluded at a Conference in Canberra in May 1980 and which Australia ratified on 6 May 1981, Australia agreed to accord the Commission and its staff certain privileges and immunities as required by international practice. International practice also requires that a person attending a conference convened by the Commission as a representative of a member country be accorded privileges and immunities. These privileges and immunities for both staff of the Commission and representatives of member countries can be accorded under the 1963 Act as it stands. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the Convention, however, not only countries may become parties but also regional economic integration organisations, such as the European Communities, may accede once the Convention has entered into force. In addition, representatives of regional organisations and international organisations in which Australia participates might be invited to attend meetings in Australia of the organs set up under the Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> When the 1963 Act was drafted it was not contemplated that international organisations, as well as countries, would become members of other international organisations. It is necessary, therefore, to expand the power to make regulations under the Act so that representatives of international organisations attending the Commission's conferences in Australia may be accorded similar privileges and immunities to those accorded to the representatives of member countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes a number of amendments to the principal Act to achieve this. In effect, every reference in the Act to representatives of countries will be extended to include a reference to representatives of certain prescribed international organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The representatives of certain international organisations only will be eligible to be accorded privileges and immunities under the Bill. The international organisations are those of which Australia is a member and those which the Bill describes as ''overseas organizations'' such as the European Communities, of which Australia cannot become a member because the organisations are composed of countries in a particular geographical region. For the Act to apply to an international organisation it must be so declared by regulations under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the definition of ''international conference'' is amended so that it will include not only a conference attended by representatives from Australia and representatives from another country, but also by representatives from a prescribed international organisation. This will enable Australia in future to accord the appropriate privileges and immunities to those representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment (dealt with in Clause 6 of the Bill) will enable Australia to implement by regulation a taxation obligation under two specific agreements- one establishing the Common Fund for Commodities and the other establishing the Asian Development Bank. Those agreements provide, among other things, that foreign experts and committee members be accorded exemption from Australian income tax when visiting or working in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Act now stands, there is no provision in the Fifth Schedule which would enable regulations to be made to grant income tax exemption to persons in those categories. Clause 6 of the Bill will amend the Fifth Schedule of the Act to include such a provision. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Bill is passed, regulations will be made as soon as practicable to accord this exemption. I understand from the Treasurer that exemption will be extended under present taxation policy to experts and committee members involved in the work of an organisation only if the Agreement establishing the organisation specifically permits Australia to tax Australian citizens working for that organisation, regardless of their employment status or location. This is the case with the Common Fund and the Asian Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure should not be significant in terms of revenue forgone. The exemption is likely to be available in respect of few organisations in the future and the total number of persons involved should be small. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will give effect to the Government's decision to establish the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), which the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced in his statement to the House on 20 August 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> It may assist honourable senators in their understanding of this proposal if I again briefly explain the essential background. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is one of the world's leading agricultural countries. Our agricultural production has long exceeded our own requirements and our agricultural exports have been and continue to be a major source of Australia's wealth. As a result we are perhaps a little complacent on the subject of food security. At no time since our very early history have we needed to be concerned about where our basic food supply and other agricultural products are to come from or whether we will have enough. Certainly we have had good years and bad years but these have affected only our relative wealth-not whether we will have enough to eat. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not, however, the situation in many other countries of the world. It is one of the major tragedies of our times that each year millions still die simply because they do not have enough to eat. As the Prime Minister recently mentioned at CHOGM ''lack of adequate food probably affects 250 million people in the Commonwealth and maybe 500 million worldwide''. </PARA>
<PARA> Again the Prime Minister alluded to this problem when he stated that ''world per capita food production declined in 1980 for the second year running and the carry-over of cereal stocks at the end of 1980-81 was at the lowest level for about five or six years''. </PARA>
<PARA> The international community has recognised this situation since the end of the Second World War and tried to deal with it through a number of programs. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Food Program ( both substantially supported by Australia) are visible proof of international concern. </PARA>
<PARA> More recently, in 1971, the international community established the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) which is an association of countries, international and regional organisations and private foundations dedicated to supporting a system of 13 international agricultural research centres around the world. In our region the best known of these is IRRI , the International Rice Research Institute, in the Philippines. The achievements of these centres are already very considerable, but a great deal more needs to be done by the international community to achieve food security. By food security I mean nutritionally adequate food supplies and effective food storage and distribution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Brandt Commission Report spells out the need for a continuing major effort for many years to come. The Harries Report on Australia's relations with the Third World re-emphasises this point. Commonwealth Heads of Government also identified the lack of food security as one of the major issues facing many countries of the developing world. </PARA>
<PARA> The agricultural surpluses we and other developed countries produce can never be a long-term solution to the food security problem, no matter how concessional the terms upon which food aid is provided. For developing countries to improve their situation and to produce more themselves will require the introduction or discovery of techniques and plant and animal strains which make more efficient use of available land resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, Australia is uniquely placed to assist developing countries in the area of agriculture. We are recognised as having particular expertise and experience in agricultural research and development over a wide range of climatic and environmental conditions, from dryland farming to tropical livestock and agricultural production. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1980-81 our spending under the aid program on agricultural research and related activities was estimated to have been about $12 million. This is quite significant. It was however, based to a considerable extent upon ad hoc requests for assistance from aid recipient governments. While the activities supported were each worthwhile in themselves they lacked co-ordination. The reason this was so, Mr President, is that no mechanism presently exists to foster a more systematic approach. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other factors that inhibit the most effective application of Australian expertise to the agricultural problems of developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The lack of an effective mechanism within Australia for systematically identifying the agricultural problems of developing countries, including the identification of those areas of research which warrant Australia's support;</PARA>
<PARA> The lack of a satisfactory mechanism for marshalling the collective expertise of bodies such as universities, State Departments of Agriculture, CSIRO and suitably competent private individuals and organisations to assist in solving the identified problems;</PARA>
<PARA> The failure of Australian laboratories to provide support for scientists engaged in agricultural research in developing countries;</PARA>
<PARA> The reluctance of the Australian research system to give proper credit to research performed in developing countries by Australian scientists, who are therefore disadvantaged compared with scientists who remain in Australia to pursue more recognised lines of research. </PARA>
<PARA> Research in industrialised countries tends to be concentrated on those agricultural commodities that are important to their own economies. Consequently , little attention is given to new ideas and techniques specifically related to agricultural production in developing countries. This is a limiting factor to increased food production in the developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA> In order to overcome these difficulties, consideration has been given to how to develop an expanded, better co-ordinated and more identifiable Australian effort , aimed at achieving nutritional self-sufficiency in developing countries. After very widespread consultation within the Australian scientific community and with other interested parties, the Government has decided to establish the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I turn now to the particular provisions of the Bill before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The functions of the Centre, as set out in Clause 5 of the Bill, are to mobilise and expand Australia's research capacity so as to assist developing countries in agriculture and related areas. The Centre will provide what is not currently available-namely a capacity to fund research by Australian persons and institutions specifically to benefit developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I should emphasise that the Centre will not itself engage in research activities. It will not attempt to emulate or duplicate the resources of existing institutions, and indeed it will be expressly debarred from becoming a research institution in its own right. It will, however, be charged with contracting research work to appropriate bodies of the kind to which I referred earlier, i.e. universities, State departments of agriculture, CSIRO and suitably competent private individuals and organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will note that the Bill does not attempt to define the term 'agriculture' for the purposes of the legislation, but instead indicates that the term will be specified by regulation. I should state, therefore, the Government's view on this point. In short, the Government sees no activity that has as its objective the production of a commodity that grows on or depends upon the land, or lives in or depends upon the water, as being excluded from the Centre's possible attention. The regulations will therefore define the term in the broadest possible way and will not confine the Centre to that discipline we know as 'agriculture' to differentiate it from other forms of land use. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor will the Centre's activities be confined to arranging research to be undertaken solely by Australian persons or institutions (although all the research contracts it enters into will be with Australian persons or institutions). A key element of the research programs the Centre commissions will be the involvement in them of developing country scientists and institutions. Collaborative arrangements of this kind will be fundamental to the success of the work commissioned by the Centre. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no reference in the functions of the Centre to a responsibility to arrange training. This is no oversight. Clearly the training of agricultural research scientists from developing countries is of basic importance to the development of their own indigenous research capacity. Provision already exists, however, within the development training programs conducted by the Australian Development Assistance Bureau (ADAB) for Australia to provide assistance with the formal academic training of scientists from developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Centre will have no responsibility for extension programs through which the results of its research could be applied in the field. Again, Mr President, this is no oversight. Extension activities normally require the commitment of significant resources and often the active involvement of the host government. While the Centre will be able to develop and promote close contacts with and between research institutes, it is not appropriate that it deal directly with foreign governments. The Australian Development Assistance Bureau is an agency which has precisely this mandate on behalf of Australia, and it is that agency which should pursue the matter of extension programs in the context of the aid program for which it is responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Centre's activities will result in the need for projects to implement research findings in the field. Accordingly there will need to be close liaison between the Centre and the Bureau to enable such projects to be developed and funded. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been provided for formally by the inclusion of the Director of ADAB on both the Policy Advisory Council and the Board of Management of the Centre in an ex officio capacity. In addition, the Centre is expected to be located close to the Bureau and its support services will be provided, in common with those of the Bureau, by the appropriate areas of the Department of Foreign Affairs. This will ensure adequate communication between the two organisations so that the successful results of the Centre's activities are backed up where necessary by appropriate extension programs. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the staffing of the Centre. ACIAR's administrative expenses will be kept to a minimum. As already explained all research work will be contracted out. However, the Centre will require the capacity to identify needs and priorities for agricultural research in developing countries, prepare briefs and commission contracts for research and to monitor critically progress of the research and the contracts under which it is conducted. I envisage that the Centre will eventually need a staff of about ten. Although they will be employed under the Public Service Act, they may be recruited from outside the Commonwealth Public Service while remaining fully within the Centre's own control. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly the operation of the Centre, working under the constraints of the long term nature of agricultural research and the long lead time required to obtain results, calls for flexibility, stability in funding arrangements and, above all , staff of such stature as to command respect among scientists in Australia and in developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The chief executive officer of the Centre-its Director-will be critical to its success and will need to be a person of outstanding ability, recognised for his professional and managerial capacities. </PARA>
<PARA> In the consultations we have had that have led to the establishment of the Centre, a consistent and strongly expressed preference by the Australian scientific community has emerged for the Centre to be a small statutory body. The success of ACIAR will depend on the enthusiastic co-operation of the scientific community and this will be assured with a statutory body with firm funding commitments. ACIAR will be responsible to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has, of course, in reaching this decision recognised the potential for statutory authorities, once established, to lead a life of their own and to continue after the need for them has disappeared. The Government has guarded against this eventuality in three ways. First, the Centre's internal administration will be managed through the Department of Foreign Affairs. This means that a close, direct and continuous oversight will be maintained on resources required to administer the Centre. Second, the Centre is to have a finite life of twelve years. Clauses 43 and 44 require that the Centre should cease to operate after that period unless amending legislation is introduced by the Government, i.e. a so called ''sunset provision''. In order that the Government can reach a decision in this matter, it is proposed that the need for the Centre as well as its operations and effectiveness be reviewed in the tenth year. The review should be completed in sufficient time to enable a copy of the report of the review to be tabled before the expiration of the period of twelve years. Third, the funds of the Centre will be handled through a Trust Fund within the public account and under the provisions of the Audit Act. </PARA>
<PARA> These elements of the legislation, together with the more normal controls requiring the Centre to submit annual reports, estimates of expenditure, financial statements, annual Parliamentary appropriation of funds and Ministerial power of direction, will ensure that the Centre functions in accordance with the Government's objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Centre will have a Policy Advisory Council that will be representative of developed and developing country expertise. The Council will be so constituted as to ensure Australian control but at the same time provide developing countries with a real opportunity to influence the Centre's activities. This is an innovation of great importance which has already attracted favourable international comment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council will meet at least once a year and members will be selected on the basis of the contribution individual members will be able to make to the work of the Centre and to provide a balance between disciplines and skills. The term of office will be up to three years. Membership will be rotated to bring in fresh skills and expertise and to ensure the continuing relevance of the Council to the changing needs of developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council will consist of 17 Ministerially appointed members, One of whom will be its President, as well as the Directors of the Centre itself and ADAB in their official capacities. While in a minority, a substantial number will be representative of developing countries or other overseas research institutions. The majority of Council members will thus be representative of Australian institutions and organisations, in particular the Universities, State Departments of Agriculture and the CSIRO. My colleagues, the Ministers for Primary Industry and Science and Technology, will each nominate one member of the Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The composition of the Policy Advisory Council reflects Australia's determination to direct the Centre's attention specifically and directly to the needs of developing countries. The Centre will not become a means of supplementing the funding of Australian institutions engaged on agricultural research related to Australia's problems. Other avenues for funding this already exist. </PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of the importance of the Centre's role, the Government has decided to establish an interim council pending passage of the legislation that will formally establish the Centre. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is grateful to Sir John Crawford for agreeing to chair the Interim Council and to the other members, whose appointment he announced on 6 October, for agreeing to serve on it. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the Policy Advisory Council, the Bill provides for the establishment of a Board of Management which will be responsible to the Minister for the conduct of the affairs of the Centre. It is proposed that the Board should consist of the President of the Council, the Directors of ACIAR and ADAB, all ex officio, and three other members appointed by the Governor-General from among the members of the Council. One of these the Governor-General will appoint as Chairman. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, ACIAR will benefit both giver and receiver. While its primary purpose is to assist developing countries, Australia too will gain in the following ways: enhance contact between our agricultural scientists and their overseas colleagues; the increased information Australia will have at its disposal on the agricultural problems of developing countries; by strengthening the links between Australian and overseas scientists and institutions; and finally some of the solutions the research sponsored by the Centre produces, will be of direct and practical benefit to Australia even though that may not have been the original intention. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Government believes that ACIAR represents an important new element in our assistance to developing countries. It is already being seen internationally as a practical demonstration of Australia's concern for and commitment to one of the major objectives of the North-South dialogue-the achievement by developing countries of greater self-reliance in agricultural production and increased food security. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to provide an underwriting arrangement to support, if necessary, returns to producers of Dried Sultana Grapes in the 1982 to 1986 seasons inclusive. The arrangement is acceptable to the Dried Vine Fruits industry. At the Industry's request, it is to apply only to sultanas, which account for about 85 per cent of the production of Dried Vine Fruits. </PARA>
<PARA> A Stabilization Scheme for Dried Vine Fruits has been in existence for most seasons since 1964. The latest arrangement, which applied to dried sultanas of the 1978 to 1980 seasons, was terminated at industry request late in 1980 when it became evident that very favourable export prices in those seasons had made Government support unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Export prices for Dried Vine Fruits are highly volatile, and respond to variations in supplies from the main exporting countries. A major crop failure, as in the United States of America in 1978, can trigger off large rises in world prices. On the other hand, abundant supplies can develop quickly, leading to keen price competition. World production in 1980-81 was relatively high and further big crops in 1981-82 in several major producing countries of the northern hemisphere have brought a sharp reduction in world prices. </PARA>
<PARA> Export returns in the next several seasons may therefore be below levels in recent years, although it is difficult to forecast the extent and duration of such a situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The domestic market absorbs about one third of our production of dried sultanas . While, in future, sales and prices on this market should be maintained, the possibility of import competition is likely to ensure that any rise in home market prices will be moderate. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry and the Government are however concerned that the income position of Australian producers could be vulnerable, if an abrupt worsening of conditions on world markets should occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has therefore decided to implement an underwriting arrangement to provide a measure of security for producers against sudden, large falls in world prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The arrangement, which the Government has prepared after full consultation with the industry, will afford security for producers but will not insulate them from market price signals, which might be indicating that fundamental changes should be made to the structure of production and trade. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry has given the Government an undertaking that it will not seek, during the life of the arrangement, any increase in the import tariff on sultanas. </PARA>
<PARA> The underwriting arrangement is based on the Government guarenteeing minimum returns per tonne from production in the 1982, 1983 and 1984 seasons equal to 90 per cent of the average of net returns per tonne to packers in the preceding two seasons and the estimated net return for the current season. In 1985 and 1986 seasons, the guaranteed minimum return will be 95 per cent of the three year average net return. </PARA>
<PARA> If the net return for a season is less than the guaranteed level, an underwriting payment, equal to the difference, would be made in respect to the total production in that season. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision for the guaranteed minimum return to be set at 90 per cent in the first three seasons reflects the very high export prices which the industry has enjoyed in recent seasons. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the determination of the three year average return requires an estimate to be made of the average return for the current season. This is to be determined by the Minister for Primary Industry after consideration of advice and information provided by the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. </PARA>
<PARA> The Administration of the underwriting arrangement is to be vested in the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation. In this regard the Bill provides that the Corporation shall comply with any direction the Minister might give it in relation to the exercise of its existing powers under the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation Act 1978 concerning the determination of prices below which sultanas may not be exported. </PARA>
<PARA> The underwriting arrangement embodied in this Bill is similiar to systems which the Government has introduced for the wheat, dairy and apple and pear industries . It is consistent with the export pricing policies which the Government has developed for those industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I wish to speak on the first reading of the Sales Tax Amendment Bills. A major livestock industry problem to which scientific research has failed to produce a complete solution is cattle tick infestation. The damage wreaked upon the cattle industry by tick is well documented. Reproductive performance and growth rates are very seriously inhibited and with severe infestations mortality rates can be high, especially in young animals. An Australian Institute of Agricultural Science report of 1979 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Parasites--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, parasites of cattle-</PARA>
<PARA> cause serious economic losses, the most serious is the cattle tick. </PARA>
<PARA>Eradication of this parasite is technically feasible in individual herds but only if repeated and completely clean musters can be achieved. Even where that feat is feasible it is a laborious and costly process for cattle producers. The law in New South Wales, for example, requires the owner of an infected herd to dip the entire herd, under supervision, every three weeks for a period of nine months. Moreover, all properties immediately adjoining the infected property must go through the same procedures even though no ticks have been detected. The cheapest and most effective means of avoiding that costly and uncertain eradication program is to quarantine areas known to be infected. This entails restrictions not only on the movement of live animals but also on fodder, fittings and animal products. </PARA>
<PARA> The movement of fodder from Queensland into New South Wales is prohibited unless the fodder has been fumigated. One would expect a grazier and a senior Country Party Minister, especially one who had been a Minister for Primary Industry, to be more than usually aware of the need to protect clean areas and to be zealous in observing quarantine regulations. Regrettably, that is not the case. In August of last year or thereabouts unfumigated hay was purchased in Queensland and taken against the law from Queensland into New South Wales and delivered to Glenclair, the property of Communications Minister Ian Sinclair. Mr Sinclair would have us believe that he was an innocent bystander to these events , the blameless victim yet again of circumstances beyond his control, of the perfidy of others. However, yet again he has been the financial beneficiary of the very perfidy he purports to deplore. I am not suggesting that the Minister was actually driving the truck. I am stating that it was his hay, his cheap Queensland hay, hay destined for his farm, which was loaded on the truck. Ian Sinclair was not technically responsible for evading the tick controls but there is no doubt that his hay, bought in Queensland presumably to cut costs on his farm, did by-pass the tick gates and thus put at risk of infection the New England cattle industry. I understand that the same hay found its way also onto the properties of several of his neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA> When the presence of the illegal hay became known to the authorities all the properties, that is, those of the Minister and his neighbours were placed under quarantine. Livestock on them were inspected periodically by New South Wales government officers. I understand that the quarantine has recently been lifted. No prosecution has been instigated, even though the Minister would have us believe it is an open and shut case against a careless truck driver who brought the offending hay unsolicited onto the Sinclair farm. It is a wonder that he does not claim that George Sinclair ordered the hay. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of course knows that Ian Sinclair was the completely innocent victim of his evil old father's larceny, a penalty, in the Prime Minister's judgment, not mitigated at all by Ian Sinclair's being the recipient of the stolen $400,000-odd that wicked old George had taken from the Walshes. Knowing how Ian had been disadvantaged by his father's embezzlement the Prime Minister decided that it was only fair that Ian be allowed to maintain the family company in a solvent state by keeping the stolen money for an extended period. For that reason, supplemented by the fact that Ian Sinclair had agreed to repay the stolen money-eventually-the Prime Minister on 19 August 1980 reinstated him as the fourth most senior Minister in the Fraser Government. Among other things the $100,000 repayment due on 1 February this year under the deed of covenant detailing repayment terms no doubt imposed stringent economy on the Sinclair farm managerial policy and its decision to purchase cheap hay which was illegally transported from Queensland to New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> For a man as experienced as the Minister for Communications in both business and public administration Ian Sinclair has had a surprising number of accident- prone or delinquent subordinates. Pre-eminent among these was, of course, Tony Webster, at the Australian Dairy Corporation. Now we have this anonymous truck driver. Both were set up to take the rap in the now familiar Sinclair style reversal of the Westminster system-if anything goes wrong, or perhaps more accurately, if one gets caught, blame it on a subordinate. Ian Sinclair has now become almost a professional victim of circumstance. Poor Ian Sinclair was, of course, the victim of circumstances when, as Minister for Primary Industry, he presided over the Australian Dairy Corporation's record breaking run in 1976 with respect to General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. On that occasion, he would have us believe, he was a victim of the perfidy of the Dairy Corporation's management which had concealed from him the continuing breach. The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations chose unanimously not to believe that version of events-a conclusion vindicated by the telex from Jack McGuire, tabled in the House of Representatives on 18 November last year ironically by Mr Sinclair himself. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, of course, well known that Ian Sinclair has little knowledge of or interest in financial transactions associated with his family companies and farming business. Indeed, Judge Staunton found to that effect. But on his own authority we know that he maintains a keen interest in the farm's physical operations. For example, he is quoted in the Land of 14 January as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> But I still like to be involved in all the major stock decisions. I'm there at the weekend and I try to have a look at the stock. I sign cheques and give orders and ask why last week's orders weren't carried out. Occasionally I participate in calf-marking or hay-making or something like that, but really my actual physical time on the farm is getting less and less. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Fraser, Mr Anthony, Mr Nixon and the Country Party in general trenchantly asserted, in spite of the evidence of Mr Webster and the conclusions of the Senate Committee, confirmed later by Mr McGuire, that Mr Sinclair did not know what was going on in the Dairy Corporation in 1976. Surely none of them would dispute Mr Sinclair's own assertion that he does know what is going on on his farm. </PARA>
<PARA> It is well known that I am no admirer of the Country Party, much less of its senior Ministers. I am appalled that its deputy leader, for the sake of a bit of cheap hay, would risk thrusting a crippling burden on the cattle industry of northern New South Wales. The cattle industry has suffered enough from Country Party indifference and incompetence. It should not be exposed to biological sabotage instigated by that party's deputy leader. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address myself, unusually I suppose, to the actual substantive matter of the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) 1981 [No. 2] (1982). I am very keen to pick up this debate as I have not had an opportunity in earlier discussions in the Senate with regard to the sales tax legislation to do so. It is something on which I have a very personal understanding, a very strong feeling, about the kinds of developments which this Government has been trying to achieve with its policy towards extending the range of sales tax. It is pretty clear that in this country there has been a great deal of criticism over the years of the form of direct taxation as it is imposed on individuals in this country. The income tax complaints, the constant calls for tax cuts, are well known and well understood by members of this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has become increasingly clear that the potential for substantially cutting the amounts of income tax which are imposed on individuals in the community would rely very greatly upon the Government's being able to extend the range of taxes by perhaps, a consumption tax on goods themselves being taxed rather than having people taxed at the source of their incomes. Of course, we know substantially the difficulties with people who are on the pay-as-you-earn taxation system by which dollars are taken from their pockets before they actually receive them. Of course, that finds its way into the hands of the Government. With an alternative system where a tax is imposed upon consumption and goods purchased, individuals with adequate cash in their hands coming from higher net income have a potential to decide upon the categories of goods which they would like to buy. In that way they make individual decisions about the goods that they buy. Consequently, this leads to a freedom of treatment of their own incomes rather than what occurs when we leave those kinds of decisions in the hands of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This underlying proposition is the fundamental one in terms of the Government's decision in the Budget of 1981 to extend sales tax to a broader range of goods than had previously applied. Clearly, it was the Government's intention to increase the tax base to ensure a greater flow of revenue not necessarily in the first year but certainly in the future when one could consider changes in the tax mix generally in such a way as to look forward to reductions in income tax. We face a situation-it has been debated in this place and in the House of Representatives for the last three or four months-in which the passage of these Bills is being obstructed by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. Many justifications for this obstruction-most of them spurious-have been put up by the Opposition and particularly by the Democrats. I shall come to those matters in a few moments but I think it is worth first noting Senator Chipp's statement last week making it clear that the Democrats in this place would be opposing passage of this legislation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I say frankly that our--</PARA>
<PARA>I take it that he meant the Democrats as a whole-</PARA>
<PARA>undertaking to ultimately allow these Bills to pass was-in the light of subsequent events-an error of judgment. </PARA>
<PARA>I can only agree with Senator Chipp and his four colleagues that they have made two very fundamental errors of judgment-firstly, of course, in putting forward their spurious economic arguments and, secondly, in their intention to pick up the most cynical political act that could possibly have been perpetrated in this place. Let us examine first of all some of the so-called effects of the imposition of sales tax which I take it the Democrats and the Opposition claim are at the base of their decision. Let us consider the so-called effect upon inflation. Quite a deal has been made out of a study conducted by one Mr Warren in connection with the effects of indirect taxes upon the rate of inflation and in connection with the regressive aspects of this form of taxation. Mr Warren carefully qualified many of the implications that were stipulated in his report but, true to form, the Opposition has ignored those qualifications. The fact is that the effect on the consumer price index of additional sales tax is a one-off effect and need not be built into the future structure of wage developments and the rate at which inflation grows. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the situation which has existed over the last few years. We have seen indirect taxation rises in some years of as much as 10 per cent; yet in the last few years we have seen the rate of inflation actually decline. This year we see that the increase in indirect taxation across the board-that is, in all categories-and including the estimates of taxation to be received from this form of sales tax, is of the order of 3.7 per cent. So the claim that this form of tax would be inflationary flies in the face of the evidence that increases in indirect taxes in previous years were accompanied by a rate of inflation which showed a decline. Can the Opposition or the Democrats prove substantially that this form of tax leads automatically to an increase in inflation? Clearly, they have not presented any evidence to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer also to the fact that quite often members of trade unions and the Australian Council of Trade Unions claim that direct taxation is a direct cause for people to seek higher wage settlement than they would otherwise seek. Does that mean that direct taxation in that sense is not inflationary? Obviously, if it is going to push up the costs of labour for manufacturers and employers in the country, that direct tax element must amount to some inflation. Does that mean that in any real sense there is a difference between direct taxes and indirect taxes in their inflationary effect? I can only point out that the evidence is that the additional indirect taxes which have been imposed have not substantially increased the rate of inflation in the last few years although, clearly, substantial problems have arisen as a result of increased wage pressures in the community, which pressures constitute one of the areas of greatest concern at present. </PARA>

During the period of government of Senator Child's party one of the most infamous taxation rip-offs of all time- namely, the Curran scheme-got its birth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it was of the order of 18 months. A point that Senator Childs has overlooked is that tax avoidance can in some ways be better controlled by imposing taxes on consumption and through the forms of indirect taxes that we have at hand. That is because people will find it more difficult to avoid payments of taxation when consumption is taxed. That is not necessarily a categorical statement; I believe that there are still ways in which one can avoid paying tax. It has been proven in the United Kingdom with the value added tax system that people can still substantially avoid taxation. Nevertheless these forms of taxation reduce the opportunities for tax avoidance and, I believe, help substantially in reducing tax evasion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am very thankful for your indulgence on this matter. I know that it is unusual but it is something that I have the opportunity to do for the first time. I wish to make a few points about the arguments which have been raised in connection with the so- called regressive effects of this form of taxation. Clearly, the rate of tax which is sought to be applied to some new ranges of goods, particularly to clothing, is a very small rate; that is, 2.5 per cent. Clearly, that is not a very high rate. In fact, by international standards, on some of the items it is very low. From my understanding, the value added tax in the United Kingdom is imposed at the rate of 15 per cent on the same classes of goods. Indeed, in France the tax applied to clothing and goods of that kind is of the order of 7 1 /2 per cent. So on an international comparison Australia is fairly cheaply rated .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On other classes of goods of a slightly more luxurious nature-if I may use that term-tax is to be applied at the rate of 17 1/2 per cent. They would include motor vehicles, computers and office furniture. A third scale of rates is to be applied to areas where there is perhaps the highest degree of luxury. That rate is to be 30 per cent and will apply to cameras, watches, television sets and record playing equipment. Surely people could not say that those items were necessities of life. Yet we find that the Opposition and the Democrats are opposing this legislation across the board on the basis of those items being basic necessities of life. I am sure that I could argue quite successfully in this forum or any other that hi-fi equipment, jewellery or television sets do not come into the category of basic necessities of life, as is claimed by the Opposition and the Democrats. I guess that that is just one of the major inconsistencies displayed by speakers from the Opposition side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that more significantly, because of the rating structure, because the rates range from 5 per cent on such things as clothing up to 30 per cent on items which might be called non-essential, there is a progressive impact on the taxpayer in a way which I am sure the Opposition would agree with were it thinking straight on this issue. A flat rate of tax is not being applied to all goods; a progressive rate is being applied. So, it can be firmly argued that those who can afford to pay the most do pay the most and those who can afford to pay the least are not forced to pay the most. That very significant point appears to be overlooked in the arguments that have been discussed in this place and in the media generally. One does not have to take my argument on this. Several studies have been conducted on this matter. Recently an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development study indicated that general consumption taxes in the countries of the OECD are not regressive because the same kinds of luxury goods are taxed at higher rates. Of course, this impacts most on those in the highest income categories. In some countries, as in Australia, food-that basic essential of life-is not taxed at all. So, for us to make out arguments on that spurious point is merely to hoodwink the Australian people as to the actual effects of the proposed legislation. It seems as though the Opposition and the Australian Democrats are determined to confuse the public on these issues and not give them an opportunity to think through all the issues themselves in such a way as to understand clearly what the Government is on about with this form of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators should also consider some of the other effects of not undertaking the kind of decision which this legislation contemplates. Very largely, the Government is seeking, through this legislation, to meet its Budget deficit, which is an item for which the Opposition and the Democrats seem to have very little regard. They have little regard for the argument that the greater the deficit the more likely an upward impact on interest rates and a higher rate of inflation. Those two matters are inextricably interlocked. If this legislation is not passed we will suffer a further blow-out in the deficit which will have to be financed from the general community by people who lend their savings to building societies, to finance companies or to banks. The community can use those funds for the purchase of goods and houses. If the funds are not used for that purpose, they will be used by this Government to finance its day-to-day operations. This will mean that the Government will need to go into the money markets and compete against the financial institutions in this country to gain funds to meet its own deficit. That would have an obvious upward impact on interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> So, if this taxation measure is not implemented it follows that not only is it likely to lead to greater rates of inflation but clearly it will also lead to higher interest rates through the impact in the money markets. From that point of view the Government has a very clear obligation-if it has an interest in keeping interest rates low in this community-to go ahead with the kind of Budget that was set out in August; that is, we should go for a Budget surplus in the domestic area to ensure that we have as neutral an effect as possible upon interest rates. We must ensure that we succeed in keeping interest rates at a low level throughout the next year or so. One would think that the Opposition and the Democrats were intent upon seeing higher interest rates in this community and clearly frustrating the Government's program in order to see that come about. One does not need too much imagination to realise what a cynical act that would be and the hardship it would create for individuals in this community . </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to a few other issues which have surrounded this issue in the last three or four months. We have to consider some of the statements made earlier by individuals in this place and in other places about the nature of the political consequences of the sorts of decisions that they now appear to be about to force upon the Senate. We know the fundamental constitutional issues that are involved . Quite clearly Senator Evans, who is in the chamber at the moment, can speak on this matter with far greater understanding and knowledge than I can. I can only repeat what he says. Clearly in the past he has been one of those who have said that this Senate has no right to restrict the passage of money Bills in this place. One can understand that kind of statement coming from a man of such integrity as Senator Evans and no doubt it is something that he would or should stand by. In fact, we find that he is changing his mind about this matter. I quote from a speech that he made to the National Conference of Labor Lawyers on 3 July last year. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the fact that constitutional and democratic principles were torn up in 1975 is no excuse for anyone doing it again. While there is a great deal to be said, tactically, for never ruling out completely any option, I believe that our credibility-</PARA>
<PARA>Meaning his-</PARA>
<PARA>and self-respect as a movement depends on us-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Senator Evans and the Labor Party-</PARA>
<PARA>being more principled than our opponents, and that we would sadly demean both ourselves and our cause were we ever to descend to the Tories' level. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are fine words, Senator Evans, but where is the meaning of them today? We know that he is committed by his party to vote against this legislation. We should not criticise him too much for that act because it is a direct result of the imposition of a Caucus decision to which all Labor members need to subscribe , or immediately resign from their party. Individuals, whatever their personal views and integrity, are bound by that decision of the Labor Caucus. Whether it is made in this House or the other House does not matter in terms of their personal judgment and integrity. They are forced by that decision to maintain and uphold that principle. Notwithstanding that Senator Evans, through some form of sophistry, might be able to justify his own stance, I would like him to justify that of his party on this issue and to demonstrate to us on this side of the chamber how he might justify his recent decision to oppose his most deeply- held views upon this very important and constitutional issue. It is important to note that Senator Evans has spoken on this issue in many forums in the past; in fact he probably made his name throughout Australia with regard to this issue following the great events of 1975. However, he now sees himself in a situation in which he is bound to support the Labor Caucus, no matter what his individual views are. I hope that when this vote finally occurs, later this evening or tomorrow, we will see Senator Evans on this side of the Senate defending the principles which he holds so deeply and with such great integrity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I guess we could find a place for Senator Evans somewhere over here. I turn now to some of those wonderfully chiselled-in-stone remarks in relation to this matter that came from the Democrats some six or eight months ago at the time of the presentation of the Budget. Let us recall, for instance, the sorts of remarks that were made by Senator Macklin in a famous article that he wrote for the Courier-Mail in Brisbane on 2 September 1981. In part he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The widespread criticism with which the sales tax gifts were greeted put us in a postion to gain much electoral popularity by heading them off . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Irrespective of the potential electoral backlash to the Democrats, we will not follow the Liberal and Labor parties in breaking election pledges. We could hardly claim to keep either of the old parties honest unless we are honest ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then we have seen Senator Macklin, along with his four colleagues, change his mind dramatically on this issue. They say that they will not support their former stand. The question of honesty does not appear to come into this matter any more. It did at the time of the presentation of the Budget, but it no longer does. Now the Democrats are out for electoral gain. They said they were prepared , for the sake of honesty, to suffer electoral unpopularity on this matter. We now find that they are not prepared to do so any longer-in fact, they will prove that they are dishonest. These sorts of remarks have been sprinkled through the pages of Hansard in recent times. Further statements were made by the then Acting Leader of the Democrats, Senator Mason, on 26 August 1981, when referring to the course of opposing this kind of legislation. At page 360 of Hansard he said:</PARA>
<PARA> That course would mean that every future government would face the risk of having at least part of its financial program destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA>The sales tax legislation is a very large part of this Government's financial program for the reasons that I outlined earlier. Senator Mason continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact that governments have a mandate for their financial program. </PARA>
<PARA>He in no way made any specific qualification to that statement by saying that this Government has no mandate at all for its financial program. On that very fundamental point we find it very difficult to understand why Senator Mason now has an alternative point of view. Later in the same speech-it is recorded on page 361 of Hansard-Senator Mason said:</PARA>
<PARA> Listen to this, senators, it is my bottom line. Those on the Labor side in particular should listen to this. Undesirable though the sales tax increases are , damaging though their impact might be, the consequences of the Senate meddling in or unilaterally rewriting a Budget seems to us too horrifying to contemplate.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, Senator Mason now finds adequate reason to deny that point of view which was expressed with such vehemence and sincerity at the time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an interesting form of logic when one can turn it on its head so quickly. Consequently, I find that statement, in conjunction with several statements that have emanated from the other side, very confusing. I believe that the electors of this country find it extremely difficult to understand the reasoning behind the Democrats' proposals. One can only assume that there is a particular reason. I guess that Senator Macklin has found it because, as I said earlier, in his letter to the Courier-Mail he managed to say that, irrespective of the potential electoral backlash, he would not follow the Liberal and Labor parties in breaking election pledges. I remind the Senate that the Democrats' statements were supported by statutory declarations which we understand were sworn by each Democrat senator at the time of the election in 1980. We believe that they must have solemnly and sincerely held the views that they put down at that stage. However, they now find that electoral considerations are of greater concern to them than the fundamental issues which they said they were espousing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I again draw the Senate's attention to the later statement made by Senator Chipp last week, when he claimed that his party had made an error of judgment in relation to these Bills. I believe it is patently clear for other reasons that they have misjudged the economic impacts of the Bills. They have misjudged the actual impacts of taxation on the community. They have not bothered to seek the truth. They have taken the easy line of supporting the so-called political concerns on these Bills which have been built up by pressure groups and other groups within the community. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have indeed. The honourable senator is having a counselling centre in Darwin. On the PM radio program on 19 August 1981, Senator Chipp suggested that if it were at all possible for the Senate to amend the sales tax Bills in such a way that the total amount going to Consolidated Revenue would not be diminished but so that in levying the taxes those at the lower end would pay less and those at the higher end would pay more the Democrats would certainly consider such an option. The point I want to make is quite clear. If there was ever any error of judgment on the part of Senator Chipp and his Democrat friends, it was in that area. As I have pointed out previously, the system which is to be implemented as a result of the passage of this legislation is not regressive in its effects upon the taxpayer. It is substantially progressive. It imposes only the smallest rates of tax on those goods which will be consumed by those at the lower end of the income scales. It imposes the highest rates of tax on those classes of goods which will be used and consumed by those in the upper reaches of the income scales. In other words, substantially this legislation does the things to which Senator Chipp made specific reference on 19 August 1981. Yet he sees reason now to refuse to accept that line and to deny that that is the impact of the Bills. His attitude is not only an error of judgment upon the way in which the community might react to this legislation but also it is an error of judgment upon the facts. It is for that reason that he stands most condemned in this place. He is not prepared to consider the proper impacts of these decisions and the way in which they impact upon the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly, if Senator Chipp wants to change his mind he has a perfect out. As I have argued, the system is not regressive; it is progressive. Senator Chipp said on 19 August that if it could be demonstrated that that would be the effect of the system he would support it. I invite him to support it on those grounds and consequently to vote with the Government in support of the legislation later. The fundamental errors of judgment which Senator Chipp has made will come home to roost in one form or another in future. It is those things by which he will be judged in terms of the proper performance of his party in this chamber. It will be regretted if the Democrats and Senator Chipp remain in their present frame of mind. We hope that, given their predeliction for changing their minds, they will see reason to do so along the lines that I have outlined. Other errors of judgment may have been made by Senator Chipp and the Democrats which they have not spelled out very clearly. One can only attribute the most base electoral hypocrisy to the decision not to support this legislation which they announced in public last week. </PARA>

Although, of course, there is a threshold question as to whether anything that Senator Messner might say would be taken seriously enough by anybody to justify a response being given, I do find offensive the repetition by him today of the canard that I, somehow, in my support for the Australian Labor Party's opposition to these sales tax Bills have been caught in an inconsistency of a fairly spectacular kind between my principled pronouncements in 1975 and much more recently. I point out to the Senate that, clearly, Senator Messner must be a man of either limited memory or even smaller attention span-or both- because there have been at least three occasions on which I have risen in my place in this Senate to answer canards of just that kind.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mine are worth preserving. I do, in fact, keep them in a drawer here for occasions such as this. I can well understand Senator Walters having some diffidence about ever having occasion to refer to her contributions on future occasions. The point that is being made, of course, is that the relevant distinction is not between money Bills on the one hand and non-money Bills on the other hand or between Budget and non-Budget Bills. The relevant, principal distinction which sustained the Labor Party in 1975 and has sustained it subsequently is between those Bills which are crucial to the survival of a government, its continuance in office, and those which are not. It is exactly that distinction which I have espoused. I suggest to the chamber that that does not savour of sophistry in any way at all. I appreciate that it is a distinction which is not capable of being well understood by a number of honourable members of this House, including Senator Messner. I also appreciate-I finish on this point-that it is a distinction which may not be capable of being appreciated by my colleagues, the Australian Democrats, who have been writhing in what they perceive to be a dilemma between constitutional purity on the one hand and crude opportunistic expediency on the other hand. That is not a dilemma which we in the Labor Party feel. We believe that it is possible to maintain constitutional purity of a very high order indeed by drawing the distinction which I have just made and which we have made throughout our contributions to this debate. I have made this distinction on all the occasions in the past. Accordingly, I hope that Senator Messner will be gentleman enough to acknowledge the point and not to repeat it tiresomely in the future. Those remarks apply also to his fellows.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will come as no surprise to members of the Senate that I will take this opportunity on the first reading of the Sales Tax Amendment Bills not to speak on the subject matter of the Bills, unlike the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Messner. I take this opportunity to make some comments on the situation in the Middle East at the moment. I have just returned from a visit to the Middle East. I went firstly as part of a parliamentary delegation and, secondly, as part of an Australian Labor Party delegation-with two of my colleagues from the House of Representatives, Mr Beazley and Mr Holding. We are the Labor Party's members of the Middle East Sub- committee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. We visited nine countries in the Middle East: Iraq, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Syria, Jordan, Israel and Egypt. It was a unique opportunity to see, at first hand, the situation in the area and to talk to officials, ministers, rulers, members of the royal families, military officials and Australian foreign affairs officials serving in the region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make this speech at this time because I think the situation in the Middle East is particularly fluid at the moment. One has only to look at the newspaper reports of the weekend. One article that comes to mind stated that the Middle East lives up to its reputation for intrigue. 'Arafat and one damaged Boeing' was the heading of one article. Another article was headed 'Huge Car Bomb used in Syrian suicide attack'. I think these are examples of some of the things that are happening in the Middle East at the moment. At this stage I do not want to talk about the report of the parliamentary delegation or any recommendations that we might make in that report. I am not trying to pre-empt that debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I place on record the two main impressions that I received in the region. The first was an optimistic impression that in the long term prospects for peace between Israel and the Arabs are good. But I want to stress that they are good in the long term. I do not consider that there will not be difficulties in the short term. Personally, I fully support the peace settlement that came about between Egypt and Israel. I think it has been good for both countries. I think one has to be very realistic and realise that Egypt, under the new president, President Mubarak, will return to the Arab camp. I think Egypt will return to its historical position within the non-aligned movement. Only a few years ago it was threatened with expulsion from that movement. In fact, it is one of the founding members of the non-aligned movement. I think there is sufficient evidence at the moment to suggest that it is returning to its historical position. </PARA>
<PARA> I firmly believe that Egypt, under the new president, will keep the peace and that the normalisation of relations with Israel will continue. I think the importance of this is that Egypt is really the centre of the Arab world. Its population of 42 million people cannot be ignored. One example of this is that the Arab countries need Egyptian workers. Three million Egyptians work outside Egypt in the Arab world at the moment. There are Egyptian doctors, teachers, technicians and, very importantly, labourers in large numbers throughout the Arab world. the very fact that Egypt, central to the Arab world, has been able to reach a peace agreement with Israel, I believe, has changed the Middle East picture permanently. The very fact that the Fahd plan is being discussed by the Arab states, even if a number of them reject it, means the issues involved in a Middle East peace plan will continue to be debated; the plan will continue to be on the agenda when the Arab nations meet. </PARA>
<PARA> My second impression was one of pessimism. Now, more than ever, I am convinced that the Labor Party's stand on the Sinai is correct. I say that because I am very pessimistic about the continuing war that is going on between Iraq and Iran . It is the forgotten war; it is the war that is being allowed to continue; it is the war that no one can seem to stop. One Western view that has a lot of currency is that it is good for the United States, it is good for Israel and it is good for the West for this war to continue. I believe that this war contains a conflict that could engulf the Middle East and eventually pose a greater threat to world peace than the Arab-Israeli conflict. I see this conflict as a battle between the Islamic fundamentalists, whom I call 'the mediaevals', and the twentieth century Arabs. It is a war that is already spilling over the borders of Iraq and Iran. It is already ignoring the traditional left or right wing labels on the regimes in the area. It is ignoring previous loyalties to either Eastern or the Western blocs. It is slowly involving the super-powers in a conflict between the countries that have the second and third largest oil reserves in the world. I believe that should be a worry to all of us. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal, very briefly, with the two sides of the conflict. Iraq has a reputation of being a radical Arab regime. Most of its military equipment has come from the Soviet Union. In particular, its strong air force has been entirely purchased from the Soviet Union. But it is a twentieth century country. For that reason alone I support it in the present conflict. It has been looking increasingly to the West as it has attempted to modernise and, especially, as it has attemped to buy new technology. It is following the Yugoslav line in the non -aligned movement. It is opposing the view that there are natural allies of the Soviet Union in the non-aligned movement. It is important in this context because the next non-aligned movement meeting will be held later this year in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq. Iraq is being supported in the war by a number of countries. It is being supported financially, mainly by Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states. They, of course, have the reputation of being conservative regimes. I say that it is being supported financially because we heard in the Middle East that Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states have poured $US30 billion into Iraq to support it and to maintain its standard of living and to make sure that Iraq maintains its present military superiority over Iran. </PARA>
<PARA> Iraq is being supported morally by Oman, a pro-United States regime in the Arab world. It is being supported by Jordan. King Hussein of Jordan recently asked for the formation of a volunteer brigade which he is going to send to fight with Iraq in its war against Iran. It is interesting to notice that Jordan has been accused of funnelling United States weapons to Iraq at the same time as Jordan is attempting to buy a sophisticated United States missile system and F16 aircraft from the United States. Even Egypt says that it sides with Iraq in the war; if Iraq's borders are threatened it will sell arms to that country. It has been reported that the Soviet Union, which has mainly supplied Iraq in the past, is turning off the tap on replacement of military equipment. That is certainly the impression that we got when we visited Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we have to ask ourselves: Why are these countries worried and why are these countries in particular supporting Iraq? Why, for instance, is the Gulf Co -operative Council-a body I am sure we will hear a lot more of in the future- holding joint defence Ministers meetings at present? Why has Saudi Arabia agreed to build an oil pipeline across Saudi Arabia from Iraq to Yanbu to guarantee that Iraq will be able to sell its oil? The Saudi Arabians say they are supporting their Arab brothers in an historic battle against the Persians as they have done over the centuries. I think their real concern is something different. They believe the Iranian leaders are becoming the terrorists of the Gulf. They believe that the Iranian leadership at the moment is exporting its fundamentalist revolution to the Shi'ite minority populations right throughout the Arab world. </PARA>
<PARA> I think if any of us want to see an example of that we have to look only at Bahrain where recently it was proved that the attempted coup was Iranian sponsored and that the people concerned had got their weapons and training in Iran. Even on the West Bank we have a situation where some Palestinian students are following the fundamentalist line. No country at the moment is more worried than Saudi Arabia. I will return to that in a few minutes. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard an article from the Jerusalem Post of 2 February entitled 'Khomeini delivers the goods' which adds to the argument I have used. I also have a number of other articles which I will seek leave to incorporate later. They are straight newspaper articles from a number of newspapers. </PARA>

<PARA>KHOMEINI DELIVERS THE GOODS</PARA>
<PARA>Internal chaos has only served to heighten religious fervour in Iran and enhance the position of its ruler, writes MORT ROSENBLUM. </PARA>
<PARA>HAVING SEIZED the advantage against Iraqi invaders and anti-government guerrillas, Iran is now threatening Gulf oil states with new revolutionary fervour, according to Western analysts. </PARA>
<PARA> ''The Ayatollah hasn't collapsed as we expected . . . He has got it together, and his appeal to Shia nationalism is making an impact,'' a ranking U.S. official said privately in Washington. ''We're worried about it.''</PARA>
<PARA> Others in Washington and Paris, including informed Iranians, reflected the same view. </PARA>
<PARA> Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has urged repeatedly that Shi'ite Moslems revolt in states governed by Sunnis, followers of the other major branch of Islam. In the past, problems at home limited active subversion. </PARA>
<PARA> Iran's economy is in a shambles, with serious food shortages, crippled production and chaotic services. But, the analysts say, adversity has actually served to heighten religious zeal. </PARA>
<PARA> ''Khomeini never talked about giving anyone prosperity,'' observed Amir Taheri, a leading Iranian journalist, now living in Paris. ''He promised martyrdom, and he is delivering the goods.''</PARA>
<PARA> U.S. intelligence sources say Iran is smuggling arms and funds into several Gulf states, sometimes in diplomatic pouches. The sources linked Iran to a December coup attempt in Bahrain, where Sunnis rule over a large Shi'ite population. They also claim Iran is backing dissidents in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Qatar. </PARA>
<PARA>SAUDI ARABIA, a fundamentalist state with a strong Sunni leadership, is less vulnerable, the analysts say. But Saudi authorities are clearly concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef Ibn Abdel-Aziz charged last month: '' Iranian leaders have become the terrorists of the Gulf.'' He accused them of training, arming and funding dissidents throughout the region. </PARA>
<PARA> Iranian authorities have meanwhile conferred the status of ''Great Satan'' on Saudi Arabia, and some have demanded that the Saudis turn over the holy Islamic cities of Mecca and Medina to international control. </PARA>
<PARA> Saudi officials say Iranian pilgrims have beaten policemen who tried to stop them from ''gibbering loudly'' and spreading political propaganda in holy shrines. Iranians charge the Saudis with harassing Shi'ite worshippers. </PARA>
<PARA> Iran has denied any connection with the Bahrein coup attempt. But, according to Teheran newspapers, Khomeini has earmarked $18 million this year for official efforts to export the revolution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Islamic Students Organization, with branches in a number of countries, recruits militants to spread the revolutionary word. </PARA>
<PARA> Powerful radio transmitters in Iran offer a more direct appeal. They broadcast religious messages and news of the revolution throughout the region. One recently urged the Gulf states to impose an oil boycott on the U.S. and Western Europe because of their support for Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week, parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Rafsanjani said Saudi Arabia ''is the only obstacle in the way of the Moslem movement.''</PARA>
<PARA> The Iranian Government also underwrites Martyr, an Arabic-Language weekly which claims a circulation of 150,000. The latest issue carried the constitution of the Bahrain Liberation Front, a manual for making Molotov cocktails and three addresses in Iran to write to for help in designing a made-to-measure revolution . </PARA>
<PARA>IRAQ which invaded Iran 16 months ago to gain control over its only access to the Gulf-the Shatt-Al-Arab-is a diminishing counterbalance to Iran, the analysts say. </PARA>

Some of us had the opportunity of going out into the Strait of Hormuz on an Omani Navy patrol and we were told that the Iranians, only a couple of nights previously, had been able to put a destroyer and a frigate to sea. That indicates that this sophisticated equipment-at least in the navy-is capable of being used and sustaining a military conflict. I believe that at the moment Iraq is looking to settle the war. I believe it is trying to settle the war on an honourable basis. But it does suit Khomeini and others for the war to continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will now turn to Iran. The casualties of the Iranians are horrendous. The estimate is that 90,000 to 100,000 people have been killed or captured in this conflict. Admittedly Iran has a larger population than Iraq. There are disturbing reports of Khomeini's revolutionary guards armed with just a piece of paper given to them by the Mullahs, apparently to ward off bullets, being pushed into the front line against the Iraqis and then being followed up by Iranian tanks. As a matter of fact officials in Jordan called this particular piece of paper issued by the Mullahs the Iranians' transit visa to heaven. Any war in which there are 90,000 to 100,000 casualties on one side is, I believe, a war that has to be stopped. The Iranians still have sophisticated United States equipment-as I said-from the time of the Shah. They are getting increasing amounts of Soviet equipment. Any visitor to Baghdad can see examples of captured equipment. It was reported to our delegation that the Soviet Union at present has between 2,000 and 4,000 military advisers in Iran.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that the position of the Tudeh party within Iran is being strengthened because there is no real alternative for large sections of the Iranian population. A particular scenario that worries the majority of the Arab states is that following the death or overthrow of Khomeini there is the possibility of a pro-Moscow regime being installed in Tehran at the same time as they see a weakened Iraq or more radical regime taking over in Baghdad. It was continually stressed to us that the United States ought to examine more closely this scenario. Of course, it is only one of a number of scenarios that might happen when Khomeini goes but it is one raised constantly by the Gulf states. Strangely enough Iran is being supported in this war by Syria. When talking to us Baath party officials made no secret of the fact that they also aimed to bring down the current regime in Iraq. One has to question the very stability of the regime in Syria itself. The British Broadcasting Corporation reported an attempted coup in which the Air Force was going to bomb key installations in the city and two divisions of the Syrian Army-one from Aleppo and one from Lebanon-were going to rebel, bisect the city and remove Assad's regime. The Muslim Brotherhood, a banned organisation in Syria, is at this moment, with certain rebels in the Army, fighting the Syrian Army at Hamah and Aleppo. The Army is run and controlled by an Alawite minority which is being increasingly isolated in Syria. As I said the very stability of that regime has to be seriously looked at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think we have also to look at the stability of the regime in Saudi Arabia. Since the incident at the Mosque a number of people around the world have speculated as to how long the Saudi Arabian regime can last. I believe that the incident at the Mosque if not started by the Iranians was certainly under Iranian influence. Recently in newspapers in Iran, Saudi Arabia was referred to as 'Great Satan'. They are asking that the cities of Mecca and Medina be taken over by international commissions and taken out of the hands of the Saudi Arabians. I think we have to look at the situation in Saudi Arabia in the context that at the moment the Saudi Arabians are producing nine million to 10 million barrels of oil a day which is certainly helping to produce the oil glut and bring about a situation favourable to the West at the moment. The Saudi Arabians really need to produce only five million or six million barrels of oil a day. I think it is horrendous to contemplate what would happen if the regime in Saudi Arabia were to collapse suddenly. I do not think that that is about to happen despite the medieval attitudes on a lot of issues. I do not think the Saudi Arabians will make the same mistakes as the Shah of Iran. I do not think they are trying to modernise too quickly. I think the regime will last a lot longer than some people think. In the longer term everybody should question the stability of the regime and ask how long it can last. These are some aspects of the scenario in the Middle East at present. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that in the light of these scenarios we should examine Australia's involvement in the region and pose some questions that were put to members of the delegation. For example, will Israel return the Sinai by 26 April?</PARA>
<PARA> Will Israel invade Palestine Liberation Organisation strongholds in southern Lebanon before 26 April and therefore weaken Egypt's position in the Arab world? I have shown the Minister an article which backs up that statement. I seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA>The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Muffling the war drums</PARA>
<PARA>The abortive incursion by five Fatah terrorists near Mehola in the Jordan Valley last Saturday drew a furious, indeed a threatening, reaction from the Israeli side which struck many people as rather out of proportion. </PARA>
<PARA> Saturday night a press conference was hastily held on orders from Defence Minister Ariel Sharon, at which Chief-of-Staff Rafael Eitan went through the motions of playing up the incident as though it had been a major military confrontation. Sunday night Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir followed suit on television, wagging his finger at Jordan for its failure to seal off the Jordan River and, more important, charging a gross violation of the cease-fire concluded with the PLO-although ostensibly with Lebanon-last July. </PARA>
<PARA> Israel, Mr Shamir sternly warned, would take measures in the wake of this violation of the cease-fire agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> This latter argument was, however, immediately interpreted, both here and abroad, as an attempt to capitalise on the Mehola incident to justify a retaliatory attack on the terrorists in southern Lebanon. It was a questionable argument, for all the evidence tended to show that the cease-fire had been strictly limited to the Lebanese frontier. If Israel needed political cover for taking forceful military action to shatter the PLO's mounting concentration of arms across the border, it would have to find something better. </PARA>
<PARA> As the matter stood, the chances were that in such places as Washington the blame would be put squarely on Israel itself for the outbreak of any fresh hostilities. </PARA>
<PARA> But the prospect of a resumed war in the north did not cause jitters in the U.S . alone, but also among Israelis along the Lebanese frontier, who recalled their nights and days in stuffy air-raid shelters last summer. A local government leader in Upper Galilee yesterday urged the authorities to do everything within their power to maintain the calm that had prevailed in the area for the past six months. </PARA>
<PARA> Themselves finally somewhat alarmed by the sound of their war drums, the authorities started to beat a tactical retreat. 'Sources' within the government were now quoted as saying that last Saturday's incident near Mehola was not a sufficient reason for a major anti-terrorist offensive by Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> Someone had apparently lost and then recovered his good senses. But what about the next time?</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EJ4">Senator SIBRAA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Other questions which were posed to us are: Will Israel annex a portion or the whole of the West Bank? How concerned is Israel that after 26 April United States foreign policy will be more pro-Saudi Arabian? Will the United States, under the constant pressure of the Arab world, begin a dialogue with the PLO? I think we ought very seriously to look at Australian involvement in the Sinai. There is a chance of PLO incursions into the Gaza Strip using arms caches which it was reported to us are in the Sinai Desert. As I have said, all these possibilities were put seriously to the delegation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a number of clouds on the horizon. Of course the first one is the autonomy talks between Egypt and Israel, which is the next step in the so-called peace process. In my opinion, the views of both sides are irreconcilable and I do not think we will see that next step being taken in the near future. The Australian situation was quite favourable. We had a very low profile in the area . We had excellent relations with both sides. We had built up quite a large trade with the Arab nations and, of course, we had our strong traditional support of Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite evident to me and to other members of our delegation that our contribution to the Sinai has dramatically raised the Australian profile in the region. Australia will now be expected to have a view on all issues in the middle East and in future no comment will not be good enough. We will undergo a constant test of our relations with the United States, our relations with Israel , our relations with the Arabs and in particular our attitude to the PLO. It will be a constant test that need not necessarily be a bad thing but I think Australia must be prepared to stand up and be counted on a number of issues involving one of the major trouble spots of the world. </PARA>

The decision may well lead to the defeat of these Bills and consequences which, I think, are horrifying for the sustainability of democratic government in this country. Therefore I believe it is a subject which ought to be examined fully.

Surely they have been past innocence for quite a long time. At times they have shown themselves to be quite mature in their determinations on this issue.

A government with a mandate in the House of Representatives and a mandate to determine its Budgets, something to which the Democrats and others pointed, has determined that these taxes ought to be collected. I have criticised these taxes before and made representations about them. I believe that some particular parts of the tax are unwise and will not be very effective. But it is not for the Senate to determine those matters. It is a decision for a government which, of course, has its obligations to its electors. The issues will be dealt with and argued at the proper time when the Government will be judged upon the whole of its financial policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some honourable senators say there has been a change of front by the Australian Democrats. Since the Australian Democrats have been in this chamber they have promoted some excellent ideas. Many of the points which they have raised in debate about Bills and so forth are matters that very often ought to have been raised earlier. If they stuck to that positive line of action, I think there would be a future for them. But if they choose to move from their major principles, I think their future will be very short. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back to 1975, the year to which an honourable senator referred. The leader and founder of the Democrats, Senator Chipp, was a member of parliament, as I was, in 1975. Today he acknowledges that he made a mistake of judgment then. He has admitted to quite a few mistakes of judgment which the Australian Democrats have made in recent times. At that time I resisted, month after month, the very enticing idea that because a government was in trouble, as it was then, one should take the opportunity to try to throw it out. </PARA>

I stood up and opposed that idea. Where was Senator Chipp then? He was very determined. He was among the strongest advocates of throwing the rascals out. He wanted an early election. I could never get any support from Senator Chipp at that time. I looked in vain for support from him in the Party room or in the Parliament. Now Senator Chipp has recognised that he was mistaken in those days. In an interview reported in the Bulletin on 21 October 1980, Senator Chipp expressed his sense of guilt over the Vietnam issue but he felt no guilt about supporting the blocking of Supply. He went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put that down to being a bad error of judgment. . . In '75 the bloody place was in a hell of a mess. The proposition I supported was that we would go to an election and let the people decide. I didn't have the faintest idea it was going to be such a divisive and emotional issue. No member of the shadow cabinet had any idea that Kerr was going to sack Whitlam. </PARA>
<PARA>He admits that he certainly did not have the foresight then. However, following that he developed it but somehow it has disappeared in the last few weeks. Also relevant to Senator Chipp's attitude in 1975 is what he said when interviewed on 17 August 1981 by Derryn Hinch, who pointed out that Senator Chipp made much of signing affidavits. I will come to that point in a few moments. Derryn Hinch asked:</PARA>
<PARA> How did that change in your mind from when you were a member of the Government back in 1975 when you blocked Supply?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Chipp replied:</PARA>
<PARA> Because I saw what it did. It threw the country into turmoil. It divided the country. Although the Senate has that power, we opted of our own free will as Democrats, to say 'we might have that power to do it, but we believe it wrong for the Senate to do it', so we virtually abrogated that power that we have. Now if you want me to say 'I believe we were wrong in 1975', I'll say it, because that is what I believe. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators should note that he said that they abrogate that power. That was the position then. In fact at the last election when a number of Australian Democrats were elected they abrogated that power. They became neutered. They told the people: 'Trust us. We are not dangerous. We will not use this power'. Of course, now they have decided, enticed by the opportunities that they think might be before them, to leave that and to use the power. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say something about the actions of the Australian Democrats at the last election. I was very fascinated when they put down statutory declarations as to what they were going to do. Perhaps we did not read the fine print of the statutory declarations closely enough. Whenever people come to me and say, 'I will swear this on a stack of bibles', I become very suspicious of them. I wonder why they need to say that, why they cannot rely upon their general integrity and say: 'This is what we will do and this is what we will not do'. They have to go through the drama of making statutory declarations. It is worth while recalling and recording and what is in those statutory declarations. I have here the standard form of the statutory declaration which the Australian Democrats all signed. Let us see what they said. We find now that they are quoting only one part, the more extreme part which relates to the bringing down of governments. But they said more than that. I will read paragraphs 3 and 4, the relevant parts, of that statutory declaration. </PARA>

It was only those honourable senators who stood for election. That is something that we have now found out. That is something new. In the statutory declarations which at least the three new senators signed they said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That I personally subscribe to and endorse without reservation of any kind the publicly announced policy of the Australian Democrats, as stated by the Leader of the Australian Democrats, the Honourable Senator D. L. Chipp, that the Australian Democrats, if gaining a position of 'balance of power' in the Senate would not use their voting numbers in such a way as to cause the blocking of supply or money bills . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable senators to notice the play of words on those two things-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in a manner which would prevent the majority party in the House of Representatives from governing. </PARA>
<PARA>That surely is what the Democrats are doing now. They are blocking the sales tax Bills and the important parts of the Budget of the majority party in the House of Representatives. It is interesting to note that, although Senator Chipp may not have signed that declaration, the Democrats are affirming his publicly announced policy. Paragraph 4 of the statutory declaration, the paragraph more quoted by Senator Chipp these days, is a little more extreme. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> That for all purposes and with no reservation of any kind, I hereby declare that if elected to the Senate I shall not cast my vote as a Senator in a manner which would be contrary to the policy of the Australian Democrats as stated in Paragraph 3 hereof and thus shall never during my tenure as a Senator contribute to or cause a situation which through blocking of supply or money bills might bring down the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The words 'bring down the Government' are stronger. That is the paragraph that the Democrats tend to quote now, having had a change of mind. But both of those things are in the statutory declaration and at least they are bound by them. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been told time and again about 'keeping the bastards honest' and what must be done to 'keep governments in control' and so forth. Nowhere have we been told how we are to keep the Democrats honest. People voted for them on the basis of principles. I suggest that of the 10 per cent or so of the public in Australia who brought those people into office, most were concerned that they would not be likely to bring down governments, that they would act honestly in this regard, and that they would be consistent. If they fail in that what is the basis of their support? In regard to this matter it is interesting to note that Senator Chipp said this in his policy speech at the time of his election:</PARA>
<PARA> Can you be sure your Members of Parliament will keep their word? If not, what can you do about them until the next election? You can keep them honest by giving the Democrats the balance of power in the Senate . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, now we see what that really involves us in. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish now to deal with the position in August or September 1981. Let us come to the better period, the high point of Democrat principle when they were saying things and determining their action on these sales tax Bills for the first time. They, like a horse, ran to jump the fence that the sales tax imposed. At the first running they bolted and went back again. They did not jump the fence. They did not jump into the fence either. They put it off for a period. Now, of course , they have jumped and they have fallen into the fence. In August they were being berated by the Australian Labor Party. Honourable senators will remember that the Labor Party had just developed a new philosophy; that one could just take some money Bills and supply Bills and that, provided they were not important enough to really disturb the government and knock it down it was all right. This is known in China as 'death by a thousand cuts'. One can cut off a limb or a bit here or there and so forth. Ultimately the victim dies but I suppose one could say that not one of these were major incisions. Only at the end did the victim bleed to death. The Democrats are now going to adopt this policy but this was not the case in August and September 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask honourable senators to listen now to what was said-this is one of my best and favourite quotations-by Dr Michael Macklin, already in the Senate, about the Democrats' attitude on sales tax:</PARA>
<PARA> The sales tax provisions have many disturbing effects-on the building industry, first home buyers, low-income families, and they would introduce an unwarranted new tax on information-but the legal advice we have received is that they are part of the Budget parcel. As such, no Senate has the right to reject them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats were elected under a promise never to use our power in the Senate to block Supply-and rightly so. Nobody should want a repetition of the events of November, 1975. By referring part of the legislation back to the Lower House, we have steered away from this possibility and at the same time we have given voters an opportunity to register their disapproval. </PARA>
<PARA> By taking the stance it did last week Labor-also pledged not to block Supply- has abandoned all pretence of political principles. Despite all it said in 1975 the ALP has now joined the Liberals in using the Senate for short-term political advantage. The lesson has not been learned. </PARA>
<PARA> Irrespective of the potential electoral backlash to the Democrats, we will not follow the Liberal and Labor parties in breaking election pledges. We could hardly claim to keep either of the old parties honest unless we are honest ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA>What a splendid statement! I make no apology for reading it with some inflection or for thinking that that represented the high point in Australian Democrat history. Let us see how Senator Mason was handling this at that same time or just before during the Budget debate. Part of the quotation which I am about to read was read by Senator Messner today. But let us hear the whole of it. Senator Mason was explaining why the Democrats did not like the Bills but said that they were not going to vote them down. Senator Tate interjected:</PARA>

<PARA> Honourable senators interjecting-</PARA>
<PARA>One does not need too many guesses as to where those interjections were coming from. Senator Mason continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Listen to this senators, it is my bottom line. Those on the Labor side in particular should listen to this. Undesirable though the sales tax increases are , damaging though their impact might be, the consequences of the Senate meddling in, or unilaterally rewriting a Budget, seem to us too horrifying to contemplate . </PARA>
<PARA>That, too, is one of my favourite quotations which I trust will be enshrined for all time. Senator Mason also said on that same day:</PARA>
<PARA> We can legally reject Supply Bills but what would be the long term implications of such an action? A respectable view can be put forward that the right of any government, including a Labor government, to create a Budget and govern is inviolate. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that that is so. I do not want to swell Senator Mason's head too much. When he was questioned on AM on 21 October he was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Will you be trying to block them again in February. </PARA>
<PARA>His answer was this:</PARA>
<PARA> No, we will not be blocking them for the reasons which we have stated time and time again, that the Democrats will not precipitate a re-run of November 1975. We see that if the sales tax legislation were blocked permanently from the Government, it would interfere with their Budget to the extent where they could, as indeed the Government is saying, take the country to a double dissolution. And I would agree, they would be justified in both circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the Australian Democrats are listening to those words because clearly they have increased the possibilities of a double dissolution. If a party loses all its moral integrity and fibre it is very vulnerable in the eyes of the public even though it may think it has popularity because of the issue on which it voted. Senator Mason has said this in a number of ways. At that time he made it very clear that it was a considered decision. I do not doubt that at that time Senator Chipp knew what the Democrats were doing and did not take any stance against it. On 19 August Senator Chipp made some comments on the PM program. In reply to a question he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Well we can't back away from being, from breaking a promise either and we're not going to be dishonourable because I'll remind you that one of the things I featured during the election campaign, under no circumstances, not even ' reprehensible' circumstances, would we ever block Supply or impede a money bill so as to prevent a democratically elected Government from governing.

We know now the Democrats have said that they are wrong again and that they are going to vote against these Bills. In a statement on 16 February Senator Chipp said that it was an error of judgment to have said all that. He went on to say, and I think this is interesting:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Government's members in the House of Representatives have resisted the continued representations of the majority of the community during the five months delay achieved by the Democrats, we believe the Senate now has no option but to take action itself. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he is passing the buck. He is telling the people that, because members of the House of Representatives in their judgment, which surely they are entitled to make, and on hearing all the representations which they got decided that they should support these Bills, this gives the Democrats some excuse to run away from their loudly announced policies of a number of years. One might ask: What is next? If these Bills are to be thrown out, what next? There is no longer any principle guide as to what they may or may not support. If the Government wanted some money to build a nuclear power station, for example, because it had determined that there was a need-we know what the views of the Democrats are on nuclear power stations-clearly that Bill would be thrown out because that is something that they do not want. The Government may find it is necessary to build such a nuclear power station to meet the energy requirements of the country. One can think of many instances where the views of the Democrats differ from those of the Government and where they now have no excuse for taking such views. There is no way for the public to judge how they will react to any of these matters. Senator Mason says the present situation is due to the attitudes of the members of the House of Representatives. That view is quite contrary to the view he adopted in August. That was not his reason then for taking the decision he did. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats should be aware of the fate of the Democratic Labor Party. In 1974, five Democratic Labor Party senators were apparently ensconced for some time in this chamber. Their principles and views were well known. It was noted that one of their members turned from the party, sold out, took an office at the behest of the Government and betrayed them and their principles. In a matter of weeks all the Democratic Labor Party senators had disappeared. I had the pleasure of eliminating their leader, Senator McManus, by my entering this chamber. </PARA>

I may not like these Bills and I may not like some others, but I do not put myself in the place of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the people who have to determine the financial policies of this country. We know that under the Constitution the Senate has limited financial powers. It is recognised that there is a primacy in the House of Representatives. As much as we may think at times that the House of Representatives is a poor chamber and does not stand up very well for its rights, it is not for us to weaken its position or to arrogate to ourselves things which we feel we might know better about.

Senator Missen has claimed also that there is now a danger that the Australian Democrats might throw out any Bill-a Bill on uranium, for instance.

Our predictions last August that the Budget would be a catastrophe have, in fact, been borne out . The balance of payments situation is appalling, inflation is acute, the housing and construction industry is collapsing. Despite all this, the Government refuses to alter its course and is not prepared to reflate the economy even to a mild extent. It has been unable to control interest rates, inflation, unemployment or the balance of payments. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) stated recently that he does not intend to index taxation or otherwise reduce the burden of income tax. The inescapable fact is that the passage of the sales tax legislation will immediately and directly increase unemployment and inflation and, in particular, it will increase the cost of housing. Should we vote for legislation that will exacerbate these burdens on the average battling Australian?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity on the first reading of a money Bill to raise the matter of resettlement of refugees in Australia and in particular to look at the role of government departments in this matter. I should like to illustrate what I have to say tonight by reference to a case which is at present in the news and which was mentioned on the Australian Broadcasting Commission program AM this morning. It relates to 34 Laotians who came to the Northern Territory in June 1980. I will try to avoid generalising from one case but it could be that by an examination of this case some lessons will be learned by the departments which will assist in future. Let me then relate the history, as I understand it, of the group I refer to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should preface my comments by saying that I have spoken to members of the group-not to all of them but to more than half of them-the social worker from the Resources and Settlement Centre in Darwin, an officer from the Northern Territory Immigration and Ethnic Affairs section of the Department of Community Development, and to employers and others who have come in contact with members of this group since they arrived in Australia. The situation is that a family group of 34 people moved from Laos into a Thai refugee camp. A relative of theirs who was living in Darwin, a Mrs Vilay Buschman, visited the camp in 1980. She was disturbed by the conditions she saw there, and whilst she had no criticism of the Thai Government she shared the view of others of us who have seen the camps in Thailand and in other areas. She came back to Australia and put the proposition to her husband-who, incidentally, is an American who has lived here for many years-that they would sponsor the family as a group of refugees to come to Australia. She contacted the Federal Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and she also contacted this group I spoke of previously, a small department in the Northern Territory Government also called Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. It is a part of the Community Development Department of the Northern Territory Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Immigration and Ethnic Affairs group of the Northern Territory Government then approached the Federal Department and put a proposition to it. The proposition was very similar to one advanced by the Honourable Nick Dondas, M.L. A. when he had responsibility for immigration in the Northern Territory. He put his proposal to a meeting of State and Federal Ministers in 1980. Basically the proposition was that refugees should come to Australia in groups, be settled on farms in the Northern Territory and carry on what might be called subsistence living-I do not use that word in any derogatory sense-but simply to imply they might look after themselves and be no great burden to the Australian people. He sought funds from the Federal Government for this purpose. Whether it was because he sought funds or not, the proposition was not agreed to. It did, however, at the time excite a good deal of comment both in the Press and, I recall, in this place. I raised the matter and I believe honourable senators on the other side of the chamber were also excited by the proposition. Approval to bring the family out was nevertheless given by the Federal Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go into fine detail here but basically the group consisted of Mrs Buschman's father-a man 91 years of age at that time-his second wife and their three children, four of Mrs Buschman's brothers and sisters and their spouses and families. Some of the families ran into the second generation. There was a total of 34 people in all. These people arrived in Darwin in June 1980. The family was met at the airport by the Buschmans and taken to a property south of Darwin known as Tumbling Waters. It is a delightful area. The accommodation available to them there, as I understand it, was a shed with a roof but no walls and a dirt floor. Beds had been purchased and set up in this open shed. No running water was available but water was available from a river close by and could be carried up to the shed. There were no toilets but there was ample space for these to be dug by the refugees. </PARA>
<PARA> The plan which Mr Buschman and his wife had was basically this: that the group would live on the farm, very much along the lines I have suggested; that they would be able to establish themselves there and grow most of the food they needed. They would keep livestock, mainly in the form of poultry, and some members of the group would seek employment off the property to bring in additional money. I must say at this stage that the Northern Territory Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs assisted in the finding of positions for these people, as did the Buschmans and others who had agreed to co -operate and assist. The fourth section of the plan was that the adults would attend English classes until they became proficient in English so that they would be more able to be employed and that the children would attend school-some in the primary school and some in the secondary school. Of course, not having English they would attend the excellent classes conducted by the Northern Territory Department of Education for both younger children and teenage students . That was the plan put forward by Mr Buschman which was agreed to, apparently, by the Department in that it gave approval for the family to come out. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us jump from the time at which they arrived to a period of six months or so later when in January 1981 one of the group, Phayloth, came to the Resources and Settlement Centre and laid certain complaints. He alleged firstly, that the living conditions were inadequate. Honourable senators might recall that I mentioned earlier that the group of people were living in a shed and that the toilet facilities were reasonably primitive-dug out close to the shed. There were few cooking facilities apart from barbecues and open fires which they could construct outside the shed. The second section of his complaint was that all of the moneys-that is, the unemployment benefits where appropriate, the family allowances and some wages-were paid into trust accounts, Mrs Buschman being trustee for all the people. I should explain here that some people worked off the property and in addition to this Mr Buschman had a contract with a poultry processor to supply labour at certain times. Some people worked under contract for Mr Buschman in poultry processing. The complaint Phayloth made about this money being paid into the accounts was that the members did not have access to it, and he made the additional complaint that they were kept short of money. </PARA>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OP7">Senator ROBERTSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting I was speaking about the refugee settlement situation in the Northern Territory. I was explaining how one of the group of 34 Laotians who came to Australia, a gentleman by the name of Phayloth, had been to the Resource and Settlement Centre and had made certain allegations and complaints. The first was about living conditions. The second concerned the fact that all moneys were paid into a trust account. I was about to move on to the third complaint which he made, and that was that the people were not allowed to leave the farm. When I pressed him on this he explained that the only transport available was held by Mr Buschman and it was not always possible for Mr Buschman to take the people to town. I think we have to be a little wary about the proposition that they were not allowed to leave. Perhaps on some occasions their movement away from the farm was not facilitated. The social worker at the Resource and Settlement Centre, Mrs J. Kaese-Hagen, took Phayloth to the Department of Social Security in early 1981. He presented to the Department a list of complaints which he had prepared with some support by a friend in Darwin. The Department of Social Security took one action only, and that was to stop Phayloth's cheque and to pay him by cash. It did not take any further action. I will come back to that later. Phayloth obtained a job at a local firm at which he was not successful. Then he and his wife went to Sydney. This movement to Sydney was organised by the Resource and Settlement Centre. He returned to Darwin in 1981.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Continuing the chronology, in March 1981 Salieng-I just make the point that Salieng is a lady-came to the Resource and Settlement Centre with complaints similar to those that had been raised by Phayloth. She had left the farm having several complaints about money and she had been befriended by a Darwin family. She continued to work at the hospital and her husband continued to work at the poultry farm. Following her visit to the Resource and Settlement Centre, Salieng contacted the Federal Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs which sent two officers in April to look at Buschman's farm. They did not have an interpreter when they visited and so they relied on Mr Buschman himself to interpret for them. When they came back they made no report to the Resource and Settlement Centre although they had been asked by it to visit the farm. In answer to a telephone query they made the comment that living at the farm was ' better than a refugee camp'. Towards the end of the year the remainder of the group left the farm although one person continued to work on it. The Resource and Settlement Centre was able to contact the Northern Territory Housing Commission in Darwin and arrange emergency housing for the four families. I just make the point that no application had been made by anyone prior to this time for a Housing Commission house. On the arrival of the Laotians in the Territory no arrangement had been made to put their names on the housing list. </PARA>
<PARA> We move now fairly quickly to 16 January this year when a number of members of the group visited Buschman's home in Darwin. Their intention was to get from him and from his wife the bank books, documents and clothing which they claimed were theirs. I understand that there was some fracas at the home and Buschman called the police. On the advice of the police he later sought an injunction to prevent the group visiting either his Darwin property or the Tumbling Waters farm. The Resource and Settlement Centre arranged for legal aid. The case is to be heard on 1 March, so I do not want to discuss it. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to get involved in any sort of family problems that might exist among all of the members of that family. My concern, at this stage anyway, is to raise a number of queries regarding the involvement of government departments. Perhaps I can list them in three main groupings. Firstly, I ask: Was sufficient investigation carried out by the departments prior to approval being given by the Minister for this Laotian family to come to Australia? Let me remind the Senate of the facts. Mr Buschman had one house in Darwin and a partially completed shed on the farm. The question must be asked: Are one house and one shed enough for Mr Buschman himself and his family and 34 additional people? We might ask further: Was the farm investigated to see whether it was suited to settlement and this self sufficiency that I spoke of earlier and called subsistence living?</PARA>
<PARA> Did both the Federal and Territory departments of immigration and ethnic affairs really investigate the viability of the scheme which was put to them by the Buschmans? Was much thought given to the strength of family ties and the relationship of Mrs Buschman to the rest of the family? I do not wish to elaborate on this except to say that those of us who have been to that area know that a person who has moved away from a family to work in a main centre and then has married a foreigner, an American, is not always accepted by the rest of the family. How much thought was given to the appriateness of Mr and Mrs Buschman as sponsors to handle what anyone would regard as an extremely difficult task; that is, settling a family of 34 people-four or five groups of adults and a number of children-in a new environment. </PARA>
<PARA> I go on to a second bracket of questions. We have talked about what might have happened before the Laotians arrived. How much support was given to the sponsors after this group had arrived and, of course, how much follow-up support was given to the family? We know that the Territory immigration and ethnic affairs people tried to find employment for the adults. We know that the children were enrolled at school-the younger children at primary school and the older children at secondary school. We know that some adults attended English classes for two or three months but then they were required back at the farm to do additional work so they were withdrawn from the English classes. </PARA>
<PARA> So, for the first four, five, or six months from June 1981 everything seemed satisfactory. What happened then? These questions, I think, must be put directly to the government departments. Did the Department of Social Security really examine the claim made by Phayloth that unemployment benefit and family allowances were not made available to the recipients and that some arrangement had been made whereby someone had trust accounts that this money was paid into and was denying the normal recipients of family allowances and unemployment benefits access to the money. Did Social Security examine allegations that unemployment benefit was being paid to people who were actually working even though they might have been working only one, two or three days a week? Did the Northern Territory Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Section have a look at the living conditions to which it had encouraged the Federal Government to bring these people? Did the Commonwealth Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Department look at the living conditions? Did the Commonwealth Department investigate whether the sponsors were meeting the conditions which they promised or which they set out when they requested that the 34 people be brought to Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> The last question in this general area is: Is the comment from officers of the Department that it was 'better than refugee camp' really sufficient? The Department is certainly more stringent than this in the cases that I have had to deal with. The Department is very seldom prepared to take an open tin shed as being sufficient accommodation. Even if it were better than the refugee camp is that sufficient for us? Are we prepared to accept those sorts of conditions? I would have thought not. I would have thought that we in Australia, if we were bringing people to Australia, would have wanted something more appropriate, something nearer the level which the majority of people in Australia enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to discourage refugee settlement-I have spoken in this place before on the topic-but I want it to be effective. We seem to have a situation where the majority of the group that came out under this sponsorship program are living in emergency housing. The majority of these are on unemployment benefit. I am not complaining about this. But we have brought these people out and the majority of them are now living here at considerable cost to the Australian community. Again, I am not complaining but I do not think we ought to create these sorts of situations. I am not suggesting either, of course, that members of the group are themselves blameless. It could be that they are not making the contribution that they ought to be making. Perhaps they are not prepared to get in and work a little harder. Perhaps they are not prepared to take their share of the responsibility for the farm enterprise not working out. Most of the members to whom I spoke seem committed. Some are in employment and are working well, it must be said, some are not. It is as blunt as that. </PARA>
<PARA> Without developing this theme any further I just say that perhaps the example I have brought before the Senate today will help us to play our part in refugee programs by improving our techniques in three ways: Firstly, prior to arrival by checking sponsors and instructing those who are coming to Australia about their responsibilities-surely that is part of the program; secondly, after arrival by providing back-up services and assisting with appropriate accommodation and employment-we should make sure that this is available before the people are brought out; and, thirdly, in the post-arrival period by continuing to give support until the refugees are settled and have become contributing members of our community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I argue that the Sales Tax Amendment Bills should be supported. To reach that stage I will argue for the desirability of changing the tax mix in Australia with a reduction in direct tax, particularly income tax, and a corresponding increase in and broadening of the indirect tax base. One legitimate and valid way in which this can be achieved is by extending the current sales tax. The Budget sought a package of sales tax extensions which increased the overall existing tax, removed certain anomalies and widened the tax base to include certain transactions which were not previously so taxed. I believe that as a package the legislation can be fairly said to have the potential for generating desirable reductions in direct taxes, particularly personal income tax as economic and budgetary conditions permit. This was the objective stated by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in the Budget, and is an objective with which I concur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why should we change the tax mix? In recent times it has been widely accepted that whereas the overall level of taxation in Australia may not be comparatively high nevertheless Australia relies heavily on direct taxes, particularly income tax. Of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development only Japan, which does not have any consumption tax, derives a smaller proportion of its revenue from indirect taxation. Australia raises 6.1 per cent of its revenue in this way. It can be compared with such countries as Austria, with a figure over 19 per cent; Belgium, over 17 per cent; Canada, over 12 per cent; Denmark, over 21 per cent; Finland, 20 per cent; France, over 21 per cent; Germany, over 15 per cent; Ireland, over 19 per cent; the Netherlands, over 16 per cent; et cetera. Thus Australia is out of step with most highly developed countries in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to put three principal reasons to the Senate as to why the Australian community would be better off with some redress of the balance between direct and indirect taxation. The first is the sum of taxation revenue being lost through avoidance of direct taxation and the consequences of that loss. Despite the Government's best endeavours such knowledgeable commentators as Professor Russell Mathews still estimate that 20 per cent of the personal income tax normally required to be paid is being lost to revenue through avoidance and evasion, usually by high income tax payers rather than wage and salary earners. Professor Russell Mathews, in a recent article, said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . quite apart from its unfortunate effects on the distribution of the tax burden, this revenue loss has had a direct impact on the size of the public sector budget deficit, the level of government borrowing, the rate of growth of money supplies and the level of interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>Expenditure based taxes are much harder to avoid than income based taxes. Secondly, the reliance on income tax has meant a need for high marginal rates which has an adverse effect on incentives and a consequent loss of economic efficiency. Thirdly, and as something of a corollary to the first two points, again as Professor Mathews says, the tax system appears to have largely failed as machinery for the redistribution of wealth on a more equitable basis. Because of the ease of avoiding income tax and the loss of incentive at higher marginal rates the tax has not had the progressive effect usually claimed of taxation systems with a high direct tax content. Indirect taxation with an increasing scale from the so-called necessaries through to luxury goods, offers greater opportunity for a progressive effect, particularly in a system without significant capital taxes and no wealth tax or death or estate duties. Progressively scaled indirect taxes offer an opportunity to redress the mix where a significant section of the community low in income but high in wealth contributes little to the tax burden. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth recalling that it was also the recommendation of the Asprey Taxation Review Committee in 1975 after its comprehensive review of the Australian taxation system that there should be greater reliance upon taxes of goods and services by the inclusion of a broad-based tax. Given the desirability of an alteration of the tax mix, and keeping the debate within the sphere of consumption or expenditure taxation, the alternatives open to government must be considered. In that regard it should be recognised that Australia's indirect tax system is narrow-based and highly discriminatory. Simply to increase the rates would therefore not be desirable. To broaden the indirect tax base would be to reduce distortion and improve horizontal equity-that is, persons in the same position should be treated equally. Thus not only should we look to a better balance between direct and indirect taxes than currently exists but the base of the current indirect taxes should be broadened. </PARA>
<PARA> Four obvious alternative systems of broad-based indirect tax would have had to be considered. The Government could have imposed, firstly, a value added tax; secondly, a retail turnover tax, possibly with a selected services tax; or, thirdly, a personal expenditure or consumption tax. Fourthly the current Australian sales tax, which is a wholesale point of sale tax, could have been broadened. The Government chose the fourth alternative for reasons which are sound and logical. Whether or not it was the best way to go is a question for political judgment with which I may not necessarily agree but the reasons for which I am prepared to concede are sound. </PARA>
<PARA> The value added tax is a multi-stage tax imposed at all stages of the production and distribution chain for goods and services. It is generally conceded to be an equitable tax but it does impose an enormous paper work burden on taxpayers and collecting authorities. It tends therefore to be cumbersome in its operation and expensive to administer. For those reasons I suspect that it was dismissed by government. A retail turnover tax has the potential to generate large income from low rates of tax and therefore has considerable appeal. On the other hand, it would necessitate an extensive licensing system and provide a significant increase in the number of tax paying units. There would be the difficulty of educating a large number of new taxpayers and recruiting and training administrative staff. The addition of a selected services tax also has appeal but, as has been argued elsewhere, it has limitations. To tax services such as interstate passenger and freight services falls beyond the Commonwealth' s tax powers. Certain transactions, such as betting transactions are already taxed at the State level. For such reasons it appears that the alternative of a retail turnover tax together with a selected services tax was also dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA> The third alternative, that of a general personal consumption tax, has considerable theoretical appeal on accepted criteria of equity, efficiency and, to a lesser degree, simplicity. However, it would be a totally new concept requiring a complete re-education of the Australian public. Additionally the transition problems would be enormous. Although it has been considered from time to time by both the United Kingdom and the United States of America, neither country has been prepared to proceed with any real form of implementation. To some extent, it has operated in Sri Lanka and India. However, to change the whole emphasis of our taxation from personal income to personal expenditure is not something which could simply be introduced in a Budget. I believe that in the longer term it would be a subject upon which the Government could profitably encourage public debate. Such stimulation by means of a Green Paper or otherwise would, in my opinion, be a worthwhile exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> This left the fourth alternative; that is, an extension of the current sales tax. I thought that the reasons for the Government's decision to extend further the current sales tax rather than introduce a new form of consumption tax were well stated by my colleague Senator Jessop on 8 September 1981 when he made a statement which I respectfully adopt. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA> If there is to be a greater reliance on indirect taxes, it will be necessary to find the tax that is best suited to Australia's political and economic framework . The main requirements for such a tax are that it should raise the required revenue, should be administratively simple and cheap, should keep the economic side effects to a minimum and should be politically acceptable. On the whole sales tax fits this bill. </PARA>
<PARA>It is true that it is an indirect tax with which the community is familiar. It has in fact been part of our taxation system since it was introduced by a Labor government in 1930 when it was imposed on a very wide range of goods, including many food items. It is administratively quite straightforward. It involves a small number of relatively large businesses, usually with developed accounting systems. The expense involved in extending the existing tax is relatively light compared with any new form of tax. Given therefore that extensions to the current sales tax were observed as the way to go, the Government had then to decide in which way the tax was to be extended. The Government obviously wanted to do it in a way that had the least detrimental effect upon inflation; further, it was anxious that the extension should not be regressive; and, finally, it desired that it be a broad-based tax in order that adequate income could be raised at a low rate. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to consider briefly the three objectives I have just mentioned in the light of the package of sales tax measures proposed by the Budget, the last part of which is before the Senate tonight. In relation to inflation, Treasury figures indicate that the impact of sales tax Budget measures on the consumer price index could be calculated at only 0.8 per cent. In this regard it should be particularly noted that the rate of increase of indirect taxes in recent years has been falling. By this year's Budget it was planned to increase by 3.7 per cent compared with 5.1 per cent in the previous year 9.6 per cent in 1979-80 and 15.5 per cent in 1978-79. Thus, although sales tax is to be extended, the total rate of increase, and, therefore, the effect on inflation, is moderate compared with previous years. </PARA>
<PARA> The second argument concerns whether the changes are regressive. A regressive tax is generally accepted as being one which places a heavier share of the tax burden on low income earners and a disproportionate lower share on high earners. A specific tax on liquor, traditionally widely utilised by low income earners, is therefore regressive and the narrow base of Australians' sales tax in the past has been criticised on such a basis. It follows, therefore, that the more broad-based the tax the greater the option of purchase and the less regressive it tends to be. Add to this higher rates on luxury items as exist in the Australian sales tax system and the tax can actually become of a progressive nature. It is true that certain of the specific items proposed to be taxed, when looked at in isolation, are obviously necessary; for example, clothes. On the other hand, such items provide great options for the taxpayer in the sums of money that are to be spent thereon. </PARA>
<PARA> To examine the effect on the income of lower income earners it is, therefore, necessary to make some assessment of what they would in fact be spending on these particular items. A recent study by the Australian Taxation Office showed that approximately 26 per cent of purchases of the lower income groups is food, which is, of course, exempt. If food were included-and such a great percentage of low income earners' income is spent thereon-the tax could be said to have a regressive effect. But estimates of tax that would be paid by low income earners on the items included is in fact very low. It is perhaps for that reason that an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development study recently indicated that broad-based sales taxes tend not to be regressive at lower and middle income levels. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend to the Senate the speech of my colleague in the other place, Mr Michael Baume, M.P., who argued that the expenditure by a pensioner on the tax would in fact be less than the increase in the consumer price index resulting from the tax and, as that is passed on in higher pensions, the pensioner will actually be better off relative to the rest of the community. Therefore, he argued that the tax would actually have a progressive effect rather than a regressive effect. Certainly I believe the Government was correct in its assessment that, as a package, broadening the base, increasing the rate on currently existing goods and removing anomalies will provide a tax which is more progressive than before. </PARA>
<PARA> Very briefly I wish to mention two of the items included within the current Bills which have aroused extensive campaigns of lobbying. The item which particularly concerns me, because of the deflated building industry in South Australia, is that of sales tax on building products. I think, however, it must be borne in mind that the rate of tax is very low. The most realistic assessments put the addition to the price of an average new home at $400, which gives a repayment of about $60 per year or $1.20 per week. When the package is balanced with the potential for direct tax relief that an extension in indirect tax offers, in addition to the detrimental effect it can potentially have upon the cash economy, I am satisfied that the benefits can outweigh the detriment. </PARA>
<PARA> The other subject I wish to mention is the extension of the tax to newspapers, magazines and books. In looking for a broad-based tax at a low rate, I can see little reason why all newspapers, magazines and books should be exempted. Schools, universities, community libraries, et cetera are already exempt and a not inconsiderable portion of the balance of sales of newspapers, magazines and books is for entertainment. As one journalist stated, he could not see why there should be a tax on photography but not a tax on pornography. Contrary to what was originally argued by the lobbyists, indirect taxation on newspapers, magazines and books is the norm rather than the exception in developed countries . The rates are worth noting when they are compared with the 2.5 per cent proposed by the Bills. For example, Austria imposes 7.8 per cent; Belgium 6.1 per cent; Denmark 22 per cent, on books; France 7 per cent; Germany 6.5 per cent ; Ireland 10 per cent; Italy 3 per cent on newspapers and 5 per cent on books; the Netherlands 4.1 per cent; and Sweden 19.1 per cent on books. It is possible to argue against any form of tax. However, if the extension of indirect tax, of which this forms a part, has the ultimate effect of allowing reductions in income tax and therefore a better tax mix, which is the basis upon which I am supporting it, then again I am satisfied that the benefit will outweigh the detriment. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, in summary, I commend the Bills to the Senate as a logical and sound way, when seen as part of a total package, of taking a small step towards redressing the imbalance between direct and indirect taxes in Australia. I am quite satisfied that if such an imbalance can be overcome, it will be to the benefit of the Australian community as a whole. It is not an ambitious step and will not resolve what I see as the major shortcomings of the Australian tax system which I detailed in my first speech to the Senate on 9 September 1981. It is, however, a constructive contribution and deserves support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter I would like to discuss tonight in speaking to the first readings of the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos. 1A to 9A) [No. 2] is the nuclear industry. It is an industry which I believe has stalled, and the signs are that it is going into reverse. There is, I believe, no more dramatic example of this than a comparison of the situation in the United States 10 years ago with the current position. At the beginning of the 1970s orders for nuclear reactors within the United States were being lodged almost daily. This peaked in 1973-74 when 40 reactors were requisitioned. The position at the moment is that there are no current orders in the United States. This is not purely an American phenomenon. In Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development countries the peak for orders was in the period from 1972-74. In those three years 44, 56 and 48 units respectively were ordered. In the years 1979 and 1980 orders in the OECD countries totalled 18. Even France, which is resisting the turn away from nuclear power more than any other country, is decreasing the number of orders. There are a number of reasons for this which I will turn to later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, I will have a hard look at the economic effects of this downturn in the nuclear economy. It is perhaps best demonstrated by looking at world uranium prices. The price of uranium yellowcake peaked, because of the popularity of nuclear-based electricity, at the end of May 1979 when it was fetching just over $US43 per lb. The price then began falling. It has now stopped. Although the uranium producers hope it has reached its rock bottom it shows no sign of rallying. The latest figures show that the current price of uranium yellowcake is $US23.5 per lb. To show what sort of effect this is having on the industry, I will quote from a transcript of an interview with the chairperson of Pancontinental, Mr Tony Grey. The interview was broadcast on the Australian Broadcasting Commission's Money Talk program on 23 July 1981. Mr Grey said:</PARA>
<PARA> They-</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to uranium prices-</PARA>
<PARA>certainly have slid from levels that were in existence a few years ago. They've got to the point where much of the world production capacity, particularly in the United States, is threatened and, indeed mines are closing down. </PARA>
<PARA>In the light of this it would seem to be the height of economic stupidity for this Government to be actively pursuing a policy of expansion in the nuclear industry but then again this Government is perhaps in the forefront of world governments when it comes to economic stupidity. </PARA>
<PARA> To reinforce this point I refer honourable senators to the developments occurring in the technology for uranium enrichment. There are a number of ways of enriching uranium ready for use in reactors. Enrichment involves the separation of uranium feed into two streams, one enriched in the isotope U-235 to approximately 3 per cent from the naturally occurring 0.7 per cent and usable for fuel, and the other a waste or tail stream decreased in U-235 concentration to a concentration of about 0.2 per cent to 0.3 per cent. These are the basic processes, although there are variations on this theme. The same amount of fuel can be produced from a smaller or larger amount of natural uranium by using more or less enrichment. Variations of up to 20 per cent in natural uranium requirements are accordingly possible. The latest technology being developed in the enrichment area is, as a matter of economics, tending more towards obtaining the same amount of fuel through enriching less uranium. This will have the direct effect of further deepening the depression in the demand for uranium in the world market to which I referred earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> Another major influence on the depression of the world uranium market is the decline in world demand for electricity. The demand for this kind of power consumption is now expected to increase at approximately 3 per cent to 3.5 per cent a year which is, in fact, half the rate of growth of the 1960s. This slump has left the electrical power industry, which already has an overcapacity of 40 per cent, with an even greater overcapacity. </PARA>
<PARA> There are four big nuclear power producers in the United States. They are Westinghouse, General Electric, Combustion Engineering and the infamous Babcock and Wilcox, the producers involved with the Three Mile Island plant. Only one of these, Westinghouse, is currently believed to be in profit. But when one looks at the situation of that company one quickly realises that this profit comes only after taking into account the huge losses on its uranium contracts, said to be about $US400m a year, following a tax write-off of the same amount. General Electric has nuclear business which accounts for 3 per cent of its total business. It is estimated that it is losing between $US20m to $US40m a year on the nuclear part of its overall operations. Combustion Engineering, which has 10 percent of its business bound up in nuclear matters, is said to be losing between $US10m to $US20m a year on this aspect of its operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I turn to Babcock and Wilcox, which in recent days has earned the record of being the worst abuser of nuclear safeguards and a positive danger to anyone who lives anywhere near a plant constructed by it, as the events of the last day or two have once again shown. At the moment this firm which, as I said earlier, designed the Three Mile Island plant, is losing $US10m a year on the 10 per cent of its business in the nuclear industry. These four big firms are not only suffering from a loss of demand as a result of the drop in nuclear power generated electricity consumption. They are suffering also from many cancellations for nuclear plants. Westinghouse has had 18 orders halted in the last five years. General Electric has had 19 orders stopped since the early 1970s. Combustion Engineering has lost four orders in the past two years. Babcock and Wilcox suffered six cancellations before the nuclear disaster at Three Mile Island and has suffered seven since that date. </PARA>
<PARA> Another reason why this is happening is that energy economists and planners in the Western world are finally realising that it is cheaper to generate electricity from coal than from nuclear power. The main reason for this is the enormous capital cost involved in setting up nuclear power stations. Costs in this area are rising at the moment. All predictions are that they will escalate rapidly in the next few years. In a study entitled 'Power Plant Cost Escalation' from Komanoff Energy Associates in New York it is stated that by the late 1980s electricity from nuclear power plants will be at least 25 per cent more expensive than electricity from coal plants. The major reason is that although nuclear plants are cheaper to operate than coal plants the crucial factor is the capital cost. As a result, and as this study shows, nuclear power plants in the United States are being wound down. Komanoff said that nuclear power plants would be operating at 55 per cent capacity. That claim was made five years ago when plants were running at 70 per cent to 80 per cent capacity. The present capacity, according to the American magazine Science, ranges from 50 per cent to 62 per cent, indicating that Komanoff's prediction of five years ago was very close to the point. </PARA>
<PARA> Komanoff also now predicts that because of general costs and the costs of mounting safety requirements attached to nuclear plants, the cost of building a nuclear plant in 1988 would be 75 per cent higher than the cost of constructing a coal plant. By the latter part of the decade Komanoff claims that the cost of building and operating nuclear plants will so greatly exceed that for coal plants that many reactors now in the early stages of construction could economically be scrapped and replaced with coal units. That phenomenon is happening at the moment. In America the Virginia Electrical Power Co. is studying the pros and cons of converting two planned reactors from nuclear to coal. I submit that this demonstrates that on economic grounds alone the nuclear industry is in an advanced state of crisis and is getting worse. </PARA>
<PARA> One important aspect which I have not as yet touched upon is the question of safety. I believe that the Three Mile Island incident, a disaster which has proven itself to be of immense proportions, has set off a reaction which is yet to stop. To support this I refer to a Republican congressman from the United States-the Oklahoma representative, Mickey Edwards. He has had a long record of being a self-confessed, former pro-nuclear person. He visited the Babcock and Wilcox plant at Three Mile Island. During an interview very soon afterwards with the magazine Congressional Quarterly Congressman Edwards said:</PARA>
<PARA> I believed all the rhetoric-that nobody died, that the system worked. I got there and was absolutely shocked at what I saw-at the responses from the Met Ed officials, at the design of the plant, at the training of the people. As I went through all of this, I became convinced the nuclear industry is a kind of loose cannon. </PARA>
<PARA> I've just about come to the conclusion that nuclear power may be a nice thing to have, but it just may not work. </PARA>
<PARA> It's not true that nobody died at Three Mile Island. The nuclear industry may have died. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Edwards is not alone in his pessimism about the future of the nuclear industry and nuclear power. Another congressman, Morris Udall, the chairman of the American House of Representatives committee responsible for overseeing nuclear regulation, in an interview in February 1979, said:</PARA>
<PARA> More and more sound thinkers I talk to believe that nuclear is one of those kinds of technologies that get so complex they fall of their own weight- technologies that are really not compatible with democratic society. </PARA>
<PARA>This notion is borne out by the evidence found in atomic and nuclear legislation throughout the world. All relevant pieces of legislation contain aspects which are clearly anti-democratic-suppression of information, suppression of liberties , emergency powers and so on. These safety requirements, which I contend are inadequate, are having a profound effect on the nuclear industry. One direct result of this industry and this type of legislation is unease among the public and, indirectly, unease among corporate managers. In respect of this I will quote very briefly one United States power firm manager, Mr John Selby of Consumers Power. In 1978 he told the Wall Street Journal:</PARA>
<PARA> I'd be very reluctant to put shareholders' money into another nuclear plant in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>This type of corporate unease in the industry shows no sign of being relieved. The Wall Street Journal in an editorial in the middle of last year emphasised the fact that the uranium and nuclear power industry was in trouble. Those nuclear power stations in the United States which are being constructed are caught up in the immense problems surrounding the safety of the industry. Reports from the United States describe the so-called 'regulatory log-jam' which companies now face when they make the decision to build a nuclear power station. The problems are just beginning to get worse. </PARA>
<PARA> I briefly refer honourable senators to recent investigations and research being carried out by scientists in the United States on what levels of ionising radiation persons can be subjected to before they face a serious risk of contracting cancer or suffering some other consequence of radiation poisoning. The most recent and most important work in this area is that being carried out by people such as Professor Edward Radford, professor of epidemiology at the Pittsburg University and former chairperson of the Committee on Biological Effects of Ionising Radiation. His research, which has recently been published and discussed in American scientific journals, came about in a somewhat accidental and ironic fashion. The American scientists working on the development of the neutron bomb became worried about radiation levels in the laboratories in which they were working. This concern directly led to two research groups having a close look at the calculations upon which are based the radiation protection standards which are used throughout the non-communist world at the moment. The standards being used are taken from radiation levels received by the survivors of the atomic blasts at Nagasaki and Hiroshima at the end of the Second World War. The people in those cities were the only large cross- section of people to have received varying amounts of radiation with various degrees of shielding. Therefore, the incidence of cancer among survivors measured against degrees of exposure led scientists throughout the world to measure and to provide standards for the non-communist world's industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The results that the professor came across are startling in terms of our current standards. It is now established that the figures for current radiation exposure levels are far too high. This means that the safety standards which apply at the moment in our nuclear industry seem to be too lax. According to Dr Radford, the safety standards should be lowered substantially. He told an American Broadcasting Corporation report in an interview broadcast on the Monitor program at the beginning of November last year that the standards operating in western countries should be lowered by a factor of five; that is, made five times stricter. He said also that the calculations upon which these safety requirements are based-that is, the likelihood of death-should be broadened to take into account the incidence of cancer; cancers which may not be necessarily fatal. I shall quote from the Monitor program and refer to Professor Radford's statement on currently accepted safety standards of permissible exposure in one year. That standard at the moment is, in scientific terms, five rems per year. During the Monitor interview, Dr Radford said:</PARA>
<PARA> If a worker actually got five rems in a year for 30 years, a total of 150 rems, I believe that would more than double his or her chance of getting cancer in their lifetime and since the chance of getting cancer is about 30 per cent, each of us has about a 30 per cent chance of getting cancer in our lifetime, being exposed to that much radiation would lead to perhaps a 60 per cent chance of getting cancer in one's lifetime which I think is too much. </PARA>
<PARA>In summing up, I say that Australia could play a part in nuclear technology and in the nuclear industry if this Government and conservative State governments had the will and had concern for future generations at heart. The International Commission for Radiation Protection should be called on to study immediately the recent findings of these American scientists. The safety standards in all aspects of the nuclear industry need urgent revision as the findings of these scientists have shown. Australia should be pressing strongly for the ICRP to make a review of the international safety standards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity presented by the first reading of the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) to revert to a topic that I raised in this chamber before Christmas. I do this in the light of further information that has become available in the development of that public debate. I refer, of course, to the proposition that the Royal Australian Navy has before the Government at present to buy an aircraft carrier to replace HMAS Melbourne. This is a very large cost for the Australian community to bear. Not only is it an expensive thing to buy, but also it is something which dictates the pattern of maritime response that is possible for Australia to make for possibly 20 years ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the outset I restate the basic premise on which our defence is based and that is that we have to look after ourselves, particularly in a post-Vietnam ' Guam doctrine' era. A corollary of looking after ourselves is, of course, that we get value for the very limited amount of money that the Australian taxpayer has to spend on defence purchases. Formerly, the Australian forces always saw themselves as supporting what we euphemistically referred to as their great and powerfull friends or allies. But in the post-Vietnam era we have to look after ourselves and rely on our own resources in times of need. There is a public expectation that we will be able to do this. It is quite remarkable to look at the shift in public appreciations of defence that have taken place post-Vietnam. If I dare say it before my learned colleagues, I think the public expectation exceeds the political recognition of it. I think one can see in the Services- certainly in the Air Force and the Army-a movement towards an Australia first concept. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument for a carrier really has to be addressed on the basis of whether we really need it. If there is a case to be made for it, is it the most cost- effective way of providing it with respect to our other priorities? I will not go through in detail the argument that the Navy made, which I mentioned in my previous speech, as to why the Navy thinks we need this carrier-the convoy protection, the anti-submarine warfare, tactical air power at sea, command and control and all the minor things like brushfire wars, diplomatic showing of the flag, emergency relief programs and that sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise the point that we really are not talking about a carrier at all here; we are talking about a small ship and a ship that, in many ways, is not as capable, operationally, as HMAS Melbourne, the ship that it is designed to replace. That is an entirely different matter from getting emotionally involved in talking about the needs for a carrier for Australia. I have an absolutely open mind about the need for a carrier for Australia. I can see that there is a very good argument for tactical air power at sea. My only concern about a carrier for Australia is how survivable it is in an age of sea-skimming missiles and of missile technology in general. I will come back to that in a few minutes and look a few miles down the track as to what is going to happen technologically. If we have a case for a carrier, for goodness sake let us buy one and not buy a toy that will not do the job. I have no time at all for my colleagues, either in my own party or on the other side of this chamber, who worry about the cost. What price is freedom? We cannot measure it. We can afford the defence systems in this country that we need to protect ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to spend a little time looking at the tactical air requirement because this is the basis of why the present proposition is unacceptable. Tactical air, or in the jargon of the Navy organic air power at sea, means providing fixed wing aircraft with the ability to do certain things-to fulfil two broad groups of functions; an aggressive function and a search function. Of course, the aggressive function is the air superiority business of controlling the air space over the fleet by airborne means. That means seeing off unfriendly aircraft; fighters as well as maritime reconnaisance aircraft. It also means the ability to mount an air strike capacity. In naval aircraft those two functions are usually discharged by the one aircraft. With the search function, of course, there is a maritime reconnaisance phase, and that capacity may be mediated by the aircraft used in the aggressive role. Certainly an airborne early warning capacity is needed so radar horizons are extended out beyond that dictated by the seaborne radar. </PARA>
<PARA> In an anti-submarine role some anti-submarine capacity is needed which means using a different type of aircraft from that category in the former class. All anti-submarine warfare is a combination, a complex of various detection sensors. The truth of the matter is that on the type of ship we are talking about, the Invincible or the American LPH class which were looked at last year and the year before, it is not possible to embark any airborne early warning or ASW type fixed wing aircraft because they are too big to fit on that little 300-foot flight deck. The only type of aircraft possible to put on it are the short take- off and vertical landing aircraft. Operationally their performance is so limited and likely to be so limited from a developmental point in the future that effectively one would have no tactical air power at sea. The only aircraft that operate or exist in the world today in this category are the British Aerospace Sea Harrier and the American McDonnell-Douglas AV8B which is going to Patuxent River for its prototype trials in March and April of this year. It is very much a developmental aircraft at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sea Harrier is marketed as a fighter but it simply does not have the capacity to survive against anything in the post-Korean war era. It is a very slow fighter. It is a subsonic fighter and is slow to accelerate. One of its biggest disabilities is the fact that it does not have an adequate air fighting radar. I see Senator Tate sitting in the chamber. He will remember the long lectures I gave him a year or two ago on the characteristics of airborne air superiority radars. The radar does not have the capacity to get into the business today. It is designed for infrared weapons systems, the Sidewinder, short range-five nautical miles-air to air missile. Most critically it is short on its look-down capacity-its ability to discriminate from on height low flying fast aircraft. Because it is limited in its radar capacity it is also limited in its strike role, the identification of difficult targets under difficult weather conditions. It suffers very severely from a range and pay load limitation. There are certain various unfortunate aerodynamic quirks with that aircraft as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The AV8B is built for the Marine Corps and is purely a strike weapon. It has no radar in it at all. It is not an air fighter in any way. It is a very much better aircraft than the Sea Harrier and it should never be confused with it, although it looks the same to the uninformed eye. In many ways it is roughly twice as good when looked at with respect to payload-range combination. It is exclusively a strike aircraft at present. While there are proposals to develop it in the future as a fighter with some limited ability, none of that has been funded yet. We are looking at a time that may be 10 years down the track and certainly quite a few hundreds of millions of dollars in developmental costs. These are costs which Australia would have to pay if it wanted to move into that field. Effectively we would be denied any modern fixed wing strike aircraft on the type of ship we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> The Navy case seems to have moved away from this requirement to the anti- submarine warfare capacity. That is a stronger case for the Navy to make but it is also a very limited case. As you, Mr Acting Deputy President would know, because these ships embark the Sea King which is a helicopter operating a dunking sonar. These helicopters do not operate all that far out from the ship- maybe up to 20 nautical miles. This is an active sonar system which ranges from as low as 1,000 yards up to maybe three to four nautical miles. It is a very useful tool but it is part of a whole system of arrays and sensors that the fleet needs for anti-submarine detection. The important point is that those helicopters can be mounted on other platforms. They do not need a very expensive pseudo aircraft carrier to carry them. They can be carried and launched off other platforms. Of course, their main requirement is for some communications data-link system so the whole of the tactical picture can be integrated. The great weakness of this kind of ship apart from the technical shortcomings I have listed--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My belief is that the data link systems fitted to HMS Invincible are more than adequate for all present and future requirements of the Australian Navy. I do not think there are any problems at all in that field. From a defensive point of view we are operating in a missile age. Surface missiles and if we consider the guided torpedoes now in existence as missiles, operate over very great ranges. Classically defence against them is to get to the launch platform and not to try to put a screen between the released missile and the target. We are looking now at torpedoes. The Russian equivalents of the Mark 48 torpedo have ranges well in excess of 20 nautical miles. That means we have to be able to get beyond that to detect the platform. The big threat is the sea skimming missiles. Since 1959 when Russian Styx missiles were used to destroy that Egyptian destroyer in Elait things have moved at a very rapid rate. The sea skimming missile is a very difficult weapon to detect and to destroy. It is moving at nearly sonic speed and is a very small target. It is a relatively cheap system as opposed to the target that it is trying to destroy. Most importantly, because it is cheap, it is possible to multiply the missiles. The defensive systems can be quite simply overwhelmed. Cutting a long story short, the initiative rests very strongly with the attacker at present. I have been to every seminar the Navy has put on since I entered Parliament and I have studied the case as assiduously as I can. I say this with the greatest regret but I think the senior levels of the Royal Australian Navy fail to appreciate the revolution in weapon systems technology which has taken place at sea. I think this tragic in respect of the purchase of very large capital ships.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What worries me is looking ahead five or 10 years down the track and seeing missiles that have very much better target acquisition systems. They will possibly be moving at three times the speed of sound. They will incorporate radar stealth technology and so will be very hard to find. We will be looking at a situation where it will be very hard to stay alive on top of the water. That is what concerns me. We are not buying a ship for 1982 or 1984; we are buying a ship that will play an essential part in the defence of Australia in 1990 and 1995. It is no good having a symbol. We have to have something that has got teeth and that will threaten someone if we ourselves are threatened. Believe me, the military analysts of any of the potential aggressors of this country will not be deterred by a little bit of Navy PR. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that given all these short-comings how can the Navy proceed with the purchase of the ship. People say that the United States Navy uses the Iwo Jima class and the Royal Navy is building three of this type of ship for its use . The important thing that was hammered into me last month in London by defence experts there was that the Royal Navy ship was built always to operate under land based air cover, to provide air superiority, to provide the air strike capacity when needed and to provide the ASW and AEW capacity. It was built to operate primarily, but not exclusively, in the North Sea under land based air cover. When it was not operating in that mode it was built to operate as part of a major fleet system where the other ships of the fleet gave it the protection that it inherently lacked itself. That is a really crucial point because what the Royal Australian Navy wants to do with this ship is make it the capital ship , the centre point of a task force concept. It was never designed to do that. We cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. </PARA>
<PARA> If we need a carrier at all we should go to the Americans and say: 'Look, you are concerned about regional defence. It is a concept we support. Give us a ship , one of those Oriskany-class that are in reserve. We will man it and operate it for 10 years'. We can avoid the capital cost in that way. Having talked extensively to American State Department people and people in the United States Navy last month, I do not think that is an impossible thing to do. If we did that we could get a ship which would fulfil all the functions that Navy wants it to fulfil. We could lay off the increased running costs against the lack of a capital cost and embark something like the F18s which we are buying for the RAAF and achieve considerable savings in the defence budget by having a common strike and air superiority fighter. But that is only if a case exists for a carrier. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me look at the cost of this ship because there has been a great deal of misrepresentation as to the true cost of this weapons system. We are not buying a ship; we are buying a weapons system. Figures of $200m to $300m have been floating around. The latest figure that I have been able to get for the cost of getting the ship here, without aircraft, will be of the order of $477m, nearly $ 500m. Once we have it we must put aircraft on it. We will have to put ASW helicopters on it and at some time in the future short take-off and vertical landing aircraft. At the moment the Government's position is that it has no intention to buy short take-off and landing aircraft. That is about as silly as buying a gun and not having any ammunition. Inevitably, if we buy the ship we will have to buy short take-off and vertical landing aircraft because they are the only sort of aircraft that will fit on the ship and Navy will want some fixed wing aircraft to fly. If we do that we are looking at a cost of $12m to $ 15m at least for the Sea King helicopters. If Navy becomes ambitious and wants the Lamps III ASW helicopters they will be in excess of $30m a copy. But the AV8B-this is purely my estimate and I will be happy to see how it works out in time-will end up coming on the market at a price considerably in excess of the F18. I do not believe that we will buy the AV8Bs at a figure under $30m a copy. The equipment fit for that comes to about $700m for helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. If we add that to about $500m for the carrier and a few other things along the line we are looking at a project cost, five or six years down the line , of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. </PARA>

<PARA> As I said earlier, I do not mind spending $1.2 billion or $1.5 billion if it will do a job and keep this country safe. What I object to is paying that sort of money just for symbolism. Having fairly and dispassionately looked at Navy's case over the years, I do not believe that it has established that what it wants to do with this ship for Australia cannot be done by alternative weapons systems . I believe it has failed to appreciate what is going on in modern weapons systems. The sole justification for buying this ship seems to me to be greed, and the greed relates to the very low price at which the hull is placed on the market. The figure of around $300m is irresistable to the Navy at present because everything it has been looking at has cost $600m or $700m. I do not believe that that is a good enough argument for buying this ship for Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I first came into this institution I was unaware of the excitement that could be engendered both in here and in the other place by State elections. However, shortly before the New South Wales election it became very apparent that these Houses of Parliament would be used as a forum to try to influence the end result. As the election got nearer the Government's frenetic activities, in trying to downgrade the Wran Government in New South Wales, became more and more apparent. I am somewhat doubtful about their effectiveness given the result in New South Wales, but I fear that with the coming Victorian election we will see a similar situation develop. Already on two occasions last week Dorothy Dix questions were asked about the power supply situation in the various States, in particular New South Wales because of the problems it is having at present. Inferred throughout was that the Victorian Government had managed its power supplies with admirable administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight I put on record the real situation in Victoria regarding power production and what the prospects are. Prior to 1980 the State Electricity Commission of Victoria was regarded as a very secure and effective public authority. It had been founded by Sir John Monash in the 1920s, based on Victoria's brown coal reserves, and there had been very few problems with it in its 50 to 60 years of existence. But in November 1980 the then Leader of the Opposition, Frank Wilkes, and his shadow Minister Derek Amos, based on Treasury documents, suggested possible power shortages in the winter of 1981 and that the SEC was near bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA> The reaction of the Victorian Liberal Government was immediately to call them scaremongers. It said they had got their facts wrong and were just trying to scare the public. Of course by May and June 1981 these claims were refuted by the fact that there were serious power shortages because of breakdowns at Hazelwood and a water shortage because of a drought in the Snowy River system. The breakdowns then occurring in Victoria were far worse than those being suffered by New South Wales at the moment. Many, many thousands of people were stood down, industry leaders were very critical of the Government at the time. The result was that the then Premier, Mr Hamer, who was overseas seeking foreign investment, was absolutely cut to pieces by his own party. It is a rather remarkable fact that one of Premier Hamer's main qualities was to show loyalty to his Ministers and supporters in State parliament. Ministers, who had been involved in the biggest land scandals in Australian history, were able to survive and not be dismissed from office. But the moment it was perceived that Dick Hamer would be a loser or could not handle the situation, he was cut to pieces and replaced by his loyal deputy of 11 years. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the situation regarding the Victorian power supply? Firstly, let us look at prices. In November 1980, after a 14.9 per cent increase, the Government promised no more increases for 12 months. That is 14.9 per cent compared with an inflation rate then of 8 per cent to 9 per cent. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Tate" NAMEID="NJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator Tate</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is that for domestic consumers or industrial consumers?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was a 14.9 per cent increase across the board. The Victorian Government promised there would be no more increases for 12 months. However 10 months later in August the SEC presented the Government with a fait accompli. There was a price increase of 19.7 per cent plus a consumer surcharge of $6 a month-$18 a quarter. The SEC disregarded its obligations to the Government and imposed a surcharge retrospectively to August 1981. It was only after immense public reaction that it set the figure from November on. The 19.7 per cent increase was not even across the board. Small consumers had to pay $6 a month surcharge plus 5.38c a kilowatt hour. In reality, for anyone who consumed only 200 kilowatt hours a month that worked out to a 42 per cent increase. Senator Carrick and others say that we must conserve our energy position. Yet the situation in Victoria is that whoever consumes less electricity in fact pays a higher rate. The more electricity a person consumes in Victoria, the cheaper it becomes. We had public meetings all over Melbourne in places such as Heidelberg, Flemington and Sunshine to protest about these charges. Normally at these sorts of protest meetings one gets only a small amount of people coming forward. At these meetings, literally thousands of people came forward to protest at these charges. So the situation in Victoria is that we have had an increase of over 14 per cent and an increase of over 19 per cent. Compare the inflation rate of maybe 18 per cent with a 33 per cent jump in power prices in two years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to compare the situation in Victoria and New South Wales. In January and February this year the Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, and the State Premier, Mr Thompson, claimed that the Victorian power supply was superior to that of New South Wales and that 1,400 megawatts had been added since June 1981 when we had the power problems. The reality is, of course, that 1,100 megawatts was already in the system; it simply had not been commissioned. The plaque had not been opened. They were already in the system when the power breakdowns occurred. New South Wales currently has restrictions but in the long term the projects that it has on the board will mean that in future it will have far less problems than Victoria. The only real increase in Victoria has been the Yallourn W4 which produces 375 megawatts. The increased demand since June 1981 has been to that extent and will continue at a rate of 7 per cent for the next few years. The position of the SEC, therefore, is worse now than it was in May 1981. The refurbishing of the plant at Hazelwood has not yet been completed. Breakdowns at Hazelwood, still the key to the Victorian power system, will be much worse in 1982 than previously. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a lot of speculation about the date of the Victorian election. One of the main reasons for not holding it on the most popular date, 29 May, was fear of future power shortages, not necessarily the fact that home interest rates were going up. When we look at the financial position of the State Electricity Commission of Victoria we find that the capital works program, Loy Yang A-the first set is due in May 1984-and Loy Yang B and the power line to the Portland aluminium smelter, will cost $820m. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Howard ) and John Stone from the Department of the Treasury have let the SEC raise only $300m to $350m from domestic sources in the financial year 1981-82. Therefore, the SEC has to raise somewhere between $470m and $520m if it is to survive. It has followed about four different ways in trying to make up the shortfall. It has obtained authority to borrow money overseas. It has already investigated Middle East sources but that does not seem politically popular so it has had to give that away. It will now have to go into the short term money market, at exorbitant interest rates, to cover the shortfall. The second thing it is doing is selling its assets. Its coal dredgers and open cuts are being sold and the one big building which it owns in the city, Monash House, is also up for sale. It has also encouraged contractor financing of power stations; that is, partial private financing of essential utilities on the basis that the SEC will meet the cash when it is able to do so. Finally, it has reduced the country customers connection rebate from $2,700, repayable over 10 years, to $800 payable over eight years. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase in country connection costs indicates the SEC's hypocrisy. The SEC claims that tariff increases should be consumer price index based but it wants to increase internal revenue for capital works by 20 per cent to 50 per cent. With massive expansion, these objectives are mutually exclusive. The Loan Council restrictions mean that a 15 per cent to 20 per cent tariff increase is imminent otherwise the SEC will not be able to meet its building commitment. Australian Ratings indicate that the SEC, rated at AA-, which is unique for a guaranteed utility, is close to bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA> I come now to the final power problem in Victoria which is the Alcoa smelter. I did not get up tonight to suggest that the Alcoa smelter should never have gone ahead. But it is very interesting to see the way in which negotiations have developed between Alcoa and the Victorian Government. In October 1978 the State Development, Decentralization and Tourism Department prepared a Cabinet submission for Mr Digby Crozier on the location of the new aluminium smelter. It was a superficial cost-benefit study motivated by the Government's need to produce a decision for the 1979 election. We have a history in Victoria once a State election is announced for a vast number of projects to be announced, be it the arts centre or the roofing of the railways, which has come up every three years in the last 20 years. There is always a new plan to roof the railways. I doubt whether the State Government will try that trick again but it is usually a good one because it gets onto the front page of the Melbourne Herald. </PARA>
<PARA> A substantial cost-benefit study by John Stanley was not completed until 1979, after the State election. At that stage Alcoa and the State Government had already decided to go ahead with Portland. The decision was made. It was a political decision made without the advantage of a cost-benefit study. The 1978 submission by Mr Crozier did not include detailed discussion of the economic impact on Victoria. It also did not look at the environmental impact, the appropriate tariffs or the effect on the Aboriginal community in that area and the sacred grounds involved. Alcoa appreciated the slackness and agreed, just before the 1979 election, actually to build it. It did not appreciate, however, the instability that existed within the SEC. Alcoa was guaranteed an exemption from turnover tax for 10 years and was charged only 21 per cent of the cost of the power line to Portland. </PARA>
<PARA> In September 1981 the Government announced an inquiry into the Alcoa tariff, which was to be increased by 25 per cent to 2.4c a kilowatt hour. Honourable senators should remember that domestic consumers are paying over 5c a kilowatt hour. The situation was that Alcoa had made its plans. The State Government had promised it a set tariff. In turn, the SEC, realising that unless it wanted every other consumer in Victoria to subsidise that, had to put up Alcoa's tariff . There have been at least two inquiries into the tariff. At first Professor Cochrane from Monash University was asked to handle it. He looked at all the problems and really could not come up with a solution other than stopping the Alcoa project. In typical fashion the Victorian Government then commissioned another accountant's report. It in turn came up with some fairly wishy-washy conclusions. Nevertheless, the project has gone ahead and this means the Victorian consumers will have to subsidise the Alcoa program. </PARA>
<PARA> Alcoa does not intend to start using electricity until the winter of 1983. But the first set at Loy Yang must not really come on stream, at the earliest, until 1984 and, given all the normal sorts of delays, it will come on a lot later. The implication for the Victorian power system is that it will have to take peak load stations, such as the gas fired Newport turbine, and run them as normal stations at a cost of something like 3.5c a kilowatt hour. To run Alcoa at Portland will cost in gas terms 3.5c a kilowatt hour for an electricity charge to Alcoa of 2.4c a kilowatt hour. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the situation of the Victorian power system. It is a very sad one. The system is an absolute mess. I hope that ministers and others in this place will refrain from pointing just to New South Wales without referring to Victoria in some sort of detail. I am not sure that over the next few weeks we will have a repeat of the sort of tactics used in this Parliament when a State election is due. I would have thought that the Federal Liberal Party is losing its taste for the fight in Victoria. It butted in last week without very much success. Already this week three Liberal Ministers have told Mr Fraser to keep out of the Victorian election. They have not done that because they particularly dislike Mr Fraser but because they regard him as a liability in that area. In addition, they are trying to use the tactic of attacking an unpopular Federal Government in the belief that they will be all right themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The main person who has led that campaign is the Minister of Housing in Victoria. I have referred to him before in this place. He has said to the Prime Minister that he should 'put up' or 'shut up'. This same individual, Mr Kennett, has been storming all around Victoria about a housing policy. He has announced a lot of new initiatives, most of which will really come to nothing. It was very interesting to read in this morning's newspaper the truth about Mr Kennett and his housing policies. Honourable senators should remember that he has consistently attacked the Federal Liberal Government for its activity over housing. He has consistently blasted the Prime Minister over interest rates. He has consistently attacked the Federal Government over welfare housing. But this morning there was a leak relating to a report from Mr T. Kneebone, General Manager, Development and Property, in this area of housing. The newspaper report I have states:</PARA>
<PARA> The leaked memo is dated February 12, only six days before Mr Kennett was reported as saying that the Department of Housing was 'the most efficient in the (State) Public Service'. </PARA>
<PARA>This memo came out at about the time when Mr Kennett was claiming that his Department was the most efficient in the State Public Service. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The multiplied form-filling and explaining of what we are meant to be doing actually prevents us from doing what we are meant to be doing . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Victorian Housing Minister and others are all running around telling everyone what they are going to do and what they should be doing, but they are doing absolutely nothing. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Staff of the division are heartily sick and tired of being prevented from doing real work because of what they see as multiplied gobbledegook . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Regarding the housing situation in Victoria, the State Housing Minister is far worse than anything we have in the Federal sphere. He has done absolutely nothing to relieve the situation in Victoria. A fund of $1m has been established which was supposed to relieve the pressure of interest rates and repayments. The reality, as the Treasurer has said, is that any scheme that is to work will cost in the order of $1,000m and above. The Government has spent something like $300, 000 or $400,000 on advertising the scheme which has only $1m allocated to it to help people who are in trouble in Victoria. The memo leaked this morning shows that Mr Kennett is a fraud when it comes to housing policies and that he has failed to do anything about housing in Victoria. The next time he tells the Prime Minister or anyone else from the Federal Liberal Party to put up or shut up, he would be exposed for what he is; that is, a publicity seeker, someone who only wants to see his photo in the paper, someone who only wants to see his now marginal State seat safe for himself. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that that situation warns honourable senators opposite that it may be best to leave the State election where it belongs, that is, in the State field. As I said initially, we have had a couple of Dorothy Dix questions on power and other matters. I expect that after the Lowe by-election has passed the Victorian election will get a great airing in this place. When the people go to the defence of the Victorian Government I hope they will realise just how bad the situation is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening on the sales tax Bills on behalf of the many people of Queensland and, I believe, also of many Australians. I have not changed my previous feelings about this tax on the people of our country, nor on the consequences that such a tax would have on the average Australian family and pensioner. At the beginning of the sales tax argument I stated that when the Budget was brought down last year a tax on the so-called necessities of life would hit those in our community least able to afford it, namely, the family and the pensioners-the very areas that we should be encouraging. I was, and still am, opposed to the decision to direct this revenue raising effort in the direction of those two vulnerable areas. From all the mail, telephone calls, telegrams and personal representations that have come through my office since the Budget was brought down I have been left in no doubt whatsoever that the people of Queensland and, indeed, of Australia do not want, and certainly do not need, a further tax burden such as the sales tax promised to be.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would say that some of the people on fixed incomes, lower incomes and the pensioners certainly cannot afford it. Like everybody else , I had hoped that the Government would see fit to offset some of the effects of the sales tax with reductions in personal income tax. However, it does not seem as though that relief will be forthcoming at present. No one would criticise the Government's desire to reduce the deficit. The $300m or so that the increases in indirect taxes would have raised would have helped to achieve this. Indeed, I think that that would have helped eventually to give good tax cuts. My objection lies in the areas at which these cost cutting measures are directed; that is, the family and the pensioners in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that there are many areas where the Government could perhaps have shown some restraint in further expenditure without having to rely so heavily on indirect taxation. I think too of the emergence of the crude oil levy which during the 1979-80 financial year raised approximately $2,227m and during the 1980-81 year raised over $3,000m. Even taking into consideration the industrial strife in Bass Strait, which the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) was speaking about this morning, and the resultant reduction in revenue, surely a source of this magnitude could have helped to finance major reforms in the tax structure. However, there is a lot to be said for a government that acknowledges its capabilities and consequently tries to live within its means both domestically and at an international level. I appreciate that our Government is trying to do this. </PARA>
<PARA> When I listen to the Australian Labor Party people talking about what they would or would not do to fix the deficit, I think back to some of the years when they were in power. It is rather hypocritical that they should talk in this way because they did not do so well themselves. However, I believe that the Government expenditure, which this tax was to provide the revenue for, was perhaps too optimistic. It would seem from the recent statements of the Treasurer reported in the newspapers and broadcast over the air that the Government deficit will be significantly higher than was predicted at the time of the Budget. The Australian taxpayer is carrying a heavy tax burden despite the fact that the Government has said that, compared with overseas countries, we are a low tax nation. However, when people do not want to work or when they do not want to do overtime-they say: 'Well, most of the money that we make will have to go to pay tax anyway'-I think we must be paying too much tax. Such a situation is damaging not only to the individual's work incentive but also to the economy. That is being proved daily. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has made it quite clear that the sales tax Bills are an integral part of the Budget strategy and, as such, cannot be excluded. As government members we accept that approach. Perhaps the Budget brought down last year by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) was too optimistic, relied too heavily on revenue raising from taxation and put too much emphasis on expenditure in certain areas. For instance, the Government has to come to grips with our social security bill. In just seven years the cost of supporting parents benefits alone has risen from $40m to $800m. Social security spending comprises 28 per cent of the Budget's total outlays. The Australian taxpayer is not only footing this enormous bill but he is also, perhaps unwittingly, contributing to the emergence of a hand-out feeling in this country. This is a problem which governments will have to deal with unless something is done to control it now. It has a snowballing effect. Very large sums of money are going out in welfare and unemployment payments. We have to accept the position that people want more wages and more social security benefits but they want to pay less tax. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter I have mentioned quite often around Queensland and in other States too is that I feel people who get dole payments should have to do a few days work a week for it. </PARA>

I will suggest to honourable senators a way in which I feel we can get on with this job. I think we should overhaul our whole taxation system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have spoken before in this place about the flat rate of taxation which the National Party in Queensland has been proposing for some time. I have not, unfortunately, had very much success convincing Mr Howard that this is a goer. Despite the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) having a joke about it all on 1 April last, I still have not been able to get it through to Mr Howard that it is a good idea, but I do not intend to give up just yet. As the present system stands the average Australian is being taxed at the marginal rate of either 32 per cent or 46 per cent. This is the result of the tax drag or the tax drift which means that through inflation wages go into higher and higher brackets. Total taxable incomes for the 1980-81 year were in excess of $82 billion and the tax collections from them were more than $17 billion. A flat rate of tax on the basis of the 20 per cent proposed by our party would raise $16 billion subject to concessions to those supporting families on low incomes. A $1 billion shortfall is a rather large amount of money. I think that instead of a 20 per cent flat rate of tax a 25 per cent flat rate of tax should have been proposed. That would bring in $21 billion. I feel that that would really help. The tax base would in fact be increased with less tax avoidance and tax evasion and greater economic activity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask Senator Keeffe to let me get on with my speech; I have not interrupted anybody else. Future increases in earnings would be taxed at the rate of only 20 per cent instead of 32 per cent or 46 per cent. I feel that the advantage to wage earners is incalculable. Honourable senators cannot tell me that if they had in their pockets 75c or 80c out of every dollar they would dig a hole in the ground and bury it. They would not; they would spend it or invest it so that the money would be able to circulate. Employment opportunities would be improved. I feel that employers would retain a larger proportion of profits for purchasing plant, for expansion and for increasing employment. Government expenditure would not be funded by the tax drift. The income tax revenue would still rise, but it would rise only in proportion to actual increases in incomes in real terms. Individuals would be less reliant on governments. Under the present system it is difficult, to a very large degree, for individuals to save sufficient for their old age or to improve their financial position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The progressive tax system tends to prevent individuals from improving themselves financially. Is it worth while for a person who earns, say, $250 a week to suffer great inconvenience by working long hours in an attempt to improve his position so that he might make $350 a week? A lot of the increase would then be taken in tax. Incentives for investments and earnings would be increased. I think that is important too. The attractiveness of overtime earnings and of the rewards for additional work effort clearly would be increased substantially. Another important thing, which Senator Walsh pooh- poohed before is that tax evasion and tax avoidance would be dramatically decreased because it would not be worth while evading tax if one had to pay only 25 per cent. </PARA>

Critics of flat tax have misrepresented the plight of the ordinary worker and taxpayer. They have concealed the effects of tax drift and the fact that he will, subject to tax indexation, lose 32 per cent or 46 per cent of each dollar under the present system. I feel it is vital to the future of this nation and those who live in it that we develop a taxation system which is more in keeping with the Australian worker's assessment of a fair and equitable distribution of the tax burden. I have no doubt whatever that continuing tax slugs will kill whatever incentive is left in the heart of the Australian worker. I urge the Government in all sincerity and with all urgency to take the burden off the Australian taxpayer either by having a complete overhaul of the taxation system such as the proposal I have just been talking about or by having a realistic approach to government expenditure and priorities. If it is good enough for the average Australian family to have to live within its means it is good enough for the Government of the nation to do the same.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my intention to use this first reading debate this evening to outline a small but blatant fraud which is being conducted by a Brisbane mail order organisation. The fact that I shall be referring to only one product which it advertises makes the fraud no less significant. This organisation is not only defrauding people in Brisbane or in other parts of Queensland; it is operating nation-wide. My intentions tonight are to alert the public to the activities of this firm. My aims are to ensure that fewer people will be duped, that advertisements lodged by this firm will no longer be accepted and that the names of reputable mail order firms will no longer be besmirched by this organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before informing the Senate of the activities of this organisation I shall mention some factors in defence of those who use the mail order system even though they are not aware of the bona fides of the firms to which they forward their money. Many residents of rural areas do not have the opportunity to do personal shopping. Being a long way from major shopping centres they are naturally attracted by alluring advertisements which describe goods available through the mail. For people in these areas reputable mail order firms fulfil a real need. It is a tragedy, however, that crooked firms exist which prey on those who trust them to send the goods for which customers forward their money. If the goods are forwarded, the customers trust that when they arrive they will be what was anticipated. </PARA>
<PARA> I expect that in this session of Parliament I shall mention organisations other than the one I will speak about this evening. Many of my constituents have contacted me about other dubious firms. Tonight, however, I shall concentrate on this one firm. Advertisements for this firm invite consumers-'entice' might be a better word-to write to June Taylor at post office box 318, Spring Hill, Queensland 4000. I am not aware whether 'June Taylor' is a registered business name, but if necessary this could be easily established. Suffice it to say that I do not believe that a June Taylor has anything to do with this firm. I have received a letter from a purported June Taylor and I shall say something about that later. I understand that the person who either manages this organisation or has a close association with it is Mr Robert Clark of the Brisbane suburb of The Gap. I believe that Mr Clark is associated with a number of other enterprises which operate from post office boxes at Spring Hill. </PARA>
<PARA> I first became aware of this organisation when I read about it in the Brisbane Sunday newspaper, Sunday Sun. A reader complained that he had been duped by an advertisement which was obviously the one to which I shall refer. My attention was next brought to this matter when my colleague Senator McLaren contacted me on behalf of one of his South Australian constituents. As the firm concerned was based in Brisbane I was quite happy to see what I could do for Senator McLaren's constituent who had, in fact, responded to the advertisement. At this stage I should mention the advertisement for the goods which 'June Taylor' is selling. This advertisement has featured in otherwise respectable national magazines. For example, it was carried on page 59 of the Australian Women's Weekly of 18 November 1981 and on page 162 of the Family Circle of 15 January 1982. I will take the opportunity of tabling a copy of the advertisement. Part of the advertisement reads:</PARA>
<PARA>100 LITTLE DOLLS ALL FOR $19.95</PARA>
<PARA>Baby Dolls-Dancing Dolls-Ballerina Dolls-Indian Dolls-Cowboy Dolls-Nurse Dolls- Costume Dolls-Mexican Dolls-Clown Dolls-Bride Dolls-Groom Dolls and many more. </PARA>
<PARA> Don't shake your head in disbelief! This is TRUE! For only 19 CENTS EACH you can give that little girl the most thrilling present of her life. This set of ONE HUNDRED DOLLS for only $19.95-Just nearly 20c a piece!</PARA>
<PARA> The wonder of this unprecedented offer is that every doll is made from beautiful high quality Styrene plastic and hard synthetic rubber. You get BABY DOLLS, NURSE DOLLS, DANCING DOLLS, FOREIGN DOLLS, CLOWN DOLLS, COWBOY DOLLS, BRIDE DOLLS and many more in lilliputian cuteness. Your daughter or niece or the cute child next door will love you for this gift. What a family for a little girl! Just think of it, 100 exquisite little dolls in beautiful high-impact styrene plastic and hard synthetic rubber at this unbelievable price!</PARA>
<PARA> So fill out the coupon below. Order as many sets as you have little girls to give them to. Enclose $19.95 for each 100 dollsets you order. And even at this amazing bargain you take no risk over this bargain; just read our guarantee opposite. </PARA>
<PARA>Available at this special price by Mail Order only. </PARA>
<PARA>Then the advertisement goes on and describes where to send the money-to 'June Taylor', Box 318, Post Office, Spring Hill. It even suggests that although one set cost $19.95 one can get two sets for $39, three sets for $57 and four sets for $75. There is no cash on delivery. A customer should allow 14 days for his or her cheque to be cleared. If one wants the dolls airmailed the price is another $1 per extra set. The guarantee is mentioned in this advertisement. I will read what this guarantee says. As I read it honourable senators will realise that the guarantee is absolutely worthless. The guarantee reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Our GuaranteeHERE IS WHAT THESEDOLLS ARE MADE OF</PARA>
<PARA> People seeing our ad and not believing we can give such value write us to ask what our 100 Dolls are made of. 'Are they paper dolls or rag dolls?' they ask. NEITHER! Each and every one of are 100 dolls is made of GENUINE STYRENE and SYNTHETIC RUBBER expensively moulded. </PARA>
<PARA> Every doll has come out of an individual mould manufactured out of high impact styrene to resist breakage and is life-like in its proportions. They are truly delightful dolls!</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, that guarantee does not mean anything. I suppose that one should really ask how could one expect to obtain 100 little dolls for $19.95. But the advertisement is so enticing that obviously some people would consider it too good an offer to miss. After all, who would not like to have their daughter, their niece or their cute child next door love them for this gift? So, off goes $19.95 and despite the keen anticipation back comes a load of junk. I illustrate to honourable senators what those 100 dolls are like. I have one of them which in the old measurement is about 1 1/4 inches high--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator's constituent certainly was not too pleased with them. A lot of people throughout Australia have not been pleased with them. I read a description of these articles in a letter which was kindly brought to my notice by the Australian Consumers Association, the publishers of Choice. I consider that that description should be brought to the attention of the Senate because it is an excellent description of these little trinkets that are sent. I quote a section of the letter of which this description was a part. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On inspecting the goods we must entirely agree with Mrs ...... comments and would go even further to describe the goods as being rubbish. In our opinion they do not even remotely fit the description outlined in the advertisement. They are cheap plastic figures of the type one would find in cereal cartons, indeed a count of the figures reveals that 47 of them are models of the human figure the remaining 53 being models of various kinds of animals. Incidentally the Concise Oxford Dictionary defines doll as being a 'small model of human figure ...'. They are exceptionally small-the smallest human figure being 25mm and the smallest animal figure 15mm. Not only poor value but because of their small size potentially hazardous to small children. </PARA>
<PARA>Naturally, when people receive dolls nobody expects to get the money back if he or she indicates dissatisfaction. In fact, I tried to obtain the money back for one constituent. I have not been successful. I believe that the money just is not made available to people who return the goods. I am told that people are often told to return the goods and they will receive their money back. Somehow the goods never seem to arrive. Most people are extremely angered but they just resolve that they will not be conned by this sort of thing again. From a comment which I made in a Queensland newspaper Mr Clark or 'June Taylor' became aware that I might raise this matter in the Senate and wrote to me requesting that I should not do so. Even though I regard him or her, whatever the case may be, as a downright scoundrel and a confidence trickster, if not an absolute crook, I shall at least have the courtesy to read the letter which was sent to me. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Dear Senator Colston:</PARA>
<PARA> Regarding Item, Page 10, ''SUNDAY MAIL'', 7 February, 1982--We have been informed today that this MAY refer to our firm and our Sets of Little Dolls being sold at $19.95 per 100. </PARA>
<PARA> At one stage just prior to Christmas we had to have some small dolls air- freighted in from Asia which were not quite up to the standard of their past stock and not our present stock-but it was an emergency to fill some pre- Christmas orders. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be happy if you would examine a couple of samples of current stock of small dolls at 19.9 cents each to determine if 100 of these assorted designs etc would be worth $19.95. We think they are. </PARA>
<PARA>I shall continue with the letter in a moment. Apparently what 'June Taylor' is saying is that these samples which were sent to me are much better than some other samples that were sent out earlier. If they are better, one can imagine what the others were like. I did see some others which were sent out to Senator McLaren's constituent and I think they were of poorer quality than these. But if they were of poorer quality than the ones I have one can imagine what they would look like. The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> We do not know of any chain store even able to sell these at 1.5 cents each ($1 .50 per 100). . . </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate here. I think I said in the Press statement that I put out about these that one could probably buy the whole 100 of them in a chain store for $1. 50. The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> We would gladly buy stock at such a low figure of 1.5 cents each as the little dolls we are selling cost us nearly $10 per 100 with freight and that is 10c each, and when you add the high cost of advertising (Example: $2850.00 for a small Black and White Advertisement in a leading Womens Magazine, the ''WOMENS WEEKLY'') then add the cost of staff to pack orders, address same etc-About $3 a set would be made on each $19.95 order, (IF THAT!) We do not think that this is excessive. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot see where this is any 'rip-off'-I have shown these 100 Dolls to my little daughter and some neighbours daughters and find only praise from these children-from an Adult point of view what can one expect for 19c each-I see where BP sells little 'Smurf' Dolls at 79c and 99c each at all BP Service Stations. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that you have given a lot of time and effort to many matters concerning people and families in the past, and we really admire you for this, and by the attitudes and fair play, we want you to consider our point of view outlined above. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not consider it right to have any business ruined by unfair statements made under Parliamentary Privilege-Sure it may be in the case of Riley McKay NSW who took Queenslanders for Half a Million by just closing down, and their business is ruined anyway, and insolvent, so no criticism can hurt them, but for our business which is going into the manufacture from March of Queensland made Doll Houses et cetera it can be a disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that you might have access to 4 or 5 Queensland customers who complained. If this is correct, could you post us names and addresses of those customers, we will write kindly to these consumers, as we now have a brand new stock just arrived of these little dolls and we are prepared to exchange any older stock for these latest USA designed ones worth every bit of 19.9 cents each. </PARA>
<PARA> Best wishes to you. </PARA>
<PARA> Yours faithfully,</PARA>
<PARA> June Taylor. </PARA>
<PARA>Some parts of that letter may be technically correct but the point is that this person produced an alluring advertisement for 100 little dolls for $19.95 and the people who received them did not expect to receive such rubbish. I have no sympathy for Mr Clark, or 'June Taylor'. He, or she, has submitted deliberately misleading advertising throughout the nation to extract money for junk. If he carries on in that way he should bear the consequences of his actions. I have extreme doubts whether any of his future projects will provide value for money. To use an old adage, I would not expect that this leopard would change his spots . </PARA>
<PARA> There are two other matters that I wish to raise in connection with this advertisement and the dolls that are sent to unsuspecting consumers. Firstly, I am surprised that Australia Post can take no action to refuse this person a post office box. The results of my inquiries suggest that Australia Post has sought legal advice but that the advice is that at this stage the post office box must still be let. Surely this is something which should be given further attention. This crook is being assisted to operate because of Australia Post's inability to make collection of his mail more difficult and to prevent him from having the respectability which some people associate with a post office box number. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter concerns the magazines which accept advertisements for these firms. When an advertisement is placed in a respected magazine such as the Australian Women's Weekly or Family Circle, I have no doubt that many readers afford the same level of respectability to the advertisements themselves. Surely these magazines have some responsibility to check out the bona fides of their advertisers. In fairness, I should mention that I have sighted a letter from the Australian Women's Weekly which indicates that Mr Clark or 'June Taylor' will no longer be able to advertise in that magazine. I wish to quote that letter, which was sent to a person in New South Wales. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> We were disturbed to receive your letter of January 7 advising of your dissatisfaction with the goods received as a result of the '100 Dolls' advertisement in 'Women's Weekly'. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately we are aware that a number of readers are also dissatisfied with this advertisement and we want you to know that before accepting the advertisement we were assured that, should any customer be unhappy, all money would be refunded. </PARA>
<PARA> We feel you have taken the right course of action by contacting the Consumer Affairs Bureau as, indeed, we have suggested to our readers. </PARA>
<PARA> We are sorry you have been inconvenienced and can assure you that no further advertisements for this company will be carried by our magazine. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely, . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>National Advertising Sales Manager</PARA>
<PARA>This action is a little like shutting the gate after the horse has bolted, but I suppose that at least it is something. I trust that other magazines will follow the Women's Weekly and refuse advertisements placed by this shyster. I would, however, urge executives of respected magazines in Australia to try to retain that respect by closely vetting the background of all potential advertisers. I raised this matter tonight because I believe that confidence tricksters, or crooks as they should be called, should not be allowed to flourish unhindered. As I gain further evidence on shady or disreputable practices I shall have no hesitation in bringing the facts to the notice of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating a package of nine Bills relating to amendments to the sales tax legislation. The Bills effectively impose a sales tax on certain categories of goods that would otherwise have been exempt under the First Schedule to the Act. It is intended that a modest rate of tax of 2 1/2 per cent should be imposed on these goods. However, not all items under the First Schedule will attract sales tax at the rate of 2 1/2 per cent. For example, goods used by universities and non-profit schools will continue to be exempt. The same will apply to goods used for church services and to machinery, implements and apparatus for use in the mining industry or for the carrying out of mining operations. Goods which are used for subsequent manufacture and goods designed as aids to manufacture will also be exempt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The important point is that this package of nine Bills is an integral and essential part of the 1981 Budget strategy. We must recognise that twice these Bills have been returned by the Senate to the House of Representatives. The legislation was originally designed to come into effect on 1 January. It was our understanding on the Government side of the chamber that the Australian Democrats intended merely to delay this legislation. As a result steps were taken to defer the operative date from 1 January until 29 March, but that was not to be. In effect, not only the Liberal Party but also the Australian people have been conned by a change of mind, or an error of judgment, as it has been put. Twice, I think, the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Chipp) has had a change of mind on important issues which he has put down to errors of judgment. I just wonder how many times we will hear a repetition of the familiar phrase: 'Oh, we have made an error of judgment; we have had a change of mind'. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important that this legislation represents an attempt by this Government to spread the burden of tax, to move from a system of heavy reliance on personal income tax to a change in the tax mix. Whenever a country relies very heavily on high personal taxation, as we do in Australia, there is an inevitable move by some people to try to avoid or to evade their obligations to society. This means that those people such as pay-as-you-earn taxpayers who are not in a position to alter their tax responsibilities find themselves having to carry too high a burden-in fact an onerous burden-of tax. Some figures show that we are moving probably towards greater dependence than previously on pay-as-you- earn tax. For example, in the year 1969-70 pay-as-you-earn tax contributed about 33 per cent of the total revenue raised, but in 1981-82 that figure was estimated to rise to over 45 per cent. So, Australia basically has been low on indirect tax and high on personal tax. I think one of the messages put through by some of our opponents is that they tend to favour not only a lower indirect tax base but also a lower pay-as-you-earn base. At the same time they must recognise a need to maintain a high level of public sector spending to service the large requirements of social welfare, defence and a whole lot of other commitments. </PARA>
<PARA> I think all governments around the world, despite the attempts of some of their leaders to try to reduce the incidence of taxation, have found this to be a very difficult exercise. What we really have to do is to recognise our responsibilities to society while at the same time recognising the problems that are being incurred by a narrowing of the tax base. Over the years we have even seen a narrowing of the sales tax base. This series of Bills, which was a part of the overall integral Budget strategy, was an attempt to move away from a narrowing of the sales tax base over the years by a series of exemptions and reclassifications which effectively reduced the amount of money that the Federal Government was receiving from the sales tax area. The Government believed that of all the measures to try to widen the tax base, the sales tax medium was perhaps the most efficient and the most equitable. It saw this as a method of restoring some degree of equity. Most of the inquiries into income tax have agreed with this tenor of thought. For example, the Asprey Taxation Review Committee recommended the widening of this tax base. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the announcement by the Australian Democrats in recent days has really come as quite a disappointment to the majority of the people who supported them. Undoubtedly no taxes are popular. Undoubtedly the Democrats relied for their change of mind upon the fact that public opinion polls showed that these taxes were not popular with the electorate. The public opinion polls supported that thesis. I suppose that one would find that public opinion polls by and large would be very much against any sort of revenue raising. I think people to some extent like to have their cake and eat it too. They want the benefits of the social welfare system that the Government provides, but at the same time they want to see their hip pockets enlarged by higher take home pay. This is not always possible, but we have to try to establish a high degree of equity. To that end the Government is embarking on the right sort of program by trying to counter all these tax avoiding and evading schemes and at the same time altering the tax mix. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to quote from the Mercury newspaper of 9 October 1980. I think that, despite people's attitudes towards sales tax, the Democrats have really let us down. I think many people put a great deal of store on the so-called honesty of the Democrats. Many people remember the message from their mothers while they were nursed on her knee: 'My son, make sure you are a man of integrity. Make sure you are a man of your word and stick to it'. Many people in Australia were saying: 'At last we believe we have found the party that is going to provide all round, without exception, this integrity'. As proof to the Australian people the Democrats provided affidavits in relation to not blocking certain monetary measures that were put forward by the lower House as, after all, this House is a House of review. They recognised the constitutional responsibilities. They pointed out the problems of 1975. They did not want to embroil the country in the sorts of difficulties that emerged from that situation in 1975. They said: ' We are going to wipe the slate clean. We are not going to have this sort of problem. We will act with a degree of honesty and integrity'. But what has happened? We have really been let down. This quotation from the Mercury of 9 October 1980 stated:</PARA>
<PARA> If the Democrats held the balance of power overnight, this could transform the whole parliamentary system. </PARA>
<PARA>What a transformation we have seen! The Australian electorate saw to it that the Democrats do hold the balance of power. But in holding this balance of power are they acting on the basis of political expediency or are they exercising integrity? The majority of people who supported the Democrats must be tinged with a little sadness. Basically they were good Australian citizens who were looking for high ideals in politics. I think they have been let down. Right across the spectrum the Democrats were very strong on the view that they would act properly and that it was their responsibility to defer but not finally to toss out these Budget Bills. Even the Courier-Mail of 2 September quoted Dr Michael Macklin as saying that the Australian Democrat senators acted properly in refusing to join the Labor Party's attempt to defeat the sales tax legislation in the Budget, even though they were under considerable pressure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have one or two items which I think are relevant to the dicussion here to night. That was a fine sentiment; it went down very well within the electorate. A number of people on our side may have said: 'Hurrah, this is great stuff for Australian politics'. Now I think they will be very dismayed to see this complete change of heart on the basis of political expediency. Had the Democrats taken that stance and had they passed the Bills, as they said they would and as we relied on, I think many on our side, despite the fact that we might have lost $79m in the meantime, would have accepted it as a political ploy that they could employ in the upper House. But we found that the situation was a complete reversal. I feel sorry for these people who went to press but somehow have had their arms twisted by someone within the party machine saying: 'No, boys, we can get away with it. We can use the excuse that the people are now with us'. But are they with the Democrats? Probably, temporarily a few may have been. The people who write to the Democrats demanding everything may have thought it was a good thing. I wonder how the thinking Australians will view this. The Democrats signed affidavits. They did not want the country pushed into turmoil but wanted some check on Liberal and National Country Party enthusiasm in some areas. I think people recognise that, after all , the government of a country should reside in the province of the lower House where the Liberal and National Country parties have a clear majority. The Democrats have had a change of heart. Their leader has had a number of changes of heart. He had one in 1975 and he has had one now. We wonder how many others we will have to face in future. This must be the nagging question that the Democrats have to overcome to restore their credibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Great store has been put on the cost of this package of measures to low income earners. It has been mentioned that these Bills are intended to raise $330m in a full year and $132m in the first part year. The losses to revenue will be compounded at a time of an overrun Budget situation. One could possibly make some excuse for the Democrats for adopting this attitude if more revenue had come in than was necessary or if we were cutting our expenses more than we had budgeted to do. It would not then be necessary to raise this extra money. But the Democrats have hit the Government at a time when it, the Treasury and the coffers are not in a position to afford any cut in taxation revenue. They have deliberately taken their stand within a few days of an announcement of a severe increase in the deficit. They have said: 'We now have the Government in a corner . We will squeeze it hard'. It comes back to the question of political expediency. I would have thought that the honourable thing to do would have been to consider the alternative situation to see whether we had an overrun of revenue or whether we were cutting costs and recouping revenue in that way. But the leader of the Democrats decided that Mr Fraser, the Prime Minister, and the Treasurer, Mr Howard, were in a tight corner on the question of revenue. He said : 'We will push them and squeeze them into the ground.'</PARA>
<PARA> These Bills provide for a modest increase of 2 1/2 per cent on a range of services. What will that mean to the ordinary person? On a summer frock costing about $20 it will probably mean an increase in price of 50c. My colleague in the other place, Mr Cadman, cited the case of the building industry. Workers in that industry recently had an 18 per cent wage increase which would have added $3,600 to the cost of the family home. There was not much of a squeal about that but there has been a heck of a squeal about the tax of 2 1/2 per cent on building supplies which will effectively add about $500 to the cost of a family home. Not a word has been said about the movements in land prices or the added cost to the family home of $3,500 as a result of the wage increase. The focus has really been on the 2 1/2 per cent sales tax which people think sounds a heck of a lot. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to recognise also that the States are missing out on this revenue. They get a fair whack of the revenue raised by means of sales tax. The Democrats' decision comes at a time when State revenues are certainly under pressure. We read this daily. My State has particular problems. New South Wales and Victoria have problems which have been highlighted as a result of elections in those two States. It must be recognised by the Democrats' that they are cutting off revenue, a large portion of which is due to the States. As we are a States House one wonders whether it is responsible to cut off deliberately revenue to the States at a time when they can ill afford to sacrifice revenue of this nature. Therefore, one must ask whether a responsible attitude has been taken. The States have responsibilities to the people. After all, they are very much closer to people than the Commonwealth is. This is something that the Democrats recognise. They believe that they are grass roots politicians and that the issues have to go to the people. </PARA>
<PARA> Who are the people who are being affected by their decision? That decision means that it will not be easy to introduce tax cuts, certainly of the size that many of us were hoping for. Some people believe that the greater dependence on indirect tax should have been associated with a hefty reduction in income tax. But as a result of changes in the whole taxation mix the wage earners and the people who are contributing their fair share of tax to Australian society-these are the ones I am concerned about, particularly the pay-as-you-earn taxpayers- will now not get the tax cuts that might otherwise have been derived. How can the Treasurer and the Government plan the finances of this Government and this nation in circumstances in which they are uncertain whether the Senate will pass the necessary taxing legislation? This raises serious questions. The ability of a government to govern is now dependent on the whims or attitudes of a very small number of people in this House and how they view certain legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How in fairness can Mr Howard or the Prime Minister attempt to bring in responsible taxing measures or even cost cutting measures in an environment of such high uncertainty? They cannot predict what the situation will be. It is no way to be able to govern a country when a government is certain that it will get the numbers in one place but when the members of the other chamber say: 'We will hive off that cost cutting measure and we will disallow this revenue raising item'. It raises tremendous constitutional problems for any government in future, whatever its political persuasion. We have to recognise that certain constitutional amendments may be necessary to overcome the situation, otherwise we will have a high level of instability in government. It will not be easy for our side of politics to get three senators up from each of the States at the next half Senate election, in which case after 1984, other things being equal and taking normal expectations into account, instability in this place could continue for a number of years. I believe that it is not in the best interests of Australia or in the best interests of Australian taxpayers to have a situation whereby the Government cannot really be judged on its merits. This is the situation in which the Fraser Government now finds itself. I think it would be far better for the Australian electorate to be able to judge a government on its package and what went right or wrong during its term of office. We are now in a situation of complete compromise and a rejection of normal business of government of an important nature because, after all, the raising of the revenue is particularly important to our social responsibilities and--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst it might be a laudable objective, unfortunately at the real test that the Australian Democrats had to face up to, they fell. As many political parties around the world do, they chose political expendiency rather than integrity. This so-called error of judgment really was a recognition that they were essentially torn, between their principles and, what one leading commentator called, their opportunism. Unfortunately, they fell for opportunism on the basis that they thought it was politically popular to knock these sorts of taxes. The raising of any sort of taxes is basically unpopular. I believe that, in the long term, the Democrats have misjudged their mark and the mood of the Australian electorate, which is looking for these high principles. All along the line the Democrats were adamant that they would not change their minds. In fact, Senator Haines, when speaking in the Budget debate, spoke of the need to maintain principles. She said the Democrats would not be roughed up by the Australian Labor Party and forced into a situation to which which some of our colleagues on the opposite benches were trying to guide them. I must give full marks to the Labor Party. It did take it a long time to encourage the Democrats to come alongside in their views.</PARA></TALK.START>

The credit for this opposition has not been given to the Australian Labor Party. It was determined and firm in its views all along the line. In the newspaper headlines who takes the credit for this situation? Not the Australian Labor Party even though it was steadfastly opposed to this legislation from the word go. There is no doubt that the Australian electorate knows where the Labor Party stands on this matter. Members of this new party-based on integrity and rightness of principles-have now taken the political opportunist line of wavering because of what they believe is a short term gain. However, in the long term, I believe that the Democrats have misread the mood of the Australian electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us consider some quotations. Senator Macklin said that by taking the stance that it did Labor also pledged not to block Supply. He said that it abandoned all preference of political principles. So people in glass houses should not throw stones. The Australian Democrats condemned the Australian Labor Party for its supposed lack of principles. In the course of going around the electorate during the break the Democrats have abandoned their political princples. Many people may have thought that the Democrats' attack on the Australian Labor Party was unfair. Senator Chipp said to Derryn Hinch when referring to certain problems:</PARA>
<PARA> It threw this country into turmoil. It divided the country. Although the Senate has that power, we opted of our own free will as Democrats, to say 'we might have that power to do it, but we believe it wrong for the Senate to do it', so we virtually abrogated that power that we have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The amount of income tax collected from wage and salary earners is not recorded separately, but the income tax revenue figures show Pay as You Earn collections, i.e., amounts of tax instalment remittances and proceeds from the sale of tax stamps as well as PAYE refunds. PAYE collections in 1975-76 net of refunds made during that financial year amounted to $7,020m.</PARA>
<PARA> Some tax is also payable by salary and wage earners on assessment where the tax instalments that have been deducted are insufficient to cover the tax payable on the total income. It is noted that, because some PAYE tax instalments are applied against income other than salary and wages, PAYE collections to this extent overstate the tax payable on salaries and wages subject to instalments. It should be mentioned that PAYE refunds generally related to amounts of instalments deducted in the previous financial year.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Net PAYE collections in 1981-82 are estimated at $17,255m. Consistent with the 1981-82 Budget assumptions regarding the expected level of the Consumer Price Index in 1981-82 net PAYE collections in 1975-76 prices as measured by the consumer price index would be $9,586m.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The National Accounts estimate of wages, salaries and supplements for 1980- 81 is $71,332m. Consistent with the 1981-82 Budget assumptions as regards average earnings and employment wages, salaries and supplements should reach $82 ,580m in 1981-82, some $41,000m more than the 1975-76 National Accounts estimate .</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Net PAYE collections in 1981-82 adjusted to 1975-76 prices are estimated to exceed 1975-76 net PAYE collections by 36.6 per cent. Wages, salaries and supplements in 1981-82 are estimated to exceed those paid in 1975-76 by 98.6 per cent.</PARA>

Details of the ceilings for individual departments were stated at page 90 of the Public Service Board's Report to Parliament for 1980-81. Those ceilings may need to be varied in the light of RCF reviews or investigations currently being undertaken or yet to be commenced, or in the light of the disposal of Commonwealth assets. Where further studies already undertaken have shown that variation of ceilings is warrented appropriate adjustments have been made.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (b) Departments' funding requirements for these categories of expenditure for 1981-82 were reassessed during the Budget process in the light of the Review decisions and other relevant considerations and the outcome of those reassessments was reflected in the bids for, and decisions on, funding provided in the 1981-82 Budget. It is not practicable to separately identify the effects on departments of the specific decisions mentioned as distinct from the effects of other considerations bearing on Budget funding decisions, all of which were reflected in the estimates tabled with the 1981-82 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> (3), (7), (8), (9) and (10) In answer to Question No. 723 from the honourable senator it was made clear that the Review of Commonwealth Functions was not primarily an exercise in cost cutting. The focus of the review was on streamlining and fining down Commonwealth operations by withdrawing from areas more appropriately handled by the States and private enterprise and rationalising a number of Commonwealth activities. While eventual ongoing savings compared with the cost of continuing programs on the basis of then existing policies were estimated to be 'of the order of $560m' it was explained in that answer why more precise figuring was not provided at the time and that the figures did not make allowance for savings of a more diffuse kind. It is in the nature of estimates that they may not be completely accurate and that the degree of inaccuracy, if any, may not be precisely known.</PARA>
<PARA> The effect of RCF decisions on estimates of budget outlays is combined with that of other Government decisions (including the 1981-82 budget measures) and with changes in underlying parameters affecting estimates. It is not practicable to separate out the financial effects of each of the many interacting influences on the financial estimates. To attempt such an exercise would involve a major effort on the part of all departments and authorities which I am not prepared to authorise.</PARA>
<PARA> I am able to inform the honourable senator, however, that, taken as a whole, the savings on the 1981-82 forward estimates achieved through the current budget (which reflects effects of a range of RCF and other decisions) were well in excess of the figure of $560m estimated as the order of ongoing savings eventually to arise from the RCF exercise. The government will, of course, also continue to pursue further savings through the implementation of those RCF decisions currently outstanding.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's statement of 30 April indicated an expected total staffing reduction of 16,000-17,000. The rate at which staff savings will be achieved can be expected to vary widely as between one decision and another. The implementation of some decisions will inevitably take much longer than others, for example the disposal of Commonwealth assets, the review of the Defence organisation, the Australia Post and Telecom reviews. Savings possibilities will in some cases only come clear as reviews proceed. The Government is closely monitoring the achievement of savings against particular decisions.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) As at end of October 1981, approximately 270 of the Government's decisions arising from the Review had been implemented or were close to final implementation, of a total of some 350 decisions. Implementation of the remainder is being pursued by responsible Ministers and is oversighted by a Cabinet Committee chaired by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) and (6) The process of Government administration constantly involves implementation of decisions; the implementation of RFC decisions has in general proceeded as part of that process rather than with seperate resources. Seperate records have not been kept of the resources applied to implementation of RCF decisions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 18 November 1981 I tabled copies of the Certificate of Population of the Chief Australian Electoral Officer and his Determination which indicated that there was no change in the representation entitlements of the States. As a consequence there is no call for any mandatory redistribution. It is true that in Queensland conditions exist which meet the criteria set out in sub-paragraph 25 (2) (b) (i) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. However, the wording of the Act is also perfectly clear in that it indicates that given the existence of those particular circumstances a redistribution may be undertaken. There is no requirement to do so and the law does not envisage that a redistribution in these circumstances is mandatory or necessarily warranted. The question is one for Government consideration.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As mentioned in the report, Telecom already applies the marginal cost pricing principle in providing for discounted off-peak STD rates. In addition, it is further studying the implications of extending the application of this principle . However, in the circumstances recommended in the report, that is discounted connection fees in areas where spare exchange equipment capacity exists, Telecom 's view is that there is limited scope for applying this approach because it would only be possible if there were a surplus of all the network components necessary for service in the particular area. In addition, Telecom is required to publish details of rentals and charges which it determines in the Commonwealth Gazette and this statutory requirement would inhibit the flexibility necessary for the Report's proposal to be effective.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom is mindful also of the possible customer reaction to a departure from its traditional non-discriminatory approach of prescribing uniform charges for all subscribers or for all subscribers within a particular classification.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) As part of my Department's 1980-81 vehicle purchase program, 84 Datsun 200B sedans and station sedans were purchased as replacements for vehicles due for disposal in Queensland. Three of these vehicles were delivered with radios and, as the Department's purchase contract with the Nissan Motor Co. (Aust.) specifically excluded radios, they were returned to the supplier, Ira L. Berk, to have them removed. There was no charge for the removal.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Radios are usually standard equipment in Datsun 200B vehicles but the Department's specification, when tenders were called, specifically requested the deletion of radios. The subsequent purchase contract with the Nissan Motor Co. ( Aust.) excluded radios at a price reduction. Because the purchase price was based on the exclusion of radios the vehicles were returned to the supplier for their removal. Since September 1981, however, my Department's practice in this area has changed. Tender specifications no longer exclude radios where the type of vehicle being sought normally includes the provision of a radio as standard equipment. This change reflects general community attitudes and diminishing price reductions for the non-supply of radios.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) See (2) and (3).</PARA>
<PARA> (6) My Department is not aware of the current location of the radios.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (b) and (2) (b) The Electoral Agents' System is used to check the accuracy of individual entries in the rolls in remote and/or sparsely populated areas. This is not undertaken however, as in urban areas, by visiting residences. The system involves sending lists of electors to appointed agents whose familiarity with an area is such that they might reasonably be expected to have some knowledge of the movement of electors within their locality. These agents traditionally are postmasters, teachers, policemen et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA> The information recorded by agents will either confirm the enrolment records or will indicate that an elector recorded as residing at that habitation has now left. In addition the agents will report any new residents who appear to be qualified for enrolment and whose names do not appear on the record. They also report alterations required in respect of the particulars of an elector-for example, change of name, change of address, et cetera. Divisional returning officers are required to follow up all reports received from electoral agents.</PARA>
<PARA> As habitations are not reviewed under the Electoral Agency System there are no statistics available to answer these parts of the honourable senator's question.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (a), (2) (a) and (3). The honourable senator appears to have a misunderstanding about habitation reviews. The aim of these reviews is to help to keep electoral rolls up-to-date by checking current entries on the roll against the names of persons actually living at addresses. The reviews do not operate solely to remove the names of electors from electoral rolls; they are concerned just as much at helping unenrolled but eligible voters have their names placed on the roll. As was pointed out in the answer given to the honourable senator's Question No. 856, in the same period in which the names of some 290,000 electors were removed from the rolls, 1.5m names were added. These of course were not all new arrivals in Australia or persons turning 18, but took into account people who had moved from one address to another, or whose names had been removed from one address by the required objection process but re- entered on the roll at their new address.</PARA>
<PARA> Much of the information being sought by the honourable senator is not maintained or needed by the Australian Electoral Office in the form in which the honourable senator asks. For example, in Question No. 856 the total number of hours worked by Habitation Review Officers for each month in each federal division in the 12 months to December 1980 was sought. As was pointed out in reply, review officers are paid by habitations reviewed and not by hours spent. In order to assist the honourable senator an attempt was made to provide him with information in the form asked for, but because of the basis of payment which gave no direct indication of time spent and because of the various densities of habitation within areas and the mixture of such areas within and between divisions, that information quite clearly could only be based on a very broad estimate. In seeking subsequently to verify further the estimates which had been made, the Electoral Office found that two of the States, Western Australia and Tasmania, had in fact interpreted the honourable senator's question more broadly than had the other States and had included in their figures not only the estimated time of habitation review officers in the field, but also of casual employees processing habitation review data in the divisional offices. Amended time estimates based only on field work are now provided in respect of those two States:</PARA>

<PARA> With this current question, No. 1374, neither statistics nor records are maintained in a way which gives ready answers to some of the questions asked or which are easily translatable into the form sought by the honourable senator. In addition, because of the way in which the question is framed there is a need to exercise care in interpreting and using the information provided. The question asks for the number of habitations reviewed in each electoral division in 1980. The position is that habitation reviews are conducted by the Australian Electoral Office not by calendar year, but by financial year. Therefore providing the information in the form which the question seeks can have a number of consequences when it comes to its use and interpretation. For example, a habitation which has been recorded as having been reviewed twice in 1980 could have been so reviewed because it is located in a new housing development with a high growth rate and it has been thought advisable to cover that area twice in the one review period or it could also mean that the habitation was visited once in each of two successive reviews, 1979-80 and 1980-81. Statistics will not give the reasons. Again, habitations which were not recorded as having been reviewed at all in 1980 could have been reviewed in the first half of the 1979-1980 review or in the second half of the 1980-81 review. Again the statistics asked for will not show this. The honourable senator will need to bear these points in mind in using the following statistical information from the Australian Electoral Office:</PARA>

<PARA> The Australian Electoral Office has advised that it is its aim to conduct a full habitation review each financial year. However as the honourable senator will appreciate it is not always possible to achieve this result. For example, elections and redistributions (Commonwealth or State) especially in the joint roll States can cause interruption to the review process. A review could also be curtailed in situations where funds, even though initially appropriated on the basis of a full review, have been eroded by escalating costs. Therefore if circumstances necessitate, a review may be undertaken or completed on a selective basis, for example, high growth areas such as new housing developments or areas of high mobility of population, or areas which have been the longest without review. Essentially, because of their knowledge of their divisions, the selection decisions will lie with the Divisional Returning Officers.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) to (5) During this year the Government had implemented policies, including the introduction of legislation which the Parliament has passed, directed at increasing the level of competition within the aviation industry and particularly between Trans Australia Airlines and Ansett. Consistent with those policies the Government considers that decisions relating to aircraft acquisitions are the commercial responsibility of the airline involved. Under the Independent Air Fares Committee Act the first class and economy fares of Ansett and TAA are matched and therefore there is no guarantee that one airline could recoup excessive capital expenditure. As the other matters raised by this question relate to the decisions of a commercial organisation, I do not consider it appropriate to respond to them.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator Messner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) From time to time, problems do arise for air traffic controllers at Brisbane Airport due to the proximity of Amberley and Archerfield control zones. These problems are similar to those encountered at other capital city airports. These problems are overcome by employing control techniques to provide an orderly and expeditious flow of traffic.</PARA>
<PARA> During the hot summer months 'return' images, commonly known as angels, appear within Brisbane radar coverage under certain atmospheric conditions. Similar angel activity is encountered on other radars in Australia and overseas. These angels at Brisbane are not considered excessive. The Brisbane radar system employs operating parameters which reduce the angel returns to a minimum and its performance compares favourably in this respect with current 'state of the art' primary radar systems.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The current Brisbane primary radar provides a twelve second update. This rate of data renewal is considered to be adequate for safe and efficient control of aircraft at Brisbane at the level of traffic expected for some years to come.</PARA>
<PARA> ARTS (Automated Radar Terminal System) is the name given to the system employed by the Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration in the United States of America for airport (terminal) air traffic control within 60 nautical miles of an airport and, with the exception of the control tower, uses displays which must be viewed in 'dark room' conditions. ARTS will not be provided for Brisbane because of more modern system, as has already been ordered for Adelaide and Melbourne, is planned.</PARA>
<PARA> A terminal radar with four second update and a more modern radar display system (providing callsign and altitude readout on new display facilities) are planned for commissioning in the time period of 1985-88 in order to allow continued safe and efficient control of expected movements at Brisbane.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. The Keperra Post Office is to close when the new Ferny Hills Post Office building is ready for occupancy, probably in February 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Australia Post has advised me that it has given further consideration to the proposed closure of Keperra Post Office and that it still considers that the closure is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post is building a new official post office at Ferny Hills to replace the existing non-official office in that suburb. Ferny Hills is considered to be a more suitable location as a base for the postal delivery group serving the areas of Ferny Hills, Arana Hills and Keperra and the postal delivery group is to be transferred from leased premises in Keperra to Ferny Hills when the new post office building is ready for occupancy. This is expected to occur in February 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> With the removal of the delivery group, Keperra Post office will have lost a major function and, as there are alternative post offices within a reasonable distance, it has been decided that the office should close concurrent with the opening of the Ferny Hills Post Office.</PARA>
<PARA> Arana Hills and Mitchelton Post Offices are 1.6 kilometres and two kilometres respectively from Keperra Post Office and each of these offices transacts more counter business than Keperra and is at a location which has a larger shopping centre.

<PARA> Australia Post considers that the postal needs of Keperra residents will be reasonably well met after closure of the office. In addition to alternative post offices nearby, a street posting box will be provided in the shopping centre and stamps may be purchased at two licensed stamp vendors already operating in the centre.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Newcastle District Telecommunications Manager did state that delays in household telephone installations were expected to worsen because of demands by expanding industry.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) At the time of the article, 813 applications were held for telephone services in the Newcastle District Office, that could not be served under three months because of insufficient pairs of cable or shortages of exchange equipment . The position showed some improvement by the end of October with the deferred applicants reduced to 628 including 62 waiting for extensions to telephone exchange equipment. The estimated delays indicates that of these, 67 will be connected within six months, 49 will be connected between six and 12 months, 282 will be connected between 12 and 18 months, and 230 will be connected between 18 months and two years.</PARA>
<PARA> The forecast for telephone demand in the Newcastle District indicates that more than 11,600 new telephones will be required for business and domestic customers during 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Representations have been received from groups concerning the grade of service being provided for the Morisset-Cooranbong region. In reply to the latest of these representations, the organisation concerned was advised that senior Telecom officers would be prepared to attend a public meeting in the area , should it be considered necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The emergency service number '000' is accessible from all customers connected to the Cooranbong Exchange. Telecom advises that it has been unable to obtain any evidence of any Cooranbong residents who have complained that '000' cannot be reached.</PARA>
<PARA> Callers from outlying areas are encouraged by Telecom to dial the emergency service direct. The telephone directory listing Cooranbong customers has spaces allocated inside the front cover, for customers to record their own emergency service telephone numbers. This applies particularly to Bush Fire Brigades where details of changes in volunteers are not always made known to the '000' operator . Direct dialling has the added advantage of avoiding network congestion, in cases where the emergency service is connected to the same telephone exchange as the caller.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Cooranbong telephone exchange is of modern design and is capable of providing a satisfactory grade of service. However, like many other exchanges with a high demand for telephone services the network switching equipment is under strain during peak traffic conditions to provide switching paths for all traffic. In these instances calls to '000' experience the same grade of service as other traffic during those times.</PARA>

Thus, in circumstances of heavy demand as have applied in recent years, some orders are not met until relatively late in the year.

<PARA> (1) Yes, the National Plan to Combat Pollution of the Sea by Oil takes into account coastal oil spills of major proportions.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Measures have been tested by exercises where management and communications procedures are tried out and equipment exercises where pollution combat equipment is deployed during simulated oil spills. In addition, contingency plans are revised and updated following actual incidents.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Measures consist of stockpiles of oil dispersant and pollution control and recovery equipment, strategically located at all State capital cities and some other ports. Pollution Committees are established in all States and are advised and assisted by Department of Transport marine pollution specialists. The Australian Coastal Surveillance Centre receives pollution reports and disseminates them for appropriate action as part of its coastal surveillance role.</PARA>

<PARA> (6) Not all expenditure on the videotex project has yet been brought to account . It includes expenditure necessary to determine operational procedures in whatever videotex system may be introduced into Australia. The cost of the project up to 20.11.81 was $524,472 (or $770,974 with overheads).</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The task force was disbanded on 30 October but will be reinstated if necessary when firm proposals for the introduction of videotex on the lines of announced Government policy are before Telecom. Two members resigned and the remainder were re-deployed within Telecom on functions appropriate to their designations and qualifications.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) For some years prior to the establishment of the task force, research and commercial staff studied the development of, and experimented with, the videotex service as part of their normal duties to keep abreast of the latest technological advances. As such, the cost of this work was considered to be inappropriate to be allocated against the videotex project. Videotex is an on- going commitment and further expenditure will be involved when a system is introduced into Australia involving Telecom services.</PARA>

<PARA> I wrote to the Chairman of the Administrative Review Council on 16 December 1980 informing the Council why this particular recommendation had not been accepted. The substantive parts of that letter were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security and I gave very careful consideration to the views expressed by the Council but we were unable to accept the Council's recommendation. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal (Social Services Act) Regulations (Amendment), which have now been made, have been drawn on the basis that for the time being the Social Security Appeals Tribunals are the most suitable initial avenue for external review of the vast majority of Social Security decisions. In our view, it is only in exceptional cases, where it is clear that an important principle of general application is involved and the case would ultimately need to be determined by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in any event, that an appeal should be able to be taken directly to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal without prior consideration by a Social Security Appeals Tribunal. The Minister and I were concerned to ensure that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal should not be seen as the general review tribunal for all cases and I would not wish to see the Tribunal President forced to determine large numbers of applications for direct access to the Tribunal. I was also concerned that the Council's recommendation might give rise to difficulties in relation to the operation of sections 14 and 15 of the Social Services Act 1947.</PARA>
<PARA> I would add that, notwithstanding our decision not to accept the Council's recommendation in this case, it will, of course, be open to a person dissatisfied with a decision of the Director-General of Social Services ultimately to take his case to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. But in the absence of a certificate from the Director-General he will only be able to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal after his case has first been considered by a Social Security Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Corporation aims to bring the parties together to attempt to reach an amicable settlement. Corporation staff attempt to establish fact from documents and by inspection of the product in dispute. The number of complaints received by the Corporation is minor in relation to the volume of meat exported.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. The Corporation has regional offices in London, Bahrain, Singapore, Tokyo and New York. Staff of these offices undertake inspections and enquiries to assist in settling of trade complaints arising within their region.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The report is submitted to AMLC Sydney, then passed to the exporter involved. In cases where the AMLC officer involved is confident that there is no valid claim he may inform the importer to that effect. If the importer requests a copy of the report such request is referred to the exporter and unless there is a sound commercially sustainable objection, a copy is provided to the importer. A copy is often supplied by the exporter to the importer in the course of their negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA> The report is directed initially to the exporter, first because the AMLC considers the exporter to be the responsible party, and secondly, because a prime function of the Corporation is to assist the Australian meat export industry in the conduct and promotion of its business.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) AMLC could seldom be confident that it has full knowledge of all the facts of a commercial transaction between the contracting parties. Consequently, it considers that legal action to settle commercial disputes is a matter for the parties. AMLC product inspection reports, on occasions, have been made available for use in such legal proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The AMLC initially contacts the exporter seeking a responsible approach to satisfaction of the contract arrangements. Should the facts reveal exporter negligence in negotiating or meeting product specifications, AMLC may place the exporter under quality assurance surveillance for a specified period.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Yes in most cases where it appears that the exporter is at fault. See also answers to questions 5 and 7.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The exporter's licence can be suspended or cancelled if he is found to have breached a condition of his licence.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Only one licence has been cancelled. The cancellation was effective from 1 September 1981. In each year several licences not being utilised were not renewed.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) Licence No. 283 was cancelled for a breach of a condition to which the licence was subject, namely an AMLC direction issued pursuant to S. 11 of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act requiring each licensee to '. . . ensure that the class, quality, standard, grading and preparation of any meat for export in his name is as specified in any agreement (whether in writing or otherwise) for the sale or supply of that meat'. The breach concerned the inclusion of horse meat in an export consignment to the USA.</PARA>

<PARA> (1), (2) and (3) In August 1981 an allegation was made that a person had apparently attempted to secure an electoral enrolment, to which he was not entitled, for an address in the Federal division of Richmond which encompasses the New South Wales State electorate of Byron. The Australian Electoral Office referred the matter to the Australian Federal Police for investigation. In the event there was no impropriety.

<PARA> In November 1981 allegations were received by the Australian Electoral Office regarding a further seven apparent enrolment irregularities in the division of Richmond.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am not aware of any 'recent events' which have had major lasting effects on the Queensland beef industry. The meat substitution matter interfered with export marketing for a short time, particularly to the United States of America, but the United States market price quickly returned to previous levels once Australian meat was released on to that market again. The other effect flowing from that matter is that meatworks are now incurring some extra cost from the additional security measures which have been imposed. Another recent event was the Commonwealth meat inspector strike which brought export meat production to a halt for one week during November.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Any Minister for Primary Industry, by virtue of his portfolio responsibilities, is likely to be acquainted with some members of the United Graziers Association and of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation.

<PARA> Commonwealth funding to/through the States in respect of general community health services (including drug addiction and alcoholism services) is now by way of general revenue payments to the States, rather than by way of specific- purpose grants as in the past. However, this change in the funding arrangements has not affected the monetary level of financial assistance by the Commonwealth. Commonwealth funding in respect of general community health services has been maintained at the same real level; this financial year, the States will receive general revenue payments equal to the specific-purpose grants made last year, plus 10 per cent to allow for cost increases.</PARA>
<PARA> Because the States have complete flexibility in how they utilise these general revenue payments, it is not possible for the Commonwealth to indicate what amounts will be allocated by the States in 1981-82 to agencies providing services solely or primarily related to drug dependence and/or alcoholism.</PARA>
<PARA> Total payments by the Commonwealth direct to national organisations providing such services will be approximately $908,000 in 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the expenditure given above, payments made by the Commonwealth under hospital cost sharing arrangements with States have covered the Commonwealth's share of hospital based drug treatment services in the States. However the amounts involved are not identifiable. Neither is the amount that will be directed to those services in 1981-82.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) State and non-government authorities participating in the transition program are required to allocate funds consistent with the guidelines for the program which have been agreed between the Commonwealth and the States. The guidelines do not specify criteria for selection of schools to be funded. They indicate, however, that the primary concern of the program is for young people who leave school each year with poor employment prospects. The program should provide education and training with a work orientation, where appropriate, for these young people and also tackle the problem of those in the schools who are likely to be in similar difficulties when it comes their turn to leave. The guidelines indicate that proposals for funding in the school sector may encompass a range of activities including provision of alternative courses; career guidance and counselling, work experience projects, teacher development and curriculum development. The guidelines say that while the boundary between transition education and general education in schools is not easy to draw, it is necessary for program funding purposes for proposals to focus on skills and/or activities clearly relevant to the transition of young people to working life.</PARA>
<PARA> In allocating funds to individual schools, State authorities should take into account a number of factors including regional and local characteristics such as youth unemployment rates. However, it must be kept in mind that transition education in secondary schools is not primarily concerned with training young people for specific jobs in the workforce. Therefore, the local levels of youth unemployment are less significant for determining distribution of funds among schools than is the case with the provision of transition courses in technical and further education colleges.</PARA>
<PARA> I will make a copy of the program guidelines available to the honourable senator.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) States are expected to observe the various criteria included in the program guidelines in distributing the available funds.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There are many instances where transition program funds are being used to expand or improve existing State transition programs. However, States may not use transition program funds to substitute for activities previously funded from State sources.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Acting Minister for Health, I provide the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am aware of recent concern about the use of urea formaldehyde foam insulation sprayed into buildings.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Canada has banned the use of urea formaldehyde foam insulation until the government is satisfied that manufacturers are able to produce a product which is stable and can be used safely.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I am unable to confirm that there was such a survey in Connecticut. However , two scientific papers concerning surveys conducted in Connecticut refer to the investigation of a total of 173 complaints which alleged associated health effects. It is reported that individuals in 65 per cent of the households investigated continued to experience symptoms an average of 2.3 years after installation of the foam.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Similar symptoms have been claimed in Australia and have been brought to the attention of the National Health and Medical Research Council.</PARA>
<PARA> The matter has already been considered by the relevant committees of the Council and on their advice the Council has established an expert working party to investigate the potential health effects of the use of the foam in Australia. Data is being assembled for consideration by the Working Party in early February 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) It is not known whether these symptoms are due to emissions of formaldehyde gas but they are similar to those classically associated with formaldehyde toxicity.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) This insulation is being used in Australia. However, as far as can be ascertained urea formaldehyde foam insulation has not been used in major Commonwealth buildings.</PARA>

<PARA> Why was it necessary to purchase a house in the suburb of East Killara which, I understand, is in New South Wales?</PARA>
<PARA> Why was it necessary to purchase a house for $140,000 to accomodate a senior defence officer of the Army?</PARA>
<PARA> Are there any adjacent military establishments which would require the purchase of a house in this prime location?</PARA>
<PARA> What is the normal cost of building a house to defence standards on government land for senior officers?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The house was acquired by the Department of Defence for use by a senior Navy officer appointed to any one of the several naval establishments in the vicinity of Sydney Harbour. There is an acute shortage of housing which is reasonably close to such establishments, and which meets the standards appropriate for senior Service officers.</PARA>
<PARA> The house was transferred to the Department of Defence from a Commonwealth authority which previously owned it (the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation). The transfer followed procedures which normally apply in such situations: After notification that the Corporation no longer required the house, the Department of Administrative Services asked other Commonwealth departments if they had a need for it, before considering its disposal. Thus, although the house was transferred to the Department of Defence at its taxation valuation ($140,000), the acquisition involved no additional outlay by the Commonwealth, in real terms.</PARA>
<PARA> The current cost of building a house to standards appropriate for senior officers is around $54,000. To this would be added the cost of land, which would vary with the location.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 22 September 1981 (Hansard, pages 849-850) Senator Coleman asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Health, a question without notice concerning the high rate of epidural anaesthetics used in childbirth, and the possible side effects of local anaesthetics on the newborn child.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> It is claimed that epidural anaesthesia using local anaesthetics can render childbirth painless and has advantages in protecting the unborn child (foetus) from undesirable side effects which may result from over breathing by the mother. It is also claimed to reduce the adverse effects of stress on the muscle tone of the womb. In expert hands, using carefully selected anaesthetic agents at optimal doses, epidural anaesthesia can thus be argued to be of benefit to both mother and child.</PARA>
<PARA> The Secretariat of the National Health and Medical Research Council has recently carried out a preliminary search of the scientific literature relating to the possible effects of local anaesthetic agents on the foetus and the newborn child. The search has indicated that under certain circumstances adverse effects on the foetus and/or the newborn children have been reported which may be attributable to the use of local anaesthetic agents administered during childbirth by a variety of techniques, including the epidural route.</PARA>
<PARA> The matter is, however, quite complex, and I agree that there would be an advantage to the community in having it subjected to proper scientific evaluation. Accordingly, I have arranged for the matter to be referred to the appropriate committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council for evaluation and report.</PARA>

<PARA> Is the Minister representing the Treasurer aware of the need in the community for the provision of adequate child care and pre-school facilities? Will the Government take steps to encourage the use and development of child care and pre-school facilities by making provision for tax deductibility of such pre- school, kindergarten and child care facilities?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Where a pre-school, kindergarten or child care centre is predominantly a school providing full-time education appropriate to the age of the child, a taxpayer may claim, as rebatable expenditure eligible for the concessional rebate of 32 cents in the dollar to the extent that the total rebatable expenditure exceeds $1590, that part of the fees paid to the centre which relates to the education component of the service provided by the centre, up to a maximum of $250 per child per year.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, where a public fund is established and maintained exclusively to provide money for the acquisition, construction or maintenance of a building used, or to be used, as a school by a government or public authority or by a society or association which is carried on otherwise than for the purposes of profit or gain to the individual members of that society or association, gifts of the value of two dollars or more to the funds are allowable deductions under the gift provisions of the income tax law. A fund established to provide for a building for use by a pre-school, kindergarten or child care centre as a school providing full-time education appropriate to the age of the children attending it, may qualify under this provision.</PARA>
<PARA> If, however, the honourable senator is proposing that an income tax deduction should be provided for expenses incurred by a parent or guardian for child care services provided by a pre-school, kindergarten or child care facility, this matter was considered by the Government in the deliberations preceding the 1981 -82 Budget. It was decided, however, that the budgetary position was such that it was not possible to include such a concession among the various proposals announced in the Budget speech.</PARA>

<PARA> I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Defence to the outstanding Defence statement made by the Minister for Defence in the House of Representatives yesterday with reference to the intention to build two FFG-type ships at the Williamstown Naval Dockyard subject to satisfactory resolution of a number of problems affecting productivity there. This is a delightful euphemism which, of course, we would expect from this Minister. Can the Minister give the House an assurance that unless all doubts about Williamstown Naval Dockyard being able to honour its contracts are removed, by the unions entering into a legally binding undertaking not to strike, indulge in bans or demarcation disputes, the Government will place the two FFG follow-on destroyer contracts with other Australian yards? In this regard, will the Minister include North Queensland Engineers and Agents, the builders of the Fremantle class ships, with other Australian yards?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of options open to the Government concerning the construction of follow-on destroyers including building them at Williamstown Naval Dockyard or ordering them from the United States. There is also the possibility of construction in another Australian shipyard.</PARA>
<PARA> The facilities at WND have been extensively modernised over the last few years and are well suited for building Naval vessels of the FFG type. The workforce has skills specifically related to destroyer construction and these skills are important for the support of the fleet.</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless the Government has made it clear that orders for ships from WND are conditional on improved productivity. Improvement in industrial relations is an essential part of this.</PARA>
<PARA> Should the Government decide to build FODs at a yard other than WND, consideration will be given to the other construction options including building the ships at North Queensland Engineers and Agents and other Australian shipyards.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided me with further information in answer to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA>
<PARA> Delays due to the flag of convenience bans have been as much as four months for vessels scheduled to load coal at Newcastle and Port Kembla.</PARA>
<PARA> The bans have resulted in the loss of some 2,000 ship days at a cost of about $25m. In addition to this, there could be costs related to the loss of coal export markets which would be difficult to quantify.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 22 October 1981 (Hansard, page 1537) Senator Watson asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs in the Senate, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, by stating that it has been rumored that there is some slack at the Industries Assistance Commission because of the shortage of references before Commission. In the past the efficiency of private industry has been the target of some comment. Recognising the Commission's expertise in this area, will the Government consider putting a request to the Commission to report upon the efficiency and cost effectiveness of transport by sea and the impact that these costs have on Australian industry and the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The IAC at this time has a very heavy workload. As well as having a number of industry specific references on hand it also has a number of major references with economy wide significance which are due for report early in 1982. These include the topics of general reductions in assistance to industry, budgetary assistance, export incentives and the customs bylaw system.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the particular question, in mid 1980 the Government asked Sir John Crawford to chair a committee of shipowner and union representatives aimed at identifying problems and suggesting ways to improve the commercial viability of Australian shipping.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has now received the Committee's report entitled ' Revitalisation of Australian Shipping-An Overview' and will be examining the report and discussing its recommendations with the shipping industry. In these circumstances, a reference to the IAC on sea transport would be inappropriate at this time. I am advised that implementation of the 'Revitalisation' report would require significant changes in attitude by all parties to the industry, and to request a further report would impose unnecessary delays.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 22 October 1981 (Hansard, page 1538) Senator Reid asked me a question without notice concerning air services between Canberra and Sydney and their publicity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided the following information in response to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the number of cancellations of Canberra services I raised the matter with both Trans Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia and indicated in the strongest terms that such a practice is quite unacceptable to travellers and the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The airlines have indicated that the demand for air travel on the Canberra- Sydney route has dropped markedly since higher air fares were introduced following consideration of the Holcroft Report. To cater more adequately for this reduced demand, both airlines have reduced by about 10 per cent the scheduled capacity on the routes to and from Canberra in their timetables which commenced on 25 October 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the honourable senator's comments on advertising I understand the Airlines of New South Wales service introduced between Canberra and Sydney is being advertised. This, however, is a matter for the airline and I have no role in the corporate decisions which determine the amount of publicity to be given to each Ansett service.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 27 October 1981 (Hansard, page 1634) Senator Watson asked me a question without notice concerning the withdrawal of Trans Australia Airlines from F27 routes and whether such withdrawals inevitably mean TAA's future will be with large aircraft servicing the major cities of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> TAA has indicated for some time that many of its F27 services are unprofitable and require either cross-subsidisation or direct subsidy for services to continue, highlighting that services by other operators with smaller aircraft would be more suitable for these routes.</PARA>
<PARA> The transfer of these services to regional and commuter operators and the eventual phasing out of F27 aircraft from TAA's fleet will limit its ability to service some of the smaller centres. Based on the current position in regard to intrastate licensing in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia where TAA presently has no traffic rights, its present fleet planning provides for an eventual all jet fleet with a minimum aircraft size equivalent to the DC9. With this minimum aircraft size TAA will be capable of servicing some 30 major centres throughout Australia which together account for almost 94 per cent of scheduled passengers.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The possibility of modifying the existing terminal to cater for international traffic has been considered. The concept has the advantage to Trans Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia of co-locating the international operation with their domestic operation. However, it involves a continuation of the present unsatisfactory arrangement where furnishings are shifted before and after every international flight and requires closure of the present public area during international operations. It has no capacity for expansion and it would be almost impossible to allow use by operators other than TAA and Ansett. The proposal is less than desirable from an aviation security aspect and is strongly opposed by Customs, Health, Immigration and Federal Police.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Transport proposal is for a separate building, some forty metres north of the existing terminal, of a size suitable for existing traffic, but with the capability of being expanded should this be needed in the future. The building can be constructed and operated without affecting domestic traffic and public convenience. This proposal is also favoured from the user Department and Aviation Security aspects. Either proposal is of the same order of cost.</PARA>

An answer to that was provided on 24 November (Hansard, p. 2442).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information in respect of the population coverage:</PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of information available to my Department at this stage, indications are that approximately 11 per cent of the population for medical and seven per cent for hospital may not have cover through either registered private health insurance funds or equivalent Commonwealth Government assistance at 31 October 1981. These figures are preliminary and are based on a sample of health funds. Therefore, they may be subject to later variation.</PARA>
<PARA> The estimated position of the proportion of the population covered by the various categories is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Medical Hospital</PARA>
<PARA>per cent per cent Basic private insurance with registered funds</PARA>
<PARA>67.5 71.6 Pensioners and dependants  13.4 13.4 Unemployed  3.4 3.4 Low income and migrants (1)  2.0 2.0 Repatriation and Defence  2.5 2.5</PARA>
<PARA>88.8 92.9</PARA>
<PARA> Note-(1) The figure represents the estimated coverage of persons who have established eligibility as health care card holders. A further 1.3 per cent of the population could possibly be covered under the low income arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> Of the estimated persons not covered (11 per cent for medical and seven per cent for hospital) further factors are relevant:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) free hospitalisation for Queensland residents and extension of eligibility for free hospitalisation in other States beyond requirements of Commonwealth; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) some coverage (assumed to be minor) by unregistered commercial insurers.</PARA>
<PARA> The overriding aim of the Government's new health policy is to ensure that all persons living in Australia have access to high quality health care at a cost both the individual and the community can afford. The most equitable and appropriate means of achieving that goal is through a combination of special assistance schemes for those people in genuine need and for those who are not, the subsidisation of private health insurance to enable them to contribute towards their health costs.</PARA>

<PARA> My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. It is a somewhat parochial question for Victorian senators. I refer the Minister to the fact that Debney Park High School is seeking to raise some $30,000 to $40,000 for a music scholarship fund, which is to be raised by selling a record featuring the Debney Park High School band, about which I think the Minister knows. I refer to the fact that almost all those involved in the project have given their services freely but, despite representations, the Treasurer has refused to exempt the record from sales tax, which amounts to 37c for each $2 record. I ask: Will the Minister take up this matter with the Treasurer again and make further representations to him about it?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a provision in the sales tax law that exempts goods for use and not for sale by a non-profit university or school. That provision, item 63A in the First Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act, does not extend to goods produced for sale by a school and there is no other provision in the law to exempt the record in question from sales tax.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 10 November 1981 (Hansard, page 1926) Senator Coleman asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Health, a question without notice concerning the health insurance arrangements as they affect overseas students in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is aware of the various problems and difficulties faced by overseas students in Australia. However I would point out that as a result of the changes to the health insurance arrangements on 1 September 1981, the community generally is required to contribute to the cost of medical and hospital services-either by personal payment or through health insurance. An exception is made only in the case of pensioner health benefits cardholders and health care cardholders, who are eligible for free bulk-billed medical treatment and free treatment in public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA> All overseas students may take out private health insurance upon their arrival in Australia and be eligible for fund benefits after a two month waiting period . No waiting period applies to the Commonwealth benefit of 30 per cent of the schedule fee. Students may also take out Australian private health insurance before they depart for Australia. In this respect they are in the same position as Australian residents.</PARA>
<PARA> The eligibility criteria under the Health Insurance Act in respect of overseas students, for health care card entitlement are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) applicants must be Australian residents; that is, their stay in Australia must have exceeded a total of six months in the 12 months preceding the time of application for a card;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) applicants must not be dependants in the sense of being a child for whom family allowance is payable or a spouse for whom additional unemployment benefit is or would be payable;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) applicants must not be wholly or substantially dependent on a resident of a country other than Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) applicants must meet the income test which applies to low income applicants for Health Care cards.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that the criteria are fair and not ungenerous and ensure that students and their dependants who are in genuine need, and not under guarantee of financial support from persons or establishments outside Australia, will be covered under the health care card arrangements. All things considered, overseas students are treated no differently to their Australian counterparts.</PARA>
<PARA>Overseas students who are studying under Australian university (or other institutional) scholarships, where no specific allowance has been made in respect of reimbursement for hospital and medical expenses, are generally eligible for a health care card.</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to students who are holders of scholarships administered by the Australian Development Assistance Bureau or by the Commonwealth Department of Education, it should be noted that the sponsoring agency guarantees to cover the cost of all hospital and medical expenses for each student in excess of $45 in any one year. This arrangement also covered dependants of these students for the period 1 September 1981 to 1 November 1981. From 2 November 1981, however, dependants of these students are generally eligible for a health care card.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not prepared to provide free health care cover to overseas students for a set period after their arrival in Australia, or to disregard money received from home countries as income when assessing their eligibility for health care cards. Such a policy would provide concessions to overseas students which are not available to Australians, and would therefore represent an inappropriate charge on the public purse.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> In formulating the new arrangements, detailed consideration was given to the requirements of persons in special need, including Aboriginals. It was decided that the issue of health care cards, which identify people as eligible for special assistance with their medical and hospital costs would be confined to persons meeting the following criteria:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Migrants or refugees in their first six months in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Unemployment or special benefit recipients with income, apart from benefit, not exceeding $40 per week (single) or $68 per week (married).</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Low income earners (the current income limits are set out below; they are adjusted every May and November):</PARA>
<PARA> Married-joint income of less than $165 gross per week, including pension if any, plus $20 for each child.</PARA>
<PARA> Sole parent with one child-income of less than $165 gross per week, including pension if any, plus $20 for each additional child.</PARA>
<PARA> Single person-income of less than $99 gross per week, including pension if any .</PARA>
<PARA>There is no discretion in the legislation to recognise people other than those who meet these criteria.</PARA>
<PARA> A public awareness program was undertaken to inform the public of the new arrangements, including:</PARA>
<PARA> distribution of pamphlets and leaflets;</PARA>
<PARA> a direct telephone enquiry system for the cost of a local telephone call;</PARA>
<PARA> radio and press advertisements;</PARA>
<PARA> 'self help' audio visual kits for use by Department of Social Security offices to enable special need groups (such as Aboriginal fringe dwellers and people in small towns) to learn of the new arrangements;</PARA>
<PARA> arrangements for departmental officers to participate in talk back, interview and other media programs on commercial, Australian Broadcasting Commission and ethnic radio and television;</PARA>
<PARA> provision of special briefings for media personalities conducting personal advice and welfare oriented columns or programs.</PARA>
<PARA> Briefings for doctors or their receptionists, social workers and public hospital staff, et cetera., have taken place to enable these people to assist persons identified as being in special need, including Aboriginals, who may have difficulty in understanding the new arrangements, and in particular, to provide advice regarding the steps to be taken in applying for and using health care cards. The Department of Social Security is seeking to assist Aboriginal communities in view of their special needs. They are able to advise a doctor, by telephone, whether a particular person holds health care card entitlement and the number of that card. Also, it should be noted that health care cards may be located centrally, for example, at a health centre, council office or with a community welfare worker.</PARA>
<PARA> The card can also be kept by a doctor or health sister. These measures should assist in overcoming any problems which may arise in identifying persons in special need who do not carry or who have lost their Health Care cards.</PARA>
<PARA> Bulk-billing arrangements have continued for persons in special need and an additional facility has been introduced which allows these people to obtain their medical benefits through the health insurance funds. Previously free medical services for people in special need depended on whether the doctor agreed to bulk-bill the patient for the services. The payment facility through the funds now ensures a greater availability of medical care from doctors who did not wish to participate previously in the bulk-billing arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA> Did the Minister for Primary Industry on 24 September enter into a stabilisation agreement to apply to the dried fruits industry? Does this arrangement provide assistance to the dried fruits industry?

<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> On 24 September 1981 the Minister for Primary Industry announced that the Government was ready to introduce an underwriting arrangement to apply to the production of dried sultanas from the 1982 to 1986 seasons. The Minister said that the offer to introduce the scheme had been made following detailed discussions with the Board of Management of the Australian Dried Fruits Association and, if the response from the industry were favourable it was intended to introduce legislation in the Budget sittings.</PARA>
<PARA> The arrangement was accepted by the industry, and the Dried Sultana Production Underwriting Bill was introduced into Parliament on 29 October.</PARA>
<PARA> Development of the scheme provided in this Bill stems from an inquiry made by the Industries Assistance Commission into the dried vine fruits industry, and reported on in 1976.

His question concerned long term contracts for meat exports from Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the allegations made in an article in the Land newspaper of 29 October 1981 relating to approaches by a number of countries to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation (AMLC) for long term agreements.</PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman of the AMLC, Mr R. G. Jones, has responded to these allegations and his rebuttal was published in the Land edition of 5 November 1981. Briefly the AMLC has offered the following responses on each individual allegation.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Korea-During 1979-80 South Korea encountered internal economic difficulties and a domestic oversupply of pork and poultry meats which led it to suspend meat import purchasing in August 1979. Korea recommenced imports in March 1981 and up to November 1981 Australian exports to Korea totalled 32,133 tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Egypt-With the stated aim of gaining food security and credit terms advantages, Egypt has sought to negotiate long-term contracts stipulating both quantity and price.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian exporters naturally are not prepared to contract on a long-term price arrangement-nor is AMLC. Traders are also not happy with bid and performance bonds required by Egypt.</PARA>
<PARA> ALMC was prepared earlier this year to use its trading powers if Egypt wished to deal on a government to government basis, but importing authorities in that country continued to negotiate with individual exporters and consortia.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Mexico-In March 1979 AMLC quoted for an initial trial shipment of 1685 tonnes of boneless beef. Mexican authorities failed to take up the offer following strong political reaction by domestic livestock producers to the idea of beef imports.</PARA>
<PARA> Suggestions of exporter resistance appear to be confused with rumours at the time that Mexican cattlemen offered the Mexican Government 50,000 head of cattle at prices approximating US 40 cents per lb. liveweight to head off imports.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Algeria-Algerian representatives visited the AMLC in April 1981 to discuss possible long term arrangements with the intention of purchasing meat at '' favourable'' prices.</PARA>
<PARA> AMLC circulated to industry Algeria's specific requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Malaysia-In March/April 1981 a Malaysian delegation visited Australia to investigate purchase of beef slaughtered according to Islamic religious rites to replace some of West Malaysia's livestock imports.</PARA>
<PARA> The West Malaysian government decided in October 1981 to call a tender for 500 tonnes of halal boneless beef cuts for delivery January/March 1982. It is likely the beef will be purchased from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Libya-Australia has supplied live sheep to Libya and will tender for additional contracts in 1982. Libya has expressed interest in purchasing lambs for fattening but not sheepmeats thus far.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Iraq-Trade negotiations continued with Iraq until interrupted by the outbreak of the Iraq-Iran conflict. For the period January/November 1981 Iraq purchased 5,323 tonnes from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to long-term agreements, the Corporation does have the power to engage in export trading of meat and live- stock in its own right. However the basic policy of the AMLC is that it will only use its trading powers when it considers that it can get a better return than private traders, when requested to do so by industry or when the importing country wishes to deal on a government to government basis. Australian producers have not shown keenness to agree to long-term agreements where quantities and prices are predetermined on the basis that other more lucrative markets may arise in the course of a long- term agreement. The United States market sets the floor price for our beef exports and in times of unrestricted access to that market, Australian exporters would not be in favour of a long-term agreement to supply another less lucrative market.</PARA>
<PARA> The question also suggested that Australia should pursue long-term contracts particularly in light of the United States countercyclical meat import legislation which is designed to restrict beef imports when domestic production is high. In this regard it should be noted that restraints did not operate in 1981 as meat imports were below the level which would trigger quotas under the legislation. The United States Secretary of Agriculture announced on 24 December 1981 that restrictions would not operate during the first quarter of 1982. Further estimates of imports will be made in 1982 before the commencement of each quarter and if the estimate of imports still remains below the '' trigger point'' no restrictions will operate.</PARA>

<PARA> As previously advised on this matter (Hansard, 12 November 1981 at page 2076) artists who produce works of art that are not for sale are obliged to bear tax at appropriate rates on any taxable raw materials that they purchase. Much the same position applies with persons who produce other kinds of goods as a hobby or in the course of preparing themselves for a trade, profession, etc. The question of exempting materials purchased by those persons also has to be taken into account when looking at the question of granting such a concession to artists.

<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In an interview on the Australian Broadcasting Commission on the radio program National Farm Report on 11 November 1981, Mr O'Connell stated that he had informed the Wool Council earlier that an increase in test charges of between 20 per cent and 40 per cent after the sale of the Australian Wool Testing Authority could be foreseen.</PARA>
<PARA> On the following day the chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation, on the same program, expressed the opinion that, although it would be very difficult to be specific, he would have considerable doubt if cost increases for AWTA services related to the impending change of status of the organisation would reach the figures mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA> The extent of any future increases of costs of operating the AWTA will undoubtedly depend largely on the attitudes and skills of the management of the new wool testing organisation. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for the Government to comment on any estimates of costs at this time.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is determined to proceed with the sale because the reasons for its decision are as cogent now as they were when announced by the Prime Minister in the Parliament in April. I have been informed by letter from the Australian Council of Wool Buyers, the National Council of Wool Selling Brokers of Australia, the Federal Council of Private Treaty Wool Merchants, the Wool Scourers and Carbonisers Association of Australia and the Wool Textile Manufacturers of Australia, that they accept the decision of the review of Commonwealth Functions to sell AWTA.</PARA>
<PARA> When AWTA is in position to meet all of its own costs directly, producers will know exactly what they are paying for wool testing services.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 18 November 1981 (Hansard, page 2255) Senator Button asked Senator Carrick the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it true that the Prime Minister has offered to help Queensland subsidise Trans Australia Airlines services to western Queensland? Does this indicate that the Government's user pays philosphy will be applied selectively? For example, does it mean that, when and if the profitable parts of Telecom Australia are sold to private enterprise, the Government will directly subsidise the losses on rural telephone services, which are currently running at $230m a year?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided the following information in response to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned about the isolation of western Queensland communities should their air services be threatened.</PARA>
<PARA> This issue has been discussed by the Prime Minister and the Premier of Queensland. As a result of the meeting, TAA, the Commonwealth and the State officers are examining options for future operations which maintain air services to the communities currently served by TAA.</PARA>
<PARA> It is expected that decisions on future arrangements for air services to western Queensland will be taken quickly by the respective Governments.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the questions concerning application of the user pays philosphy, the Holcroft Inquiry into domestic air fares recommended that where the Government decides that a community shall be provided with an air service which requires a subsidy for its viable operation, the subsidy be explicitly provided so that its cost is borne by the community as a whole and not only by other air travellers as a cross subsidy. The Government has accepted this recommendation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 18 November 1981 (Hansard, page 2255) Senator Thomas asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs in the Senate, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. I refer to questions previously asked by Senator Puplick on 26 February and by me on 12 March relating to the importation of gold chain. The Industries Assistance Commission, in report No. 274 dated 6 August and entitled Chain of precious metal, has recommended that the duty on chain falling under tariff item 71.14 and currently dutiable at two per cent be subject to duty at 25 per cent, which is the same level as is applied to chain jewellery which falls within item 71.12.9. The report also recommends a review of the whole industry in 1986. Will the Minister advise whether the Government will accept the report of the IAC and, if so, whether speedy implementation can be made of the recommendation to lift duty under tariff item 71.14 from two per cent to 25 per cent to prevent some importers from taking advantage of what seems to be an anomaly in tariff provisions covering the importation of gold chain?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> To Senator Messner's answer, that is 'I recall the questions on this subject that were asked by Senator Puplick some six months ago and earlier by Senator Thomas. It is true that the industries Assistance Commission did recommend a change in the rate of duty applicable to precious metal chain-two per cent-as distinct from that chain which constitutes jewellery, to which a tariff of some 25 per cent applies. The Government has decided to accept the recommendation in the report and has applied the higher rate to precious metal chain since 30 October. I understand that that was the date upon which the announcement was made. I will check for the information of the honourable senator whether that was the actual date of implementation of the new decision.'</PARA>
<PARA> I would add that: The Government decision to accept an IAC recommendation to impose a duty rate of 25 per cent on chain of precious metal falling to tariff item 71.14 took effect on and from 30 October 1981.</PARA>

<PARA> I draw the Minister's attention to the abundance of camels in the Northern Territory and to the fact that export camel meat is classified as game meat and is therefore required to be processed through a registered game meat export establishment. There are no game meat export abattoirs in the Northern Territory. As this industry could be one of significance in the Northern Territory, employing members of Aboriginal communities and providing an alternative source of income, will the Government reconsider classification of camel meat with a view to amending the regulations to allow camels to be slaughtered for export under normal conditions, as for beef, at local abattoirs ?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied me with the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> The existing provisions of the Exports (Meat) Regulations only provide for camels to be slaughtered in the field as game meat. Game meat premises must comply in full with the relevant provisions of the Export (Meat) Regulations and all current export requirements. These include requirements relating to siting, water supply, construction and hygiene.</PARA>
<PARA> If it could be shown to be desirable to amend the Exports (Meat) Regulations to include camels as animals which may be slaughtered in an abattoir, I would be prepared to consider such action.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The transfer of textile clothing and footwear quotas between importers is an integral part of the quota allocation system. Although transfers are processed through the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs no monitoring , other than that necessary to establish the bona fides of the transferee as a legitimate importer, is undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Since the new seven year program of assistance for the textile clothing and footwear industries was announced there has been some rationalisation of quota holdings through the transfer arrangements.

<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided the following information in response to Senator Crichton-Browne's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In its 1979 Roads Report, the Bureau of Transport Economics made no recommendations in relation to the future distribution among States of Commonwealth roads assistance. Rather, the Bureau has assessed an overall level of economically warranted roads investment for each State and Territory over the period 1979-80 to 1983-84. The question of the relative contributions by Commonwealth, State and Local Government towards an economically warranted program was not addressed in the report.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has never distributed its road grants purely on the basis of population size. Prior to 1969-70, Commonwealth road grants were distributed among the mainland States according to a formula which attached equal weighting to area, population and the number of registered motor vehicles. Between 1969- 70 and 1977-78, the distribution of Commonwealth road grants was brought more closely into line with road needs as assessed by the former Bureau of Roads. These assessments took account of a wide range of economic and social factors including projected usage of roads, road user benefits, construction and land acquisition costs. The former Bureau of Roads also examined the different capacity of State and Local Governments to finance road programs in each State.</PARA>
<PARA> Since 1977-78, State funding relativities have remained constant. Western Australia's share is currently 12.7 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the future, the Commonwealth will take account of the road needs of all States, including Western Australia's, when determining the apportionment between States and the Northern Territory of the levels of funds it has undertaken to provide over the three years 1982-83 to 1984-85.</PARA>

Properties which are temporarily surplus are being offered to the public at full market rentals. Rentals on existing leases of property not immediately required for Government purposes are also being reviewed to achieve maximum revenue. The Financial Services Section of the Purchasing Division has been the subject of an approach to the Public Service Board aimed towards providing a more appropriate organisation to handle the workload. The Public Service Board approved a revised and enhanced organisation structure in May 1981. It has also been agreed that the Board would be prepared to review the organisation structure if, in the longer term, it is considered to be inadequate. The arrears in work are a matter of considerable concern, but there is, of course, a question of balancing the need for adequate investigation of claims against the cost to the tax payer of such investigation. In this regard the Department is to conduct a review in the near future aimed at seeing if there can be improvements in the operational efficiencies of the Financial Services Sections. The review will consider such aspects as scope for auditing company systems and controls versus detailed claims checking, the possible use of private financial firms and the adequacy of existing claims documentation.</PARA>

<PARA> (3), (7), (8), (9) and (10) In answer to Question no. 723 from the honourable senator it was made clear that the Review of Commonwealth Functions was not primarily an exercise in cost cutting. The focus of the review was on streamlining and fining down Commonwealth operations by withdrawing from areas more appropriately handled by the States and private enterprise and rationalising a number of Commonwealth activities. While eventual ongoing savings compared with the cost of continuing programs on the basis of then existing policies were estimated to be 'of the order of $560 million' it was explained in that answer why more precise figuring was not provided at the time and that the figures did not make allowance for savings for a more diffuse kind. It is in the nature of estimates that they may not be completely accurate and that the degree of inaccuracy, if any, may not be precisely known.</PARA>
<PARA> The effect of RCF decisions on estimates of budget outlays is combined with that of other Government decisions (including the 1981-82 budget measures) and with changes in underlying parameters affecting estimates. It is not practicable to separate out the financial effects of each of the many interacting influences on the financial estimates. To attempt such an exercise would involve a major effort on the part of all departments and authorities which I am not prepared to authorise.</PARA>
<PARA> I am able to inform the honourable senator, however that, taken as a whole, the savings on the 1981-82 forward estimates achieved through the current budget ( which reflects effects of a range of RCF and other decisions) were well in excess of the figure of $560 million estimated as the order of ongoing savings eventually to arise from the RCF exercise. The Government will, of course, also continue to pursue further savings through the implementation of those RCF decisions currently outstanding.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's statement of 30 April indicated an expected total staffing reduction of 16,000-17,000. The rate at which staff savings will be achieved can be expected to vary widely as between one decision and another. The implementation of some decisions will inevitably take much longer than others, for example the disposal of Commonwealth assets, the review of the Defence organisation, the Australia Post and Telecom reviews. Savings possibilities will in some cases only become clear as reviews proceed. The Government is closely monitoring the achievement of savings against particular decisions.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) As at the end October 1981, approximately 270 of the Governments' decisions arising from the review had been implemented or were close to final implementation, of a total of some 350 decisions. Implimentation of the remainder is being pursued by responsible Ministers and is oversighted by a Cabinet Committee chaired by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</PARA>
<PARA> (5), (6) The process of government administration constantly involves implementation of decisions: the implementation of RCF decisions has in general proceeded as part of that process rather than with separate resources. Separate records have not been kept of the resources applied to implementation of RCF decisions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The information requested is not available.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) During December 1981 the Department wrote to all pensioners in receipt of supplementary assistance, including those in aged and disabled persons' homes, to obtain the information necessary to assess entitlement under the amended supplementary assistance provisions which came into operation on 1 February 1982 . It also wrote to non-home owning pensioners who do not receive supplementary assistance but who may become eligible under the new provisions, that is because of the revised income test. Subsequent assessment of eligibility will be carried out when the pensioner's circumstances change and in conjunction with normal pension reviews.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The new provisions have not been designed to assist organisations operating aged and disabled persons accommodation but to assist the more needy pensioners in meeting rent charges or costs of their board and lodging. It is probable, however, that some institutions increased their charges as a result of the new provision as charges are often related to a proportion of total income.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Does the McKinsey Report contain the following suggestions:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Improve market information, particularly on requirements of major business customers. Differentiate service provision, for example, by offering a faster connection time at a higher price, offering new services such as call charge recording (CCR) for STD as an option, as Telecom intends, and providing a sale option on all terminal equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Provide market input into the introduction of new technology into the network. Specifically, we recommend accelerated replacement of switching equipment to provide custom calling features to subscribers sooner.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Develop issue-oriented business and product planning over a 5 year time horizon. Telecom does extensive technical and financial planning but comparatively little market or business planning. Product/market plans need to be developed for new services that cater for customer needs by spelling out type and timing of new service offerings as well as pricing policies to encourage use of the service. A business perspective on critical issues is also required. Taking a 5 year horizon allows Telecom to integrate market needs, technology changes, and its own capabilities into its planning.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator Durack</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The locations referred to were listed as locations at which chemical warfare experiments took place during World War II. The list was contained in an answer given in 1975 by the then Minister for Defence to House of Representatives Question No. 1950 (see Hansard of 20 August 1975).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I am now advised that that answer to House of Representatives Question No. 1950 was based in part on documentary evidence that at least 2 tests were carried out at Port Wakefield on 1-2 February 1944. These trials were designed to test 25 pounder shells filled with chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) I assume that the list of locations in that answer did not purport to include those places, such as the Royal Australian Air Force Air Armament and Gas School at Nhill, where field training exercises were carried out to prepare Servicemen to defend themselves against gas attacks. Nor, I assume, did the list purport to include those places where chemical warfare stocks were stored and/or disposed of after the war. I am advised that no records have been found to indicate that dumping of mustard gas or phosgene gas took place at Nhill.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) There are difficulties, some of which are illustrated by the answers to earlier parts of this question, in providing an unchallengeable listing of all localities at which veterans may conceiveably have experienced some exposure to chemical warfare agents. Rather than attempt to do so, I repeat the statement I, and successive Ministers before me have made that any veteran who believes his health has suffered because of his war service and who wishes to make a claim for compensation should approach the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Relevant documentation is available to individuals and to that Department through Australian Archives.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Dengue fever has been reported and the diagnosis confirmed by laboratory investigation in northern Queensland, with an extensive outbreak occuring on Thursday Island and on the mainland as far south as Townsville.</PARA>
<PARA> An effective defence against the spread of this disease exists in vector control and the elimination of the aedes mosquito which transmits the disease from man to man. There is no vaccine yet available.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government has contributed to vector control measures under the Australian Encephalitis Control Program since 1975. Queensland has participated for the first time in this program in 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Health organises a national vector control course for the training of personnel in vector control measures at Mildura each year. In November 1981 six officers from Queensland attended this course.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Queensland Institute of Medical Research (QIMR) is a World Health Organisation Arbovirus Research and Reference Centre.

<PARA> Are students from overseas, sponsored by the Australian Development Assistance Bureau, precluded from changing to a Ph.D. course if they enrolled originally for a masters degree; if so, are potential students, especially in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia advised in writing before they have enrolled; and if not, will the Minister for Foreign Affairs ensure that they are so advised in future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Students sponsored by the Australian Development Assistant Bureau may upgrade their studies from masters to doctorate level if this was provided for in the original offer of awards made to their home governments, but not if masters studies only were requested and offered. Before they come to Australia, students are orally briefed about their awards and are required by Australia's overseas missions to sign an acknowledgement that the type, level and duration of the training offered are acceptable to them.</PARA>
<PARA> The nominating procedure requires developing country governments themselves to select candidates for Australian awards and specify the types and level of training required. The Bureau then sets about placing and enrolling the students in accordance with these wishes and offering the appropriate awards to the home government. The students may not enrol themselves nor do they receive the award offers direct from the Bureau. The home governments are informed of the conditions of the awards by the appropriate Australian overseas missions and it is the responsibility of those governments to pass that information on to their students. Many do so in writing. In addition our overseas missions themselves reinforce this information in routine predeparture briefing of the students, ask students to sign an acknowledgement that the training offered is acceptable, and the students are further briefed by the Bureau's Regional Offices upon their arrival in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> These procedures were designed to achieve the primary goals of Australia's development training program. It should be understood that it is not the aim of that program to develop to the utmost the academic talent of the gifted individual student. It is primarily the aim to help the governments of developing countries to meet their needs for skilled manpower in their own development programs according to priorities which they themselves consider to be appropriate. Thus the awards under the program are given by the Bureau on behalf of the Australian government to the governments of developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA> Developing countries do of course nominate candidates for doctoral studies, and students nominated for these are often initially placed at the masters level with a view to upgrading to Ph.D if their performance warrants it. This is allowed for in the original award offer. Students who may not upgrade in this way are those for whom study at masters level only was asked for by their governments and for whom masters awards only were offered by the Bureau and accepted by those governments, as well as for those whom Ph.D studies were requested by their governments, but whose academic background or other factors only permitted an award to be offered at masters level.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator Messner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Measurement of cabin pressure is usually expressed in terms of cabin altitude. The cabin altitudes normally maintained are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Aircraft</PARA>
<PARA>9,000m 12,000m</PARA>
<PARA>(a) Boeing 747  3,200 ft 6,400 ft (b) Boeing 727  3,800 ft 7,000 ft (c) Douglas DC9  6,400 ft 8,400 ft (at 10,668m, the maximim operating altitude) (d) Airbus 300  4,600 ft 7,900 ft</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Annoxia or hypoxia is a reduced supply of oxygen to the body's tissues and organs. Some reduction in oxygen supply occurs at every height above sea level. At the cabin altitudes referred to above, the reduction is within tolerance except for individuals with seriously impaired reserves of oxygen.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) While studies have been carried out on the effects of alcohol on flight crew performance at low atmosphere pressures, there are no known studies in relation to passenger health.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) People with advanced heart or respiratory ailments may be more susceptable to the effects of hypoxia on long flights and may require supplemental oxygen which airlines are required to carry in the subject aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Except as noted in (4), there cannot be said to be any dangers to passengers in prolonged flights at altitudes normally used in passenger operations, nor would it be practical for airlines to issue general 'warnings'. One of the functions of airline medical departments is to evaluate likely effects of flight on intending passengers whose medical conditions are notified to them, either directly by the passengers or through booking clerks.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) The Commonwealth Department of Health has advised that lead is a toxic substance with no known beneficial physiological effects. Hence the amount of lead in the environment capable of absorption by humans should be reduced to a minimum. Lead in soil has the potential to enter the human food chain and so contribute to lead uptake by man via crops and animal foodstuffs. The Department of Health has also advised that the lead levels in soils near Adelaide reported by the CSIRO are at present low and would not make a major contribution to the total uptake of lead. Consequently the present health risk from soil lead in the area studied is minimal.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Some studies on EMP have been undertaken in Australia. The Government is also aware of studies carried out overseas on requirements for protection against EMP effects in the unlikely circumstances of superpower nuclear conflict .</PARA>
<PARA> (2) to (4) The studies undertaken in Australia indicate that one or more high altitude nuclear bursts over Australia could extensively disrupt and damage unprotected communications circuits and facilities. These are, however, unlikely circumstances, even if global conflict-itself a very remote possibility-were to occur.</PARA>
<PARA> The studies undertaken in Australia provide a basis for assessing the relative vulnerability of key systems, and assist in the development of protection criteria for communications circuits and facilities. Consideration is given to EMP survivability in the procurement of new defence electronic equipment. Security requirements preclude detailed discussion of these matters.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) to (7) There is no conceivable strategic benefit from an EMP attack against Australia aimed at targets suggested by the honourable senator. Nuclear attack against Australia, if it occurred at all, would be in the context of global nuclear war. Nuclear war would, even if Australia were not attacked, have more severe long-term implications for Australia's economy than the loss of computer data banks. The policy of successive Australian Governments has been to do all within Australia's power to assist in the deterrence of nuclear war. It remains the Government's view that nuclear war is a remote and improbable prospect, and will remain so providing adequate deterrent measures are sustained.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Die-cast box prototypes of the NAL/CSIRO aid system were received by NAL on 25 November 1981. After thorough assessment, the units will be returned to Plessey Australia Pty Ltd, for design adjustments prior to building of pre- production models in the final case. These models will be subjected to environmental tests and field trials. The first delivery of production units will occur in December 1982. Following acceptance, testing and familiarisation, distribution will commence locally early in 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) NAL/CSIRO radio frequency aids will be distributed as normal hearing aids and are intended for use at home as well as at school. The technical innovation and sophistication of this system are major reasons for delay in development, but the advantages are sufficient to warrant this course. The initial deliveries of aids will be fitted to children with the greatest need coupled with capacity to benefit from the system. The specific children will not be nominated until much closer to the delivery date. It will take several years for the system to be provided to the majority of children who could benefit and to those adults for whom the special features of the system would be of advantage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 September 1981 (Hansard, page 563) Senator Jones asked me a question without notice in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry in the Senate. The honourable senator's question was as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No doubt the Minister's attention has been drawn to the many reports that an outbreak of food poisoning had occurred in the State of Victoria and that the State Health Commission had warned people not to eat any salami produced by Tibaldi Small Goods (Australia) Pty Ltd as well as to further reports that three other companies which produce salami had found bacteria in the salami produced. Can the Minister inform the Senate whether any steps have been taken to identify meat used in the production of these or other smallgoods and whether any species test has been taken from meat or meat by-products sold on the Australian home market?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied me with the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Victorian Department of Agriculture conducted an extensive species testing survey of raw meats used for sausage manufacture in 1980. During 1981, such species testing involved the testing of meat at the Tibaldi premises. I am advised a program to monitor meat and smallgoods on the domestic market was introduced on 18 January 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In accordance with controls imposed nationally by the Australian Bureau of Animal Health, meat and processed product produced for export is sampled by species testing. The Australian Bureau of Animal Health has suggested to domestic meat inspection authorities that testing of domestic product would be desirable.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) My advice is that, as at 20 January 1982, only the States of Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia are conducting a routine species testing program on domestic meats. The next meeting of the Standing Committee on Agriculture will be considering this matter further.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 September 1981 (Hansard, page 555) Senator Gietzelt asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a fact that the Minister for Primary Industry has said that he would be embarrassed if he were in charge of the Australian Federal Police, referring to the investigation into meat substitution? In what way would the Minister be embarrassed? Does the Minister agree with the Minister for Primary Industry that the Australian Federal Police has the responsibility of stopping fraudulent behaviour but it has to produce evidence to justify prosecution of offenders? On how many occasions have allegations of improprieties or breaches of regulations in meat inspections or the meat export industry been investigated by the Australian Federal Police and with what result? I appreciate that the Minister might not have these facts. If he does not, would he be prepared to make a statement to the Senate at a later time itemising the allegations and the result of police inquiries?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable senator is aware the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Sir Colin Woods, KCVO, CBE, QPM, is responsible for the control of operations of the Australian Federal Police. It is not within the ambit of powers given to the Minister to direct the course of, or otherwise interfere by any means in, any investigation being carried out by the Australian Federal Police.</PARA>
<PARA> My colleague, the Minister for Primary Industry has stated (House of Represenatives Hansard of 9 September 1981 page 1062) that he was referring to comments made by the Commissioner about the conduct of past police investigations in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner, whose high standards are well known, was providing a professional view after an examination of the reports of past investigations. He informs me that he does not perceive any cause for embarrassment. The use of expert police resources is a matter of constant review of priorities and professional judgment and in the absence of evidence of a wide-ranging scheme most matters referred locally by departmental representatives will be dealt with locally on their face value.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner has advised that with hindsight and in the light of recent developments, it is possible that more vigorous inquiries into allegations in past years may have produced sufficient evidence to warrant prosecutions. The Commissioner assures me that the present investigation is an extremely thorough one.</PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable senator knows, several persons have been charged recently in Victoria under the Commonwealth Crimes Act as a result of the current Australian Federal Police investigation. It would therefore not be appropriate to comment further at this time.</PARA>
<PARA> For details of requests for investigation by the police and the outcome, I refer the honourable senator to the answer provided by the Minister for Primary Industry to a question without notice asked by the Member for Grey (House of Repre- sentatives Hansard of 17 November 1981 page 2934).</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 September 1981 (Hansard, page 557) Senator McLaren asked me the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry will recall the public outcry last year at the cruelty meted out to live horses destined for export to Japan and the subsequent tabling in the Parliament of guidelines governing future exports. I ask the Minister: Why were Dr Wirth, President of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and six RSPCA inspectors refused permission to inspect a consignment of 60 horses being loaded at Tullamarine Airport last night aboard a DC8 aircraft operated by the American Flying Tigers company and destined for Japan? As Dr Wirth has been reported as saying that the aircraft was unfit for the transport of horses and that the stringent regulations gazetted after the previous sorry episode do not extend to air travel of horses, I further ask: Will the Government take urgent action to gazette regulations to cover all forms of transport of live animals from Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that a party of RSPCA officials arrived at the airport and were denied entry in accordance with airport regulations. A veterinary officer of the State Department of Agriculture was instrumental in having the RSPCA party permitted entry onto the airport loading area. Dr Wirth was extended an invitation to examine the horses as they were loading. The RSPCA officials departed from the tarmac before loading of the horses commenced.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not believe that it is possible to prescribe by regulation all husbandry matters relating to the transportation of animals. Such definition would be too extensive for practical use and would defy amendment in any real way. The Government believes that husbandry should be regulated by the preparation of standards or codes which allow the use of professional judgment in their interpretation. Such standards have or are being prepared and issued for most classes of animals and forms of transport.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 15 September 1981 (Hansard, page 729) Senator Mulvihill asked be, as Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, the following question without notice concerning the 1979 and 1981 elections for the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Was Gosford the medium-sized post office outside the metropolitan area at which 380 ballot papers were illegally seized during the 1979 ballot? Was the unnamed candidate involved in this illegal seizure Mt Frank King? Are inquiries being made at the moment into happenings at the Newcastle mail centre involving the King-Battese-Hawkins election material?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that the first the Australian Electoral Office heard of an alleged seizure in 1979 of 380 ballot papers was when the matter was raised in the Senate on 11 June 1981. By that time, the 1981 election process had begun. The view was taken that, in the light of allegations, whether substantiated or not, concerning an election two years earlier, the most appropraite course for the Electoral Office to follow was to seek the co-operation of Australia Post officials in tightening security arrangements for the despatch and return of 1981 election material. This was done.</PARA>
<PARA> Now that the 1981 election has been completed it would be quite appropriate to undertake detailed investigations into the allegations regarding the conduct of the 1979 election. However, Australia Post has advised that it has no knowledge of this alleged interference with electoral material in 1979 and unless there is specific information forthcoming which could assist, there is at present no basis for such investigations.</PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the incidents at the Newcastle Mail Centre involving King- Battese-Hawkins election material I am advised that there have been Australia Post enquiries but that the matter was not one which involved the Australian Electoral Office or the conduct of the 1981 election.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 17 September 1981 (Hansard page 823) Senator Thomas asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Communications, a question without notice concerning international subscriber dialling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> International calling is very popular with an increasing proportion of customers-the average increase being about 30 per cent per annum-and there have been very heavy demands on Telecom by customers to provide automatic dialling for international calls. Responding to this demand Telecom has been introducing ISD on a multi-metering basis at suitably equipped exchanges since 1976, with the charges for these calls being recorded on subscribers' meters along with local and STD calls. However, because of the inability to provide details of these high cost calls, access to the ISD facility has been provided only where requested.</PARA>
<PARA> Advances in technology have now enabled Telecom to introduce a call charge record (CCR) system which will automatically record details of subscriber dialed international calls. With the introduction of this system at an exchange , ISD will be provided to all subscribers connected to that exchange, as a separate total for any ISD calls made will appear on their telephone bills.</PARA>
<PARA> The new ISD/CCR system is being introduced progressively at suitable exchanges and by June 1982 will be provided on about 1.4m services. Ultimately, as exchanges are updated with more modern equipment, ISD/CCR will be made available to all subscribers. Should any subscriber wish to take less than full advantage of the telephone service, there is a standard fee of $3 per annum which will ensure that access from the service is restricted in a prescribed way.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom believes the provision of ISD/CCR as a standard facility on all telephone services is a logical further step in providing for the present day telephone needs of the community and one that will be welcomed by most customers because, in addition to giving speedy automatic access to overseas telephone subscribers, it gives the opportunity to make savings in call costs with the added advantage of individual call records.</PARA>
<PARA> ISD/CCR will not disadvantage customers who do not currently make overseas calls and it is Telecom's view therefore, that where a customer requires his service to be rendered non-standard to the extent of removing the capability to direct dial overseas calls, it is reasonable to apply a small charge to help offset the additional costs involved in modifying the service.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following additional information, to that which was given at the time:</PARA>
<PARA> A number of visiting Commonwealth Heads of Delegations to CHOGM flew in their own aircraft.

The transport of Heads of Delegations to and from Canberra for the Retreat was also carried out by the RAAF, with some assistance from Department of Transport aircraft. The great success of the Commonwealth Meeting in Australia, a Meeting which brought a great many distinguished people to this country, was in no small part due to the efforts of the RAAF in assisting with air transport arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 September 1981, (Hansard, page 986) Senator Townley asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications. I refer again to the matter of Telecom Australia and the fact that many months ago the Auditor-General declared that there were more than 20 causes of error in telephone accounts. Some of these, of course, reduced the subscriber's costs but most increased the cost to the consumer. Is the Minister able to say whether most of those causes have yet been corrected? What is the state of play with Telecom giving subscribers an accurate account showing in particular the details of STD calls, including the date, length, and cost of the call, as is done in countries such as Canada and the United States?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom has advised that to place into perspective the criticisms made in the Auditor-General's report on Telecom's metering and charging procedures, it needs to be borne in mind that considerably less than 1 per cent of the 9.5 million metropolitan telephone bills issued annually are queried by customers and only a small proportion of these are found to require adjustment. Most adjustments made follow the disclosure of human errors in reading of meters or errors in computation. During 1980-81 the number of telephone bills issued increased by 4.6 per cent to 9.53 million while the number of accounts queried increased by only 0.4 per cent. Adjustments were made to 0.04 per cent of accounts issued and less than 20 per cent of the adjusted bills were due to technical faults or suspected equipment malfunctions.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom has advised however that it has been giving attention to the development of improved methods for supervising the performance of the metering system. Because of the extremely low incidence of metering faults in a very large and widespread network, there are no simple economic methods for quickly detecting the occasional fault the moment it occurs. Telecom has received tenders for a modern computer-based metering supervisory system which will improve supervision of the metering system and also allow improved handling of customer complaints.</PARA>
<PARA> Regarding the question of giving subscribers details of STD calls, the honourable senator will be aware no doubt that Telecom is progressively introducing a system known as Call Charge Recording (CCR) for international calls, which will enable subscribers to be given details of ISD calls made from their services. By June 1982 ISD/CCR will have been provided in 1.4 million services. Plans have also been announced for the provision of a CCR system for STD calls. This is a major undertaking and it is proposed that this service be offered on an optional basis. It is expected to be made available progressively from metropolitan exchanges commencing in 1984 and extended to some country areas from 1986.</PARA>

<PARA> In accordance with long standing practice, I neither confirm nor deny the allegations contained, or referred to, in the question.</PARA>
<PARA> However, I point out certain requirements of the law. Thus, the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 provides that, where a warrant has been issued under sections 11 or 21, the Australian Telecommunications Commission is authorised to inspect telegrams lodged by, or on behalf of, or addressed to, or intended to be received by, the person specified in the warrant. The Commission is further authorised to make and furnish copies of those telegrams to the Director-General of Security or the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police as the case may be. Officers of the Commission's Internal Investigation Unit, being officers duly approved for that purpose, undertake the action authorised to be taken by the Commission pursuant to such warrants. Except in accordance with this procedure, it would be unlawful for an officer of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization or the Australian Federal Police to intercept, or to seek from the Commission to have access to, a telegram or a copy of a telegram.</PARA>
<PARA> Interception of a telecommunications service, including the interception of a telex message, when authorised pursuant to a warrant issued under sections 9, 10 or 20 of the Act, is carried out by an officer of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization or a member of the Australian Federal Police duly authorised for that purpose pursuant to section 12 or 22 respectively of the Act. The warrant must relate to a specific service and any other form of interception by such an officer or member would be unlawful.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 17 November 1981 (Hansard, page 2193) Senator Jessop asked me a question without notice concerning the proposed petrochemical development at Stony Point in South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my reply I undertook to seek information in respect of that part of the question which referred to the leasing of Crown land in the Stony Point area. I now provide the following answer:</PARA>
<PARA> Information from the Department of Administrative Services indicates that the Commonwealth and the State of South Australia are negotiating on a land exchange proposal. The State will acquire some 2 490 ha of Commonwealth land adjoining its existing holdings at Stony Point. The land provided by the Commonwealth to the State will be used to provide an access corridor to the Stony Point facility. The State will provide a similar area of land to the Commonwealth in return.</PARA>
<PARA> Dow Chemical has decided to concentrate its studies of a proposed petrochemical plant in the Stony Point area rather than at Redcliff. The Asahi Chemical Industry Co Ltd, Mitsui and Toatsu Chemical Inc. have been considering involvement in a petrochemical plant in the region following the surrender of exclusive rights by Dow Chemicals in 1980.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 18 November 1981 (Hansard, page 2257) Senator Townley asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When will Telecom install the system which will detail on subscribers' accounts the details of subscriber trunk dialling calls so that subscribers who query their accounts can have some basis for their argument against the might of Telecom which, from my observations, still does not give subscribers the benefit of the doubt over disputed accounts.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Advances in technology have enabled Telecom to introduce at reasonable cost a Call Charge Record (CCR) system which will automatically record details of subscriber dialled international calls. It has, therefore, commenced a program to provide this system progressively at suitable exchanges and ultimately at all exchanges throughout Australia. With its introduction at an exchange, all subscribers served by that exchange gain access to ISD as a standard facility and on their subsequent telephone bills a separate total will appear for any ISD calls made. Telecom has indicated that by June 1982 the new ISD/CCR system will have been provided on about 1.4m services.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom has undertaken extensive studies of the technical work to provide STD/ CCR and through market surveys has also looked at the question of subscriber needs. A large proportion of subscribers make few, if any, STD calls and their requirement is for the cheapest practicable service. Some subscribers require a lock on their telephone as a security against unauthorised use and there are those who require a range of cost control services, such as call analysis equipment, individual meters and other timing devices. There are also those who would like a full record of their STD calls. Then again, there are subscribers who would prefer the existing multi-metering system as it preserves the anonymous nature of the telephone service.</PARA>
<PARA> Against this background, and as the provision of STD/CCR on a universal basis would involve very heavy capital and manpower investment in network modernisation Telecom proposes to offer it as an optional service. As an optional service STD/CCR will be available from most metropolitan exchanges in 1984.</PARA>
<PARA> Extension of the program to the balance of metropolitan exchanges and to the country will follow but, at this stage, it will be 1986 at least before a start can be made to provide the optional service to country customers.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that 15 East Timorese were arrested at Halim Airport in Jakarta on 4 November 1981, reportedly for attempting to leave Indonesia on forged Indonesian passports. All 15 held Australian entry visas stamped in Portuguese passports.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that a further 17 East Timorese, some of whom may have intended travelling to Australia, were arrested on 14 November also reportedly for carrying forged Indonesian passports.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, I did not make the statement attributed to me by the honourable senator.</PARA>
<PARA> I assume that the honourable senator was referring to part of an address given by me to the recent Annual General Meeting of the Voluntary Health Insurance Association of Australia in which I touched briefly upon the aspect of hospital only health insurance cover in the broader context of emerging trends since the 1 September 1981 changes to the health insurance arrangements. In voicing the concern of registered organizations about persons taking out hospital only cover and attending public hospital outpatient departments for medical treatment, I pointed out the potential effects on the public hospital system and the need for both Government and the health insurance industry to co- operate in closely monitoring the situation.</PARA>
<PARA> I also indicated my concern that the people promoting 'hospital only' insurance were not doing so to assist the public but were attempting to discredit the new initiatives taken by the Government and to confuse the public .</PARA>
<PARA> I have not in any way attempted to persuade people from taking hospital only insurance. However, in fairness to those who may have been disposed towards it, I have pointed out the shortcomings of such insurance, for example, delays that could result from pressure on public hospitals, lack of continuity of care by a private general practitioner who becomes familiar with a patient's medical history and a lack of the full range of medical (including specialist) services in some hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, to act responsibly in this matter, the Government must maintain a careful monitoring of the situation in the interests of maintaining an efficient health delivery and finance system.</PARA>
<PARA> It would require a strong imaginative effort to convert 'monitoring of trends' into a 'crackdown'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The provision of subscribers' line plant in rural areas provides that an applicant living up to a radial distance of 16 kilometres from an automatic exchange is provided with a service for the payment of the normal connection fee and rental. Prior to 1 January 1982 those living beyond the 16 kilometre radius had the option of contributing to the cost of the distance in excess of 16 kilometres at the rate of $160 per half kilometre or paying an annual rental of $500. The honourable senator would no doubt be aware that a new charging policy was introduced from 1 January which substantially reduces line charges for existing customers whose telephone services are being converted to automatic working and new customers seeking connection to either an automatic or manual telephone service.</PARA>
<PARA> Having regard to the foregoing, the answers are-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) On average, the capital investment involved in providing a line 16 kilometres radially from an exchange is $12,500.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) An applicant located 16 kilometres radially from an automatic exchange would not be called upon to make either a capital contribution or pay the special rental mentioned in the above explanatory note.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The special rental option of $500 was not increased in September 1981. The costs of installing and maintaining long lines will vary over time depending on the technology available. Hopefully the very long lines will become cheaper when digital radio concentrator systems are used. The extent of cross-subsidisation will therefore depend on the costs relevant to the long country services rather than the rental and conditions applicable to these services. Under the new charging policy, the special rental option will be terminated in 1986.</PARA>

<PARA> Adoption of the new statistical system for 1981-82 (see answer to part 2) does not allow direct comparison with previous years.

<PARA> Recurrent funds for the 1982-84 triennium were not allocated to the SCV Melbourne in the State Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1981 because no acceptable consolidation proposal in respect of the College had been received by the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission, as required by the Review of Commonwealth Functions. However, funds have been made available for the College in 1982 from the national unallocated grant on the understanding that consolidation will be actively pursued during the year. As an autonomous institution established under State legislation, SCV Melbourne is responsible for deciding the internal distribution of the funds provided to it. The extent of reductions in SCV Melbourne's teaching programs is also a matter for the College itself to determine in consultation with the Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> Melbourne State College is the only college of advanced education in metropolitan Melbourne which provides a course designed primarily to train teacher librarians for primary and secondary schools.

<PARA> The Minister for the Capital Territory has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Canberra's buses operate on a fare collection system designed to speed passenger loadings thus reducing delays and achieving a high level of productivity from drivers and vehicles. Passengers are encouraged to prepurchase rides off the bus. Passengers paying on the bus are required to place the exact fare in a farebox. Drivers carry a change float to provide change if required. A small but significant number of passengers are still seeking change on buses and this slows loading times to the inconvenience of all passengers.</PARA>
<PARA> To overcome this the Department suggested an exact fare system which included levying a charge for providing change. This was submitted to the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly for consideration and to encourage public comment. The Assembly supported the system proposed but opposed the imposition of the administrative charge. Subsequent public reaction has been against not only the levy but also the exact fare system itself.</PARA>
<PARA> Given my commitment to encourage the use of public transport I will not impose a system to which the community is so obviously opposed. Accordingly, I have given a direction to my Department not to proceed with the introduction of the system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 27 October 1981 (Hansard page 1625) Senator Hamer asked me, as Minister representing the Prime Minister, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer to his statement on the conditional decision to commit our Defence Force to the Sinai peacekeeping operation. Does the Government attach equal importance to the two arms of the Camp David Accords-the Israeli withdrawal from Egyptian territory in the Sinai and the solving of the problem of Palestinian autonomy? Has the failure to achieve a just and honourable solution to the Palestinian problem been the cause of great damage to the strategic position of the Western world in the key Middle Eastern area? In the autonomy talks to be held between now and next January between Israel and Egypt will a marked change of attitude on the part of both sides be necessary if any significant progress is to be made? When the Minister said that our involvement in the Sinai peacekeeping force was on the 'understanding that all the parties to the Camp David Accords press forward with a continuing peace process in the Middle East', does this mean that our force will not be committed to the Middle East unless there is some substantial progress towards a solution which is just and honourable to both sides of the Palestinian problem?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following additional comments to the answer I gave to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that it is important both that the Israelis withdraw from the Sinai and that there be a resolution of the Palestinian issue. A solution to the Palestinian issue is central to the future stability and peace of the Middle East. At the same time Israeli withdrawal from the final third of the Sinai is essential if progress is to be achieved on the wider Palestinian issue since failure of the Israelis to withdraw from the final third of the Sinai would seriously weaken the resolve of most of the countries of the region to settle the Middle East dispute by negotiation.</PARA>
<PARA> In his statement to Parliament on 22 October on Australian participation in the Sinai peacekeeping force, the Prime Minister stated 'the continued progress towards peace in the Middle East is of enormous significance to Australia. An outbreak of conflict would have repercussions not only for the region but also for the peace of the world which would affect us profoundly and in manifold ways. It would affect our allies and friends in ways which could not but impinge greatly on our international relationships with risks for the strategic balance of great moment to our national security. Australia's interest is in seeing what is probably the single most serious threat to world peace removed.'</PARA>
<PARA> With reference to your question about the autonomy negotiations concerned with the future status of the Israeli occupied West Bank and Gaza, I regret to say that there has still been little progress. There are many reasons for this. The Camp David Agreement does not make clear what was intended on the concept of autonomy, and this has not made it any easier to reach agreement. In addition, of course, there has been no agreement on the long term future of the Palestinians after the transitional autonomy stage of five years envisaged under Camp David.</PARA>
<PARA> Regarding your query about the terms of our commitment to the Sinai force, the Prime Minister said in his statement to Parliament on 22 October that 'our participation in the peacekeeping force would be on the understanding that all the parties to the Accords abided by word and deed with their provisions, and press forward with a continuing peace process in the Middle East'. Australia will be looking to the United States to exert and sustain the strongest pressure to ensure effective progress in implementing the Camp David Accords as they relate not only to the Sinai but also to Palestinian autonomy. Australia's participation in the Sinai Peacekeeping Force is not however formally linked to any particular steps in this regard.</PARA>

<PARA> I have a question for the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. It is about the prominent labelling of packages as 'Made in Australia', when what is not infrequently meant is that the package is made in Australia but the product is imported.

I am aware of a case in which a fully imported citizens band transceiver was given a very minor modification in Australia and prominently labelled 'Australian Made'. On examination it was found that 99 per cent of the product in fact had been made in South Korea. I ask: What are the limitations, if any, on the use of the label 'Made in Australia'? Is the Government considering any action to tighten the limitations on the use of the label or any other action which might otherwise protect both Australian producers of products actually made in Australia and consumers in Australia from this practice?</PARA>

<PARA> The Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act and the Commerce (Imports) Regulations made thereunder, and the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations made under the Customs Act prescribe certain marking to be applied to imported goods. Where imported goods bear markings in a language other than that of the country of origin, a statement of the country of origin must be attached. In addition, certain specific types of imported goods such as food and drink, textile products and shoes are required to bear a trade description which includes a statement of the country of origin.</PARA>
<PARA> Although there is no general requirement that imported goods supplied in the Australian market carry a country of origin marking, the Commonwealth Trade Practices Act 1974 prohibits misleading of deceptive conduct, including conduct related to country of origin markings, by corporations and certain individuals in trade or commerce. The Act allows the Federal Court to grant to any person injunctions to restrain such conduct, and on prosecution to impose fines of up to $50,000 on corporations and up to $10,000 on individuals who contravene its provisions.</PARA>
<PARA> The Trade Practices Commission has addressed this question of country of origin in its booklet 'Advertising and Selling: A business guide to consumer protection under the Trade Practices Act'.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission has indicated that special care is necessary where the country of origin is made a feature of advertising or product description. It states that where goods are composed of parts or material originating in more than one country, or where goods are manufactured or assembled in one country from parts or material originating from another, any description of the origin should not be such as to mislead consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> If the honourable senator passes on details of the case he cites, or any other similar cases of which he may be aware, to the Trade Practices Commission, the Commission will look into the matter and take whatever action is appropriate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 14 October 1981 (Hansard, page 1160) Senator Coleman asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Minister representing the Minister for Communications aware of complaints that the maintenance sections of Telecom Australia have not received substantial supplies for some two months? Is he also aware that new services are not available in some States because new phones have to be dismantled for spare parts to maintain existing services? Will the Minister advise the Senate whether this deliberate choking off is a means of establishing that Telecom is inefficient, thus conditioning people for the sale of that authority to private enterprise?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom did experience shortages of some items of maintenance equipment in the latter part of 1981. This was due primarily to industrial disputes affecting the manufacture and delivery of material. The industrial problems have since been resolved and deliveries of maintenance materials are proceeding. Some critical items of equipment were in short supply due to unprecedented demand. This equipment has been identified and a special allocation of funds has been provided to urgently improve the stock position.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not the policy of Telecom to dismantle new telephones to maintain existing services at the expense of new services. If this practice has occurred it would certainly have been in isolation and does not reflect the normal maintenance procedures currently operating within Telecom.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1a) and (2) Telecom believes that the best interests of suppliers and of itself as a purchaser are met by conforming with Government standards of purchasing, in particular that its needs are subject to public tenders and that all who seek to do business with Telecom shall have an equal opportunity to do so. As a consequence, Telecom does not control the number of companies established in Australia who are capable of manufacturing telecommunications equipment and supplies.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom seeks only to buy from more than one source where manufacturing capacity limitations require it, where better security of supply is required or where there is a need to ensure future competition.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been some rationalisation. In recent years the number of suppliers has reduced in some areas. For example, new generation ARE exchange equipment is being provided by two suppliers whereas existing crossbar is supplied by three. Channel modem suppliers have reduced from four to three.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom has strengthened its commercial organisation and included a broad marketing base in the Commercial Services Department. Stronger market input into tender evaluations has resulted.</PARA>
<PARA> New equipment and services have been developed in line with the new technology available, with the scope and type of services provided being firmly based on market indicators. Forecasting models are used as an input to tender evaluation. For example, market factors were taken into account in Telecom's recent decision to purchase the 'Commander' small business system range.</PARA>
<PARA> (1b) and (2) Improvement in labour productivity by changes in policies relating to work force deployment and the prewiring of new homes is receiving attention by Telecom management.</PARA>
<PARA> The area most likely to benefit from work force redeployment is exchange maintenance which is the subject of ongoing industrial negotiations between Telecom and the relevant staff association under the auspices of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> National policy on prewiring of new homes is under review.</PARA>
<PARA> Where appropriate, initiatives are taken to improve the total mix of stock so that stocks of those items which are most commonly in short supply are increased as necessary. This is an ongoing exercise since the pattern of supply problems continuously changes. Where short term shortages occur, an allocation of additional funds is made to improve the supply of items in urgent demand. Material supply co-ordination is kept under close and regular review with the responsibility for control of critical items of stock decentralized wherever possible.</PARA>
<PARA> (1c) and (2) The strengthening of the commercial and marketing activities of Telecom mentioned above will result in improved management of overheads in relation to services and products.</PARA>
<PARA> In other areas overhead and administrative costs are kept under regular review and adjustments made to effect productivity improvements.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The effect of any changes to policy procedures or practices associated with the recommendations of the McKinsey Report would be of a long term nature and the financial impact cannot be accurately quantified in the short term.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Since its inception Telecom has aimed at providing a universal standard telecommunications service throughout Australia embracing continuous automatic service, subscriber trunk dialling and international subscriber dialling. The former Australian Post Office had similar objectives also. This objective is in harmony with the requirements of the Telecommunications Act which requires the Commission to have special regard to people residing or carrying on business outside the cities.</PARA>
<PARA> Inevitably with such an objective, given the thin population spread and large size of the country, there will be a substantial cross-subsidisation from profitable areas of the network to cover the high costs involved in providing modern communications to the rural and remote areas of Australia.</PARA>
